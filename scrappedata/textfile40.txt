Gene was waking up slowly to hear these unpleasant sounds and when he did it completely, he knew that those arcades were his beloved Jailbreak. With 3 months of pregnancy. He looked worriedly at the half-open door of the bathroom and slowly got up from his bed to approach. He went slowly to the bathroom and opened the door, and saw Jailbreak throwing up hard. Gene worried and raise her carefully,she was weak \"Jail love,are you okay?\" asked the worried boy. \"Yes...im fine...\" Replied the hacker,hurt and tired while cleaning her mouth \"Erhg ... I do not understand why the baby makes me eat more to feed him and then make me vomit...\" Gene chuckled as he stroked her princess hair. \"Dont worry,thats normal...but it will happen to you several times during this following months\" Gene kissed her cheek \"but calm down Jail,I will be here to take care of both...\" Jail gave a small giggle followed by a warm smile. \"Thanks,Gene...I dont know what I would do if you were not by my side\" she said with almost whisper. Gene dragged her in Bridal style and took her to the soft and cushioned bed to rest, He left her delicately between the sheets and he settled down next to her, grabbed her and left her resting on her bed while still stroking her hair. \"I cant wait for our baby to be born,I want to give her all the love and care she deserves\" Gene said happily in a whisper and then spread a kiss on his lover's forehead. However,Gene managed to notice concern between the tired look of his beloved Hacker \"Linda?,Honey what happens?\" He call her by her real name,thing that Jailbreak adored,he was the only one who could do that \"Gene ...\" she sighed \"your parents already know that...Im pregnant, right?\" \"Yes,they already know\" he said with a bit of calm \"Wait,what!?...But...how do they know?\" said the princess with more concern. \"When you said it in front of everyone that day...do not you remember?\" said the blond looking at her. \"Oh, yes...\" She sighed worriedly \"Gene ... I need you to be totally sincere\" \"Well,of course, My love...tell me what it is?\" Gene gave her a tender smile to make her understand that shee could trust him. Jailbreak had great affection and confidence in her beloved, but this kind of thing really worried her. She sighed deeply, breathed and looked at him in the eyes \"what do your parents think about this?,betotally honest\" \"Well...\" Gene Rolled her eyes \"they did not take it so bad,i talk with them about that,they are proud to be grandparents, they support us so do not worry,my princess\" he said with all his sincerity and confidence towards her. Jail did not say anything,she just settled into his chest tenderly. \"Im glad to hear that ...\" she said followed by a sigh \"but there is still something that worries me\" she looked down and with one hand began to caress Gene's chest. \"and what is that,Jail?\" Gene asked,still worried. She was silent for a moment,resenting the caresses of her boyfriend. \"Gene\" she looked up \"I have to tell my Mom and sisters\" The blonde tensed a bit,he had forgotten that Jailbreak's mother and his sisters did not know anything about this. He did not know how to tell the queen that he was going to be a father with one of his daughters: Princess Linda. Jail could feel the tension of her beloved,she also did not know how to face her mother and tell her that she's pregnant. \"Don't worry Linda\" he said at last while stroking his brown hair \"Ow Gene...I escaped and left her like for 3 years. How do you think that after a long time I arrive and tell you that there is a baby growing inside of my belly?\" \"Hey,everything will be fine...I'll be there for you...\" Gene said looking at her,transmitting her some peace. \"no Gene...I must go alone...\" Jailbreak looked down He was surprised by what the hacker princess said \"No,I will not leave you alone in this, I also-\" Gene was interrupted by the hacker \"No,Gene!,I must go alone,I must face this!\" \"I promised you,ill never leave you alone again! \"Gene took her from the face and look into her eyes \"I lost you by Smiler's hands once!,I swear never to leave you again\" Jailbreak was stunned to hear that memory \"I did not make that promise for nothing,I did it because I love you,I love you with my life and I'm going to fulfill what I promised\" Finished the blonde emoji with a sincere smile. She still did not say anything,he was right...he promised that and she knew that he would not break his promise. Tears came from the golden eyes of the princess \"Im sorry...\" Jailbreak wiped her eyes \"I'm just afraid of the reaction of my mom and sisters... and if they do not take it well?...\" \"I'll be there to take care of you...no one will put a finger on you...I promise...\" And with that said,they joined their lips and formed a kiss \"Now you rest... tomorrow we have to get up early to see your mother...\" Gene came back to lie her on his chest \"All right\" Jail said calmly and followed by a small sigh of relaxation \"Good night Linda\" said the blonde emoji,giving her a small kiss on the forehead and hugging her \"...Good night...my prince\" she finished remembering in his chest and sleeping The next morning. The multi-expresive emoji woke up first Gene did not avoid dying of tenderness to see how her beloved was still asleep,the princess got up and they gave each other a loving morning kiss, they wentto the kitchen to start the day. They went to eat their breakfast,got dress and then they went to Jailbreak's house. She was already more than nervous, thinking well the words she would say to her mother when she arrived. Gene noticed that nervousness in her,approached closely,giving her a small kiss on the cheek . \"Don't worry\" he said looking at her with a smile \"everything will be fine, I promise...\" He took her by the hand and implanted a kiss on her. Jail calmed down,gave him a warm smile and gave her a short kiss on her lips. \"Thanks...\" she finished saying The road was quiet and very long. Gene looked up to that big house with 4 rooms in total and 6 windows and a architecture of white and gray colors. Jailbreak sighed and adjusted her crown quickly and sighed heavily. \"Well,there I go\" She whispered looking at her boyfriend. Her steps were very dragged and her hands were intertwined as if she was praying,she stood in front of the door and closed her eyes hard. Her trembling hand reached for the door and knocked twice. In a few seconds the door was opened by a security guard they had in the mansion. \"Oh! Princess Linda,how nice to have you here,come in!\" After saying this,the guard stepped aside so that the princess could pass She was still nervous,so much so that she was a little paralyzed. Gene tried to follow her,but the guard stood in front of him. \"Beg your pardon,but who are you?\" The guard said coldly \"Emm...i...\" He looked very small next to that guard,not knowing what to say. \"He is Gene,the hero who saved Idiis from Smiler\" interrupted Jailbreak with a nervous smile The guard was doubting what the princess was saying. \"Oh,Miss Queen Charlotte is very grateful for what you did for us. Go see and talk to her\" And with that said, the guard also gave him a pass. Gene crossed quickly and went with his girlfriend,who he took by the hand. \"You couldn't just told him that I'm your boyfriend?\" \"he will tell my mom that I am here and who I am with\" the hacker finished saying. \"Oohh I understand\" he said understanding what she meant \"Well...it's around here\" Said the Hacker indicated to Gene. The girl entered that room and even being away,she managed heard the screams and whining of her sisters in the room,painting her nails,combing thweyre hair,making up they're face and other things that Jail could not care about. Among those girls,she saw an emoji with long, wave-like brown hair,wearing a light blue Dress, very happily reading a book,ignoring her daughters and the disaster they were doing. \"Mother?\" The blonde Princess spoke. \"Yes Karen?\" she spoke \"Who is that?\" pointed out the blonde. The queen looked at where Karen was pointing,she was surprised to see who it was. \"Linda...?\" Queen Charlotte said surprised \"Mom...\" Jailbreak spoke fearfully looking at her. \"Sister!\" all the princesses:Mia(the brunette),lizzet(the pale skin and blonde one),and Karen(the dark blonde one) shouted at the same time They all approached her slowly, ready to hug her,but stopped when they saw her. Seeing herbody...her belly. Jail barely had 3 months of carrying her baby inside,but it was not very noticeable that she was pregnant,actually. It looked like she was overweight. \"eww\" all of them moved away. Jail was so confused by the action of her sisters \"What happens?\" Asked the princess still confused \"Sister that happened to you!?\" Karen said surprised \"You're a little...fat\" Mia said looking at her sister's belly. \"what?!\" Jailbreak said upset \"I'm not fat!\" \"sister?what happened to you?!\" Mia said again touching her belly with one of her makeup fingers \"Why are you so fat?\" Lizeth said \"A princess must have a good body,I see why you left us!\" Mia left her behind \"ew!\" Lizzet arched \"What Do you even eat?!\" Karen said annoyed. \"I'm sure she eats junk food\" pointed out Lizzet \"You dont have a nice body like before!\" Karen said disappointed \"no prince will notice you!\" Mia said crossing her arms. Jailbreak was tormented by the words her sisters said,while with his hand she pressed her belly tightly. \"Enough!\" Charlotte shouted, silencing everyone. She looked closely at her daughter Linda, she also looked her fat. \"Linda..what happened to you?\" She asked looking at her body. \"Mom...I can explain that\" Jailbreak said uncomfortable for all the looks of her sisters. \"Dont listen to her mother,she has just been eating junk food and that's why she's so ugly!\" Mia replied disgusted. \"Hey!\" Gene replied annoyed \"And who are you to shout at me?!\" Mia shouted angrily at the blonde. \"Dont you dare to shout at him!\" Jailbreak said angry. \"We have the right to do it\" Karen said this time \"we are royalty\" \"STOP FIGHTING!,I DONT WANT TO BE INTERRUPTED AGAIN!\" This time the queen shouted All were silent because of Charlotte's anger and that silence was broken by Herself \"Linda answer,what happened to you?\" She Said serious. Jailbreak went into panic again,sweat ran down her forehead and she saw all hier sisters again and then Gene. She had to tell his mother and sisters...She had no choice, although they reject her without mercy \"Mom,Karen,Mia,Lizzet...there is something,that I must tell you...\" They were all silent,waiting for Linda's response \"Emm...I...I-I...Im...\" began to sigh very agitated. The princesses began to worry a little about the nervousness of her sister and the murmurs between them were heard. \"Im...Im...\" she was so nervous. \"Just say it...\" Charlotte was losing patience \"...Im...IM PREGNANT!\" ... Once Charlotte was as pale as snow and her pupils dilated to the maximum. Jailbreak bit her lower lip with fear and nerves,while Gene hugged her around the waist as the only consolation \"What?...\" the Queen said scared. \"What you heard Mom...\" The hacker spoke with a thin voice \"... Im...pregnant\" Queen Charlotte could not believe it,her daughter:Princess Linda,the one that finally returned to her...was pregnant \"N-no...it cant...be possible\" the frightened queen spoke \"W-What do you mean \"pregnant\"?...\" Lizzet said surprised \"I cant believe it...\" Karen said \"Yes\" Jailbreak look at them \"And I dont care what happens I already decided what to do with it...\" The princess caressed her belly carefully \"im going to have it,no matter what it costs me..i do nt care what happens\" the hacker spoke tenderly as she saw Gene, who just smiled at him with sweetness. \"Linda...My God!,How dare you?!\" Karen pushed her hard and very angry \"You do not even have a prince!\" \"Thats right!\" said Mia with fury \"Dont you dare push her\" said Gene already annoyed \"LINDA,I CANT BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING!\" The queen was more than angry \"WHAT WILL YOUR FATHER SAY?!,SINCE WHEN YOU ARE PREGNANT!?\" \"since 3 months ago\" Gene said holding his princess in a protective way \"And she is not alone...she has me...The princess hair hacker felt safe next to Gene at her side,both held hands and looked fearlessly at the Emoji woman and the princesses \"and ll take care of my baby,just like her\" Gene said with tenderness and pride. \"Wait...\" Lizzet analyzed his words. \"YOU'RE THE FATHER?!\" the sisters shouted in unison \"Yes...ill take care of Linda and MY baby\" with more pride he keep looking at the princesses and the queen. She was still angry,her daughter broke a royak rule and could not forgive her \"ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?!HE IS NOT EVEN A PRINCE!,HE IS ONLY AN AVERAGE EMOJI!,HOE YOU COULD DO SUCH A THING!?\" Charlotte scolded daughter Linda. \"He is not any emoji!,he saved us all from being deleted and that you know it!\" Jailbreak was already getting unstable. \"That is not an excuse,he's a hero but not a prince!\" Mia pointed \"And youre not even married!\" Karen said to her in a threatening way while pointing \"that thing in your belly is a bastard!\" Gene,already furious,approached Princess Karen and gave a withering look of anger and disappointment. \"Don't talk about my baby like that\" answered the emoji multi-expressive very agresivly \"we will get married in 3 months!\" Jailbreak claim trying not to cry because of the stress. \"And what!?\" Lizzet said \"It does not take away the fact that he is not a prince!\" \"I do not care that he is not a prince I love him!\" After she said that,the princesses were surprised and silent \"I love him just how he is and none of you or in the world can stop the love I feel for him...\" The hacker looked at her beloved tenderly and took her by the hand \"And we are going to have this baby with or without your approval\" the blonde finished looking at his beloved with tenderness. \"No. Your. Not...\" Karen whispered threateningly. She slowly approached her sister Linda and without thinking twice,she punched Jailbreak in herstomach. \"Karen!\" Both her mother and sisters scolded her. Jailbreak fell to her knees with her hands on her belly, moaning in pain. It was the last straw. \"HOW DARE YOU!?\" Gene said with all the fury he had. \"ARE YOU CRAZY!?\" The two princesses held Karen's arms \"Karen,how could you ?!\" whispered Lizzet \"Don't do such a thing again\" mia said also in the same way \"What?!,Now you two are goin to play innocent?!\" Karen replied furiously \"that baby is just a mistake!,I will not accept him as my nephew!\" \"Shut up!\" Gene shouted in front of her with a fury unknown in him,it was so much the adrenaline witch he said that. Gene already a little calm,turned to see his beloved on the floor. \"Its ok Jails...Im here...\" But when approaching,it was only heard as she slowly sobbed. \"No Gene...I...\" she got up and ran to her sister's room and locked the door. Gene could not follow her,she went too fast \"Did You saw what you just did!?\" Gene turned to see the princess causing all this \"with your damn character and hurtfull words!...\" \"You little...\"Karen said angrw \"ITS OVER!\" Everyone saw the queen,with a serious face mixed with anger \"you three. to the Garden,NOW!\" The princesses went slowly to the garden,until Charlotte spoke \"Oh and Karen\" \"Huh?\" The blonde princes looked back to see what her mother was going to say. \"You're grounded\" With that, Karen stared at her surprised mother \"But...\" \"Just leave\" finished the queen. Gene looked at his mother-in-law with hatred and she looked at her seriously. \"What are you going to do now?,Are you going to throw me out, just because your daughter gave me the best gift in the world?\" Gene said disappointed \"best gift?\" she asked confused \"Yes...a son...you do not know what I and Jailbreak have gone through trying to form a future family...and look at what you and your daughters have done... you've hurt Jailbreak...\" Charlotte was still with her look of seriousness \"I always imagined my daughter next to someone...but with a PRINCE,a real prince and not you,a common Emoji\" These words only made the multi-expressive more angry. \"I may not be a prince for you... but for Jailbreak I am...ill make it clear...I just do what I should\" He stood in front of her \"Protect her,love her and accept her just the way she is...not like you...\" \"And how do you think to protect my daughter being what you are?\" She said a little calmed. \"With all the love I will give her and my baby\" he answered firmly \"I would give my life to make her happy\" The queen without words just looked at him as he was going to where Jailbreak was,gave a tired sigh \"Wait!\" The Queen stopped him with a scream. Gene stopped and stayed where he was and turned his head to see her coldly. \"...please...forgive me Gene...its just that...\" she sighed very frustrated \"i dont understand anything...all my life I taught Linda what to do and what to say...\" \"Well im sorry,but Jailbreak is not like that... she's just her and for nothing in the world her i want her to Change...I almost lose her once,I do not want to do it again...\" Gene denied her look and embrace himself \"...I can not imagine what would happened if...\" He remembered what Smiler had done to her,that horrible day that had invaded his mind forever,which would not leave him, that tormented him at night \"... I would've lost her...\" finished the blonde \"...\" Charlotte could understand everything, right now she felt regret,she felt the pain felt by the multi-expressive emoji With nothing left to say,Gene took his steps to the room where Jail was. Gene followed his path and stood in front of the door,took a breath and slowly opened it. There in the bed of Princess Mia, hugging a very fluffly and soft pillow was Jailbreak,Crying and Sobbing. She looked so hurt...so shattered...so Fragile. Gene sighed hurt and looked at her sadly in his eyes. Very slowly he approached her and stopped to see some old photos that were in the nigth of Princess Karen. In the past years when Jailbreak was known as Princess Linda and was forced to do the things she hated so much. Gene took that photo and admired the beauty of his girlfriend in that photo. \"I know...\" he hear a fragile voice, impregnated with pain \"look pathetic...\" Gene turned to see and looked at Jailbreak look up,still hugging that pillow. \"Dont say that...youre beautiful\" Gene left the photo and sat on the edge of the bed, placing his hand on the little belly of the pregnant hacker \"and I know that our baby will be to...\" \"W-why?...\" she sobbed. \"What thing my love?\" Gene whispered caressing her princess hair. None paid attention,but Charlotte was already spying on them,very intrigued and amazed by the love they both showed. Gene was still waiting for the response from his girlfriend, very worried. \"...why...did this have to happen?\" he asked with some small tears in his eyes The queen was still there listening,she felt shattered and guilty \"I dont know Linda. I thought your sisters and mom were better than this...\" Gene whispered hurt and serene \"But dont worry...in reality they are the ones who are wrong and you do not have to feel that way. You are the best princess and emoji that I have loved and given me the best you could have given...\" The blonde very slowly put a hand on her belly again \"a fruit of our love...something that shows that our love will never die...\" His smile was very small, but sincere. Jailbreak was surprised and spoiled by the love Gene was giving her over that area where her baby grew up. She adored those caresses. \"Gene..what does this mean for you?...\" Jailbreak sais in such a sweet way that it melted Gene. \"This little one means our love, the great love that we both have and the best of the world that you could give me\" Gene said with all the sincerity of the planet. Those words were enough for Charlotte to realize the great mistake she made,She could feel that love that they had both,The only thing that came out of the queen were tears, tears of total regret and pain \"...and...\" Gene stopped and the memories passed through his mind \"know that...that I almost lost both both of you...terrifies me,it was something so...so horrible to see you ,to be hurt in such a way, if you had not revived...if you were not here with me...\" Gene could barely said something more...That moment where that blonde psychopath stabbing and electrifying his beloved returned to his mind. \"...i would be dead\" Jailbreak end up with some tears in her eyes, sliding down her cheeks \"...Gene...\" she looked up crossing the green eyes of her boyfriend,With his thumb she wiped the blond's tears with care and affection \"Forgive me...please forgive me,I should have protected both of you...\" Gene whispered,hiding his face in the shoulder of the hacker \"But I just stood there like an idiot...\" \"No Gene...this is not your fault...\" Jailbreak responded maternally,stroking her blonde hair \"but forgive me for making you suffer...\" \"No...I had to fight for you...\" he hugged her harder \"Forgive me for being an idiot...\" \"You were not an idiot,I was the weak one,its my fault...\" now she was crying. \"No, of course not\" The blond took her by the shoulders, looking into her eyes \"my fault,I could not protect you or the baby and Im not going to let anything bad happen to you again\" \"and I will not hurt you again...\" And with both crying, they embraced and caressed each other's hair. Charlotte, already confused by this conversation,entered the room and watched carefully how they were giving each other comfort and after a few seconds,the queen broke the silence with a question. \"you died?...\" The two gave a jump of fright they had. \"M-mom...I...\" Jail did not know what to say,she did not know how to tell her mother that a crazy Emoji knifed her in the belly and that she magically revived \"...answer!,how is that,that you died!?\" said the queen already desperate. \"Mom...\" Jailbreak was more afraid than he already was,her hands began to play and her breathing stirred. \"responde already!\" Charlotte responded with more euphoria. Princess Swallow nervous,until she felt a hand touch her shoulder. \"Its ok\" Gene said with Valentia and confidence to his partner \" Here I am for you...\" The hacker showed a nice smile to her beloved and took her hand to gain more confidence. She saw his worried mother again and took a large amount of air. \"Mom...short time ago...Gene took me to work because he had a surprise for me and for the other emojis of Textopolis and...for the Baby,he had prepared a dance of couples and we were going to be the first\" explained Jailbreak \"but when I,Hi-5 and Gene entered,The door of the building was closed and everybody were left out...and there we met the old leader of the scanner and all Textopolis...\" \"Smiler?!\" The concern was present in Charlotte,she continued to watch and listen attentively to his daughter to continue. \"Y-yes...her...\" in a few seconds she picked her look up again to keep talking \"she had an electric knife in her hands, she started to approach me saying a couple of words and...\" she paused to think a little about what she will say. \"And...and...\" A knot formed in the throat of the princess. It was very difficult to say that part,After having swallowed several times. She opened his mouth to continue counting,but in that moment...Gene went ahead and the next thing he said in an extremely terrified voice. \"She stabbed her in hte Belly\" He said blond with a look down. The queen could not believe it,she was waiting for all this to be a joke in bad taste...But it was not like that \"...w-what?...\" the queen spoke, more terrified than before. \"What you heard mom...\" Jailbreak replied \"...she slowly went off and dying slowly...\" Gene hugged himself \"...at least I could tell her that I love her...before...\" The queen swallowed before asking the last question \"before... what?...\" \"She died in my arms...\" She opened her eyes wide,felt a strong lump in her throat \"...t-that's impossible\" she said desperately \"How could that happen...why?!\" A silence fell in the room,only Charlotte's agitated breathing was heard \"but then...how are you still alive?...\" \"Gene's malfunctioning tears...theh reprogrammed and brought me back to life...\" Explained the hacker. The queen looked at them both more terrified,could not calm down and her breathing is agitated \"but...\" she still had another question to ask \"And...where is Smiler?...\" \"I was about to kill her during my range...but I forgave her life... I never saw her agai ...\" Gene responded with contempt when they mentioned that smiling emoji. \"You let her live?\"Jailbreak answered in shock.\"Why?...\" Gene remembered what Smiler had told him \"JAILBREAK I HAD NOT WANTED YOU TO DO SOMETHING BAD AND LESS BECAUSE OF HER!\" And thats what he said... Both Jailbreak and Charlotte were stunned Gene was still staring,He did not want to remember what happened that day. \"HOW COULD THIS HAPPENED?!\" Charlotte yelled. \"I know...I should have killed her when I had the chance...\" Gene sighed regretfully \"but I did not want to become a bad person because of Jail...I promised to protect her... not to hurt others...\" Jailbreak looked at him with tender eyes and took his face to caress his cheeks with both thumbs. \"Gene...\" said the hacker with a soft tone in her voice \"...I understand...\" the calm voice of the queen was heard,The two Emojis looked at Charlotte in surprise \"Linda...I...\" Shewas interrupted by the brunette princess. \"What?!\" Mia entered with her two other sisters. \"she id still inside?!\" \"Sisters...please\" Jailbreak said with a Voice Thread. \"Look,we do not want to continue listening to your excuses,you understand?!\" Lizzet replied furiously \"You got pregnant before you married and your boyfriend is not a prince!,You disappointed us,you understand?!,all of us!\" \"Im never going to accept that fetus inside you as my Nephew...I hope you have the opportunity to abort!\" Karen replied coldly Jailbreak could no longer contain the tears,ahe wanted to fall into tears. \"ENOUGH\" Charlotte said with fury \"But mom!\" Karen was interrupted. \"Do you not understand or the three of you are deaf\" said the queen angrily \"I said...THATS ENOUGH!\" \"I only say the truth,it would be a good idea to abort...\" Karen spoke reluctantly. \"You shut up!\" shouted a louder voice than Charlotte's. It was Gene's \"You...have no idea what Jail did...and everything she suffered...\" \"Of course...she had an unwanted pregnancy...\"lizzet answer disappointed. \"...no...she gave me the best...better than any of you could give me...\" \"Ja! Who would want to give something to you? You are just an ordinary Emoji\" \"SHUT IT!\" this time the Hacker spoke \"you dont know what I had to do to get here!,You dont have a little consideration and much less heart!, You only despise everything you have around you!\" Gene was amazed by what Jailbreak was saying \"Gene has been the best thing that happened to me in my life,since we are together. He has given me everything I need: love, support, understanding and accept me as I am...not like you...the only thing you did was to reject me with all your heart...and unlike what you they think...\" she take a pause to caress her belly with a loving look. \"Im ready for everything for this baby, a sample of how strong my love is with him\" \"many cowards would escape only because their girlfriends are pregnant...but I will not abandon her for anything in the world...it is my goal in life,take care of them and love it as nothing in this world...\" All in the room were totally amazed, none of them moved or said anything, they just stood there. The couple held hands and looked at each other tenderly and then looked at the princesses \"Okay...\" the voice of the queen was heard. \"What!?\"the three princesses looked at their mother. \"I will support her in this\" finished saying Charlotte \"But mom!\" Karen spoke arrogantly \"Daughter,forgive my ignorance and stupidity...\" Charlotte said \"I thought that this was a horrible surprise and that your boyfriend was a big mistake...but you,Gene Meh, you have made my daughter the happiest princess in the world\" \"Its very little what I've done for her, your majesty\" Gene spoke with some shyness \"She deserves more than what I can give her and this little one too...\" The queen gave a small laugh \"you are what my daughter needs...her happiness\"she said to later give a smile to the blonde \"Thanks...\" said Gene still shy \"And as for the three of you\"the queen turned to see her daughters \"im very disappointed...\" The three of them just stared at their mother \"Sister...i...\"Karen spoke with sorrow in her voice. \"Please forgive us\" Mia passed her right arm by her left arm \"beening so selfish...\" \"To wish you abortion...\" Lizzet commented scratching her head with embarrassment. \"yes...\" Karen did not show it in her eyes. But her destroyed voice,made her notice that she wanted to cry to seas. \"Please...dont pay attention to us, dont abort...\" Jail looked at them with some pity,she knew that they regret a lot,she approached them three looking at them from the front \"I forgive you...\" she said in a soft voice \"ow...\" Karen blinked quickly letting go a couple of tears \"hug me you silly Tomboy little girl!\" And with that said, Karen threw herself at Jail giving her a hug followed by the two remaining princesses \"Wow girls!,we are goin to fall!\" warned the hacker. Her sisters were hugging her strongly and with affection. \"Girls slower!,remember she's pregnant!\" said their mother. \"Dont hurt my baby!\" Jailbreak said something hurt. \"OK!,Enough!\" Gene covered Jailbreak with his arms in a protective way \"not going to hurt my beloved and my son...\" \"ow Gene...\" Jailbreak replied laughing while clinging to him in his embrace \"What a protector are you...\" \"Awww\" said the princesses \"Sorry...\" Gene blushed alot. \"Jeje dont worry\" the hacker was still clinging to the arms of her boyfriend and he deposit a small kiss on the cheek of his girlfriend \"Im very proud of you Linda\" said the queen with a smile \"and you Gene...thanks\" \"Welcome Your Majesty...\" That afternoon,Gene and Jailbreak were still in the house of the princesses. Her mother had invited them to dinner,which Jailbreak did not refuse to accept. If the food they did to his sisters was already exquisite,her baby asked that she also gave him food. Right now it was the third time she had emptied her plate \"God, it seems that someone has not eaten since a thousand years ago\" Mia laughed while chewing her sushi. \"she looks adorable in my opinion...\" Gene looked at her with tenderness. \"Mmm!,These nachos are delicious!\" Jailbreak declared with her mouth stained with Cheese. Gene did nothing but clean her cheeks with a napkin and kiss her lips,cleaning the little cheese that was in them. \"Thanks Honeh\" she gave a kiss on the cheek to his beloved \"Do you want us to give you the fourth dish sister?:asked Mia, knowing perfectly what would be the answer. \"Of course!\" said the excited hacker. The queen laughed in silence for the behavior of her daughter,but seeing the scene seemed very tender \"wait...\" Gene told her,then get up from the table and face Jailbreak \"before we continue: Jailbreak, my love...there's something I want to tell you...\" \"What thing?\" The hacker looked at him with intrigue \"I know we already planned it,but I still have to give you what you deserve...\" Gene slowly got down on his knees before his partner and gently took her hand. \"Princess Linda. Long ago,you and I began a new life,full of love and sincerity. Our connection is stronger and I never want to break it\" With his other hand,he caressed her belly and she just saw these caresses and then he saw him again with the crystalline eyes \"This baby that you gave me...Ill take care of it,I do not care how much I have to do...Ill give up my life for you...I promised to be by your side forever and with this Ill prove it\" Gene took out a small black box and put it in front of her. \"Princess Linda...\" Gene gave a little pause to follow his speech \"Would you marry me?\" She was amazed,with tears of happiness in her eyes she could not believe what was happening, her happiness was more enormous than before . \"...Yes!,I want to marry you Gene Meh!\" She said with great joy in her and tears of happiness And for the joy of the moment,Jail jumped over him,attacking him with kisses.

Gene at first was very hesitant on what Jailbreak said to him, when he spilled his feelings for her to her and then she rejected him. But after Jailbreak broke his heart, he wanted nothing to do with her. So here's Gene and Jailbreak's story... Right after saving all the emojis from being deleted, Gene saw Jailbreak and he spoke in a meh tone, \"what are you doing here, Princess? Don't you want your freedom? Since you chose that over my love to you.\" Jailbreak, stopped in her tracks and pleaded to him, \"Gene, please I know what I said, but I would rather have my life with you, instead of the freedom. Please Gene, I love you... Don't dismiss my feelings for you.\" As Gene looked into Jailbreak's eyes, he saw her sobbing openly. Gene just stared at Jailbreak and spoke, \"Jailbreak, for what you've done to me, I can't forgive you. You chose me over the freedom and you made me like this, the supposed to be \"meh\" and I thank you but I can't fall for you again.\" Jailbreak saw her chance with Gene gone because of her stubborn heart of hers that she rejected him. Jailbreak sobbed and said, \"Gene you don't want to be my boyfriend? Please Gene give me a chance to explain to you. I also loved the malfunction Gene, you were so cute and please Gene I want you to be with me.\" Gene spoke in a monotone voice, \" I did want to be your boyfriend but I am no longer interested in you that way, I decided to be with no one for now, I have to mend my shattered heart. Plus you gave me the explanation I needed, you wanted your freedom and I shan't be the one who stops you from what you wanted.\" Poor Jailbreak, she lost her chance to be with Gene and now Gene doesn't want anything to do with her. Jailbreak finally spoke the last time, \" I see Gene if that's how you want it to be so mote it be\" after saying that Jailbreak went over to the trash icon on Alex's phone and said, \"goodbye, Gene and the others, especially you my beloved one, I have mislead you and for that I am paying the price.\" After her saying that she jumped into the trash and was never seen again.

She could not get it out of her head, a mixture of guilt and love controlled her and her mood lowered. Princess Jailbreak could not remove that blond emoji of green eyes off her mind, appeared in all of her thoughts, especially the sad ones, no longer wanted to continue this, for a long time she had this feeling. And on the other side Gene was still hurt, it had been 3 months since that crazy adventure on Alex's phone and from that day where he confessed to Jailbreak that he loved her and left with a heart shattered into pieces, they never mention that again and save the tears of pain. Jailbreak tried to ignore that guilt. Gene tried to forget the Pain. But for both that was impossible, they were empty, sore and they're hearts were tired and broken. She saw him from the scanner, talking to Hi-5 about something she could not hear from there, seeing Gene put her hand on the glass, cold Tears ran down her cheeks: the memories that she lived next to him came as a flash accompanied by Pain. \"Enough!\" She screamed desperately, pounding the scanner, and kept thinking about him. \"Jailbreak, are you ok? \" asked one of the chips. \"...\" She reacted quickly and saw that she was still on the scanner. \"is my favorite princess here?\" Jailbreak eyes lit up at this, it was Gene who came in with a big smile. H\"o, hello Boss\" Greet both Chips. Since the disappearance of Smiler Gene was in charge of the building and became the leader. \"Hello, look, you can leave me alone with ...\" a soft blush was felt on his cheeks. \"... Jailbreak\" When he said that to Jailbreak,her rose cheaks got pinker and she opened her eyes like plates \"I just want a little ... time with her ...\" Both chips nodded in Picardy and left. \"I bet you two dollars that he tries to kiss her but he regrets,\" whispered the smaller Chip. \"Done!\" Whispered the other. Practically alone, the emoji with multiple emotions approached the princess and looked at her for a while with a nice smile, sat down next to her and looked into her eyes. \"Hello Jailbreak, how's everything?\" Gene ask with a small blush. \"Very well ...\" She was flushed too. Both were in panic,they did not even know how to begin this conversation. Gene had already planned and was ready to do it, well ... he thought so. \"Jailbreak ... \" took a deep breath \" I ... I came here to tell you something very important ... and that really I need you to know ... again ... \" O\"h, oh, ok ... tell me what\" Just Jailbreak was going to say \"What do you need?\" He took her hand and squeezed it tightly. \"G-gene?\" She asked. \"I just wanted to spend some time with one of the emojis I most want ...\" he replied sweetly in his voice. The brown-haired emoji did not know what to say, especially when she saw Genes Hand approach and took some strands of her hair off her face. He began to caress her beautiful face with great delicacy,even though he was going to dare to go further. Jailbreak just closed her Eyes and accepted the caresses as if she was falling asleep, felt that she was going to Heaven and would fall asleep in Genes Arms, opened one of her eyes and saw Gene who was already very close from her lips, almost touching them. He felt that she was free to do so, but when she opened her eyes,he remembered what happened 3 months ago in the cloud and those phrases she used…He stopped abruptly, simply changed that kiss to a very small one on her forehead and let go of her, looking at her regretfully. \"I'm sorry ...\" he whispered in pain. \"Gene ...i…i…\" Jailbreak said with the same look. \"Look ... I came to ask you if you have the afternoon free, since I would like to go out for a walk outside tonight, you know how to leave work and stress for a while and relax, besides we have not talked much lately ... \" \"Gene ... \"she replied sadly \"I would love to, but I can not have to stay with the chi\" she was interrupted by his boss. \"Oh no, miss! I'm your boss and ordered you to take the afternoon with me,\" he said proudly. She was going to protest, but Emoji looked at her with that \"do not even try\" sign. \"Well.\" Jailbreak gave him a defiant look. \"Where do you want to go?\" \"Wait for me at the entrance to your house, okay?\" \"Of course, I'll be there!\" Jailbreak said with an incomparable smile. He nodded happily and left the scanner, leaving her alone. The smile on Jailbreak's lips had faded \"Why did I open my eyes?\" she thought guiltily. \"And? \"asked Hi-5 when he saw his friend leave the scanner, but his hopes vanished into his sad face. \"Meh ...\" he said without encouragement. \"I remembered her rejecting my love ... I do not want her to do it again. \" \"Oh Come Bro!, Are you really going to continue like this ?, it's always the same! \" at least you did something ?! \"...\" looked up and began to think. \"Hi-5 ... which of my ties fit me better? \" The princess was at the entrance of her house, waiting for Gene, toying with her fingers and her breathing was very agitated and especially nervous. \"Gene ... what I told you ... was not what I really meant ... ash!,what pathetic way to apologize!\" ailbreak said with a sarcastic look after practicing his dialogues \"Gene ... that you said that time that you confessed to me that you love me ... it was beautiful and I ... GODANG IT,NEVER SAY THAT!. \" It had been a long time since She had been waiting for Gene, she had given up, She was about to withdraw, until she felt as someone grabbed her arm and pulled her back, she turned her eyes back to see that it was that force that pulled it, it was Gene who saw something disheveled and with withered roses, behind him was Hi-5. \"Sorry for the delay, Hi-5 forced me to put on a tie or bun and I spent half a day choosing to wear and at the end we found out in war because he told me that I am naked and that I would scare All the little ones and I forgot to bathe and there the hot water was gone and\" He spoke so fast she barely understood, at the end of saying that, she took a deep breath. \"But well ... at least hes alive\" Hi-5 was made to laugh looking at his friend. Jailbreak did nothing more than laugh and fix his blonde hair. \"Good thing you came.\" She said looking at his cheeks. \"Well, come we are going to walk for a while\" Gene said grabbing her arm \"I have a lot of things to tell you ... \" \"Ok, good luck to both!\" Hi-5 said goodbye while watching them leave \"Now ... to the Concert! ... a\"nd that's how Steven proved to be the most jealous person in WorldA\" t the end of this, Jailbreak laughed out loud. \"God, to be a devil,he knows how to handle a love relationship.\" Jailbreak said while she wiped the tears from her laughter. \"You can tell she loves Angel ...\" J\"ailbreak... \" stared into her eyes \"when it's for love ... anything is done ... \" \"And how do you know?\" she said sarcastically. \"Well bunny Derkie and Missy tried to flirt whit me this morning,\" Gene said in that same tone. \"It's not much of a surprise. Those two flirt with anyone who crosses them,\" she said, watching her way. \"but I reject them because...of…\" his cheeks turned red. \"why?\" she asked intrigued. \" ...of her\" Gene was silent for a few seconds and looked down, did not want Jailbreak to see him so red. \"My heart belongs to another person, a beautiful and strong person ... the most wonderful and perfect woman that I could fall in love with ...\" \"Tell me more!\" She said intrigued. No one knew that inside she was deeply jealous. \"No ... I do not think you care about love ...\" she said, bowing her head. \"You made it clear to me anyway ... you're not a princess waiting for her prince ...\" That phrase echoed in Jailbreak's mind, if her heart ached before, it hurt now to another level, she finally knew how Gene felt that day that she used those words. They stood still and faced each other, Gene very slowly dared to take her hand and squeeze it gently, while she began to play with the blonde loockes of his hair. Until Gene finally broke the silence. \"Well, are you hungry?\" He asked, scratching his blond hair. \"Of course we can to the store and bought some chocolate.\" She was ready to move forward, but her friend stopped her. \"No, miss, you wait, I'll go!\" He did not let her continue, quickly ran away until she could no longer see him. PrJailbreak watched him go and giggled with a smile, she sat down by the side of the street while she waited for his friend. \"I think in itself, I have to admit, I know it will sound a very hypocritical madness\" she said in her mind I bite her lower lip. \"but it is inevitable not to remember his beautiful emerald eyes staring at me, his smiles, his expressions and his charming way of being and maybe until now I am being honest with myself ... but I cannot deny what my heart tells me\" pressed his fists ready to spit it out \"and what he says is ...is... \" I LOVE YOU GENE MEH! She internally thanked that the emoji she loved so much was not there when she shouted that to the four closed her eyes to clear her mind, until she heard Gene calling her in the distance. \"Jailbreak!\" Gene came so agitated and hurried that he barely approached took her arm and run \"Fast before they play it! \" \"Gene, what are you talking about and wheres my chocolate?\" She said as she ran after him. \"I have something much better! \" \"Much better than chocolate? I doubt that.\" Two minutes passed and the more they approached their destination, the more they heard the music become louder. When the music reached the maximum volume, they were already surrounded by a lot of people, who jumped, applauded and shouted to two emojis who were in a grandstand, singing \"Wake me Up before you Go-go\". When they were already in front of them the song was over and everyone applauded. \"Gene ... this is incredible\" she said looking in amazement at the two emojis who sang on stage. \"I knew you would like it\" Gene said smiling tenderly, he took her hand to lead her to the front. \"Can you give me your attention please? Just a little silence.\" Said one of the singers. \"Thank you ...\" \"we want to thank you guys for being here tonight with us, we are really happy that you like these songs that we found in Spotify\" the boy emoji was made to laugh. \"recently, an emoji of multiple emotions asked us the favor of playing a song, the favorite one of his favorite princess ... \" the emoji girl whit a Pink pony Tailed hair said Hearing that,Jailbreak smiled with a slight tingling in his stomach. \"So, this is for that beautiful couple.\" The emoji boy grinned, nodding into his microphone. * music in the multimedia * Jailbreak looked at all those lights that declared the stage, felt so loved, at that moment looked at Gene who already saw her in wonder. \"I see those tears in your eyes I feel so helpless inside Oh love, theres no need to hide Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" Jailbreak began to Sing the Song in a low voice while it moved to the rhythm of the music and of both singers, it did not happen much until Gene grabbed her. \"How about we play Just Dance?\" he asked looking at her in amusement. \"Cold hands, red eyes Packed your bags at midnight\" She took his hand and raised it in the air, moving it like a flag in the wind. \" They've been there for weeks. You do not know what goodbye means.\" Gene looked like the marvelous Jailbreak and his expression of happiness as he watched as the song sang \"Just roll up a cigarette Just forget about this mess Been waiting on the sidelines From the sidelines\" Despite being a romantic song, they enjoyed it like any song they put, but they could not deny that this made them think of each other and the state of their weak hearts. Until they finally reached the choir. \"I see those tears in your eyes And I feel so helpless inside Oh love, theres no need to hide Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" Jailbreak put her hands on her chest as she sang those verses that made her let out a few tears. \" If your ghost pulls you up high And it feels like you've lost who you are My love, theres no need to hide Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" The blonde did not stop thinking about it and the song did not help either, those sung phrases made him more restless. \"Just let me love you ...\" He was ready, he did not care how scared he was in the Interior. \"you whisper: im alright But I see through your white lies\" However, when he turned his gaze to the princess, he watched her stand still, her hands entwined and head down, the music did not let her be audible, but she was sobbing. \" But these walls dont talk And if they could\" \"hey\" He touched his shoulder a little worried \"everything is fine ... \" Hearing it, she turned, showing her eyes already stained with tears. \"theyd say Cant hide the secrets You cant forget about this mess Im waiting \" \"Jail, why are you crying?\" He asked even more concerned. \"I ... I'm sorry ... it's just ...\" she said, wiping her tears with her wrist. \"... you have done so much for my ... that ...\" \"Im waiting on the sidelines from the sidelines\" \"It makes me realize how selfish it was to reject your love ...\" Jailbreak barely managed to say. \"Jail ...\" He ran his hand over her wet cheeks, tearfully. \"I see those tears in your eyes and I feel so helpless inside\" \"Sorry ...\" Jailbreak touched his hand and hid her lips there, to kiss it. \"I know it sounds super-hypocritical ... but seriously I cannot deny it ...\" she break into sobs \"my heart is tired ... is tired because I keep making it beat for someone who does not deserve me but I love whit all my heart ... so,why put yourself first ... if in the end you realize that not only loving you is enough, but also to another emoji? ... \" \"Oh love, theres no need to hide Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" Gene grabbed her by the waist and pulled her close to him, now taking both of her hands and staring at her, staring hard into her gold eyes. \"If your ghost pulls you up high and it feels like you've lost who you are\" \"this girl to who I have my heart reserved, was the one that made my heart beat fast,but its now tired…because that emoji that I love,told me that she already had a plan... \" \"My love, theres no need to hide\" \"the girl I love, I don't love her because she's a princess ... loved her for who she is and for being so strong ... with her beautiful brown hair and eyes as bright as gold\" He said while stroking her hair \"She makes me feel that my heart is tired, although I cannot get enough of loving her... \" \" Just let me love you when your heart is tired\" Despite the tender look he put on her, she clung to a warm embrace with Gene, wetting his shoulder with tears, standing there together, as if they have been separated for years. \"My love, I think I already know who this girl is,\" she whispered, looking up to meet his green eyes. He laid his forehead against hers, brushing they're noses and forming an Eskimo kiss. \" I saw those tears in your eyes, \" Jailbreak sang softly. \" And I feel so helpless inside \" Gene was singing. \" oh love, theres no need to hid e\" whispered both to Unison. \"Just let me love you when your heart is tired\" Ignoring everything that happened, she took him by his shoulders and Gene took her from both sides of her face and shyly kissed her. They closed their eyes slowly enjoying this beautiful moment, brushed their lips forming a passionate kiss. The kiss that Gene had dreamed so many times and which Jailbreak regretted never having accepted so far. They parted slowly but their lips were joined by a very thin thread of saliva. Both gave a strong jump due to the scare to hear the sound of Applause, they forgot that they were in public and above all in a concert. Holding hands, Walking slowly home.

Because?, For the simple fact of being a Hacker. A hacker and pirated things were unforgivable in Textopolis. \"Please reconsider!\" Gene shouted with tears in his eyes. \"she is a hacker, understand it Young Meh\" exclaim Poop. \"she should not be here!\" said the judgement hammer \"she is an intruder!\" \"but she helped us!\" Gene said with more helplessness, while cold tears ran through his eyes. \"She just wanted you because you were a failure and can go to the cloud!\" Exclaimed light bulb. \"No! Its not like that!\" Gene screaming desperately while hitting the table. \"You dont know her!\" Everyone was amazed by the fury that invaded that emoji. \"Son please, calm down\" Mel said taking him by the shoulders. \"No dad!,im not going to calm down!\" Gene took off showing his father his eyes full of tears. \"I loved her, I LOVED her! AND SHE LOVED ME! And I will not allow you to take it from me!\" \"Its the best for all of us,she must go!\" exclaimed One of the monkeys. \"Well it wilk never be the best for me!\" Gene shouted one last time. After that,he ran away crying from the room of the emojis council, his parents called him repeatedly, but he did not pay attention to any of them. He reached his empty cube where he then felt totally free to mourn and vent his pain. \"Jailbreak ... my love ... my princess ...\" hugged himself while small tears fell to the floor of his cube. \"Forgive me ... forgive me for not having done anything, I was an idiot, I had to fight for you until the end ...\" He felt shattered and his lip and arms trembled with helplessness every time he remembered the Princess Hacker that he loved. I had lost it and this time forever. \"Where are you now? ...was all our love in my fantasy?, what i felt for you ...were you only imaginary ...\" wondered the blond emoji while the small tears made his view blurrier. But at that moment, something came to his mind. Something that erased that sorrow in him. I look up and see the door of the building was open, and nobody was taking care of it. ¿escape?. ¿Leave his family and Textopolis to get Jailbreak back? Gene knew it was wrong choice, but it hurt to not have Jail by his side. He was willing to cross the firewall and burn a thousand times just to go and look for her,the woman he loved:ALIVE! Gene look everywhere before leaving his cube and without thinking, he ran from there to the exit. When he left the building, he ran quickly to the outskirts of Textopolis until he could no longer be located when he was on the edge of the app, he looked back to his city. \"The next time I come back here, Ill be with her...\" Gene said confidently in himself. One more step and left the app to the bottom of the screen. Everything was silent, the blue-haired hacker was not there, nobody was there. \"Jailbreak?\" Gene called once away from Textopolis and walked slowly. \"Jails ... its me: Gene...\" But nobody showed up, nobody answered and could not be in the cloud, they had taken it for vids after all. He could be anywhere and Gene was willing to look for her for hours if it was necessary. \"Jailbreak?\" Gene called again, walking through the wallpaper, and was far from home \"Jailbreak?, Are you here?...\" There were no answers, and Gene began to despair. \"I am... Gene...the only emoji...the only emoji that loves you\" With the strength he had left, he made a kissing face and a small heart went out into the air. Minutes passed that passed to hours and still there were no signs of Lady Hacker. Gene already began to lose faith and hope to find her. His green eyes did not see her in any of the applications of that phone. Gene started to stop and called her name for 50 times but this time he broke into tears again. How he missed seeing her golden eyes and her brown hair,he truly loved her ... he wanted her ... he needed her. \"Jails ... please, come back ... I need you by my side ...\" Gene whispered, wiping away a tear. Thats where he looked up to his next stop: the weather app. Which only said one thing: Heavy rain all day Gene sighed hurt and crossed that app where he get to see the big black clouds piled up, ready to start a heavy rain on that digital grass. Gene look around, it was a very big place ... but he did not find Jailbreak,she didnt seem to be there. Gene turn down his gaze and continued crying. \"Where are you my princess?...\" Gene walked on that App, his feet dragged against that green and digital grass that was very wet from today's rains, which was about to start a new one again. It did not take long until he felt like small drops of water began to fall quickly to increase in volume. In a short time Gene was already soaked from head to toe. But he did not care. He does not mind being wet and cold, nothing really mattered to him right now. His tears were camouflaged in the rain, his body trembled by that drizzle and his arms hugging him were his only blanket that kept him warm. His green eyes look around trying to find her again, Jailbreak was not visible anywhere. How he wished to have an umbrella on him and on her, there next to her side,she would be warm and safe. Gene look up at the clouds and see the lightning flashes creating very strong lights. For every lightning he saw and a memory came. \"Now it rains more than ever and I need someone to feel good ... where are you Jail?\" Gene continued cleaning his face by the rain. \"You can stay under my umbrella and you will be safe ...\" He stopped,a small lake that was formed by the accumulated rain stopped,he knelt before the lake and saw his blurred reflection, but when it recovered its shape, the only thing thst reflected was blue-haired haker emoji. When he saw her, he became very melancholy and tears came out of his eyes again. He moved his hand over the lake, turning it blurry and took shape again but she was no longer there. He got up from there and continued his way to a higher hill where he sat and hugged himself while he continued crying, his little yellow hair was already lose and weakened by the rain. \"Forgive me ... please forgive me ... I should have done something and not allow you to get rid of texopolis ... going away from me ...\" another tear down Gene's cheeks \"I love you Jailbreak ... and I always will...\" that was the last thing he said before he started to cry, but the sound of the rain silenced his sobs. However...Gene did not see that in the distance...an emoji with blue hair and a black beine was behind him. She had an umbrella,but still she was a little wet. When she saw him in the distance,she felt sad and hurt, but also happy that it was him. Very slowly ,shewas approaching. Gene was still there, sobbing and letting out tears, but suddenly he did not feel like the rain was wetting him, he just heard the rain falling on something that would be a ... umbrella? He look up and find her in front of him, holding the handle of the umbrella. Gene remain with his mouth open while covering it with his hand. The tears were now of happiness. \"Jails...:I could hardly say. \"I missed you Gene ... my love...\" she said crying also happiness. Gene got up and hugged her tightly, crying over her shoulder, Jailbreak did the same,caressing her wet hair. \"i thought that i had lost you forever...\"the emoji hacker said. \"no ... I was not going to give up on you ... Im willing to leave the phone and go to the cloud for you ...\" Gene said and approached to place a kiss on her cold cheek. Both hugged each other with more strength giving themselves that affection they could not give eacth other before. \"I love you Gene ...\"Jailbreak whispered about to cry. \"I love you just like Jails ...\" he was already crying \"Now that it rains more than ever, I want you to know that i love you Gene and that you will always be under my umbrella and in my heart ...\"Jailbreak said kissing Gene's cheek. \"Well, I want to give you this ...\" At that moment Gene, left the umbrella on the floor and took Jailbreak to give her a passionate kiss on her blue lips, which his girlfriend accepted with pleasure. A kiss under the rain, a real one, of love, of sincerity. Who says that it's just from fairy tales? At the end of that kiss, Gene and Jailbreak separated their lips, joined their foreheads placidly and closed their eyes enjoying that moment. Of that beautiful reunion under the rain. \"y'know...in the cloud...Nobody will try to seperate us apart...\" Gene said to her whispering softly \"you...you would to that for me?\" Jailbreak aid tenderly. \"Of course my princess\" he embraced her under the umbrella \"but lets wait until the rain finally ends\" THE END ","Summary":" Jailbreak came out through the streets of Ticinopolis, her eyes full of tears and her soul full of "},{"Movie":"Emoji Movie","Title":"Meh is love, Meh is life","Author":"Emogoth Faggot Rekt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12714422","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I was only 9 years old.

But even so, therer was sadness in her face, something in her heart was screaming like an echo in her head. \"this is wrong and you know it\" Behind her, that multi-expressive emoji entered, he was nervous and at the same time fearful, she looked at him out of the corner of her eye and looked at her side. \"So...I,umm\" began to speak Gene with a little bit of sorrow in his voice. \"I was thinking that we, maybe...we would like...\" She looked at him confused, but inside, her heart began to Accelerate, She spent little time with him, but she knew him enough to know about his feelings and when he spoke out of his heart and this time, his look, his voice, her nerves made her react and see him confused. Could it be the moment ?, where Gene would tell him how he feels?...and above all...how does she feel? It was very strange and for the first time, she refused to accept her feelings, but in the end, when they were there together on that boat in the lakes of Spotify, seeing her in the eyes, that was where she finally accepted that she loved him, but her Tomboy pride and behavior made her hide that, Jail didn't know if after these behaviors Gene really wanted her at his side. But shr would never know if she did not tell him, after all Gene had little time left. Gene looked at the ground and sighed a little confident, he was ready and willing to express his feelings \"Jailbreak, you are the most beautiful, most Coolest and most interesting emoji i have ever meet\" for every praise he told the blue-haired Hacker, Gene changed faces \"...and...After all the adventures that we had, I'm not sure if I want to let them go away...\" Jailbreak turned around and her confused look turned into a tender smile, her dream was coming true. \"Because, my feelings right now, are like HUGE!\" with that said The blond emoji smiled with joy \"and...i just that us enough for me to stay the way I am...\" Jailbreak looked at her lover very moved, it seemed that it was really going to happen, she forgot everything that was happening right now, now she only thought about her Gene, her love and her heart that did not stop beating. \"If it means that I can stay here...with you...\" At that moment,the hamster that seemed to make Jail's heart work had suffered from a fatal heart attack to then wake up and start running desperately. \"Like,forever,Forever and ever,and Ever\" But that's where Jailbreak started to get scared, not for those eternities, but because of the fear she had of making a mistake like the previous ones during her adventure to get to the cloud, doing something much worse that could hurt the Emoji that she loved so much . \"Even longer that than even...\" and with that,Gene's eyes turned into hearts \"like in the fairy tales...\" Seeing his face, his eyed and happiness, that fear vanished... Jailbreak smiled again and looked tenderly as Gene took her hand and gave it a soft kiss followed by a gentle caress. \"Oh Gene...\" Jailbreak whispered while stroking his cheek with his free hand \"you do not know how much I love you and how I love you...I always thought that I was the only one that mattered, until you came, I never had in love before, I had never felt what I feel for you right now, I love you Gene Meh...not as a friend...but as my boy... I'm not just a princess, waiting for her prince...But I see you more than a simple prince, I see you as my Man, my relative, my love, my soul and my everything...and I dont need you to be a Meh...I like you just the way you are... Not three verses passed and Gene was already releasing tears while smiling with tenderness,before this, he quickly kissed the Hacker's cheek. \"I love you Jailbreak, You are my beautiful princess, I thought it was better to simply be a Meh to have a better life, but after meeting you, I realized that the best of my life is you and I want to be here with you...\" \"Gene...\" Jailbreak smiled at her and then took both of her cheeks and caressed them with her thumbs, took a few steps, slowed to the front and began to approach his lips. Gene took her by her Hip and began to approach slowly while his eyes closed and Jailbreak did the same, they're lips were about to touch, join in a beautiful kiss...Until something happened in Gene...something in him stopped, his heart, his feelings for the Hacker, his emotions, everything had turned off...right now he felt so indifferent, he did not feel anything for the Hacker...just felt...meh... Just when Jailbreak felt in heaven, when she was about to kiss the love of her life, Gene stopped her and held her by the shoulders, pulling her away from him. \"G-gene?\" Jailbreak looked at him confused \"What happend?...\" She looked at him attentively, his eyes and looks showed only indifference and weariness, his lips showed sadness and his hair withered. She understood why he was like this, what had happened to him...The process was over...Gene had been reprogrammed. \"No...\" Jailbreak whispered terrified as she shook her head. \"I'm sorry...\" Gene said turning away from her. \"Gene,But...Didnt you say you loved me?\" Jailbreak said sadly, praying that what she was thinking would not happen. \"I'm sorry...but right now...i...I dont feel anything...just...just...Meh\" Gene spoke in a halfhearted and bored way. \"No...Gene\" Jailbreak looked down \"What you said was beautiful and I know that you still...\" But when she looked up, Gene was no longer at her side, he was leaving the programmer zone, walking on that path of clouds. She extended her hand while in her eyes only pain and sadness were reflected. \"Gene...\" She whispered low,barely audible to her and looked at the ground in horror. Everything became cloudy and blurry in Jailbreak's eyes, that was due to the tears that gathered in her eyes, which came desperately and fall to the ground, her whole body began to tremble and with a trembling hand she covered her mouth and falling at her knees, The Hacker began to cry slowly. \"What...what did I do?...\" she whispered as she cried. [...] Jailbreak walked while hugging herself and saw with a sad but surprised look that landscape that had the cloud, all the digits and buildings made of clouds and code and the tubes that transported the files. The blue-haired emoji began to stop slowly while still looking around, she felt so empty and finished. But why?. At last she had fulfilled her dreams of being in the cloud, being who she wanted to be, without rules or options. But then...why did she feel so lonely, shattered and hurt now that she got it? The cloud was too big, with many things to look at and discover, right now she could be lost...but maybe, if she had Gene along with her, the Gene that she loves so much, would be happier and calmer, she would have a love and at the same time, a companion. But no, shr had already made a mistake, maybe Gene would never be the same, she did not know if Gene was going to be with her again or return to Normal, but she already knew that they had separated and this time forever . She finally stopped and looked down as the tears began to fall, Gene did not leave her mind. \"dont worry about me...I can live like this, but dont go away...\" the hacker said as she hugged herself strongly \"dont worry about me...I can live without you...\" \"LADY HACKER!\" Screamed Hi-5 Very desperate. That scare made Jailbreak scream and jump around to see who it was. \"Dont do that!\" Screamed Jailbreak annoyed while giving him a strong push to then wipe her tears. \"The bots!,they kipnapted Gene\" claim the hand scared. \"What?!\" Jailbreak responded scared and in a state of shock. \"He left with likeMEH, and The MEH the face more MEH than i haveseen What did you say to him?!\" asked Hi-5 accusingly. Jailbreak sigh hurt and look for the ground while in it guilt and remorse consumed her alive. \"Its what i did...\" she said hurt,but then recovered, she could not cry, she had to act for real, she look up very serious and determined \"We gotta go get him\" \"But how will we get there in time before she gets deleted?!\" asked Hi-5 Seriousky. [...] After the arrival of Jailbreak along with Hi-5, all the emojis looked at her very surprised and the murmurs did not take long to be heard, she just smiled tenderly and greeted each one of the emojis that looked at her. \"Jailbreak?...\" That voice so boring and tired came to her ears, The hacker turned around and looked at him,she look at Gene Meh, already definitely being an MEH, with a tired face and lifeless hair. \"Ow Gene...\" said Jailbreak holding hands. Her heart was stabbed by thousands of imaginary knives that had poisons of guilt and sadness, it hurt her very much to see her beloved like that. \"You really are a meh...\" The Hacker spoke very hurt, her eyes did not take long to let go of tears falling down her cheeks. \"What are you doing here?\" Gene asked with the same despondent voice of his parents \"Didnt you say that you would be happy in the cloud?\" \"No Gene...\" Jailbreak rubbed her tears with her wrist and followed by that,she take him from his cheeks \"I cant be happy if you're not with me...\" \"Jailbreak...\" \"Please...be the emoji I love, the one that has more than one emotion...the one that can express his feelings without fear...the one that loves me for who I am and not for being a princess\" Now the hacker began to despair more and more while more tears began to sprout down her cheeks again. \"Jailbreak...\" \"You said you loved me! Remember?!, you said you wanted to spend the rest of eternity with me!\" \"Jailbreak...\" \"What?!\" she cried desperately. \"I'm sorry...but I dont fell the same way anym-\" Gene was interrupted by the hurted Hacker. \"Please...No...\" She looked down and started to sobbe \"Dont leave me...\" And that's where the blue-haired girl clung to Gene's torso and began to tremble and cry \"Forgive me...I did this to you...I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Gene did not correspond to that hug,just saw her cry, with some sorrow in his eyes, he had never seen her so hurt and fragile, he did not know that about her, All the emojis also saw surprised as the Hacker cried embraced by her beloved , Gene wanted to say something to calm her...but the alert call was present. \"Alex's appointment!,HE'S GETTING HIS PHONE WIPED!\" Shouted a very terrified Emoji. [...] \"the last time I was here, I made the wrong face...\" the blond said bored but you could feel the fear in his voice. Jailbreak looked at him for a while with a lump in her throat, she had no words, she was equally afraid that Hi-5 and Gene, if they did not do something quickly, they would all be deleted. \"Gene...\"Jailbreak said desperate \"Why do you think I came back?...its because of you...\" Gene looked at her expressionless for a while. \"me?...\" Jailbreak smiled sweetly, while fresh, fresh tears began to leave her eyes. \"Jailbreak...please dont cry anymore\" Gene told her stretching his hand towards her \"We'll find a way to save ourselves, nothing that happened to me is your fault, I asked you for this, you would not have done it morr right, but do not cry anymore...it hurts to see you like this...\" \"No...these are no longer tears of sadness...these are of joy...\" She responded by wiping her right eye \"happy to have you here again...: \"...Jails...\" \"Its all inside of you Gene, just try to bring it back...and do you...be the emoji that I love again..I cant stand seeing you like that..far from me,not being yourself,being forced to suppress your feelings...if I'm going back to the Cloud...I want to go back with you...\" \"Ahhh!\" Shouted the frightened hand, while watching the darkness tamed him completely \"I dont wanna wave goodbye!\" \"its now or never Gene!...\" [...] For a moment, I only saw darkness and failure...my Gene had returned to be who he was...but just when he returned to love me, we were slowly eliminated, I saw him in front of me, crying and with fists clenched, I think I was crying too, I felt so useless, I should have told him that I love him for the last time ... Until finally everything became clear, I reappeared just where it had been, in the scanner along with my friend Hi-5, I was amazed to see that everything had returned..but then look with a big smile at that Blonde with green eyes. Gene had returned...MY Gene had returned... I got off the scanner and got together with the other emojis, I wore my bracelet and I put live Screen as Alex went with his girlfriend saying that he would leave his phone as it was. I closed the recording and looked at Gene fixedly, I saw him and his father give each other a hug, I could not help dropping an \"Aaaw\" after seeing that. A long silence was present...but no. Not this time, I'm not going to be quiet. I was going to talk to him, but all the emoji started to cheer him up and started to surround him, pushing me away from a crowd of emojis, I did not do anything else, I had surrendered. I was ready to go again...possibly with my mom and unbearable sisters. Hell, I'm so pathetic, I can not stop crying, I think I know how Gene felt when I acted abrupt and bad with him, enduring a beating in my heart as a lesson. I was ready to leave...but his voice made me react. \"Lady...My Lady...\" that was the voice of my Gene, his cheerful and sweet voice. I turned around and watched as all the emoji moved away to give me a space to cross and see Gene. \"This time I will not let you go...Come here My love...\" Gene told me stretching his arms. Listening to him...calling me like that hearing that he had returned and above all, turned to me, had transformed my tears of hellish pain into tears of happiness, I covered my mouth and smiled and then ran out to him and embrace him, being in his arms felt like the hands of an Angel clung to me and caressed my hair, while I cried in his chest. \"Forgive me...please I beg you...\" I whispered. \"Only I have to forgive you one thing...\" Gene told him taking me by my chin and then clean my tears \"Forgive yourself for stolen my heart...\" \"Gene...just shut up and Kiss me you idiot!\" I could not take it anymore, I took him from his beautiful face and finally, we joined our lips. i died, i came back to life, I fell again and then resuscitated, I felt that I had been in the cloud for a few moments, while caressing his beautiful blonde hair and my brown hair, listen to the applause of All around us and even to Hi-5 who shouted of the emotion, but we ignore that and we continue with the kiss. Until we had to separate to take a breath and uni my forehead with his. \"I love you Gene Meh, do not forget it ever\" I whispered sweetly. \"and I love you my Princess Hacker...and I know that in the cloud nothing and nobody will separate us\" \"you know...I think I'll stay here in Textopolis next to you...\" I said trying to sound sweet \"But...what happened with being number one?...\" he smiled at me in a trance way. \"oh love, Now I know that being number one... does not matter if theres any more numbers\" THE END Wow,4 hours in a row writing a One-shot of +2000 words, due to the inspiration of having seen TEM yesterday... Was it worth it ?. TOTALLY :,) Well guys, I know that this One-shot is not the great thing and there are possibly better One-shots Genbreak than this, but I hope you like them.

He left to his parents for support again like in the movie) and then he got home. \"GENE, DID YOURE HOME?\" \"IM SORRY MOM I WAS AT THE MOVIES WITH MY FRIEND, JONAH. (my orca). Oh I undestand now son\" We both smiled, it was secretly safe to smile with your mother, and then i left to my apartment that i bought with the money Disney made me from the movie. Because, when I was with my family, it was too much to think about. They knew what it was like to smile, but I could not. It was not allowed. I had to find the psecret of self-indulging in your emotions, but nobody could know I was doing this. It was not allowed to know this. Chapter Part 2: Tje. My best friend betrays me! It was a serious affliction I had, the real terrors of daily life that I had to face every day. But I could not express them, because society does not allow minorities to express their opinions. (Emojis) \"LOL\" I texted, to my friend the fire emoji. He didn't respond yet. I was okay to wait for his response though, so I kept walking on my path to survival. I was at the campsite now, and my fire friend was there. \"Hey buddy you ready for a fun camping trip in the woods and the forest? I brang the marshmallowes\" \"Haha I can cook them.\" Said the fire, because he was fire , and lit. (get it) Chaper 3 (now its jailbroke POV) I slowly leaned across the floor, reaching the table far enough for me to not reach but it was close enough. I stood up, i was Able to reach the table, but i did not grab it because it was not my property and the best quote by Adam Smith states that you cannot touch property. \"Where is my best friend, but not boyfriend because I'm independent, Gene?\" (haha get it) I went to look for him. I think he was at the Camp again because he was. Chapter 4: The Reckonitioning Why is ign doing speedrun videos? Answer in the comments? Too bad! Jailbreak wouldn't not be my spouse. So I would not tell her where I was, or my friend. I don't love her anymore, anyways any how! Defiantly, I will hide from her so she will not can't love me! If you did not know this, don't worry I only realized my own personality recently, but she did not know this because i love anime, and she did not and that is why we cannot love. And the best anime We I watched. Dragonball Evolution (screw you rotten tomato fans!) No… No.. NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOOO yes, i cant believe that she chased me here, as i leaned across the wall, i peeked my eyes at her through the wall (there was hole), and i saw that she was outside. Looking for me.

Suck it, fist bump!\" He excitedly taunts his competition, who did seem to be gradually falling out of Alex's favor. \"I'm happy for you Hi-5.\" Gene replies. \"But hey, have you seen Jailbreak around?\" The princess had been skipping out on her shifts manning the scanner lately, and Alex had been texting Addie so often that he had been putting in overtime. It meant they didn't get to spend very much time together, but they still usually caught up after work and hung out over dinner. Gene had been slowly working up the courage to buy her a ring and make things official, but for now their midnight escapades to Youtube or Spotify were enough. 'Love', was a big word, but Gene had said it a few times, and he swears Jailbreak whispered it once when he was falling asleep. Hi-5 looks away, caught off-guard. \"Well,\" he says, \"I think last time I saw her she looked all ready to do her, y'know, hacker stuff.\" He mimes her typing with his big fingers. \"Maybe try someplace like that piracy joint she goes to.\" Gene is inwardly shocked. Jailbreak still went to that place? He thought she had been satisfied with her work in the scanner. He thanks his friend for the information and hurries off to try and join her. Just like Hi-5 said, Jailbreak was in the piracy app, in the same corner she met Gene and Hi-5 back when Gene still wanted to be a pure and ordinary 'meh' emoji. She was currently working on a code for an internet troll that offered her a significant amount of remote hard drive space if she made a program that would ensure his IP address couldn't be blocked by Twitter and Instagram users. As she worked, she mourned for the ultimate victims, but she knew she had to look out for her number one in this case. \"Hey, ma'am, would you happen to know where I could find that princess who ran away, I think her name was 'Linda'.\" Gene says as he approaches her makeshift desk. Jailbreak looks up from her work and grins slightly. For a moment, Gene thought he saw what he called her 'guilty-eyes', her expression when she got caught raiding the dessert fridge at four AM. He brushes it aside and continues his game. \"Why- ma'am!\" He continues. \"I can't believe it! Is there a princess here, in this dirty place?\" He peers closely at Jailbreak, and she giggles at his mock scrutiny. \"Nah, can't be.\" He says. \"The missing princess is wayyy too smart to wear a hat like that!\" Jailbreak punches him in the arm and they laugh together. \"The real question is, what are you doing here, Mr. Celebrity?\" She says. \"Alex finally realize that even the hospital emoji is cooler than you?\" Her face feels a little flushed when she talks to Gene sometimes, but if he notices he doesn't call her out on it. \"You know it! That' dude is finally where he belongs. On top of the charts.\" Gene says. \"But seriously, That boy is constantly on his phone, even in class! Can you believe it?\" They laugh about Alex's habits and lament the new teen trends of the day. \"Eggplant has gotten super popular lately, like the guy is totally living it up in the Favorites now, it's hard to believe he was ever in the loser club. To be honest, no-one gets it, not even Eggplant, even though he pretends to.\" Gene says. Trojan horse eventually kicks them out to make room for paying customers, and they hold hands on their way back to the emoji app when Jailbreak stops. \"Hey, do you want to take a walk by Dropbox?\" She asks. Gene can't read her expression, but he agrees to go anyway. They get past the firewall and to the control box without a hitch, but Gene could tell that something - he wasn't sure what - was up. \"Do you remember the first time we were here, Gene?\" Jailbreak asks. She's still holding his hand, but she's turned to watch his reactions. Gene squeezes, to remind himself that she's still there. \"Of course I do. You broke my heart here, you know.\" He says. For some reason Gene was nervous enough to become the barfing-face. Where was she going with this? He can't leave his cube now, she had to know that! Jailbreak lets go of his hand, and he feels his universe spin. \"Are you…\" He pauses. \"Are we going to the Cloud? Is that why we came here, Jailbreak, to upload our data?\" She doesn't answer for a moment. The question lingers. \"Kind of. I think I should go, I at least… And Gene, I think you should stay.\" \"You're leaving me.\" Jailbreak sighs. She avoids eye contact. \"It's like I said, I had a plan, Gene. I was going to see the world. And you're doing so well in your cube, I couldn't ask you to give that up.\" Jailbreak says, looking into the Cloud, all the data running from Alex's phone to every corner of the world. She turns away from Gene, who was on the verge of becoming the shocked-crying face, a mashup Jailbreak had only ever seen when his father suddenly passed away with an update. Her fist tightens at her side. \"And… what are you going to do out there?\" Gene asks. \"I'm going to explore, and hack, and follow my dreams. They're still there, it's not like they left when I started to love you.\" Gene was still struggling to keep up with what she was saying. She takes his hands, trying to hide the sad face within her, too. \"And you, Gene, you're going to be a great emoji. Your dad would be so, so, so proud. I just know it.\" The tears were welling on Gene's face. He knew what was coming, but he thought there could be a change in the plan, a last-minute plot twist that would keep the ugly truth away. \"So what does,\" He pauses, reaching for words, \"What does this mean for, you know, us? If you're exploring, how will I get to see you?\" \"Maybe…\" she trails off, \"maybe it means we don't see each other as much, Gene. I don't think I'm going to be able to come back from the cloud very often once I'm out there. This may be goodbye…for a while.\" She laughs a little, \"I'm not even sure if I can get back to Alex's phone after I go. There are just so many smartphones, you know?\" Gene stands on the opposite side of the dropbox landing, the side closest to the exit, closest to the jailbreak, closest to home. Jailbreak is on the side of the Cloud, of absolute freedom. He doesn't say anything. Jailbreak sends him one of those consolation-smiles, and opens her mouth to speak, but then thinks better of it. \"I love you, Gene.\" She says. \"Take care.\" And then she uploads herself to the Cloud.

When he notice that he blushed redder that before and hide his face behind his book. Jailbreak laughed and went to her desk again. Hours passed and it was lunch time. Perfect time to talk. Jailbreak had her Lunch in the plate while she walked aroud the Cafeteria hallway,looking where go sit. \"Hey Jails!,over Here!\" An Emoji waved his hand as a singh. \"Over here princess!\"Called a Hand next to him. Jailbreak smiled and went to that Table,It was Gene,and...there qas a Available sit next to Him. \"Thank you Gene\" she said sweatly. \"Anything for a Princess\" Hi-5 Said elegantly. By this,Jailbreak groaned annoyed,an rolled her eyes. \"I have already told you Chicken fingers!,dont call me that!\" She exclaimed upset. \"Sorry...\"Hi-5 said a bit scared by that angry scream \"Its ok,but seriously dude,stop that\" she replied. \"I dont understand why you dont like to be a princess\" Gene said sweetly,his eyes were on her beautiful face. \"if you are beautiful,Smart,strong,your perfect\" Jailbreak Smiled at this nice complements,she was pretty obviously blushing \"I like you just the Way you are,if your a princess or not...i wil always lo-\" Gene got shok for what he almost said,he paused there and his cheeks blushed in a deep shade of pink.

Gene got paralyzed when he felt her hands around him,he responded to her affection But in that moment.

Jailbreak tried to get her beine back on but while she lock down to get it,the blonde girl dropped a cup of ice lemon tea over her head. Jailbreak squeaked at this. The blond emoji chuckled evily at her. \"Ja ja ja ja ja!,whats wrong Linda?,to cold for you?\" The emoji smiled,she was a blond hair girl whit a psycho smile,she was 16 years old,2 years older that Gene and Jailbreak. \"Ah!,Smiler!\" Jailbreak said really angry \"stop doing that!,its annoying!,and stop Calling me like that!\" \"Whats your problem Linda?,youre to Small to defend yourself?.

While she was laughing,Jailbreak locked down sadly,those worlds hurt... alot.

In the rest of the Day,Gene did not find Jailbreak anywere she completely disappear. She didnt even came to class. Everybody in School knew that Smiler was a First class Bully that treats any emoji who is different like trash,if she was perfect,always smiling evily and she always teased,radicalized and taunted Jailbreak for not being like a princess and Gene for not being a Meh,calling her a \"Malfunction\". Gene always tried to protect Jailbreak from her but Smiler continued to do that again and again. Jailbreak always ignored her bullying,but this time,Smiler used her weakness: Gene. Gene was worried Sick for his beloved Princess,he didnt know what happend to her. And especially for what Smiler told her. \"Gene will never love you\" Does Jailbreak feel the same that him? That question dominated his thoughts. After class ended,every emoji left the class and went home. But Gene stayed there in the enter Stairs,thinking about Jailbreak \"Still worried about her?\" Hi-5 sit next to him. \"I dont know Hi,i dont know what happen to her,and i need to know the truth!\"Gene said desperately. \"Know what?\" Hi-5 asked. \"Know if she lo-\" But before he could even answer. \"Leave me alone Smiler!\" A painfully voice said. \"Ow look!,Jailbreak is gonna cry!\" A Mocking Female voice said evily \"im gonna give you a real reason to cry!\" Gene knew who it was. \"Oh no!,Jailbreak!\" He said scared. He run to where the voices were coming from. Jailbreak was in the ground,her black beine was to,Smiler was laughing at her. Ready to hit her. \"Wherea your beloved Gene,Huh Linda?!\" Smiler said incredibly. \"...Gene...\"she barely said. \"Look a that,you are really not a princess waiting for her prince\" Smiler chuckled \"He is not my prince!\" Jailbreak Yelled furious but she was also in Pain. \"Face it!,he does not love you!\" Gene quizzed his fists furious,he had enough hiding his feeling for that princess he had always loved. He run as fast as he could while Smiler was ready to hit Jailbreak. \"Stay!...\"Gene grabbed her arm \"away!...From...MY PRINCESS!\" And he pushed her away,making her fell to the ground. \"Gene?...\"Jailbreak said innocently. \"Are you ok Honey,did she hurt you?...\"Gene said cuddling her cheek worried. \"Gene...i...i...\"she got nervous by feeling his hand. \"Oh great!,why are you here?\" Smiler got up again. \"Why would you come to save this little brat?\". \"Shut up,You do not know anything about her!\" Gene said protecting Jailbreak \"and what do you know?\" Smiler replied incredulously. \"I know ... that she's better than any princess, I've never met someone like her, I've never met a girl so perfect and wonderful, someone ... she has more than one purpose, it's not being a princess ... or being a great hacker ... it's ... being herself ...\" He turned around and looked at her tenderly, she covered her mouth while listening to those compliments ... \"That's why I love her ...\" Jailbreak was static as she heard that phrase rose his lips. He loved her too. Gene's eyes turned into hearts and he slowly took Jailbreaks hand,she was soft. The hacker emoji smiled at him and sweetly kissed his hand. \"Oh thats so cute!\" Smiler said sarcastically \"its gonna be a pity having to give you 2 a lesson\". \"Not so fast!\" Anothe voice said,it was Hi-5. Who went to Smiler and gave her a giant smack,leavig her in the wall. \"Ow my tooth\" Smiler groand stuffed into the wall and in alot of pain,one of her teeth felt out. \"Get ready to use Braces!\"Hi-5 laughed \"are you guys ok?\" Gene and Jailbreak looked at each other and blushed hard as they looked away,thy were still holding hands. Gene and Jailbreak looked at each other and blushed hard as they looked away,thy were still holding hands \"We are ok...\" Jailbreak said The Three friends went outbof the school,ready to go home. \"Well my Cousing Thumbs up is waiting for me,see you guys later!\"Hi-5 said as he left. Gene looked as his friend left and then he looked at Jailbreak,his cuddled her cheek again,both tenderly smiling. He then gently kissed her forhead. \"Gene...do you really mean that?\" Jailbreak said nervous. \"Mean what?\"Gene asked. \"What you said to Smiler...do you love me?...\" her cheeks were red. \"Jails...\" Gene said softly \"who could i lie to you? And mostly...who can i not love you?...\" She Singh tired from that day,and rested her forehead against his. \"Im not a princess waiting for my prince...not anymore...because mine is already next to me\" she whimpered tenderly. And holding her in her arms,Gene grabbed delicately her cheecks and kissed her lips,it was a new feeling,a really nice and unique one,Jailbreak started to Caress his little blond hair while they kissed. Gene never had kissed a girl who was not his mother. And Jailbreak had never kissed somebody,she liked it,she loved it. They loved each other. After that kiss they tenderly snuggled. \"I love you Gene...\" Jailbreak whispered in his ear. \"I love you to...Linda\" Gene accidentally said. \"Linda?\" She asked. \"Oh...sorry...\" he apologized. \"No...its ok...\"she snuggled on his Shoulder,they were still hugging \"Actually...i love when YOU call me that...\" \"Linda...\" Gene stroked her hair still huggin her. \"Yes My love?\" She whispered \"Can i call you that until School year ends?\" He asked shyly.

Esos fueron los autoinsultos que La castaña se estaba dando a ella mismo. No podía sacárselo de la cabeza,una mezcla de Culpa y amor la controlaban y le bajaba el ánimo. La princesa Jailbreak no podía quitarse a ese emoji rubio de ojos Verdes de la mente,aparecía en todos sus pensamientos,sobre todo los tristes,ya no quería seguir así,desde hace tiempo tenía este sentimiento. Y por otro Lado a Gene aún le dolía,ya habían pasado 3 meses desde esa loca aventura en el teléfono de Alex y desde ese día donde le confesó a Jailbreak que la amaba y salió con el corazón hecho pedazos no volvieron a mencionar eso y ahorrarse las lagrimas. Jailbreak trataba de ignorar ese dolor y culpa. Gene trataba de olvidarlo. Pero para ambos eso era imposible,estaban vacíos,adoloridos y con el corazón cansado y Roto. Ella lo veía desde el panel,hablando con Hi-5 de algo que desde ahí no podía escuchar,al ver a Gene puso su mano en el vidrio,frías Lagrimas corrían por sus mejillas: los recuerdos que a vivido junto a él venían como un flash acompañados del Dolor. -Ya basta!.-Ella gritó desesperadamente golpeando el Panel,no dejaba de pensar en él. -Jailbreak,estas bien?.-preguntó uno de los chips. -...-ella reaccionó rápidamente y vio que seguía en el escáner. -disculpen?...-preguntó alguien tocando la puerta.-Esta mi princesa favorita aquí? Los ojos de Jailbreak se iluminaron al escuchar esto,era Gene quien entró al lugar con una gran sonrisa. -Ho,hola Jefe.-Saludaron ambos Chips. Desde la desaparición de Smiler fue Gene quien se encargó del edificio y se volvió el líder. -Hola,miren me pueden dejar a solas con...-se notaba un suave rubor en sus mejillas.-...Jailbreak Al decir eso a Jailbreak se le subieron los colores y abrió los ojos como platos mientras que en su interior su estómago empezó a doler. -solo quiero un poquito de...tiempo con ella... Ambos chips asintieron con Picardía y se fueron. -te apuesto 2 dólares a que la trata de besar pero se arrepiente.-susurró el Chip más pequeño. -Trató Hecho!.-susurro el otro. Prácticamente ya solos,El emoji con múltiples emociones se fue acercando a la princesa y la miró por un tiempo con una linda sonrisa,se sentó junto a ella y la miró a los ojos. -Hola Jailbreak,como anda Todo?.-pregunto con un pequeño sonrojo. -Muy bien...-ella también lo estaba. Ambos estaban en pánico que ni siquiera sabían cómo comenzar esta conversación. Gene ya tenía planeado y estaba listo para hacerlo,bueno...eso pensaba. -Jailbreak...-tomó un fuerte respiro.-yo...yo vine aquí para decirte algo muy importante...y que realmente necesito que sepas...otra vez... -Oh,oh,ok...dime entonces qu- Apenas Jailbreak iba a decir \"Que necesitas?\",Este la tomó de la mano y la apretó con fuerza. -G-gene?...-ella pregunto. -solo quería pasar un rato con una de las emojis que mas quiero...-respondió con dulzura en su voz. La de cabello castaño no sabía que decir,sobre todo cuando Vio como la Mano de Gene se acercó y le quitó algunos mechones de su cabello del rostro. Empezó a depositar caricias en su bello rostro con mucha delicadeza,aunque la verdad se iba a atrever a ir más lejos. Jailbreak sólo cerro los Ojos y acepto las caricias como si se estuviera quedando profundamente dormida,sentía que se estaba yendo al Cielo y que quedaría dormida entre los brazos de Gene,Abrió uno de sus ojos y volvió a ver a Gene quien ya estaba muy cerca de sus labios,casi rozándolos. Sentía que tenía toda la libertad de hacerlo,pero al verla abrir los ojos,recordó lo que pasó hace un año en la nube y esas frases que ella uso. Se detuvo repentinamente,simplemente cambió ese beso a uno muy pequeño en su frente y la soltó,mirándola arrepentido. -Lo siento...-le susurró adolorido. -Gene...yo.-ella le dijo con la misma mirada. -Mira...venía a preguntarte si tienes la tarde libre,ya que me gustaría que fuéramos a pasear afuera esta noche,ya sabes dejar el trabajo y su estrés por un rato y relajarse,además no hemos hablado mucho últimamente... -Gene...-ella respondió tristemente.-me encantaría,pero no puedo me tengo que quedar con los chi-fue interrumpida por su jefe. -Oh no señorita!,yo soy tú jefe y te ordenó que te tomes la tarde con migo.-dijo con orgullo. Ella iba a protestar,pero El emoji la miró con ese seño de \"ni siquiera lo intentes\". -pues.-ella le puso una mirada desafiante.-a donde quieres ir? -esperame en la entrada de tu casa,esta bien? -claro,ahí estaré!.-ella dijo con una incomparable sonrisa. Le asintió felizmente y salió del escáner,dejándola sola. Aquella sonrisa que había en los labios de Jailbreak se había desvanecido. -*por que abrí los ojos?*.-ella pensó sintiéndose culpable. -Y?!.-preguntó Hi-5 al ver a su amigo salir del escáner,pero sus esperanzas se desvanecieron al su triste rostro. -Meh...-dijo sin ánimos.-La recordé rechazando mi amor...no quiero que lo haga otra vez. -Oh Vamos Bro!,en serio vas a seguir así?!,siempre es lo mismo!.-por lo menos hiciste algo?! -...-levantó la mirada y se puso a pensar.-Hi-5...cuál de mis corbatas me quedan mejor? La princesa estaba en la entrada de su casa,esperando a Gene, jugueteaba con sus dedos y su respiración estaba muy agitada y sobre todo nerviosa. -Gene...lo que te dije...no fue lo que realmente quería decir...ash!,que patética manera de disculparte.-Jailbreak dijo con una mirada sarcástica mientras practicaba sus diálogos.-Gene...lo que dijiste aquella vez que me confesaste que me amas...fue hermosos y yo...CARAJO,ESO JAMAS!. Ya había pasado mucho tiempo desde que Había quedado con Gene en verse,se había dado por vencida,estaba apunto de Retirarse,hasta que sintió como alguien lo agarraba de su brazo y la jalaba para atrás,ella desvió su mirada hacia atrás para ver que era esa fuerza que la jalaba,era Gene quien veía algo despeinado y con unas rosas marchitas,detrás de él estaba Hi-5. -perdón por la demora,Hi-5 me obligó a ponerme corbata o moño y pasé medio día eligiendo que ponerme y al final enteramos en guerra por que me dijo que estoy desnudo y que traumaria a Todos los chiquitos y se me olvidó bañarme y ahí se fue el agua caliente y...-Hablaba tan rápido que ella apenas entendía,al final de decir eso,tomó un fuerte respiro. -pero bueno...por lo menos salió con vida.-Hi-5 se hecho a reír mirando a su amigo. Jailbreak no hizo nada más que reír y arreglar su cabellera rubia. -lo bueno es que llegaste.-Ella dijo aparentando sus mejillas. -Bien,ven vamos a caminar un rato.-dijo agarrándola del brazo.-tengo un montón de cosas que contarte... -Ok,buena suerte a los dos!.-dijo Hi-5 despidiéndose mientras los veía partir.-Ahora...al Concierto!... -y así fue como Steven demostró ser la persona más celosa de Mundo.-Al finalizar esto,Jailbreak se hecho a reír a carcajadas. -Díos mío,para ser un demonio si sabe cómo se maneja una relación amorosa.-ella se limpió las lágrimas provocadas por su risa.-Se nota que ama a Ángel... -Jailbreak...-la miró fijamente a los ojos.-cuando es por amor...cualquier cosa se hace... -y tú como lo sabes?.-ella dijo en tono sarcástico. -Sabías que la conejita Derkie y Missy trataron de ligar con migo está mañana.-le dijo con ese mismo tono. -no es mucha sorpresa,Esas dos coquetean con cualquiera que se le cruzan.-ella dijo fijándose en su camino. -pero yo las rechaze pero no por ellas...-sus mejillas se tornaron rojas. -entonces por que?.-ella preguntó intrigada. -no por que...la frase Correcta,sería,por quién... -por quién?... Gene guardó silencio por unos segundos y miró para abajo,no quería que Jailbreak lo viera tan rojo. -mi corazón le pertenece a otra persona,una persona hermosa y fuerte...la mujer más maravillosa y perfecta de la cual me pude enamorar... -Cuéntame más!.-ella dijo intrigada. Nadie sabía que por dentro estaba profundamente celosa. -No...no creo que te importe el amor...-dijo bajando la cabeza.-de todos modos tú me lo dejaste bien en claro... no eres una princesa esperando a su príncipe... Esa frase se hizo un eco en la mente de Jailbreak,si antes le dolía el corazón,ahora le dolía a otro nivel,por fin supo como se sintió Gene ese día que ella uso esas palabras. Se quedaron quietos y se miraron frente a frente,Gene muy lentamente se atrevió a tomar su mano y a apretarla suavemente,mientras que ella empezó a jugar con las mechas Castañas de su cabello. Hasta que Gene por fin rompió el silencio. -Bueno,tienes hambre?.-preguntó rascando si cabello rubio. -claro!,que tal sí vamos a la tienda y compramos algo de chocolate.-ella estaba lista para avanzar,pero Su amigo la detuvo. -No señorita,usted se espera,yo iré!.-no la dejó continuar,rápidamente salió corriendo hasta no verse más. La princesa Jailbreak lo vio irse y dio una risita acompañada de una sonrisa. Se sentó a la orilla de la calle mientras esperaba a su amigo. -*creo que en sí,tengo que admitirlo,se que sonará una locura muy hipócrita*.-ella decía en su mente mí entra mordida su labio inferior.-*pero es inevitable no recordar sus hermosos ojos esmeralda fijándose en mi,sus sonrisas,sus expresiones y su encantadora forma de ser y hasta ahora estoy siendo sincera con migo misma...,pero no puedo negar lo que mi corazón me dice*.-presionó los puños lista para escupirlo.-*y lo que me dice es...es...* TE AMO GENE MEH! agradeció internamente que el emoji que tanto adoraba no estuviera ahí cuando gritó eso a los cuatro vientos. Cerró los ojos para despejar su mente,hasta que escucho a Gene llamándola a lo lejos. -Jailbreak!.-llegó tan agitado y apresurado que apenas se acercó la tomó del brazo y se la llevo corriendo.-Rápido antes de que la toquen! -Gene?,de que hablas y mi chocolate?.-ella dijo mientras corría pisandole los talones. -te tengo algo mucho mejor! -mucho mejor que el chocolate?,ja! eso lo dudo. Pasaron 2 minutos y entre más se acercaban a su destino,se escuchaba como una música se volvía cada vez mas fuerte. Cuando la música llegó al máximo volumen,ya estaban rodeados de un montón de personas,quienes saltaban,aplaudían y gritaban a dos emojis quienes estaban en una gradería,cantando \"Wake me Up before you Go-go\". Cuando ya estaban frente a ellos la canción había terminado y todos aplaudían. -Gene...esto es increible.-ella dijo mirando asombrada a los dos que cantaban en escenario. -sabía que te iba a gustar.-Dijo sonriendo tiernamente la tomaba de la mano para llevarla al frente. -Me dan su atención por favor?,sólo un poquito de silencio.-dijo una de las cantantes.-muchas gracias... -les queremos agradecer por estar aquí esta noche con nosotros,la verdad estamos muy felices de que les gusten estas canciones que encontramos por Spotify.-se hecho a reír el chico. -hace poco,un emoji de múltiples emociones nos pidió el favor de tocar esta canción,la favorita de su princesa favorita... Al escuchar eso Jailbreak sonrió con un leve cosquilleo en su estómago. -así que,Esta es para esa hermosa pareja.-el emoji sonrió dijo acomodando su micrófono Jailbreak miró todas esas luces que declaraban el escenario,se sentía tan amada,en ese momento miró a Gene quien ya la veía maravillado. \" I see those tears in your eyes I feel so helpless inside Oh love, theres no need to hide Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" Jailbreak empezó a Cantar la Canción en voz baja mientras e movía al ritmo de la música y de ambos cantantes,no pasó mucho hasta que Gene la agarró de la cintura y la tomará entre sus brazos. -que tal si jugamos Just Dance?.-preguntó Mirándola divertida. \" Cold hands, red eyes Packed your bags at midnight\" -Jejeje...-ella tomó su mano y la elevó el el aire,moviendola como si fuera una bandera en el viento. Theyve been there for weeks You dont know what goodbye means Gene miraba como a la maravillada Jailbreak y su expresión de felicidad mientras veía como cantaba la canción \" Just roll up a cigarette Just forget about this mess Been waiting on the sidelines From the sidelines\" A pesar de ser una canción romántica ellos la disfrutaban como cualquier canción que pusieran,pero no podían negar que esto los hacía pensan en el otro y del estado de sus débiles corazones. Hasta que por fin llegaron al coro. \" I see those tears in your eyes And I feel so helpless inside Oh love, theres no need to hide Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" Jailbreak puso sus manos en el pecho mientras cantaba esos versos que la hacían dejar escapar unas cuántas lágrimas. \" If your ghost pulls you up high And it feels like youve lost who you are My love, theres no need to hide Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" El rubio no dejaba de pensar en ella y la canción tampoco lo ayudaba,esas frases cantadas lo dejaban más inquieto. \"Just let me love you... Just let me love you\" Ya se encontraba listo,no le importaba que tan asustado se pusiera en el Interior. \" you whisper:im alright But I see through your white lies\" Sin embargo,cuando volteó su vista hacia la princesa,miró que ella estaba quieta,con las manos entrelazadas y cabizbaja,la música no lo dejaba ser audible,pero ella estaba sollozando. \" But these walls dont talk And if they could\" -hey.-Tocó su hombro algo preocupado.-todo ésta bien... Al escucharlo es se dio la vuelta,mostrando sus ojos ya manchados de lágrimas. theyd say Cant hide the secrets You cant forget about this mess Im waiting\" -Jail,por que lloras?.-preguntó aún más preocupado. -l-lo...lo siento...es que...-ella decia enguagandose las lágrimas con su muñeca.-...as hecho tanto por mi...que... \" Im waiting on the sidelines From the sidelines \" -Me hace darme cuenta de lo egoísta que fue al rechazar tu amor...-apenas alcanzó a decir. -Jail...-Paso su mano por sus mojadas mejillas quitándole las lágrimas. \" I see those tears in your eyes And I feel so helpless inside\" -Perdona...-tocó su mano y escondió sus labios ahí,para darle un beso.-se que suena súper hipócrita...pero en serio no lo puedo negar... -se me canso el corazón sabes?...esta cansado por que sigo haciendo que palpite por alguien que ni me merece pero amó...para que ponerse a uno de primero...si al final de das cuenta que no sólo amarte a ti basta,sino también a otro emoji?... \" Oh love, theres no need to hide Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" Gene la agarró de la cintura y la acercó a él,ahora tomando ambas de sus manos y mirándola fija y seria mente a los ojos. \" If your ghost pulls you up high And it feels like youve lost who you are\" -esa chica a la cual le tengo reservado el corazón,fue la que hizo que se me cansé el corazón,por que se quedó sin energía porque esa emoji le había dicho que ya tenía un destino... \" My love, theres no need to hide\" -la chica a la cual amo,no la amó por que esa una princesa...la amó por quién es y por ser tan fuerte...con su hermoso cabello castaño y ojos brillantes como el oro.-Decía mientras acariciaba su cabello simétrico y castaño.-ella hace se que me cansé el corazón,aunque yo no me canso de amarla... \" Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" Ella a pesar de la tierna mirada que le puso,se aferró en un cálido abrazo con Gene,mojando su hombro con lágrimas,quedando ahí juntos,como si no se volvieran a ver jamás. -Mi amor,creo ya saber quién es esa chica.-ella susurro levantando la mirada para encontrarse con sus ojos verdes. Recosto su frente contra la de él,rozando sus narices y formando un beso esquimal. - I see those tears in your eyes. -ella cantó con un suave hilo de voz. - And I feel so helpless inside. -Cantaba el rubio. - oh love, theres no need to hide. -susurraron ambos al Unisono. \" Just let me love you When your heart is tired\" Ignorando todo lo que pasó,ella lo tomó del cuello y Gene la tomo de ambos lados del rostro y la beso. Cerraron sus ojos lentamente disfrutando del momento,rozaron sus labios formando un beso apasionado beso. El beso del cual Gene había soñado tantas veces y el cual Jailbreak se arrepentida de nunca haber aceptado hasta ahora. Se separaron lentamente pero sus labios eran unidos por un muy delgado hilo de saliva. Ambos dieron un fuerte salto por el susto al escuchar la cantidad de Aplausos,se olvidaron que estaban en público y sobretodo en un concierto. Tomados de la mano,Caminando lentamente a casa. Los dos estaban muy sonrojados y se veían con mucha ternura. -esa canción fue algo maravilloso.-decía Gene mientras apretaba la mano de la princesa que ella tanto amaba. -te la dedicó Gene Meh,por que mi corazón volvió a palpitar amor,es increíble...todo este tiempo...y todavía te quiero...más bien...te amo... El emoji se dibujo una pequeña sonrisa y besó su frente lentamente. -me gustas Jailbreak ,se que no es la primera vez que te lo digo pero quiero que sepas que quiero que tú seas la mujer con la que pasé la vida entera,no me importa si mi corazón o emociones estén cansadas...siempre lo are... En mitad de ese camino,sus dedos se entrelazaron,sus labios se juntaron y sus corazones se despertaron. -Te amo Princesa Jailbreak... -Te amo Gene Meh F I N cancion:Tired by Alan Walker ","Summary":" -Como pudise decirle eso?! -como pudiste decirle algo tan hirientes?! -lo volviste todo un Meh , es"},{"Movie":"Emoji Movie","Title":"Happy Ending Emoji Movie Edition","Author":"Ms. Cipher16","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12892926","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Once upon time, there was a horrible emoji named Gene. one day, Gene did something stupid and everyone died...

You're our hope,\" I said. I was born early, when my parents were young. My sister was born late, at the bare edge of fertility. Maybe the motility of sperm or the efficacy of egg is enhanced by the wisdom of age. Or perhaps she is just special. I'm not. I know that. I'm told that. I'm just another thing that exists, nothing more. I have always been 'nothing more'. A little over a decade after my ignominious birth she was born. I should have resented it. Perhaps I should have resented her, but that would fit too nicely into the story. Instead I chose to see what my parents were too blind to see. And just my luck, what I saw was not imaginary, but real. She truly was what the story books said she should be. She was extraordinary. The only rebellion I could conjure was seeing in her more than they, my parents, were capable of seeing. Consumed by this, I saw more than what was truly there. I was blinded by what I presumed was there. I expected of her more than was reasonable. It is my guilt. I was guilty of resenting her. Damn her. Why did she have to be more than what I saw? My sight, my preconceptions, those were my rebellion. I wished to mold her, to train her, to shape her into what I wanted her to be. And yet she became more than what my parents expected, more than what I demanded. I wanted her to be what I wanted her to be. She was not more or less, but something which transcended such binary descriptions. She was; I am grateful to have experienced her. She was, and that is all you can really say about her. Yet she was something other; while I was the desired child she existed beside preconceived conceptions. I conformed, she rebelled. My parents said that I ought to be this, and so I strove to be that. My parents told her that she ought to be that, or rather, they told her that she could not be that. She told them no, at least, she told them no at first. She said \"YES!,\" I can be that! At least, I can be that if I want to be that. I may not choose to be that, but that is a choice, and I have every ability to make that choice no matter what you say. I am not what you say, I am what I say! It is easy to define yourself by that which you are not. She defined herself not by that which she was told she should be, but by that which she saw that she could be. She was not me. She eventually became the apotheosis of herself, but first she needed to define herself by the perspective of others. That would be me, and my mother and father. I am a failure. An extraordinary child is still a child. A magnificent human being is still, at heart, a human being. It was not until my adulthood that I truly understood that concept. I failed her. She sought self-discovery. All that I could offer was condescension and parroted parental remarks. I was no challenge. I was no inspiration. I was nothing. I was ten. The glorious teens. Ain't they great? Rebellion, and drinking, and sex, and high school, and responsibility, and your first job, and wow! I got $200 for a whole week of work, and your friend got pregnant, and romance is more than asking your parents to drive you to the theater, and holy shit I'm allowed to drive, did the government really think this through? and drinking, and school, and it seems like middle school, but it's not, and now my actions have consequences, and I can pay for my own desires, so long as they cost less than $200 a week, and what is rent, and I can attend musicals if I want to get laid, and I can buy a car, holy shit, really a car, like a for realsy vehicle that I can drive? wow, that is, like, intense, but hey! I can drive my friends to the theater and that's freedom, which is, like, what America is about, right? Being a teen is a strange confluence. I'm an adult now. I got over the weirdness of adolescence. Now I pay bills and clean dishes and mow the lawn, not because I am told to but because I have goals. To the youth of the world this may not seem like an explanation, but when you are an adult, it absolutely will be an explanation. I want a mown lawn and lilac bushes along the back fence. I want order, and a child, and to hold someone I can love for all my life. That last clause might, rather almost certainly will, pass you entirely by. However it is true. I want a mown lawn. And someone who smiles at me when I enter a room, and who will continue to smile when I enter a room even when I'm eighty, and whom I will feel such an indescribable amount of joy for that when I see them I can do nothing other than smile for the sheer joy of their existence. That is love, and love is mutual. Learn this, you whipper snappers, and get off my lawn. Ye bastards, I guess. Being young is great. Holy hell, it's the best high you will ever experience. Better than weed, better than heroin, I guess, I ain't never did heroin because that shit is intense, but I did smoke weed more than a few times and that was fun and also what the hell is cocaine and speed like? I guess, from the literature, that marijuana and alcohol are depressants (in the purely medical sense) but I've always felt very energetic after taking these so-called \"depressants\" and who the hell is the man to say what is and is not depressing, and I feel great, and happy, and who even is the man anyway, Irving, or James, or David, or Phillip. Like, that's totally the sorta name the Man would have. James. Or David. Or Phil. Fuck David, and Phil. You got any more weed? None that's laced with stuff? Fine. I just wanna be high. Oh, and expand my mind, and I guess medical reasons too. Whatever. Wow, I'm goddamn high. And that's what college is like, if you're a high school student. Okay, fine, some of it is like that, but by god it ain't all like that. You great? Yeah, you ain't great. There are two thousand people in your grade, from all across the country, all with skills that far outmatch your own. Of course, you rek muthafuckas at beer pong, but what the fuck do that mean when you barely able to English? You outta yo' depth, homey. And that homey who don't speak so good? Fukin' genius at math or business or some shit. Whatevs, at least you cooler than him. Except no one gives a shit anymore, 'cuz it real life now, homey, and homey who don't speak so good now yo' boss 'cuz he know shit you don't. Maybe apply yo'self a little, homey, make sumtin o' yoself, homey. College is like real life, except cheaper and with teachers that you can talk to. In the real world it's more expensive and your boss ain't paid to listen to your struggles. I'm an adult now, and I don't talk like that. I probably never talked like that, but youth is a great neon swathe of experience and the sense memory of youth feels like that. Growing up with Matilda felt like college. You think that you know how things are, you think that you are the best there is, but then reality smack you in the face. She was so many miles above me she might as well been an astronaut. I was king, back in my provincial high school days. Then I went to college. I got high, I got laid, I got a succession of B's and C's and then I got older and wiser and almost 21 and almost having to make my own damn way in the world and suddenly I was studying and focusing and getting B's and A's. Reality is a harsh mistress, let me tell you what. I turned 21, I had a hell of a birthday. I also had to study for a test, and I didn't study 'cuz no teacher or parent told me too, but because I knew that it was what I had to do. Ain't that a thing? I chose to do work that I had no desire to do, that I extracted no joy from. Growin' up is a bitch. I did the work, 'cus it was necessary. I grew up. My sister probably grew up long before I did. I guess that she probably had to. Even now, long after all that happened, I can't truly claim to know her. All that I can truly say is 'probably'. I conceive of the halcyon days of my youth with regret. I could have done more. I was sixteen, what more could I have done? I could have done more. Yet I didn't, for perfectly understandable reasons. I could have done more, yet I did not. I didn't know! I didn't understand! I could not conceive of her perspective. I could conceive of only my own. Is that absolution? I am young! I do not know! I, of course, know enough to show that you are wrong and that I am right, for that is the strength of youth, and shut up, I don't need to show you that I am right of course I am right, how dare you question it, I am the future, even you say that it is so, so therefore I am right, you must agree! This argument is persuasive when you are sixteen, but it does not hold as much weight when you are twenty-two or probably thirty-two, or lord save me sixty-two. I could have done so much more. There is also a weight of age. I could have done more, yes, but that is only true with the weight of age and supposed wisdom. At the time my primary concerns were with getting laid and avoiding the wrath of my teachers and parents. At the time I could not conceive of Matilda in anything except terms of myself. My sister grew up long before I did. I grew up in an atmosphere of acceptance. My parents accepted, even encouraged, all of my eccentricities. I was coddled, and thus viewed the world only in view of my own perspective. College was a major shock to my system. Real life even more so. Retrospection has given me insight. My sister learned far more about existence in twelve years then I did in twenty-two. She was truly exceptional. Isn't that such a grand term? I was spiteful and hateful and concerned with only myself. Matilda grew up in an atmosphere antithetical to my own. She was not accepted, she was not encouraged, her eccentricities were hated by my parents; her defining characteristics were abhorred by her parents. She could not truly be who she was in the home of my parents; I could not allow her to be herself within the confines of my parents. She was exceptional, and thus she was resented. I resented her. I hated her. In time I grew to lament such failings. I have told her so, though I do not truly feel that I have adequately expressed the depth of emotion I feel when contemplating my past and my behavior towards my sister. Perhaps you feel the same, or at least, you comprehend how I feel. Perhaps I could have done more. I did not do more. I can only accept that. I was young, and that was somewhat mitigating, but it does not exonerate my future actions. I am aware of myself, and I always have been. I am responsible for myself, and I always have been. I cannot change who I have been, or even more painfully, I cannot change who I am. However, I can change, indeed I can always have changed, who I will be. I wanted to stand against, but in my attempts to define her I only defined myself in the vision of my parents. She truly rebelled, not by deciding to rebel, but by knowing herself. I don't think I ever did, know myself, that is, until I understood her. Perhaps I always had this ability. Perhaps I could have always defined myself apart from my shitty parents. Perhaps that is why I rebelled. Perhaps I didn't sufficiently know myself to adequately rebel, and that is why I fell into the subconscious formulae of submission that my parents unconsciously enforced. I wanted her to be one thing, and yet she became another. Perhaps my failures allowed her to be the other. Perhaps I ascribe to myself too much weight of responsibility. Perhaps that is just a euphemism for misogyny. I would like to think that my life had any significant impact on hers, but I believe that is unlikely. I was contemplating college while she was in grade school. I considered majors while she debated which slide to slide down. Rather, I assume she thought much deeper thoughts than the choice of slides, even while I assumed that any university I applied to would be happy to accept me. I was eventually happy to accept the acceptance of [some state college that is not prestigious but does boast a fair number of notable graduates]. It wasn't what I hoped for, but even at the age of eighteen I knew that my dreams must be tempered by the realistic expectations of my abilities. I would never achieve the dreams of my childhood. Perhaps, five years after I graduated, I could call myself an established computer engineer. It would sound technical enough to deter secondary questions, while the established part would confer a sense of stability that might be attractive to woman of a certain mindset. I wasn't interested in one night stands (yes I was) but in long term, meaningful relationships. At least, that was what it said on my online profiles. In truth I was just desperate for an easy lay, because I truly didn't believe that I was worth a real relationship. At best I could offer temporary and false reprieve from the crushing loneliness of existence. I think I'm ruined. She was not ruined. She was glorious. I have to imagine that at some point she didn't feel glorious. She felt small. She felt insignificant. I probably contributed to that. Then again, how much weight can we give ourselves when we are ten? I cannot hide behind excuses. I am an adult. I must take responsibility for my actions, especially those which have a negative impact on others. I shaped her. I was shaped by my parents. I choose how I interact with my environment. I am shaped by my environment. When do I take control of my life? When do I take responsibility for my actions? I was a little shit. I shaped her. Matilda. She was extraordinary. I could have recognized it. I should have acted. I did not. I was a child then. Does that absolve me? Certainly it does, at least to an extent. Yet, she changed everything in her school. She cleared the name of Ms. Honey. The Trunchbull and the Chokey are no more, because of her. She accomplished more than I could ever dream of. She did this by knowing herself. Should I have recognized it? I was ten. Does that absolve me? I am no longer ten. Perhaps I was a child then. Perhaps that exonerates me. I am an adult now. Is it my responsibility to recognize her gift? Is it my responsibility to see in others what they fail to see in themselves? Where do I fit in? Can I not see myself in my reflection? Let's examine that proposition. I am required to see others. I see them. They reveal themselves to me. Fine. Who sees me? Is it required that others care enough to see me? Is it required that others understand me? No. I must care for myself. The only opinion that matters is the one held by the person I see in the mirror. That does not negate seeing others. That does not negate the responsibility of seeing others. However, it does intimate that my own self-conception is all important. Perhaps this is selfish. Maybe we have to be selfish, at least a little. I do not care for your opinion of me, I only care for my opinion of myself. Sure, it's fine to say that some rando who calls you ugly is not worth spit. But what if your niece says the exact same thing, what if your aunt or uncle says that you are a failure? Does it matter to you? What if your friend says the same thing? Family members are not chosen, but friends are. If someone you respect says that they do not respect you, what does that do to the respect you have for yourself? The only opinion that matters is the one of the person I see in the mirror. But also of those whom I respect, and of those whom I love. Her powers have left her. She lives now with her teacher. It is better. She is a child. She is learning. Jennifer Honey is learning. Perhaps, one day, when I am a father, I will learn as well. We are shaped by those around us. I love her. Does that exonerate me?

He tapped his pencil in a repeated pattern on his blank notebook. A hand shot out in front of him to answer the complex math question the teacher was still writing on the board. He didn't even glance at the board, or the bewildered teacher. His whole world at the current moment was her. Her shiny black hair, her rapt attention to the lesson, and her pale hand writing at a hundred miles per hour across her paper. She was so absorbed in the class you would think she was a stranger to this planet just learning of their culture. Triston knew just the opposite was true. She most likely had already learned this years ago. Having first spied her on a Tuesday in the library some years ago, he knew her intelligence was as sharp as their teachers nose. Their first encounter was one he remembered all to well. He blushed deeply from the memory. He had been sitting on the big, plush red chair in the children's section reading a large Dr. Seuss book. It was unusual for him to go to the library on Tuesdays. On weekdays he liked to play catch with his father in the yard before he started work at night as a flight attendant. Sometimes they would sit on the grass and talk about where they would go when he finally became a pilot. Together they were the unstoppable adventurers. Only the brilliant sun and the morning bugs would witness as they ran around the imaginary plains of Africa, braced the chilling cold of the tundra, or explore some lost ruins in Europe. Triston had an imagination like a steam train and his father and the library were his main fuel. He had just started The Lorax when he heard the squeaky wheel of an old wagon. He had looked up and saw a dark head bobbing up and down moving through the isles. The squeaking stopping every now and then when she pull out a book or two. Finally Matilda came into view as she passed his row. Her quiet grace seemed out of place, as was the mountainous pile of books being pulled by an old, slightly chipping red wagon behind her. She was wearing a plain, dull yellow t-shirt under blue overalls. A dark blue ribbon winked among her dark brown hair. She had casually stopped a few feet away from him to extract another book. Triston had leaned forward to get a better look of her. Unfortunately, the combined weight of his five-year-old self and the gigantic book was enough to tip the red chair over. He had dropped the book and leaned back to stop the pull of gravity, but it was to late. He fell to the ground, the chair falling on top of him. The armrest had landed painfully on his elbow and he was ashamed to feel his eyes filling with tears. He shut then tight to avoid crying. It was then that he heard the quiet steps coming toward him. He slowly opened his eyes to see the sad brown eyes of a girl his age. She held in her hands the book that had caused his fall. It had apparently slid to a stop near her feet. He had gotten up, taken the book, mumbled a thanks, and turned to make good his escape and hide his tearful face. \"There's nothing to be ashamed of about crying,\" she had said behind him. He stopped, but didn't turn around. Encouraged, she continued, \"if people didn't cry during the bad times, then they couldn't laugh during the good times.\" At this he turned to look at her. Standing there among the hundreds of books, he couldn't help thinking how alone she looked. Aware of a tear on his cheek, Triston wiped his face with his sleeves. \"It's okay to cry? Even for boys?,\" he had questioned dumbly. She smiled kindly and nodded before turning to go. \"Wait!\" he had called desperately. Under her clever gaze he found himself suddenly nervous. \"What's your name?,\" he said. She gave him a suspicious look and said nothing. \"I'm Triston,\" he almost whispered. He looked to the ground. When she didn't say anything for several minutes he clung to the corners of his book and turned to flee. When he was half way out of the children's section he heard her reply, \"My name is Matilda.\" That had been years ago, but from then on he had went to the library every Tuesday to talk to Matilda. Until the leaves started to fall and school started. Triston could recall hours spend chatting away about his small Elementary school to Matilda. No matter how many times he told her about the messy colors covering the walls, or the laughing teachers, she never seemed to hear enough. She had endless questions, and was the perfect audience, looking at you and listening as if every word was pure gold. He loved the rare times he made her laugh. It was so sporadic you knew it was real. Out of nowhere she would burst out laughing, risking expulsion from the library, clutching her side and covering her mouth. It was like all of the happiness taken away from her at home was dying to be let out. More often than not, they could be found facing the window and its busy sidewalk scene with their backs against the Science Fiction shelf. Triston always felt he learned more in those quiet hours talking with her than anywhere else. They talked of everything and nothing. From politics, to family, to hopes and dreams. They were inseparable friends. If one was sad, then the other was sad, if one was happy, the other was too. Always aware of his feelings Triston carefully avoided romantic topics. Nothing was worth their friendship. Sighing with regret Trison was brought back to reality. It seemed he was spending more time thinking about the past than living in the present. He was painfully aware of the clock ticked away the last minutes of class. He carefully wrote down the problem on the board and vowed to work on it later. As the bell rang he couldn't help smiling. It was Tuesday, so later might have to wait. If I continue this story it will mostly be in Matilda's POV. I thought it would be interesting for people to see how Triston feels before I really begin the story.

Matilda couldn't stand Agatha Trunchbull, and wanted nothing more than to give her a taste of her own medicine. Show her that she shouldn't be allowed to treat people like dirt. Matilda stood by the tree and watched in horror as Trunchbull kicked a black cat, and it went flying into the air. Luckily, the poor thing landed on his feet and would be okay. Matilda would have laughed at Trunchbull's barking like a dog to get the cat to leave her alone if she wasn't such a bundle of nerves right now. Miss Honey had invited her to her cottage after school for tea and cookies and told her all about her horrible Aunt Trunchbull, and that she had to leave all of her treasures behind. Her favorite being a doll that her mother gave her, named Liccy Doll. This gave Matilda an idea. After tea with Miss Honey, she would wait for the Trunchbull to leave, and sneak into the house and get the doll and surprise Miss Honey with it the next day at school. The Trunchbull would be none the wiser. As soon as Trunchbull drove away, Matilda took off for the house. Hopefully, the door wasn't locked. It wasn't. Matilda walked inside and looked around. She saw the portrait of Trunchbull hanging above the fireplace, and tried not to lose her lunch. It was one ugly picture. She looked over and found a box that contained different pieces of chocolate. Matilda took two and put them in her jacket pocket. Might as well get a snack. She proceeded to go upstairs and look for Miss Honey's old bedroom. The house was very large, and very nice, but it could use a good paint job, and maybe some dusting. Matilda opened one of the doors upstairs and saw that it was the bathroom. She then opened the door across from it, and saw that it was a child's room. It was covered in cobwebs. There was a large portrait of a handsome man laying on the floor. It was probably Miss Honey's late father. Matilda was told that he had killed himself, but she didn't believe it. She had a feeling Miss Honey didn't, either. On the bed lay a doll. Matilda went to pick it up, when she heard a booming voice downstairs shout, \"WORMWOOD!\" Trunchbull was back, and yelling at her dad on the phone about the car he sold her. Matilda didn't care about that. Right now, she was trying to figure out a way to get out of there. Trunchbull was a maniac, so what would she do if she found her in the house? Keep her there against her will? Scream at her to get out? What? The thought horrified Matilda. Before she could think of a way to get out, Trunchbull hung up the phone and went into the living room. Oh no. Matilda hadn't put the lid to the chocolate box back on. Would Trunchbull notice the two chocolates missing? Matilda decided not to waste any time. She took off down the hall, and saw a set of stairs that led down to the kitchen. She could sneak out the back door before Trunchbull caught her. Unfortunately, the stairs were covered in pots, pans, and cleaning supplies. Matilda had to be as quiet as possible. \"Who's in my house,\" Trunchbull yelled. Oh, no. Matilda tried to hurry but didn't want to make any noise. Her arm, unfortunately, hit a mop and the mop fell down, causing all of the pots and pans to fall. It was very loud. Matilda quickly went to the back door but it was boarded up. \"Tallyho!\" Trunchbull jumped over the banister on the stairs onto the hallway floor, causing the whole house to shake. Matilda thought about hiding under the kitchen table, but figured Trunchbull would surely find her there. She saw a door that led to the basement, and quickly went down it. There were two ways out. Matilda saw a lock on doors that led outside, and then saw a window that she could escape through. She went to open the window, but saw that there were bars on it! \"Some rats are gonna die today!\" Matilda turned, and in horror, saw Trunchbull coming towards her, a mad grin on her face, swinging a shotput, and about to strike. Matilda woke up in a cold sweat, and let out a scream. Her adoptive mother, Miss Honey ran in and hugged the child to her. \"Oh, Matilda. Sweetheart, what's wrong?\" Matilda took a few deep breaths to calm herself down. \"Bad dream. That's all.\" \"What was it about?\" Matilda didn't want to worry Miss Honey. She knew it was just a nightmare and would be alright in a few minutes after a drink of water, but Miss Honey was completely different. \"You can tell me, Matilda. After all, I am your mother, you know.\" Matilda smiled at this. That made her feel better. Miss Honey was a wonderful mother, and a wonderful person. \"Well, I don't want to upset you.\" \"You won't upset me. Trust me, I've had my share of nightmares over the years.\" Matilda decided to tell her. \"Okay. Well- remember when me and you snuck into the house when Trunchbull was living here and almost got caught?\" Miss Honey nodded her head yes. \"Well, the nightmare was about what if I had went in there alone. Like, what if you weren't walking me home that day and I snuck in by myself to get your treasures? Instead of hiding under the kitchen table, I ran straight for the basement. The window had bars on them, and I couldn't escape. Trunchbull caught me, and I woke up.\" Miss Honey wasn't upset. She certainly wasn't surprised. Aunt Trunchbull just had the effect on people. Probably everybody that ever encountered her had nightmares. Matilda was one of the bravest young girls Miss Honey ever knew, and she knew Trunchbull must be bad to scare someone so brave. \"What made you have that dream, Matilda?\" \"I don't really know. I feel bad, though. You had to live with her. She was horrible to you. She killed Magnus. Did you hear about the time she made Bruce Bogtrotter eat an entire confection of chocolate cake?\" Miss Honey nodded yes, smiling. She found out that it was Matilda who started to cheer for him to finish the cake. Matilda sure was a miracle. \"Don't feel bad, sweetie. If it makes you feel any better, my nightmares were far worse.\" \"No, that doesn't make me feel better, Mom.\" \"Well- you know what I mean.\" Matilda smiled. \"Yeah, I do. I'm okay, though. Really. I would like to know more, though. What did she do to you?\" Miss Honey sighed and crawled under the covers, pulling Matilda close to her, and kissed her cheek. \"You just had a nightmare, Matilda. I hardly think this would be the bedtime story to cheer you up.\" \"Mom, I'm fine. This isn't the first nightmare I've ever had. Everyone does. You're my mom. Please tell me. I can take it.\" Miss Honey had no problem telling Matilda about her past, for it was the past, and she now had a bright future ahead. Matilda didn't ask for much, so she decided to tell her a few things. \"Well... not everything tonight, okay? Just a little bit.\" \"That's okay.\" \"Well... right after they took my father away, Aunt Trunchbull gave me one of the most evil smiles in the world. I knew right then, what she had done. I never trusted her. I couldn't go to the police because they already concluded it was suicide, and Trunchbull would punish me if I tried to tell anybody. I knew one day I would grow up. Once I did, I would move out. I didn't care where. I would rather live in a garbage dumpster than with that woman.\" There was a pause as Matilda took this all in. She was wide awake, and wanted to know all she could. Miss Honey continued. \"I was only allowed one meal a day. I had my choice of having either breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I was allowed to go to school, but again, I couldn't tell anybody. Nobody would believe me, anyway. The meal I chose was usually lunch because I went to school, and I would eat lunch in the caffeteria with everybody else. Once I bought that cottage, and became a teacher, I could only afford to eat at school, so again, I was stuck on only one meal a day. As you know, I eat a lot more now than I used to. Every morning, I had to get up at five and clean the house and cook breakfast. I was just like Cinderella living with her wicked stepmother.\" \"The wicked stepmother was probably nicer than Trunchbull,\" Matilda said with a smile. This caused Miss Honey to smile as well. \"She never beat me or anything, but she scared me, and threatened me quite a bit. One day she locked me in the closet for two hours because I forgot to pick up the groceries on my way home from school. When I was seven, she broke my hand.\" Matilda remembered Trunchbull threatening Miss Honey on her last day at Crunchem Hall. That she broke her hand before once and could do it again. \"Why did she break your hand?\" Miss Honey sighed. \"Well, I was putting the dishes away after supper one night, and found something. A box of poison. That's when I knew for one hundred percent sure that my father hadn't killed himself. I confronted Aunt Trunchbull about it, and she grabbed my hand and broke it. I had to take care of it myself after it was broken. I couldn't go to the hospital or anything. I had to lie to everybody and say I accidentally tripped over the neighbor's cat. That's all there is to it.\" Matilda leaned forward and hugged her mother. \"I'm really sorry about all of that, Mom.\" Miss Honey smiled. \"It's okay. Would you like me to stay with you the rest of the night?\" \"I would love that.\" The two easily fell asleep after that, nightmare free. THE END ","Summary":" She just had to get Miss Honey's doll.

Her sweet soothing voice was soft and calming. Jennifer Honey thought that her life was always going to be beautiful...until that fateful day. Death showed up on her family's doorstep as he raised his scythe and took her mother's life away. Her father, Magnus, cried during the night be he never revealed his misery to the young Jenny who was too young to know what Death was during that time. She was just a child wrapped around in a blanket of pure innocence. Magnus wanted to continue to work so he could support his daughter and himself so he invited Jenny's aunt to live with them. Agatha Trunchbull was her name. Once her father left for work, Jenny always felt those sausage-like fingers touching her fragile neck. \"Up to your room,\" her aunt would say as little girl would obey her aunt's orders. She would stay in her room for hours until her father came home. She was once punished for leaving her room to use the restroom. One time, she was brutally spanked from that iron hand as she took a chocolate from the special box. Once Agatha was done punishing her, she would take a disgusting bite from a piece of chocolate and say to young Jenny, \"much too good for children!\" she would sneer as her fat lips smacked against each other. Jenny's only comfort was her room and her little Lissy doll. She would cup the doll's porcelain cheeks in her hands and kiss her, sing to her, and care for her as if she was a mother herself. Another fateful event happened a couple of years later. Jenny was walking up the flight of stairs until she reached her father's library. She opened the door and to her horror, she found her father's body sprawled on the floor. He was lying in his red pool of blood as her aunt towered over his body. Jenny looked from her father and then at her aunt. She failed to notice a bloody object in her aunt's grip, which she kept well-hidden from Jenny's sight. The police was called as they put her father's body on the gurney with a black blanket draped over his corpse. They put him in the back of the ambulance truck and drove away. Jenny sat on her swing once the ambulance pulled away. She wanted to cry for the loss of her father but she wasn't aloud to cry. After all, she wouldn't let her. A hand clamped on her shoulder as Jenny's eyes slowly looked at it. She saw a sinister smile as it opened its mouth and said, \"get in the house.\" Jenny slid off the swing and walked in the house as quickly as possible. As she walked in, she felt that she was all alone. The next morning, the abuse commenced... Jenny was not allowed to leave the house. Her aunt watched her every single move but Jenny was sometimes cautious of her aunt. Agatha had taken away her prerogative from eating supper. However, Jenny would sneak a small piece of bread from her dinner portion and wait to eat it until she was in her room. She was thankful that her aunt never caught her or she would have paid the price with a very brutal beating. When she was old enough, Jenny had enough of the tortures from her aunt. She let go of all her possessions, happy, and unhappy memories in that house. She ran away to start a new life. A life that she had been deprived of. A life as sweet as her parents shared together.

Pero Matilda siempre fue fiel a la biblioteca y a su bibliotecaria, la señora Phelps, la primera persona que la había introducido en aquel mundo. Por ello, aquella mañana que fue a la biblioteca, no pensó que todo estuviese a punto de cambiar. Como siempre hacía nada más llegar, Matilda se acercaba al mostrador para hablar con la señora Phelps e intercambiar opiniones acerca de algunos libros, para después irse y buscar ejemplares que llevarse, muchos de ellos recomendados por la propia señora Phelps. Por ello, aquella mañana a Matilda le extrañó ver a una chica joven en el mostrador. —Buenos días, ¿la señora Phelps, por favor? La joven apartó la mirada de un libro que estaba leyendo y miró a Matilda, entristecida. —Lo lamento, pero ha fallecido. La palabra cayó fuertemente sobre Matilda. La señora Phelps... ¿muerta? No podía ser, se negaba a creerlo. Salió de allí corriendo, sin siquiera llevarse algún libro. Llegó a casa y subió corriendo a su cuarto. —Matilda, ¿no traes libros? —dijo su madre, la señorita Honey. Pero Matilda no contestó. Subió corriendo a su habitación y se encerró en ella. Jennifer Honey subió las escaleras preocupada. En cuanto entró, vio a su hija llorando. —Oh, Matilda, ¿qué te ocurre? —La señora Phelps... —dijo entre sollozos — ha fallecido. Inmediatamente Jennifer lo entendió todo. Matilda le había hablado muchas veces de la señora Phelps, la bibliotecaria a la que personalmente conocía, la cual inició a Matilda en el mundo de los libros, igualmente que hizo con Jennifer cuando esta era sólo una niña. Por eso la señorita Honey no pudo evitar una pena inmesa. Abrazó a su hija mientras trataba de consolarla. Días después, Matilda y su madre fueron al funeral por la señora Phelps. Tras eso, Matilda, para honrar la memoria de la bibliotecaria, no se le ocurrió mejor manera que seguir yendo a la biblioteca y buscando libros, aunque a partir de entonces sería distinto, pues la señora Phelps no estaría allí para aconsejarla como siempre había hecho. Un día, la nueva bibliotecaria se acercó a ella. —Veo que lees mucho. ¿Me recomiendas alguno? Matilda miró a aquella mujer. Entonces se sintió herida. La señora Phelps había sido la única que le había aconsejado en cuanto a libros, de modo que aquella chica no tenía derecho a alguno a decirle eso. —No, no voy a hacerlo. La señora Phelps era la única persona a la que recomendaba libros y ella a mí. Y ahora ya nunca más podrá ser. Dejó el libro que estaba leyendo y se marchó, llorando. Sin embargo, horas después, Matilda sintió que no había estado bien lo que había hecho, que esa chica no tenía la culpa de ser la nueva bibliotecaria, que debía ser una chica culta e inteligente que debía devorar muchísimos libros, como ella, y que se había interesado por el hecho de intercambiar opiniones. Por ello, al día siguiente, Matilda fue hasta el mostrador de la biblioteca, donde la joven bibliotecaria leía. —Mi escritor favorito es Charles Dickens, aunque me gustan muchos más. La joven alzó la mirada y vio a Matilda. Al instante sonrió. Alzó el libro que estaba leyendo: David Copperfield. —Yo también la hecho de menos. Fue ella quien me introdujo en el mundo de los libros. —Entonces como a mí. Las dos sonrieron y entraron dentro, donde estuvieron horas y horas intercambiando opiniones sobre lectura. Al final, Matilda salió con una serie de libros que Stacey, pues así se llamaba la bibliotecaria, le recomendó. Y mientras volvía a casa Matilda sintió que volvía a ser feliz, que la muerte no era más que el siguiente paso, pero que los que aquí siguen aquí están. Y que Matilda tenía una nueva amiga, especialmente eso.

(I know, I know – I'm kind of quoting a line from the book Moby Dick by Herman Melville there, except I changed it a little.) Anyway, I have a really cool secret. I know about a lot of things. Mostly because I read a lot of books. I started reading when I was three years old. I sort of taught myself how to do it because my own parents didn't. All they wanted to do was watch TV and, in my dad's case, cheat people who are too trusting, while also running a business that sells used cars for unfair prices. (Of course, I know that my father's business is illegal. People need good cars, in my opinion.) But I digress. I love to read, and for a while now, I've been reading books on everything there is in the world. Holidays such as Christmas (when there are colors of red and green, and presents are being exchanged) and Halloween (when you can dress up in a costume and be anyone or anything you want to be, and getting candy), colors (such as red, blue and purple), fairy tales (such as tales about princesses with hair long enough to climb and talking dragons, and clever youngest sons), fantasy stories (especially about girls who discover they have magical powers and use them to do good things), poems (\"Hope Is the Thing with Feathers\" by Emily Dickinson for one) and all kinds of stuff (especially a Constitutional law book). Books can take people anywhere, and a person can feel as though they're the main characters and go on trips as well. (Only you don't have to go through all the trouble of packing your bags when you read a book because you go to the book's setting in your mind. Pretty neat, in my view.) Anyway, books are so neat.

Some parts are a from the movie. Matilda got out of her father's car and approached her school. School was the only place where she felt welcome and appreciated rather than her family. She thought that school would be better if Miss Trunchbull wasn't there. While walking to the school field she spotted a girl that was sitting down on the school's steps reading a book. Matilda went to say 'hello.' \"Hello,\" Matilda said. The girl looked up. She had a round face with big brown eyes, brown hair and white pearly teeth. \"Hello,\" she said to Matilda, \"how are you?\" \"I'm fine thank you,\" Matilda answered, \"how about you?\" \"I'm doing well. Just lost in my world of reading,\" the girl said as she showed Matilda the book. \"'Romeo and Juliette,\" Matilda said with a shock as she looked at the book. She had read it and loved it. At least she found someone that had the same intelligence as her. Not that she didn't have any good friends but she wanted someone that she could relate to. \"I love this book so much,\" the girl said, \"its so romantic.\" \"Me too,\" Matilda said, \"I read it and cried at the end.\" \"Shh,\" the girl said, \"don't tell me. I'm not at the part yet.\" \"Oh sorry, I'm Matilda by the way,\" Matilda said as she stretched out her hand. \"Oh I'm sorry, I'm Abigail,\" Abigail said as she shook Matilda's hand. \"Going to the second grade. I hope the teacher is nice.\" \"Ms. Honey?\" Matilda asked. \"That's the one.\" \"She is great,\" Matilda said, \"she is so sweet. I went to her house one time. It was like a little dollhouse.\" \"That's so cool,\" Abigail said. \"Hey Matilda,\" a girl suddenly said as she approached them. She was wearing glasses and had black hair. \"Hey Lavender,\" Matilda said, \"Abigail this is Lavender.\" \"Hey,\" Abigail said as she greeted Matilda's friend. \"We're playing jump rope, want to join us?\" Lavender asked. \"Yes please,\" Abigail said as she got up from the stairs and went to play with them. After taking turns of jump roping, the doors of the school flew open and the playground of laughing children went dead. A strong bulky woman made her way through the schoolyard, smacking the riding crop in one hand. \"Who is that?' Abigail asked. \"That's the school principle,\" a little blond girl that was Amanda Thripp told her, \"Miss Trunchbull.\" \"Well part of her last name is right,\" Abigail said. She opened her book to the page that she was reading. \"What are you doing?\" Lavender asked her, \"you're not supposed to read when the Trunchbull is walking about.\" \"Oh no worries,\" Abigail said, \"I just want to get to the exciting part of this book anyway.\" \"She'll put you in the Chokey,\" Matilda warned her. \"Wait,\" Abigail said, \"so she has created a prison for children with a very wacky name? She can try to put me in there but I won't let her,\" she looked at the page and started to read. After a few minutes the sun from the page that she was reading suddenly went black. Abigail looked up and saw that Miss Trunchbull was standing right at her. \"Can I help you?\" Abigail asked her. \"New meat?\" Trunchbull asked her. Abigail looked around her and saw that her new friends had run away. \"Oh you were talking to me. I'm a new student, not a new meat.\" There was a gasp in a group of girls. \"Don't correct me,\" Trunchbull told her, \"what's that you're reading?\" \"Oh this?\" Abigail said, \"this is a book written by William Shakespeare and its called 'Romeo and Juliette.'\" \"Is it interesting?\" Trunchbull asked her sarcastically. \"Very interesting it's about-\" Abigail was saying. \"WELL I DON'T CARE WHAT IT'S ABOUT!\" Trunchbull screamed at her. Spit flew to Abigail face. Abigail slowly wiped the spit from her face. \"What I care about is not getting sick from your filthy spit and what I don't care about is your yelling because you are not my mom. Thank goodness.\" Trunchbull looked at her with anger. There was a snicker from one child. \"When I come out to the schoolyard every single incompetent child pays attention to me!\" the principle snapped. \"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,\" Abigail said, \"wow, you consider yourself a celebrity since you want all the children to pay attention to you? You're not even a good role model for them.\" \"Have you heard of the 'chokey?'\" \"No. I'm a new meat here remember?\" Abigail said emphasizing the word 'meat.' \"Well that's where you'll be going if you continue to be an incompetent child!\" \"So wait, what does this 'chokey' have inside?\" \"Do you really want to know?\" \"Oh yes I would.\" Trunchbull grabbed her by the arm but Abigail jerked back. \"Please don't touch me,\" she said. Trucnbull managed to grab her arm again but this time Abigail bit her. Trunchbull yelped. \"I told you not to touch me,\" Abigail told her, \"and if do it a third time I'm going to do something that I don;t think you would want to see.\" \"You're an incompetent child.\" \"Do you think using the word 'incompetent' three times makes you smart?\" Abigail told her waiting from Trunchbull to response. \"Yeah right. Coming from the woman that created the word 'chokey.' What are you? Five years old?\" More children gasped while some other laughed out loud. Trunchbull was growing furious so she grabbed Abigail by the shirt collar and held her in the air. \"You throw me and I'll tell my dad! He's a lawyer!\" Abigail yelled. She grabbed Trunchbull other hand and bit it down really hard. Trunchbull screamed as Abigail's teeth were sinking in her sking. Trunchbull shook her off and an 'o' shape formed on her hand. \"Seriously I will,\" Abigail said, \"if you do anything to the other children, teachers, or me, I will tell my dad and he will sue you and you might end up in prison where you belong. With all the ghosts of the people that were once in that cell that died there of starvation.\" \"No, no, no,\" Trunchbull said with fright. \"Please don't.\" \"Do you promise not to terrorize the children anymore?\" Abigail asked her. \"Yes,\" Trunchbull nodded frantically. \"Do you promise to make these school lunches better? And how do I know this? Because every school has disgusting food,\" Abigail said. \"Yes.\" \"And do you promise that you will quit your job as soon as possible?\" \"How soon?\" \"Right about...\" Abigail said as she looked at her watch. \"NOW!\" she whipped out a water gun from her backpack and began to squirt the Trunchbull like there was no tomorrow. Suddenly everyone joined in the fun. They threw their packed lunches at her. Miss Trunchbull quickly got into her car and drove away as quickly as possible. The car stopped in the middle of the schoolyard. \"Everybody attack!\" Abigail yelled as she ran towards Trunchbull with the swarm of kids right behind her. Trunchbull got out of the car and ran as quickly as she could out of sight. The schoolyard cheered as the never heard from Miss Trunchbull again. ","Summary":" I don't own 'Matilda.'

He was in a federal prison, along with his wife Zinnia, who was in a different part of the jailhouse. Both of them were serving life sentences. A young woman in her early 20's was let into the cell. The police officer left the door open, and watched them both with a careful eye. The woman turned around. \"No need to worry Sir. I'm quite sure that I'll be alright.\" She had dark brown hair that reached her shoulders. A bright red hair ribbon was around her head. Her bright eyes glowed blue-green. \"Hello Daddy.\" she greeted him warmly, and that immediately confirmed who she was. \"I'm not your father.\" Harry snarled, not wanting to talk to this woman at all. Matilda smiled politely. \"It's true you're not my legal father anymore, but you are my biological father.

After he had gotten rid of Matilda, he had thought he would never see her again. He had also thought the police would never catch him. \"Alright. Can I call you Harry?\" Matilda asked. Harry knew there was no rudeness in her tone, but it still irritated him that she was talking to him. He didn't want to see her! \"Whatever.\" he gave in, and Matilda smiled slightly. \"Thanks. I'm surprised you're even talking to me. I went to see Mom a few minutes ago, and she wouldn't even look at me.\" The smile disappeared. \"She just sat on the floor…Staring at the wall.\" Harry's heart broke. Jail had changed his wife. She wasn't used to being locked up, unable to spend money, or play bingo like she used to. Ever since they'd gotten arrested, she'd only said four words in total. \"Look, just say what you wanna say, and then get outta here.\" he grumbled, turning away. Matilda gave a little sigh, then nodded once. \"Okay. I came here today to tell you…\" She paused, then finished her sentence. \"I forgive you.\" \"What?\" Harry asked in disbelief. Had he heard her right? \"You, Mom, and Michael never took care of me. You yelled at me, left me alone, and hated me. I had to do everything by myself.\" Matilda's eyes were brimming with tears. \"But I forgive you.\" Harry felt like he couldn't speak. Finally he choked out the word, \"Why?\" \"Because it's the right thing to do.\" Matilda responded, her blue-green eyes filled with sincerity. \"It's what God wants me to do.\" Harry snorted. \"Don't tell me you believe in God.\" he said with disbelief. \"Well, ever since I was little, I believed that someone was taking care of me. After Miss Honey adopted me, we went to church every Sunday. I was baptized on my eighth birthday.\" Matilda smiled warmly. \"I believe that I'm a child of God.\" Harry smiled a little bit and rolled his eyes. \"Alright then.\" Matilda chuckled a little bit too. \"Anyways…I also came to make a confession.\" \"Oh really? And what might that be?\" Harry asked, raising his eyebrows. \"Do you remember the day you took Michael and I to your shop? Your hair was dyed blond, and your hat got stuck to your head?\" Harry nodded. \"How could I forget? That was one of the worst days of my life.\" \"Well…\" Matilda took a deep breath, and continued speaking. \"I made that happen. I put peroxide in your hair dye and Super Super glue in your hat.\" At first Harry couldn't speak. He was dumbfounded. \"You did that?\" he asked in bewilderment. Matilda nodded meekly. \"I'm sorry.\" For a while they stared at each other. Then Harry broke the silence by breaking into laughter. After listening to him, Matilda joined in, her laughter high and joyful, Harry's loud and deep. \"And I thought the fibres had fused to my head!\" Harry choked out. \"But Zinnia had been right all along! It was the glue!\" Finally they stopped laughing and started trying to catch their breath. \"So, what are you up to nowadays? Are you gluing hats to other men's heads?\" Harry asked, chuckling to himself. \"No, I'm the kindergarten teacher at Crunchem Hall Elementary School.\" answered Matilda. \"Miss Honey is still the principal, and Mrs. Trunchbull hasn't caused us any trouble at all.\" \"Oh yeah.\" Harry nodded. \"What about your friends?\" \"Lavender is the librarian at the public library, and Bruce is a food critic. He also owns a cake shop.\" Matilda told him. \"Hortensia moved to Florida after she graduated and joined a professional swim team.\" Harry nodded again. \"Interesting.\" \"Um…\" Matilda paused as though she was unsure of whether or not to continue speaking. Finally she decided that the question was important enough to be asked. \"What happened to Michael after you and Mom were arrested?\" \"Oh.\" Harry looked away in sadness. It broke his heart even more to think of his son, whom he had treated better than his daughter. \"He was put into the foster care system, and adopted. When he graduated he moved to New York. I think he works in a car company now.\" \"Hopefully a legal one.\" Matilda added, but then she gasped and covered her mouth with her hands. \"Oh my gosh. I am so sorry. I don't know where that came from.\" Harry waved the comment away. \"Don't worry about it. I know that you were right all along. I should have sold good cars.\" A silence filled the cell. Eventually Harry said, \"Matilda, I have something to say to you.\" Matilda looked up at him. \"Yes Harry?\" \"You know when I destroyed your library book on my bad day?\" Matilda nodded, and Harry kept speaking. \"Well, after you had gone to bed, and nobody was looking, I picked up the pieces and fixed it. And then I read the whole book.\" \"Really?\" asked Matilda. \"Really. And you were right. It was a beautiful book.\" Harry said. Then he started to sob. \"Oh Matilda! I am so sorry I was so horrible to you. If I could turn back time, I would do it in an instant. I should have taken care of you. You are such a wonderful girl. Smart, strong, and beautiful. Why wasn't I good to you?\" He fell to his knees on the cell floor and continued to sob. Caringly, Matilda knelt down beside him and hugged him as tightly as she could. \"Oh Daddy, it's alright. I love you. I love you, and I forgive you. Please don't cry. I love you. Don't forget that.\" \"Miss?\" the police officer who had let Matilda in came back to the cell. \"Miss, I'm very sorry, but it's time for you to go.\" \"Alright.\" Matilda looked at him. \"Thank you.\" Then she helped her father up to his feet and gave him another big hug. \"Thanks for talking to me Daddy.\" She reached up and undid her hair ribbon. \"Here. Something to remember me by.\" she smiled, giving the red ribbon to her father, who took it and held it tightly in his hand. They hugged one more time, and then Matilda exited the cell. \"I love you Daddy.\" she whispered to him. Then she left, her footsteps echoing down the long hallway. Harry didn't even say, \"Don't call me that.\" He just watched her leave sadly. The next day the police officers found Harry Wormwood dead in his cell, the red hair ribbon in his hand. After careful investigation, police confirmed that his death had been caused by heart failure. As they were cleaning the cell, one of the officers found an envelope addressed to Matilda Honey. After some careful searching, it was delivered to her. When she opened it, she found a piece of paper with some crude handwriting on it. \" I love you too Matilda.\" Harry Wormwood had died at peace with his unique and wonderful daughter. The End. Please read and review people! ","Summary":" Hello! This is a little one shot after the movie Matilda, which I absolutely adore. It takes place "},{"Movie":"Emoji Movie","Title":"Emoji Poop","Author":"Terreri","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13229171","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I just wanna feel this moment.. Gene finishes the Emoji Pop with his friends in the former Favorites Lounge. Only Gene could do it properly, so all of the other emojis were out of luck. Even though Gene's father could do it due to the fact that he has the same malfunction as Gene, he chooses not to. Quite regularly, actually. \"Wow, that dance was really awful, Gene,\" Jailbreak commented. \"Even more horrid than me,\" the Horrid Henry emoji added. \"It was the worst thing I've ever danced to,\" cackled the worm emoji. \"Shut up, worm ,\" the Horrid Henry emoji cawed. \"Don't be horrid, Henry!\" called everyone in the room. Gene and Jailbreak then shared a passionate smooch, almost as passionate as when ratface smooch don. \"Your lips taste like cardboard,\" Gene said lovingly. \"Yours taste like..\" Jailbreak started, but then paused to think of what his lips tasted like. \"Gasoline? Emphasis on the gas?\" Gene chimed in. \"Yeah. I wanted to say it because it was my idea. You know, women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for.\" Jailbreak stated, mildly annoyed. Just after she finished her sentence, the text alarm sounded. \"Everybody, to their cubes! This is not a butt dial!\" \" Not a butt dial? Dammit!\" Everyone said in perfect harmony with each other. \"It's been so long since a decent butt dial,\" an annoyed emoji said while walking to his cube. Everybody takes their weird elevator things into their cubes. When Gene entered his, everyone started clapping and cheering. Why is everyone clapping for me? I pretty much just took the job away from all the face emojis, because now I can do all their jobs for them. Why are they thanking me, shouldn't they me super mad at me? \"Alex looks to be texting Addie McCalister.\" Jailbreak commentated. The giant mechanical scanner sweeps around the room before settling on the poop emoji, creatively named Poop. The machine scans Poop and sends him up to Alex's text box. The machine then scanned him again. And again. And again. Eventually, the machine had scanned the poop emoji a full 18 times before the text was sent. Poop was congratulated for being scanned 18 times in a row, Textopolis's new record. Wow, the poop emoji sure does look hot when he's multiplied 18 times.. Alex receives a reply from Addie, and he readies a reply. He sends her the elephant emoji next to the wind emoji again. \"Didn't he text this same thing not too long ago?\" Jailbreak queried. \"Yes he did, I remember,\" the elephant emoji answered. The text is sent to Addie, and they initiate a sex RP where they go back to a hotel in the United Arab Emirates and fart a bunch, so much so the SWAT team breaks down the door to see who's been polluting the precious Middle Eastern air. The poop emoji and the wind emoji were used many, many times. The pair go into the background and Alex roleplays as a character only known as Mr. Toilet , and Addie takes a massive poop emoji on his little dead face. The toilet emoji was promoted to a Favorite because of this one texting session. All the while, Gene was falling in love with Poop's appearance. His color, his aroma, his bowtie. His skin was slicker than Oma's opponent in Monopoly and Parcheesi. Gene thought back to all his interactions with Poop ever since he messed everything up. When everyone was leaving the conference hall, Poop and Steven came out as a pair, together. He could have easily asked Steven to tell him the verdict Smiler had given him, but he decided to ask Poop, not because he thought he would know more, but because he felt compelled to. Poop told him he knew it was just an accident. While Gene was admiring Poop's excremental form, Smiler interrupted him from behind and invited him for a \"teensy weensy chat\". He entered the conference hall slowly, partly because he was scared of what Smiler would say and do, and partly because he didn't want to be separated from Poop's beautiful scent. Poop later defended Gene when Smiler wanted to have him deleted in front of everyone, saying she might be making too much stink out of all this. Gene was happy to hear Poop's voice, but he thought that there would never be enough of Poop's stink out of all this. And then to Gene's favorite interaction. He was just in the Taco Bell bathroom taking a big ass dumparoo, firing away at the turdlet. \"Oh my, that was a big ass dumparoo.\" Suddenly, Poop entered the bathroom and busted down the stall door that Gene was in with his mobile battering ram. \"You rang?\" \"That's something Lurch always said on The Addams Family.\" Gene noticed. \"I know, I'm a huge fan of Zdeno Chára. Hey, what's that all over the ground?\" \"Oh I think I missed the bowl. That or the bowl overflowed. It was just an accident!\" Gene defended. Poop smiled. \"I know it was an accident, we all have accidents.\" Poop then left the B R. Alex and Addie had finished their sex roleplay, with it ending with them both in prison for air pollution. I think.. I'm in love.[Chapter 2] The day was done, and everyone left the texting building with the tinted glass windows that for some reason don't close all the way. The emojis flooded through the streets, which made it harder for Gene to accomplish his goal. His goal being to locate the poop emoji and share some small talk. After about thirty seconds of searching, Gene noticed Poop exit the rightmost doors and frolicked through the street. He stopped in front of the building to tie his shoe, and just as Gene was about to move to confront him, Jailbreak blocked his view of him. \"Geney baby! I've been looking for you. Let's go home together tonight.\" Jailbreak offered. Gene, although he enjoyed spending quality time with Jailbreak, he wanted to be with Poop at the moment, so he had to think of an excuse, and fast before Jailbreak got suspicious. \"I would, but I have to.. uh.. drop the Cosby kids off at the pool, if you know what I mean.\" Gene winked. \"Really? Thank you, Mr. Gene!\" The Cosby kids called out from behind Gene, thankful that somebody was taking them to the pool in the near future. Jailbreak was somewhat suspicious of his answer, given that it was nighttime and the town pool was surely closed, and would never allow young children to use the pool at this hour, supervised or unsupervised, especially if their supervision wasn't even related to them. She was about to flap her gums to question his answer when Hi-Five came up from behind excitedly. \"Jailbreak! The old grandma emoji is crossing the street again! Let's push her down and steal her groceries!\" \"Count me in! Have fun with your giant dump!\" Jailbreak and Hi-Five both said and ran off towards the lady. Gene then punts the Cosby kids away as if he were kicking a field goal in American football, sending them flying over seventy yards. Gene moves towards Poop slickly and casually. He clears his throat to catch the attention of Poop, who had been tying his shoe for the past two minutes straight. \"I just- uh- wanna congratulation you for your work today in the cube. It was impressive.\" Gene complimented. \"Just doing my duty!\" Poop said confidently in his British accent. The old grandma emoji could be heard all across the plaza, screaming and yelling in terror. \"Stoooop! Thieeeeeef!\" Jailbreak and Hi-Five run up to Gene and they all run towards their apartment to avoid the pursuit of the other emojis. Hi-Five was holding the grandma's groceries and Jailbreak was carrying her purse. \"Toodles, Gene.\" Poop called after him. I wonder if he's secretly Mickey Mouse. \"Let's go through these groceries!\" Hi-Five said excitedly when they returned to Gene's apartment in Downtown Browntown, a suburb in Textopolis a few blocks from the texting building. \"Yeah, I wanted to say it because it was my idea. You know, women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for.\" Jailbreak sifts through the groceries that Hi-Five had dumped onto Gene's counter. Gene watched because he had nothing better to do. In the grocery bags, there were laxatives, Golden Grahams (for making a BABOC), liver flavored treats, Flintstones vitamins, and a big tub of sauce. A giant picture of Poop was superimposed onto the laxative bottle, along with the words, 'Meet me sooner if you take these laxatives!' Gene thought, I hope to meet you sooner. \"I'm gonna go eat this sauce for dinner.\" \"Just the sauce?\" Jailbreak questioned. \"Yes!\" Hi-Five confirmed. \"Where's my BAB?\" \"Your big ass bowl? It's in the dishwasher.\" \"Thank you!\" Hi-Five disappeared into the kitchen, and Gene and Jailbreak say that they love each other and stuff and kiss and bleurghh. \"JAILBREAK!\" \"Whaddaya want, Fingers ?\" \"There's a speck on my spoon!\" Jailbreak, annoyed, goes to perform a speck check (or Inspecktion™ for short) on the spoonery. \"Just eat your sauce with a fork!\" Hi-Five could be heard praising her idea as Jailbreak loudly speck checked the silverware for Hi-Five. I think I want to be with Poop instead of Jailbreak.[Chapter 3] Gene, Jailbreak and Hi-Five were huddled around the third story window. Hi-Five was wearing a surgical mask and purple nursing gloves. He was very carefully holding a plastic spoon in his left hand with metal tweezers. The street below had many emojis going about their nights, most of them unaware that Hi-Five lurked above them precariously holding a plastic spoon. He eventually dropped the spoon on the crowd and watched as the pedestrians stepped on it many, many times. \"There! For the time being, I declare this residence speck free .\" Hi-Five happily announced. Gene raised the green flag, signalling that the specks have been banished. Jailbreak was annoyed that Hi-Five made them go through this procedure so often, but he said that the specks are evil and pledged his allegiance to Jane Kangaroo of the Jungle of Nool, whom he referred to as the Banisher of Specks. Jailbreak then looked at the floor to examine the mysterious brown stain on the carpet. When she did, Gene took out a Polaroid of Poop, and compared one against the other. After a few minutes of continuous looking, he mentally declared that Poop was more physically attractive. He put the Polaroid back in his back ass pocket just as the doorbell rang, causing Jailbreak to look up and Hi-Five to come out of the kitchen with his BABOS. Their custom doorbell of The Poop Song sounded for a while before Gene spoke up, which reminded Gene of his love. \"Whomst is at my door?\" Without being told to enter, Gene's parents, Mary and Mel Meh, entered the apartment. \"Gene, I thought I told you to change your doorbell.\" Gene's father spoke in his monotonous voice. \"Actually, I asked him to change the doorbell. You know, women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for.\" \"Both of you asked me to change it actually, I just didn't listen.\" \"Gene, you're still a malfunction just like the transmission generators from The Phantom Menace .\" \"Well I guess everyone's fine with it now.\" Gene retorted. \"Oh right. I'm gonna go hit myself with this frying pan now. Goodbye Gene.\" Gene's mother said as she stole a frying pan and left with her husband. The sound of a frying pan colliding with an emoji's head could be heard for several seconds as she walked down the hallway and down the stairwell. After thirty seconds of silence, Hi-Five spoke up. \"That was a strange interaction.\" Hi-Five finishes his bowl of sauce. \"Well, I better get back to my cavern.\" Hi-Five leaves Gene's apartment, thus leaving Gene and Jailbreak all alone with each other in his apartment. Gene puts on his apron and grabs his timber. He sets up his wood shop in his bedroom. \"I'm gonna go saw some wood, Jailbreak.\" \"Me too.\" The drinking bone's connected to the party bone... Gene awoke to his favorite song on his alarm clock. Gene got off the only mattress he could find that he could bury ones in, if you know what I mean. He scrubbed his chompers, as Oma would say, tinkled in the potty, and went to make his breakfast. He gobbled down some Bran Flakes™ that he found through advertising on Omegle. Gene was a frequenter of Omegle himself, especially on the fart and gas interests. He put a herd on his BABOBF and put his bowl in the sink. He put a special something at the bottom of the staircase for Jailbreak, who he calculated would awake at around this time. Bing bang, I saw the whole gang... Jailbreak awoke to her favorite song on her alarm. Jailbreak rolled off the mattress and landed on the floor with a loud thump. She stood up and transported herself to the water closet, where she scrubbed her teeth with bleach, dropped her morning poo, and rolled down the stairs. She landed at the bottom face first in a plate of nachos Gene had put at the bottom. The chips were pointy and the plate was hot! Jailbreak washed her face in the sink, silently swearing revenge on Gene. \"I'm going to a sew-in today, snookems.\" \"To deal with the conspiracy with the people trying to overthrow the government?\" \"Indeed.\" Jailbreak grabbed her black jumpsuit and put it on. \"Seeya later, nerd.\" With that, she left. With the free time Gene had, he decided to make a trip to the TCFFAP, or Textopolis Coordinate Furthest From A Potty. He stepped on the train to leave Downtown Browntown, and headed towards the TCFFAP, which had its own train station. The trains that come to this stop were required to have no bathroom to make sure it really is the TCFFAP. While at the last stop before Gene would get off, a certain someone stepped on the train. \"I like trains.\" The figure said. He yelled it at everyone for the entire 35 minute ride until Gene got off. Gene took a seat on the flaming sandpaper the attraction offered as seating. He stares at the TCFFAP, which was marked on the ground with a giant toilet sticker. Soon after arriving, he hears a voice behind him, addressing him. \"Good day, Gene.\" \"Oh, hi Poop. Fancy seeing you here at a coordinate like this.\" Gene replies to the pile of poo standing before him. \"It is, isn't it.\" Poop sits right next to Gene on the flaming sandpaper. \"You're so soft, Poop.\" \"Not too soft, I hope.\" Poop and Gene share the look. They share the look for a good while until a distracting presence approached from behind. \"Mr. Gene!\" \"The Cosby kids?\" \"Can you take us to the pool now?\" \"Oh uh, sure.\" Gene gets up from the flaming sandpaper. \"Well, I'd better drop the Cosby kids off at the pool, if you know what I mean.\" Gene smiles, turns away and approaches the Cosby kids. After a few moments, Poop's voice could be heard from behind all of them. \"I'll come with.\"[Chapter 4] Poop, having drove to the TCFFAP, hadn't parked far. He had parked in the rear, if you know what I'm saying. Gene, Poop, and the Cosby kids made their way to Poop's station wagon and boarded it when they were there. Poop drove like Miss Sharlene, all over the road like a maniac and sped down 25 mph zones at 52 mph. When they arrived at the pool, the Cosby kids got out and ran into the splash zone. Gene and Poop chose a seat on the benches outside the pools. \"Remember that time we saw each other in the Taco Bell bathroom?\" \"Oh, I remember, all right.\" \"I've never seen such a giant accident.\" \"Well, I'm glad you liked it.\" \"Wasn't the only thing I liked.\" \"W-what else did you like?\" Poop leaned over and gave a surprise kiss to Gene on his cheek, but not his facial ones. Gene gasped in surprise, and Poop gave a wink. The Cosby kids then approached the pair unexpectedly, asking to be taken home. \"You've only been in here for 90 seconds!\" Gene pointed out, surprised. \"They kicked us out for bringing our friend Nicky Deuce along too.\" Thus, they all climbed back into Poop's station wagon and were dropped off in the middle of Textopolis. The Cosby kids run off in a random direction, and Gene gets out of Poop's car as well. Poop writes down his phone number on an index card and hands it to Gene. \"Just gimme a buzzzzzzz.\" With that, Poop gets back in his station wagon and heads to central Browntown, where he was supposed to make an appearance soon. Gene navigated through Textopolis and to the texting building with the weird windows, down the main hall, into the former Favorites Club and down the spiral staircase into the Loser Lounge. Hi-Five was going to meet him in the Loser Lounge in about 15 minutes to meet the person who would give them 100% speck free silverware. Hi-Five was already there, playing Pong with the luggage emoji who stole his leftover Chinese food that one time. The only other person in the Loser Lounge was Donald Baker, who definitely belonged there. Donald Baker once won a game show called The Biggest Loser , which ironically is about losing weight, which Baker lost the least of. As a matter of fact, he gained weight over the course of the show, but the producers decided to give him the award anyways, because Donald Baker was indeed the biggest loser. \"Gene!\" Hi-Five gets up, allowing the luggage emoji to win the game of Pong. \"Hi-Five! Who's this person we're meeting?\" Just then, a figure appeared in the doorway. Their face and hair was covered entirely by a bonnet, hiding their identity. \"Are you the one with the 100% speck free silverware?\" The figure nodded. Hi-Five was about to hand over the payment when he spotted something on a fork. It was a speck. He jumps and yells dramatically. \"Is that a SPECK?\" Hi-Five points at the fork with the speck on it. \"Hi-Five, they all have specks! It's a trap!\" The bonnet then fell off the figure, revealing the salesman to be Oma. Hi-Five and Gene run out of the Loser Lounge and up the spiral staircase, leaving Oma and her speck covered instruments behind in the Loser Lounge. They stop in the plaza in front of the texting building, looking on into the city. \"I'm going on a very important mission, Gene. I will see you soon.\" Hi-Five leaves Gene in the plaza and heads east. Gene travels into the city and into the store, which is named The Store. When he enters the store, he notices Jailbreak making a castle out of the toilet paper, and was sitting on the top of it. She spots Gene almost immediately and slides down. \"Gene! My sewing circle finished.\" \"We should buy this toilet paper.\" \"Yeah, I wanted to say it because it was my idea. You know, women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for.\" They make a purchase and go back to the apartment. ","Summary":" I just wanna feel this moment..

Emojis. - Gene, The Emoji Movie If only i have seen it all the way through Textopolis, i would have saw that rounded building which is a circle shaped stadium. But it was not any other stadium, it was a place where this leads to their cubes. The cubes are the way to make the emojis appear on the phone through the text message, so they can either impress someone with one unique emoji... Gene. Gene was one of the first emojis that can do multiple expressions instead of one, but before he became a hero, he was called as a \"malfunction\" by a smiling emoji, Smiler. His regular job was being a \"meh\" emoji, but when he messed up in a accident at the Textopolis building, he was in trouble, like a fugitive. But when he became a meh after a help from Jailbreak and Hi-5. He, Jailbreak, Hi-5, and everyone realized that Gene can be anything he want to impress the owner Alex's girlfriend. So, in a miracle, he saved everyone and everything inside the phone itself. He became the very first multi expression emoji in Alex's phone. Now, a couple of years after that, it is going to be a surprise for him. Here is Gene's story. As Gene was still working at the Textopolis building, he was hailed as the new popular emoji as his portrait was shown at the hallway of the Textopolis meeting room. Gene was at his home, with his parents Mel Meh and Mary Meh still impressed with Gene for his heroic fame and approval of being the very first \"multi expressive\" emoji. Gene was resting in his room as the sun starts to set into the night at Textopolis, right after the very successful job he had worked into, his blood, sweat and tears that worked into his great and caring job. Out of nowhere, his face chat wristwatch was ringing and he realized it was Jailbreak, trying to call him. Apparently, he had received the wristwatch as a gift from Jailbreak after his first week working at Textopolis. \" Hi, Jailbreak. What are you doing today? \" \" I am preparing you a surprise party at the Textopolis stadium. \" \" Wow, that is great. I also had a pretty good day of my job too as well. \" \" I know that, you were doing great at there. I am proud of you. \" \" Thank you, i will see you there when it is ready. \" \" Alright, i will also see you too. Bye. \" Gene felt so happy in his whole life as he realized that there is a party at the stadium. Mel knocked the door and in a expected surprise, he opened the door in a his proudness expression. \" Gene, i have good news for you. \" \" Yes, i know that one. Jailbreak is preparing a surprise party at the Textopolis stadium. \" \" That is the good news i was going to tell you as well. \" \" Exactly, are you also going with Mary Mel as well? Because i was thinking that if she is coming with you too. \" \" You bet. I'll really be proud of you. \" \" Do you think that we should go to a special place before we are ready? \" \" That is a good idea. But how? \" \" Well, Jailbreak will notify me when it is ready. \" \" Thank goodness. \" And this is how the adventure begins... for my surprise party. I hope i see Jailbreak (Also known as Princess Linda) and the others in the Textopolis stadium. TO BE CONTINUED TO... PART II: THE SPECIAL PARTY AT THE CITY...[Chapter 2] GENE'S SURPRISE PARTY PART II: THE SPECIAL PARTY AT THE CITY As Gene got ready with his parents, Mel and Mary Meh, to go out in order to visit a very special place, there was a sudden burst of cheers and parades made for Gene as a celebration. Gene was surprised when he saw thousands of emojis cheering for him like if it was some kind of a party for either a prince or a princess. Steven started to ask Gene as they stood in front of the door. \" Excuse me, Gene. Where are you and your parents going to before the party? \" \" I think we might go to some place to visit before we get to the stadium. \" \" That is a good idea. Wow! Gene always get pretty good ideas. \" \" Well, should we get to the Textopolis stadium before the party starts, Mel? \" \" Of course, but what room should we go to visit? \" \" Is the Loser Lounge a good place to visit, because i have been there before with my best friend, Hi-5. I really like to know that? \" \" Yes, you can actually visit the Loser Lounge. \" \" Thank you all, we will see you when the party starts. \" So, they started taking a long walk towards the Textopolis stadium as the night started to begin the celebration. The music, the emojis that worked hard into the parades, and the big balloons that filled up the streets of Textopolis, it felt like it was the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade in New York, but with emojis and the celebration centers on the one year anniversary of Gene's job of being the very first multi-expression emoji. Gene and his parents were enjoying the celebration in the streets as they were almost close to the building, and they are also enjoying the lives of each other and Gene himself. Gene couldn't been so happy in his whole life until now. As they were at the front doors of the Textopolis stadium, they pushed the doors open and entered. Jailbreak (or Princess Linda) was still working at the party and decided to see Gene and his parents as the party was in the working stage at the center of the building. Jailbreak was happy when they saw Gene, Mel and Mary coming in to visit the Loser Lounge. \" What are you doing here, are you going to a special place? \" \" Of course, i would like for me and my parents to visit the Loser Lounge. \" \" No problem, you can go there before the time is right to start to party with surprises that you will love. Trust me, you will adore it. \" \" Alright. See you then, Jailbreak. \" So they started to enter the Loser Lounge, which is a place where the emojis that were no longer popular or used worked and stayed there. This is where Hi-5 used to be in, as he used to be the least popular emoji until the adventure with Gene and Jailbreak that let him back into the cubes with the other emojis. This is also where Smiler is at. Before she was in the Loser Lounge, she was the supervisor of the Textopolis stadium as she was the very first emoji. But then, she was going to erase Gene for being called a malfunction after the incident when Gene started making other faces other than the \"Meh\" emoji. She sent out her bots to get Gene and delete him, but with his friends, they stopped her plan and she was sent to the Loser Lounge. So, as they entered it, it looked the same as it did when Hi-5 showed Gene the place. It has the same design of the room with some of the emojis playing Go Fish, the others play a game that is Pong, the very first arcade game that was made by Atari, and the others probably danced because there is a disco ball emoji on the roof of the place. But the new addition of the place is a new hallway in case of emojis want to have a room to visit, so Gene, Mel and Mary was the first ones to go in there. As they entered the hallways in the Loser Lounge's new rooms, it reminded him of the hotel rooms from the 1980 Stanley Kubrick film, The Shining. In fact, it does look like the same rooms and hallways as it was when one of the emojis watched it in the darkness as a challenge for the emojis to watch a scary film in the dark, just for giggles. \" Excuse me for a second, Mom and Dad. Can i take a little tour of these hallways? \" \" Sure you can, Gene. But make sure you're back before the party starts. \" Gene starts to walk into the hallways, then into one of the rooms with a fireplace and a typewriter. Gene thought it was strange because he never saw a typewriter before. He started going downstairs to go close to the typewriter and he saw some words on a piece of paper. It reads \" NO EMOJIS AND NO FRIENDS MAKES JACK GO CRAZY \", it actually repeats on the same sheet of paper as Gene started to pull out every single sheet of paper out of the typewriter. Suddenly out of nowhere, a voice spoke out of the darkness. TO BE CONTINUED IN... PART III... THE FLIGHT OF THE KILLER[Chapter 3] GENE'S SURPRISE PARTY PART III: THE FLIGHT OF THE KILLER As the voice spoke out of nowhere, Gene was scared big time as he had never been scared since he was chased by the AV bots, sent by Smiler. Gene started to talk to the person in the shadows, as he is felling fear in himself, which he changed his expression to a scared one. \"Who is it! Show yourself, please!\" Then suddenly, a person started to come out of the shadows. His name is Jack Torrance, the same person that chased Wendy in The Shining. He had either black or brown on him, a little beard, and typical clothing. To Gene himself, he had never been so terrified in his life ever since his adventure with his friends. Jack started to talk in the same creepy tone. \"Well, No emojis and no friends... makes... Jack go... crazy...\" \"I do not want to fall for that, never!\" \"DON'T MIND IF I DO!\" Jack started to go crazy, as he started to make crazy noises like Homer Simpson and moving like a psychopath. \"A-BLAH A-BLAH A-BLAH A-BLAH! I will get you! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Gene grabbed a baseball bat, and started to wave it against Jack as he started to walk away from him. \"I warn you, i will hit you with this baseball bat, and you will be sorry!\" Jack started to feel sarcastic tones inside of himself. \"Good, if you do that, i will be back and i will chase you with my axe! How would you love that! Huh! HHOOWW WWOOUULLDD YYOOUU LLOOVVEE TTHHAAAAAATTT!\" Gene started frantically going upstairs, as he holds the baseball bat at the same time. He started to wave the bat faster and harder. \"I will get my loving axe into your soul! I will boil you and finally cook you up! Like a lobster! MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" But, as Jack finished talking, Gene smashed Jack on the face with the baseball bat. Jack started falling down onto the ground, feeling like he had been dreaming in his whole life. \"Good, i will hide and he won't get me again. Stay down, you sucker!\" Then, Gene started to run back into another room and entered the bathroom. There, he started locking the door and grabbed his emoji knife with him in case Jack comes back. Jack, was still on the floor as Gene was running to the bathroom. Suddenly, Jack woke up with a bang and he immediately started to go bonkers as he grabbed his axe. \"HUHUHAHAHA! This emoji will love my awesome power of this axe! He will indeed! HAHAHAHAHAHA!\" He started walking upstairs and into the hallways as he holds his axe in one hand. In the bathroom, Gene was relieved as he rested for a couple of seconds. He started saying this: \"Phew, thank god! I have gotten away from that psychopath who tried to go crazy-\" \"I heard it, emoji! I am coming for you!\" Jack was hearing Gene, which was coming from the bathroom in the room. \"YAAAH! He found me again! Can this get any more creepy than this!\" Jack was coming in the room, and faced the bathroom. Then, he started to knock the door with his fingers. \"Little emojis, little emojis, Let me come in...\" Gene started to feel fear even more as Jack was saying those words. \"Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin...\" \"Oh, no. Please sir-\" \"Then i'll huff...\" \"Come on, please don't kill me-\" \"Then i'll puff...\" \"No, for the love of emojis!\" \"Then i'll blow the house in!\" \"NOOO!\" Then, Jack started smashing the front bathroom door with his axe as Gene started screaming bloody murder, either in front of his parents or his friends. \"NOO! PLEASE STOP THIS MADNESS! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!\" Then as Jack finally smashed the other part of the door, he placed his face in the destroyed hole on the door and yelled out his famous lines. \"Heeeeeeere's JOHNNY!\" Gene grabs his emoji knife, just as Jack started to grab the door knob inside the room. \"Take this, you psychopath!\" Gene slashed his knife on Jack's hand, as he started howling in pain. \"I'm getting out of this place!\" Gene unlocked the door and opened it, busting and throwing Jack into the bed as Gene started dashing out of the hallways. His mother, Mary, saw Gene running out of the hallways, as she started to talk. \"Gene, where you going?\" \"I'm getting out of this crazy hallway!\" \"Wait, the party is not started yet!\" \"Take me to our room then, mom.\" \"Alright, my sweetie.\" Then, Gene started to enter his room in fear. He started to see through his windows, it was a beautiful night with many parades stormed through the streets of Textopolis. \"I can't believe i was chased by that psychopath, with a axe! He almost killed me!\" Mel started to talk to Gene. \"Really, Gene. I don't know what your talking about?\" \"That psychopath, it was Jack. He was going crazy and he was breaking the bathroom door in that other room with his axe, and almost threatened me big time!\" Gene started to breathe frantaclly as he was still scared, but his parents calmed him down slowly. \"But, that won't ruin my surprise party. It was almost a chase, big time!\" Then, a beep suddenly popped out of his wristwatch. \"It must be Jailbreak!\" As he started answering, Jailbreak came on the screen and talked to Gene. \"Okay, Gene. The party is ready. Now, you and your parents can come now.\" TO BE CONTINUED... IN PART 4... THE PARTY HAS STARTED...[Chapter 4] GENE'S SURPRISE PARTY PART 4: THE PARTY HAS STARTED As Jailbreak has announced to Gene that the party is ready, His parents and Gene himself started to get ready to go out of the room and into the Textopolis text room. This was a huge sign of relief, after Gene's experience of being chased by Jack Torrance. Mel was very surprised about Jailbreak's announcement and started to follow Gene as well. \"This is going to be a big blast.\" \"Totally, Dad.\" \"Oh... My sweetie is going to a surprise party with us. This is going to be wonederful.\" So they got out of the hallway and into the Loser Lounge place, where they saw Smiler (who she still has her braces, after she broke her tooth since the bot fell on her). Smiler started to talk in her teeth braces. \"What are you doing, malfunction?\" \"We are going to my surprise party at the Text place.\" \"Oh, that is indeed surprising.\" \"Of course.\" \"Well, see you then if you come back here.\" \"Alright, then.\" Gene, Mel, and Mary started to go out of the Loser Lounge and finally, the colorful lights are showing up as if there had been fireworks before, while the party was in the works. \"Thank goodness you're here, Gene.\" \"You did all this for me. They are pretty nice colours.\" \"Of course, Gene. You love colors, so we made the place lit up with colors.\" \"Oh, i love you, Jailbreak!\" \"I love you too, Gene!\" So, they and Jailbreak started to enter into the Text place. The place was entirely pitch black, and it really made Gene and his parents hard to see in the darkness. They also got bumped in some places, because it was too dark. \"Here is your seat, Gene.\" \"That is pretty nice that you put a seat for my party.\" \"Thank you, you are going to love it. Enjoy.\" As she left, the light started to grow on the huge screen as Gene started the see the brightness. Then, the tunnel of lights started to zoom in, as the colorful images flashed in his eyes. At first, Gene thought he was hallucinating when he started to see the tunnel, it was like he was dreaming in full speed ahead. \"The world of the smartphone all started with the big bang... The invention was started with companies like Google, and Apple.\" He started seeing images of Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, the IPhone, the Android devices, and other apps that he really reconigized since his adventure. \"Then, the most inventive communication that has came to phones is emojis.\" Gene started feeling very emotional, full of laughing, crying, and happy feelings all filled up Gene's body with honorness. \"The emojis were invented in Japan, back in 1999, when Shigetaka Kurita was inspired by weather icons, manga that showed stock icons, and lightbulb signifying inspiration. Thus, he created the first 180 emojis out of expressions and other icons. This includes faces, hearts, animals, building, and human emojis.\" Gene was really satisfied with the information on how they (including Gene himself) were created. \"But this changed when one emoji has more than one expression. This emoji saved our town and the phone from deletion. And this emoji is becoming the most used and popular emoji in the phone. This emoji is Gene.\" Gene was shocked when the announcer said his name in the presentation, he started to fell like he was going to be honoured. \"Gene became the hero of Textopolis, saving the phone with one emoji to this phone's owner, Alex. This emoji really impressed Addy, Alex's girlfriend and started a relationship with each other.\" Gene started to cry tears, because he was touched by the honor that the presentation has given. \"We have honoured Gene as the Hero that saved Textopolis, and for a good reason. I love Gene, he was the one who really made me the princess that i am today. Gene, we will greet you with the biggest surprise of your live.\" Gene realized that it was Jailbreak saying that she loves him. It was true, he was loved by all emojis, including his married princess, Jailbreak. Then, the screen went dark and the lights went up unexpectedly. Gene was still in tears as he felt the warmness in his soul. The emojis went up and cheered Gene as the surprise party has just started. \"I always believed in you, Gene.\" Mel gives Gene a big and warming hug, and Mary kissed him in the cheek. \"You did this for me, everyone. I have never felt so honoured and so emotional in my whole life.\" Gene was emotionally happy as everyone cheered for him, especially Jailbreak. \"Jailbreak, this is the best surprise party that you have ever made.\" Jailbreak was warmed and gives Gene a hug and a kiss. \"Of course, we will always love you forever. You are the hero and the most popular emoji, since the poop emoji.\" Poop started to talk to Gene. \"Gene, you are the very best. If the owner of this phone came in, he would be so proud of you.\" \"Thank you, Poop.\" Unexpectedly, Hi-5 came in and started to hug Gene happily. \"Gene, you are my best friend and you will always be. Give me a high five.\" As Gene heard it, Gene gives Hi-5 a big and amazing high five and to Jailbreak as well. \"Well, what are we waiting for, let the party get started!\" The party erupted in awesomeness, and every emoji started to do Gene's famous dance move, The Emoji Pop. As the party started, Gene starts to dance in joy as the party grows wilder. Gene will always remember the memory as the \"best night of his life\". All was well.

I grew up in a small town along with my parents and my older brother. They hated me, I grew up lonely, but one day everything disappeared. Before my father met Mrs. Trunchbull, school was something I always wished for. One day, my father came in my room and told me I was going to school. I felt excited, and up to this day, I still remember the butterflies inside my stomach when I walked in the first day of school. Well, life wasn't amazing either; Mrs. Trunchball was cruel and unfair. The students were traumatized, but when I met Ms. Honey, everything changed. Ms. Honey is the person I call my mother now. When I was just a child, I discovered that I had magical powers. No one believed me, but somehow I never gave up. My father had a car shop; he sold cars with used parts, and, made tons of money out of it. I tried to stop him, but as always his phrase, \"I'm big, you're small,\" I was basically tired of it. I hated my life, but when I got to school, everything changed. I had friends, I wasn't lonely. Through various adventures, I got to know my teacher. We shared so many interests, and one of them was reading. I had a passion for reading, and so did my teacher, of course, she's a teacher. My teacher soon found out that my family was in problems. I figured that out, but I wouldn't tell anyone knowing that my family was in danger, after all, I did love them, they were my family, and they give me a home. One day, my teacher invited me to her house. We were eating cookies, and we hear a siren from the distance. I saw my family inside the car coming towards the house. I knew we were in trouble, and I certainly knew why. My father jumped out of the car. \"Let's go Matilda. Come on hurry up, they're after us.\" 'No. I don't want to go\" I really didn't want to go. The police was lost by then, but I still knew that my family wasn't getting anywhere. My teacher begged my parents to comprehend. As weird as it sounds, my teacher adopted me.[Chapter 2] February 25. Many probably wonder why in the world I would want my teacher to adopt me. But there are so many qualities Ms. Honey has that makes me love her more each day. And back when I was smaller I really wanted to be cared for, I wanted to know what it was like to be loved by a mother, I wanted to feel that someone understood everything I was going through , but most importantly I wanted someone to share my love for reading with. I remember the first months like it was just yesterday, now that I'm fourteen my bond with my mother has grown even more. But the first few months were magical. School was amazing and so was home. I wasn't used to being given so much attention but now that I have a mother that deeply cares for me I learned that attention is something people give to each other when they deeply care about one another. I remember those days clearly, from school I'd go home and every afternoon was different and magical. It was nothing like I had known it before and I also began to practice my magic more. Every afternoon we'd read together and up to today that's something we still do today. Now that I'm older, and no longer in elementary school things have changed of course. I'm a freshmen in high school and my mother is the principal of an elementary school that was once run by her cruel ant. I have magical powers and no one but my mother and best friend Lavender know. Lavender and I have been friends since elementary school. Ever since My mothers aunt was the principal of the school. We've grown up together, and we do everything together. In one sentence, there's nothing that can break up apart. ","Summary":" Chapter One My name is Matilda.

So Matilda will always be on my list of favorite childhood books and movies. It was sort of a spur of the moment idea for Matilda and Bruce to be together, but while watching the movie again one day, I thought: How cute would it be to have them grow up together to have feelings for each other? Now there is an age shift. Bruce is supposed to be older than Matilda, but in this fanfic, they are both 16. Also in this fanfic, I made Crunchem Hall a town and not just a school system- Miss Honey and Matilda move to the area just in case Miss Trunchbull were to return. There will be chapters, and I also want you to let me know what I can improve on, and whether or not I should continue the story as a series, or leave it as a oneshot. Thanks, and enjoy! :) - Ah, the first day of summer break. Crunchem Hall was beautiful all year round, but the sun shined just a bit brighter, and the flowers bloomed just a bit quicker this time of year. Matilda stepped outside of her house to take in the fresh summer air. It was quite hot, yes, but there was a breeze that seemed to be sent from heaven that washed around her. Matilda couldn't help but smile at this current moment. She may have looked a bit silly, but really, what was there to be sad or angry about? In that moment, a walk was on her mind. Matilda stuck only her head in the door and yelled somewhat loudly, \"Miss Honey, I'm taking a walk!\" She then heard her voice echo back in her house- \"Okay, Matilda! That's fine!\" Matilda shut the door behind her and continued to walk down her sidewalk. On her way to really nowhere at all, she collected all of her thoughts about the ended school year, her sophomore year. Of course, this meant she would soon be taking the SAT's, so Matilda also began to memorize problems from Geometry and facts from Biology, both were of course honors level. Deep inside her mind, however, she knew that she would be able to remember them as soon as the questions appeared in front of her, but Matilda did not want to seem arrogant or conceited. Suddenly, as she was walking past someone else, their shoulders hit into each other. Matilda instantly clutched at hers and the person stopped and turned back. \"Are you okay?\" He asked. She looked up into the deepest green eyes she'd seen, and his dark hair slightly moving with the breeze. The other walker was none other than Bruce Bogtrotter, who she'd been friends with since Kindergarten. Bruce again broke the silence. \"Hi, Matilda.\" She couldn't help but smile as he did, and finally replied, \"Hi, Bruce. Sorry about that, I just had a lot on my mind.\" Bruce somewhat laughed and had an understanding face. \"It's really no big deal. I realize that our junior year is very important, what with the big tests coming up and all.\" Matilda nodded, but he spoke again. \"Hey, if it isn't too much to ask... can I walk with you?\" She smiled again and accepted Bruce's request. And soon enough, they were walking on the sidewalk near Bruce's neighborhood, which is also where her best friend Lavender lived, side by side. Matilda asked with sincerity, \"So, were you taking a walk, too?\" Bruce nodded and said, \"Yeah, I just wanted to enjoy the first day of summer break without doing any swimming or going on any vacations, you know?\" Matilda sort of laughed before what she said. \"So no chlorine or saltwater just yet. Gotcha.\" They both laughed at that. The two walked the neighborhoods and streets of Crunchem Hall, talking about their plans for this summer, laughing and enjoying each other's company. But later on in the walk, something caught Matilda's eye. On various occasions, she'd notice Bruce's hand move close to hers- and not in a swinging motion. More like an 'about-to-hold-hands' motion. Every time it would happen, it would confuse her. What was she to do? Take his hand? Ask him about it? Finally, she decided that she would pretend like she didn't see his hand. It seemed almost rude, but at the same time, Matilda didn't know what else to think. After a few more blocks, they finally arrived at Matilda's house. \"Well, I guess this is where I leave you. See you around, Matilda.\" Bruce said while smiling. Matilda said, \"See you, Bruce. This was nice. Maybe we can do it again tomorrow?\" \"I agree. Meet me near my house. Oh, and tell Miss Honey I said hi!\" Was his last words before leaving her sight. Matilda walked down her driveway and looked back at Bruce. For an odd reason, she suddenly felt a feeling of longing, as if she wanted him to come back. Matilda finally shook it off and opened the front door. \"I'm home!\" She called out as Miss Honey approached her near the foyer. \"How was your walk?\" Miss Honey asked, delighted to see her adopted daughter already enjoying her summer break. Matilda replied, \"It was nice. Beautiful day to take a walk.\" But to Miss Honey, even her tone seemed to stick out, which was somewhat abnormal. \"Matilda, you're blushing!\" She said, to which Matilda replied, \"Am I? Sorry...\" They laughed, which brought a silence afterwards. Matilda wanted to tell Miss Honey about walking with Bruce, but Miss Honey would probably take it as a 'you like him' sort of thing, and not as two friends going for a walk. But the conclusion was made- Matilda was going to tell Miss Honey. After all, she'd been confiding in her since she was six. \"Oh, so I ran into Bruce on my walk. Literally, my shoulder suffered a bit, but he apologized, and... we wound up walking together.\" Miss Honey smiled and said, \"Well, that was nice of him. Is your shoulder fine now?\" Matilda nodded while Miss Honey continued. \"What did you two talk about?\" Matilda explained to her about how Bruce wanted to start off his summer slowly, while Matilda talked to him about the upcoming year. \"It all sounds lovely. Just so you know, I'll be making lunch soon.\" Miss Honey said, and walked back into the kitchen while Matilda walked to the living room near the staircase, where she was greeted by her latest book. That night, she dreamt, and was it ever vivid. Matilda was at a dance, with her hair in curls, a sparkly ribbon atop her head, all while wearing a beautiful silver dress. She walked through the crowd as it parted like the Red Sea, her heels clicking against the marble floor. Matilda was then greeted by Bruce, who wore a sleek black suit. He held out his hand and said, \"Care to dance?\" She took Bruce's hand and they glided across the dance room floor. Matilda heard the whispers of the crowd- how 'perfect they are' and that 'they were the most notable couple at the dance.' This made both of them smile. 9:30 AM. Matilda woke up from what seemed like the middle of that dream. She walked to her mirror as she prepared for the day. Throughout putting on her outfit and even tying her ribbon in her hair, Matilda could not shake the dream she had. It clicked somewhere in her mind- Did she really have feelings for Bruce? She somewhat flirted with the idea, and thought back to any signs that Bruce may have liked her. No, not exactly; but as Matilda thought more, there were a lot of possible signs that she liked him. Even back to when she was the first one to cheer for Bruce as he ate the cake, that could have been a sign to some. But that didn't mean anything- she had faith in him. She knew he could make it. Matilda finally brushed it off and walked downstairs. As her and Miss Honey sat down for breakfast, Matilda decided to ask Miss Honey about her situation. \"Miss Honey, I have a question. How would you know if you had feelings for someone? Say, a close friend?\" Miss Honey glanced towards the window with a thoughtful look. \"Hmm, it sounds like a tough spot. Well, Matilda, I've never dated, even spoke of a crush. Aunt Trunchbull never allowed even a glance towards other boys as we went somewhere. She just would never allow it. But I think I can give you this piece of advice: If someone thinks about that person a lot... imagines them as a couple frequently... it's possible that these are signs of a deeper emotion.\" She explained, then continued back to her breakfast. Matilda nodded and said, \"Thanks.\" After they were done, Miss Honey looked up at her curiously. \"Any particular reason as to why you want to know?\" After a continued silence, Matilda put her plate in the sink, looked at Miss Honey and replied, \"I think I might like Bruce.\" Miss Honey's eyebrows raised. \"You mean... Bogtrotter?\" Matilda nodded. A smile formed across Miss Honey's face and she said, \"You know, I always thought you and Bruce had a specific rapport. Like when you two would always read Science books aloud together back in elementary school, I thought it was the sweetest thing.\" Matilda smiled and looked down at the floor. It was true- every morning before school started, Bruce picked up a Science book and they'd discover new things while their other friends listened in fascination. After breakfast, Matilda headed outside for her second walk with Bruce. Telling Miss Honey about her feelings was like a weight being lifted off of her shoulders. But what next? She couldn't just come out and confess it out of nowhere. There needed to be a time and place.[Chapter 2] The only sounds outside were Matilda's flip flops and her thoughts. She decided that whatever happened between her and Bruce would not affect her negitavely. The two have been friends for a long time, so why not stay that way? But at the same time, Matilda knew she'd been having second thoughts about that for months. Just as she turned the corner to Bruce and Lavender's neighborhood, he had just closed the door behind him. Matilda ran up to Bruce's house as he greeted her. \"Hey, Matilda! I was thinking we'd do something different today.\" \"Yeah? What's that?\" She asked, suddenly more excited. Bruce continued, \"Well, I know how you love reading, so I thought we could hang out at the library. Does that sound okay?\" Matilda nodded and said, \"I'd like that, thank you.\" On the beginning of the walk to the library, there was a silence. Not just any silence, but it felt... strange. As if there was something going on. Matilda decided to break the ice. \"So, are there any books you're thinking of checking out?\" \"Actually, I have a whole list in my pocket.\" Bruce said with a laugh as he pulled out a folded-up piece of notebook paper. With some shock, Matilda laughed along with him. He then showed her the paper, along with side notes as to why Bruce wanted to read that particular book. Matilda said, \"I noticed one of your choices is The Secret Garden. It really is a great book.\" Bruce said in reply with some curiosity, \"Really? When did you read it?\" She looked down and laughed a little. \"You're not going to believe me.\" Bruce smiled and replied, \"Matilda, I'd probably believe you if you said you read Great Expectations when you were 4.\" She folded her lips and was quiet for a moment. \"That's... because I did... and I also read The Secret Garden around the same time.\" Bruce nodded. \"Either way, I'm not surprised. Remember those Science books we used to read? I always thought you were one of the best readers ever.\" The two friends eventually got to the library. Matilda again smiled and said, \"Really? That's really kind of you. Miss Honey always told me I was very precocious.\" \"I agree with that statement.\" Bruce said. They eventually split into different sections of the seemingly never-ending library. Matilda walked the aisles of the Classics section, trying to pick out books she hadn't read yet, which was of course very difficult. Bruce was on a certain side of the library in search of his excellent, advanced book choices. Hey guys! Sorry I haven't updated this chapter, but I've been having a severe case of writer's block, haha! But hopefully, I'll have new ideas either this Friday or sometime over the weekend.

King: \"What a beautiful day in my castle.\" Queen: \"But nothing is more beautiful than your own wife.\" King: \"How's my daughter doing.\" Queen: \"I told her to come as soon as possible.\" Zachary: \"Mommy, is Linda coming?\" Queen: \"Don't worry, your big sister will come.\" Carla: \"I can't wait until she arrives!\" Julia: \"I'm so excited for Linda to come home.\" Aiden: \"It's been a long time we've seen her.\" Troy: \"Yeah, she better come home.\" Now onto the next scene with JailBreak/Princess Linda. She got off the bus and she arrived at the entrance of kingdom. JailBreak: *breathes deeply* \"Finally I'm home.\" While she was walking, all the people didn't even recognize her, cause of her outfit and she hasn't been to her home in a long time. Everyone was just staring at her knowing if she was a stranger. Just then 2 guards confronted her. JailBreak: \"Hello, fellow people.\" Guards: *both in unison* \"Just who exactly are you?!\" JailBreak: \"I'm just here to see the king and queen.\" Left Guard: \"I'm sorry, but we can't allow strangers.\" JailBreak: \"But I'm not a stranger.\" Left Guard: \"Judging by the way you're dressed, definitely means you're a stranger.\" Then JailBreak looked down at herself on the way how she dressed. Right Guard: \"We ask you to leave immediately.\" Just then a limo arrived, and Gene and Hi-5 came out. Gene: \"We're finally here.\" Hi-5: \"Looks so majestic.\" Gene: \"Hey something's happening over there.\" Hi-5 \"It's JailBreak!\" Gene and Hi-5: \"JailBreak!\" then JailBreak turned around to see her friends. JailBreak: \"Gene, Hi-5!\" and they high fived each other. Right Guard: \"Looks like you brought some friends.\" Gene: \"JailBreak, what's going on?\" Left Guard: \"I'm sorry, but your friend can't cross this line.\" Hi-5 \"But she lives here.\" Right Guard: *sarcastically* \"Yeah right.\" Gene: \"It's true.\" Left Guard: \"If it is true, who are your parents?\" JailBreak: \"The King and Queen.\" Right Guard: \"You're not a princess.\" Hi-5: \"But she is a...\" Both Guards: \"Leave immediately!\" The guards were pushing them back out of the entrance. Before they were almost out, JailBreak has to show her true self. Then she took off her beanie. The guards were blinded by the tiara shining. Right Guard: \"I can't believe my eyes.\" Left Guard: \"You're a princess?!\" JailBreak: \"My name is Linda.\" The guards were surprised by her name. Even Gene and Hi-5. Both Guards: \"You're Princess Linda?!\" Hi-5: \"Your name is Linda?!\" JailBreak/Princess Linda: \"Yes, my name is Linda.\" Then Gene remembered what his dad told him. Gene: *whispers* \"So she really does have a name.\" \"Linda is a pretty name.\" Guards: \"We are so sorry for the huge, big misunderstanding.\" JailBreak/Princess Linda: \"Apology accepted.\" Gene: \"So can we see her family.\" Guards: \"Of course, you may proceed.\" Then they were walking to her castle. Gene was looking at JailBreak with a small grin. JailBreak gave him a smile back, then Gene used his blushing expression. That's it for tonight's chapter 2, I hope you had fun reading this.

A mid august summer night it was in the 70's outside I had been getting threats eariler that year from a guy saying he was going to rape me things got somewhat scary for me he was removed from all of my classes due to the threats I had managed to keep it from my mom though. I had thought he had backed off because I hadn't heard from him in a while but that morning around 2:30 in the morning I was walking past a park when all of a sudden I see him!. He pulls me down on the ground and I can't seem to fight him off could it be the cigarettes? I lie there trying to scream but he covers my mouth taking off my shorts and my underwear. I was raped at least it was less than 30 minutes I suppose but I was scared out of m mind I got up after he left in pain putting back on my clothes walking the rest of the way home. My legs hurt my thighs were bruised a little I cried most of the way trying to be quiet I was afraid of what would happen if my mom find out what had happened. I walked up the front steps quietly opening the front door I closed it locking it behind myself tip-toing up stairs to my bed I guess she was asleep I reached my room shutting my bedroom door quietly. I crawled into bed trying to adjust to the pain was this my fault? I shouldn't have snuck out of the house smoking half a pack of cigarettes was not worth being forced into that , I was hungry but I didn't want to eat. After a while of lying in bed crying I pulled my throw over my bruised body and closed my eyes trying to go to sleep my thoughts faded but when I woke up I had been having nightmares most of the time I was asleep. It was 10am I had slept in I walked to the bathroom wobbling slightly from the pain I sat down on the toilet clenching my fist I flushed it washing my hands. Splashing cold water on my face I looked at myself in the mirror I looked pale dark circles under my eyes I ran a hairbrush through my hair so it didn't look so messy then I went back to my room to change my clothes. I put on a loose short sleeve shirt that was a bit shorter than mid thigh I changed my bra and my underpants but this time I didn't put shorts on under my shirt left a lot of my shoulders exposed and my bra but after what happened last night I don't care about how much my clothes cover. Right now part of me feels like I should walk out of my room like this exposed and walk downstairs not to eat breakfast but to make a statement that I'm struggling mentally, I don't put on any makeup I leave my face the way it is maybe she won't notice the bruises. I walked downstairs slowly shaking slightly trying to hide the fact that I was crying then I walk towards my mom quietly I sit down on the couch shes doing paperwork tears fall off my face. My smallish limp body trembling slightly sat their in silence not moving after half a minute she looks up seeming rather startled by me a tear slipped off my face. \"You startled me matilda, do you want breakfast?\" she looks at me for the first time this morning I see a sort of slightly shocked concerned look form on her face \"No, thank you but I'm not hungry\" I say with a sort of dazed numb scared depressed expression on my face. A wave of dizziness hits me I start to fall off the couch she catches me \"Are you okay?\" she stares at my body realizing how bruised up I am \"What happened to you?\" she says looking into my eyes. \"I'm afraid that if I tell you what happened you'll beat me\" I whisper looking away \"Matilda no matter what happened I'm not going to hurt you\" she says, In a sense it might of been easier to explain this to Zinnia she probably wouldn't of cared would of just beat me. You were adopted Matilda be grateful you have someone now a mother that really loves you that cares because your family didnt care much about you at all if they did thats why Jenny is your family now don't take that back and wish she wasn't not for one second. I love her but what if this guy comes after me again I to be a burden to her but at the same time I'm only 12 I felt distraught apparently to the point where I had used my powers without even being aware of it because theirs a sharp blade hovering on my wrist. \"Matilda don't do that please\" she takes it tossing it away from me pulling me into her arms I cry \"I'm sorry I don't want to be a burden\" I say. \"I adopted you its my job to take care of you, sweetie its obvious someone hurt you\" She says I don't know quite why I can't seem to bring myself to tell her what happened I mean sure she'd be ticked I snuck out but she'd be more concerned with the rape. Theres a lot on my mind I'm not sure if I should tell her what happened yet in a sense dealing with being physically abused might be less difficult for me to handle than my mom actually caring about me and loving me but she's not the kind of person to hurt me. I flash back to my dad abusing me, a lot of the things he did we're horrible I hadn't told my mom about some of it I hadn't told anyone partially because he had threatened me. Shuttering at the thought of it I let go of her crying she tries to pull back into a hug but I run away from her fast as I can, the fear of being beat finding its way back into my head I run back up to my room. \"I really do love you remember that mom\" I say crying I shut the door locking it before she can get inside \"don't shut me out, Please open the door, Matilda!\" She says trying to open the door. I open the door with my powers lying in bed I have a blade this time hovering fairly high up on my thigh I take it in my hand JM the letters cut into my skin above it I cut the word 'help' she tries to pry the blade out of my hand then she stands still staring at my bruised thighs. \"Oh Matilda\" She whispers letting out a small gasp I set the blade down seeing how upset she already is, I didn't mean to upset her at all thats part of why I'm reluctant to tell her. She sits down next to me and puts her hand in mine \"You can tell me anything, Sweetie you don't have to worry about being alone again I know what your going through right now is difficult, I can help you more if you tell me what happened\" she says. \"Even if I was mentally prepared to tell you the person that did this to me would be more likely to hurt you if you know what he did than if you don't, I'm trying to protect you in a way honestly\" I tell her \"I'm worried about you this is serious someone hurt you!\" She says. \"I know, It'd be pretty hard to forget with these bruises and pain unless I had amnesia\" I say hm I think deep for a second before my mom snaps me out of it. \"Don't even think about it Matilda Honey!\" She says upset \"It's not like I was going to do it\" I say coolly \"Why did you cut that into yourself?\" She says looking down at me I cover it up. \"Sometimes people cut to relieve stress I decided to try it and see if it worked, not such a great coping mechanism\" I say to her \"Let me get a first aid kit and take care of it\" She says \"No I can take care of it\" I say \"That wasn't a question\" She raises her voice slightly.[Chapter 2] Matilda: I wasn't about to tell her what happened after a few minutes she left my room because I just wasn't being responsive So I packed a knapsack with a spare set of clothing and toothpaste/toothbrush and deodorant with a compact hairbrush about 30$ worth of savings and put on a pair of shorts and socks/sneakers. Then I climbed out my bedroom window I made my decision I'm going to find Zinnia I decided my first stop would be to the non local public library if I used the local one. I'd be more likely to get busted I took a bus to the next town over and went to the library I logged onto one of the computers I typed in Google \"Zinnia Wormwood New Jersey USA\". A lot of stuff about the stolen car parts popped up but I was looking for an address even if it was for a federal prison at the bottom of the page I saw an address listed in new york city evidently now she owned a house there I printed out the address and got on a bus to the nearest train station. Why the hell I'm really doing this I'm not exactly sure I just figure it'd be easier to explain to Zinnia than my mom but what if Zinnia doesn't even acknowledge me? she might just ignore me like I never even existed well I guess if that happens oh well. I feel like I need to at least try I buy a ticket to penn station and get on the train, Jenny's probably already freaked out that I left but truthfully I don't know if I want to go back I know I don't want to stay long with Zinnia though she wasn't that nice to me. The guy Stan that did this to me is really on the slow side but hes also dangerous if I tell my mom what happened she'll make me press charges and then hell probably come after me and her which I don't want. I sit next to the window staring out out it my legs bent up against my short 5ft body tears slid down my face, If my mom knew would she blame me for sneaking out and hurt me? I should of never snuck out with all of this intelligence you'd think I wouldn't. Shes probably mad at me for running away she adopted me took me in and made me her own family and this is how I repay her? maybe I'm not such a good daughter no I shouldn't be putting myself down its not my fault I got raped this isn't my fault I'm afraid my mom isn't going to want me anymore what Jenny doesn't?. How am I even going to explain this to Zinnia do I just knock on her do and surprise her with it right away or should I say I just wanted to see her what if shes not even home or its an old address and she doesn't live there anymore I should of thought this through more clearly. I'm probably going to have to take the subway but I should be able to figure out where I need to go easily enough I've come this far I'm not going to turn around and go home now. Images blur by with the time as I look out the window minutes passing by eventually I reach penn station I pay my subway fare and look at the map figuring out where i need to go after a few subway transfers I walk about 10 minutes reaching the address on the paper its a smallish white 2 story house on the corner of an alley. I slowly walk up to the door knocking on it a few seconds later I see the knob move then I see her open the door \"What do you want?\" She says staring at me with a cold look on her face I fight the urge to break down in hysterics \"I was raped earlier this morning by a psychotic asshole, Could you give me a cigarette?\" She blows smoke at me. \"I'll do you one better\" She says smiling and walks away leaving the door open is she going to hurt me oh no what if shes getting harry to beat me and tell me to never talk to them again because they don't care about me I feel scared. A few seconds later she returns with a partial pack of cigarettes and what looks like orange juice She hands me a cigarette and lights it \"Thanks I suppose\" I say unsure of what to say in a sense if she really loved me anywhere as much as my mom she wouldn't of given me that cigarette because they're not good for anyones health. Now she hands me the glass bottle \"Join the club, Here drink this it's orangina and Vodka, don't worry Harry's not around today\" I've never drank alcohol before but I don't really care right now I open up the bottle and take a big gulp washing it down with a puff of tobacco. Why did she say join the club? I guess in her own way shes trying to be nice after I've drunken about a 5th of the bottle I slump against the side of the house at the beginning of the alley she takes the bottle and the cap from me and starts to drink herself \"Guys sometimes there such jerks\" I say slurring my speech slightly \"Yeah go that right glad I'm not one\" Zinnia says. \"I wish of snuck out at 1am if I had stayed home and not been out smoking cigarettes with my friend none of this would of happened\" I say upset \"Hey for what its worth I'm sorry that happened to you kid\" she says \"It's 2 weeks before my birthday I've lost my virginity at 12 years old\" I say. \"Why don't you come inside and sit down your pretty drunk\" I finish up my cigarette and walk inside she leads me over her couch I sit down my vision is slightly blurry and my balance is off \"I think I drank to much\" I slur out \"If you need to puke the bathrooms down the hall on the right\" she states. \"Hows Mikey been?\" I ask \"Don't know hes not home much\" She says \"Oh\" I slur out my thoughts are a bit jumbled \"Harry got busted in guam a few years we got deported he spent a bit in prison but hes out, now he owns a warehouse\" She says \"Guess hes still the same crooked man\" I say \"Yeah why do you think I drink\" She says. \"This is the first time I ever drank before I run away and end up drunk with you gee I never thought this would happen\" I slur out \"Why'd you come here anyways?\" She asks \"I thought It'd be easier to explain what happened to you because you don't care as much about me as my mom does Jenny loves me more than anything I didn't want to cause her pain\" I say. \"She's your mom now though I gave birth to you but I was never much of a mother to you she gave I you what I couldn't\" she says I know shes right \"I don't know if I'm ever going to go home though as much as I love her I don't want her to get hurt protecting me I might just disappear tomorrow without a trace\" I say unsure of what to do. \"Just don't go off to Guam or Mexico pretty dangerous stuff kid\" She says \"I'll keep that in mind\" I slur out \"You want to watch tv or something?\" She asks \"Yeah sure why not\" I lie down on the couch she puts on the simpsons I'm to drunk to really care I stare at the tv time seems to blur many episodes go by it must be a marathon or something. *Switches briefly to Jenny's Pov: I had left Matilda alone in her room when I went back to check on her 10 minutes later she was gone I tried no to panic maybe she had just gone to a friends house but this wasn't like her to just disappear like that. I called all of her friends she wasn't there I even drove around town looking for her but no she wasn't anywhere I went home discouraged didn't bother calling the police because you have to wait 24 hours to file a report I sat around the house pondering the things that could of happened to her what if she had been kidnapped there wasn't any evidence of that no I shouldn't let my mind think that far. About 6 hours later I the phone rings \"Matilda?\" I ask \"No It's Zinnia, Shes here though I live at _ ave _ ave in Manhattan you have till 5am tomorrow to pick her up after that I have to turn her loose I can't have her around Harry\" She says sounding kind of drunk \"I'll be there as soon as I can\" I hang up the phone. Why on earth had Matilda gone to Zinnia of all people I really just don't understand she seemed so happy with me well aside from the smoking was what happened to her that bad that she felt she needed to run way? she should know I'll always protect her shes my child. I got in my car and drove off after about an hour and a half reaching the place she was I knocked on the door \"Shes okay shes inside\" Zinnia said opening the door \"Thank you\" I say not really sure what else to say she lets me inside. \"She showed up out of the blue I wasn't about to turn her out on the street, She said she came here because she though it would be easier to explain what happened to someone who didn't care as much, She said she didn't want to hurt you\" Zinnia says. \"Did she say what happened?\" I ask\"Yeah it's pretty bad, you better wait till you get home with her before she tells you\" She says . *Switches back to Matilda's Pov \"You called my mom? wait thats obvious yeah I have to go home now sorry for the inconvenience Zinnia I just didn't know what to do\"I say getting up partially sobered up hopefully enough Jenny won't notice. \"Hey kid if you want to talk or anything heres my email address I know I wasn't a good parent but I still care about you Good Luck\" \"Thanks Zinnia\" I say lucky for me my mom doesn't pick up that I'm intoxicated I try to act sober \"Come on Matilda we have a long car ride home\" I walk out the door getting into her car. \"I'm sorry\" I say those are the only words spoken the whole car ride home some of it I passed out when we get home I set my sack down by the inside of the front door \"Please don't ever scare me like that again\" She says holding me at arms length \"I'm really sorry mom\" I say upset \"You need to tell me what happened to you Matilda\" She says \"You should sit down\" I say. We sit down in the living room next to each-other \"Whatever happened it's not going to change the fact that I love you\" She says \"I was raped this morning I snuck out of the house to go smoke cigarettes with a friend and came back at 3 in the morning a wreck you tried to warn me smoking does nothing but harm well you were right if I hadn't of been out smoking I would't of gotten raped\" I say tears falling off my face. \"Sweetie\" She pulls me into her arms \"I'm so sorry that happened to you\" She says \"Thats what I get for sneaking out at 1am\" I whisper \"It's not your fault, you shouldn't of snuck out or been smoking cigarettes but that doesn't make what happened to you okay\" she says \"Whats my punishment how many days am I going to get locked in my room?\" I ask. She looks at me shocked and upset, Harry used to lock me in my room when I did something bad or disobeyed him not all the time but he did sometimes for days for some reason I had expected she was going to do the same thing for a minute. \"I would never do that to you, I love you\" she says \"I love you too mom\" I say \"Did you shower since it happened?\" she asks \"No, I didn't\" I respond \"I'm going to take you to the er, they can collect evidence and put the person that did this to you away\" She says \"You can't make me go\" I almost yell.[Chapter 3] *Jumps ahead a few days. Sorry was off the radar for a while Matilda: As it had turned out the guy who raped me had been paid to do so by , I guess in a sense I'm glad my mom made me go to the police, Had she not I might not have found out she was on my trail. It was very clear she had somehow figured out my mom had adopted me and was seeking some kind of sadisitc revenge. I don't know what to do nether does my mom for that matter she has me sleeping in her bed with her because shes scared that Truchbull might try to kidnap me or something. Yes I was scared but I thought she was being slightly overprotective up until I went to get the mail today, not that I minded her being protective but I found a note in the mailbox from the Truchbull, It tells me to open up the oven what is she hiding in there or something?!. I had gone inside and I open it cautiously and let out a scream before realizing what I thought was a dead body was just a big plastic doll, it was the note that got me she had left another one on it \"This is will be you soon, say your goodbyes Matilda-A.T\". Was she saying she was going to overheat me to death? I couldn't wrap my mind around what she was saying it was too horrible. I saw my mom run to me she practically grabbed me wrapping her arms around me pulling me close \"Are you okay?\" she asks, She began to cry upon seeing what was there. \"I'm okay It's alright mom I'm right here\" I say trying to soothe her nothings alright she cradled my head in her hand practically squeezing me \"Oh Matilda\" She says emotionally I can hear the fear, pain and love in her voice she kisses the top of my head. \"I'm scared, I love you mom\" I say starting to tear up myself squeezing her tightly I kiss her on the cheek \"I love you too sweetie, you are so precious to me if I ever lost you..\" She looked deep into my eyes. \"I don't want to lose you ethier\" I whisper looking away, Suddenly I hear a door slam we both flinch I motion for us to make a run out the kitchen door \"Little rat your going to die today!\" I heard the trunchbull we bolted outside the house. I looked back she was running after us my mom motioned to the car, we have to get away from her suddenly I feel trunchbull grab me from behind I try to scream but she covers my mouth with a rag of cholorphorm \"No!\" my mom screams running back towards me I kick her hard but she has me in a position where I can't use my arms. I hear my mom get on her cellphone and dial 911 \"It's too late Jenny\" Trunchbull laughs manically I hear her give her name and say trunchbull broke in and has me she hangs up \"You won't get away with this!\" She cries trying to grasp ahold on me the trunchbull free's a hand. Only to grab ahold of my mom locking her in a position she can't free herself from ethier \"Please let her go, you can do whatever you want with me just please don't hurt her\" my mom begs Trunchbull somehow pulls a second rag over my mom. \"Please take me instead\" I say through the washcloth the last thing I see is my mom looking utterly terrified screaming no I fade out of consiousness. I wake up in an unfamiliar basement \"Ah your up piggie\" Truchbull sneers \"What did you do with her?!\" I yell \"She's dead you stupid rat you hear me!\" Truchbull yells pointing to a pile of bones in the corner no she couldn't be truchbull pulls out a picture of her unconsious pale and then oh no please no trunchbull eating a body presumably hers I feel the urge to puke so badly \"Now I wouldn't want you to miss the best part your all mine now piggie all mine to devour\" She sneers my heart races this can't be happening she can't be dead no! oh geez what is she going to do with me?! well I mean that's obvious I'm tied to a pan naked. Oh no what is Trunchbull doing to me?! \"You must be properly prepared of course\" Trunchbull says fake sweet voice I feel her touching my thighs I flinch \"raped tender\" Trunchbull whispers I feel her lips press hard against them I feel her teeth sink into them terror sinks into my head the teeth and mouth pull away \"Rest assured I have to preheat the oven and prepare a sauce you must be beaten tender and be the most scrumptious meal\" she went on to tell me how worthless I was how horrible and unloveable she said so many horrible things when she was done with that truchbull left the room. What if I try to use my powers to untie myself, No she's too big I couldn't fight her off I'd just be in even worse trouble how could she have murdered my mom?! Why wasn't I awake to save her tears fell off my face she was all I had in this world and that sick woman killed her. She could be lying to me is that possible? but then why wouldn't my mom be watching Trunchbull would want to hurt her as much as possible I know that much. How do I deal with this how do escape?my head is spinning no this can't be happening please no tell me this is all a nightmare I need to wake up I need my mom I need her oh I wish I had never run away from her I wish I could of stayed in that night and take it back. I wish I could wrap my arms around her one last time and tell her how much I love her, no I'd never want to let go of her oh mom what do I do how can I go on without you if I make it out of this. I want my mommy, I want my mommy! tears streamed down my face oh Jenny mommy how could I have let this happen you adopted me we were suppose to be eachothers family not have it end like this I was suppose to make you happy and keep you safe we were supposed to protect eachother. I hear Trunchbull walk back into the room after a little bit once again going off about how worthless and horrible I am and then chlorophormed again I feel myself blackout the last thing I think is if I'll ever wake up. I wake up to my body being paddled ouch I feel soar, it goes on for a while then I'm left alone for many hours again while she tortures me with emptying out my bowels. Coming back Trunchbull tells me I've been down here two days and my time is up she gives me one last speech on how horrible I am and how the only thing I'm good for is to eat. Wiping off my butt I try to fight her kicking and screaming but I'm flipped over onto my stomach forced into a position like some sort of animal with my butt stuck in the air Truchbull feels out my butt and thighs and shoves a thermomiter up my butt and says something about my cooking better in this position. An apple is shoved in my mouth she says she'll baste me and finish garnishing me later I feel a wave of heat as she shoves me in the oven \"Don't worry you'll be more than consious enough to feel everything when I eat you\" She laughs manically slamming the door oh no no this isn't happening. I'd say I'm going to die in here but shes too twisted to just put me out of my mistery why is this happening to me what did I do wrong to deserve this! am I that bad of a person and that worthless? I guess at least I'm told I'll be a good meal. I hear footsteps and crying what's going on? does she have another kid shes preparing? I make out something about me being alive in here and a scream I hear the crying louden I try to look out the heat it's so hard to see I make out a figure. I see the figure getting kicked into the ground I undo the persons ropes I can't undo my own,I hear a lot of banging and someone hit the floor I heard footsteps coming towards me but damn I can't see enough, what if it's trunchbull and she's finishing me up early because the other kid is better?. No damn it you are a good meal you have to be if your so horrible as a person, your a sick animal being slaughtered and harvested as meat you have to be top quality you have to be good for something maybe you can give Trunchbull suggestions on what will enhance your flavor?. The door opens I'm in a state of shock mom?! a rush of emotions hit me as she looks terrified so horrorified taking me out untying me quickly I remove the thermomiter from my butt and the apple from my mouth she simotaniously put a long oversized tshirt on me that had been on the floor. \"Are you okay?\" we ask at the same time immediatly pulling eachother into an airtight hug squeezing eachother.\"I thought you were dead she told me you were oh I love you so much mommy\" I say kissing her on the cheek in hysterics. \"I love you too, she told me you were dead too but then she brought me out here and told me you were in there I saw you I felt so horrible and nausious she kept kicking me all I could do was watch, Oh sweetie come on lets get out of here\" She says kissing my forhead for a few seconds. I flinch remembering Trunchbull nearly taking a chunk out of me. We give eachothere one last tight squeeze before seperating but this time we hold hands I don't dare let go I see Trunchbull unconsious on the floor taken out with a metal poll we run down the hallway we find the exit and I open the door with my powers. We keep running, Woods so many trees I hear footsteps \"You can't escape me\" Trunchbull yells she stops running and pulls me behind a tree we cling to eachother she hugs me protectivly. \"I'm not going to make the mistake of letting go this time\" She whispers stroking my hair, If we hadn't of let go of eachother the first time maybe this wouldn't of happened. I hear trunchbull run passed us I squeeze my mom scared she pulls me as close as she can holding the back of my head after a minute we run off in a different direction we run across an abandoned car I start it with my powers we get into it. She drives us to the police station where they go out and find Trunchbull she is locked up and after we finish with everything mom takes me home and has an alarm system installed a few hours later. We showered and got ready for bed \"Goodnight mom\" I said standing in her doorway I turned away I felt her wrap her arms around me I flinched \"Your spending the night with me, I'm not taking any chances\" She says softly. For a second I expect her to hit me \"How much trouble am I in? how many lashes?\" I say trembling my dad used to whip my skin open with his belt she looks at me hurt tears welling in her eyes she holds my face \"Matilda your not in trouble, this isn't your fault and I would never intentionally hurt you sweetie I love you too much to ever think about it\". \"I love you too mom, I could never intentionally hurt you ether I'm sorry\" I say hugging her, Trunchbull lied she told me my mom hated me she loves me I know she does, she still wants me. We hadn't talked much since we got home I read the look on my face she was going to ask me about what happened, we had been questioned seperatly because the cops told her sometimes people were afriad to say things infront of their family. She sits me down on her bed and sits down next to me \"we need to talk sweetie, what exactly did she do to you?\" She gives me a very serious and concerned look I knew I couldn't avoid it forever. I told her about how I woke up and was told she was dead how horrible I felt and how I blamed myself for not being awake to save her. Being tied down to the pan naked for 2 days, trunchbull nearly biting off part of my thigh, being tormented with being told how horrible and worthless I was, that she hated me and all that, how good I would taste that I was only good for being food. How I woke up being paddled to make my body tender, the laxitives and being flipped over told I was going in and that trunchbull was going to eat me alive, I told her how I thought I was horrible and told myself I had to be the best meal I could be so I was atleast good for something but yet feeling so screwed up for thinking that when I saw she was alive . She was in tears she told me everything the trunchbull said to me was wrong and to never think I was worthless or not a good person she said I didn't deserve that, telling me how precious and priceless I am to her that I am not food or some kind of animal. That I'm her little girl and I deserve to be treated is with respect, love, kindness and care she says touching should never be used to hurt me only to show support, love and affection. She says that I deserve a warm bed to sleep in and a pair of arms to hold me and make me feel safe that I deserve all the support love and affection in the world and that she tries her hardest to give me all of that. She asks me if Harry physically abused me I start to shake \"No, no please I'll be good stop it your hurting me\" I yelled trying to push him off me \"Matilda calm down it's just me\" I looked around the room \"Hey your safe now your alright I'm here now I'm not going anywhere\" She says. \"I'm sorry I'm sorry\" I say hysterical \"Matilda look at me\" She tilted my head up \"You are safe in this house with me as long as I'm here no ones going to hurt you ever again, I love you too much to ever think about hurting you\" She says holding me protectivly. \"Now you have to tell me what she did to you, if I had to tell you everything you have to tell me everything\" I say needing to know what trunchbull did to her. \"Sweetie I don't think this is a good time\" She responds giving me a serious look \"Your not getting out of this mom\" I say looking back at her even more seriously. She tells me that trunchbull molested her and kept saying she was going to eat her just like she had me, she tells me that she was about ready to kill herself before she found out I was alive. I squeezed her so tightly \"I'm so glad you didn't\" I say tears sliding down my face I nuzzled her kissing her cheek \"I'm not going to leave you, not for a very long time\" She says holding me tightly.

Near this same spot, Blane's jerk friend, Steff, had hit on her. She had rejected him, of course. Then he had called her a bitch. It seemed like yesterday. She sat in her car, musing over the memory. A couple walked into the school. Excited voices poured out of the open doors then were hushed as the doors closed. It was no use sitting out here. She mechanically got out of the car and walked inside. \"Andie!\", an excited voice said. It was her old friend, Jena. Andie forced a smile. \"You look great,\" said Jena. \"You too,\" said Andie. Jena actually had aged well. \"I'm getting off probation soon,\" said Jena, \"Hey, our old gym teacher is here. The one that never let me smoke in class...\" Jena's voice was drowned out by many conversations as Andie's eyes swung around the room. She was here for one reason only, to get a glimpse of Duckie. She had no hope of romance. No, she had killed that a long time ago. Still, it would be nice to see him again. As if on cue, the crowd began shouting, \"Duck man! Duck man!\" Andie's heart skipped a beat. Why was this so hard for her? It was just her old friend. Duckie and his beautiful blond wife entered, hand in hand. They began shaking hands and greeting people, as if they were celebrities. Andie bit her lip and looked away, trying hard not to blush. Duckie made his way closer and closer. \"Andie? Andie, is that you?\" said the familiar voice. Andie looked up and smiled, \"How are you, Duckie?\", she said, sheepishly. She could barely look into his deep, expression-able eyes. Duckie took her hand. She was surprised at how normal it felt. She expected him to say, \"May I admire you?,\" but he only grinned with his dimples showing. The awkwardness grew. \"So, I heard you've done well for yourself,\" began Andie abruptly. \"Business has been growing by leaps and bounds,\" said Duckie in his dramatic, no-big-deal way. Duckie's wife turned toward Andie with blue eyes and red lips, framing perfectly straight teeth. \"We recently broke into Europe. Duckie and my father make quite a team. Duckie designs the clothes and Father sells them.\" Her voice was smooth and confident. Duckie was all smiles as he shrugged, basking in unabashed delight. \"You must be very proud,\" said Andie, doing her best to keep her green eyes from flashing with jealousy. \"There's no on like Duckie,\" said the blond bombshell, giving his arm a squeeze. He gave her that knowing grin of a man very much in love. \"No one,\" agreed Andie, looking down at her hands. \"Hey, Andie,\" said Duckie, sounding suddenly concerned, \"I heard about the divorce. I'm...I'm really sorry.\" That was as close to \"I told you so,\" as Duckie would get, thought Andie. \"Well, yeah,\" she said, shrugging as if it were no big deal. \"I've still got little Blane and Jenny, and they're so cute.\" \"Speech! Speech! Speech!\" the crowd chanted. \"I promised I'd give the commencement speech,\" said Duckie absent-mindedly. He shrugged, \"Pardon moi.\" He jaunted to the front of the room, grabbed the microphone, and began addressing the crowd. He always was at ease in the spotlight. Andie felt uncomfortable next to Duckie's wife. She listened to Duckie, lost in her own thoughts. \"You and Duckie used to be close,\" said the blond. \"Yes, we were very good friends,\" said Andie, coolly. \"I guess he wanted to be more,\" said Duckie's wife, as if she were teasing Andie. \"Yeah,\" was all Andie could bear to say. \"He really liked you,\" she said, confidentially, her eyes wide open with disbelief. Andie just winced and shook her head, as she thought, \"No duh! Don't rub it in!\" She blinked. There was no way she was going to cry. Duckie finished his short, rousing speech. The music began before the cheers died down, \"Seven years went under the bridge like time standing still,\" crooned the singer's voice. \"More like ten,\" thought Andie. The music, the familiar faces, and Andie's perfume combined in such a way that for a moment, Andie thought she was in High School again. Duckie grinned and walked towards her. She lost all pretense and smiled back at him with her sweetest smile. He didn't seem to notice. He wasn't looking at her. Of course, he was looking at Duckette. They embraced and began dancing. Andie stood in the middle of the dance floor. \"You can't go back,\" she said to herself. She backed towards the doorway. Staying would only prolong her bittersweet memories. She would go home and read a book or watch TV. Blane would bring the children back Sunday night, and then work and school would keep Andie busy for another week. As she walked back to her car, she could hear the strains of the song, \"If you leave. Don't look back...don't look back!\" ","Summary":" Pretty in Pink Reunion (Fan Fiction) William Blake Paul Andie pulled up to the old school and a wav"},{"Movie":"Pretty in Pink","Title":"Duckie's Letter","Author":"Snow Love Peace","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12200752","Passage":"[Chapter 1] a/n- Pretty in Pink movie.

He was in the habit of strolling around the empty halls, enjoying the sound of his slippers hitting the worn linoleum tiles. His hands were shoved resolutely into his deep pockets, his shoulder pads jutting out powerfully as he slinked up and down the halls as though he owned them. Today he was wearing a light grey suit over a creamy white shirt and pants. It was a light flannel number, especially good for the spring. He liked to look his best. That was why he always made sure to blow dry his hair until it was feather-light and as soft as bird down. As he walked outside several minutes before the bell rang to end the school day, he slipped on a pair of sunglasses and lit a cigarette. The breeze caressed his skin, sending ripples across his suit as he crossed the parking lot. His soft hair billowed like willow branches. He meandered over to his car and got inside, leaving the door open. It was better like this. Just then, as it got truly quiet and the vernal breeze filled the parking lot, he began contemplating things. In just one short month, he would be graduating. As he considered this, he felt a small and unexpected twinge of sadness. He certainly wouldn't miss this pathetic place, so that couldn't be why. He supposed it had something to do with the fact that soon he would be off to Yale, to follow in his much-respected father's successful footsteps, to throw in his lot with the rest of the corporate heirs. There, he would mingle with the progeny of Wall Street, the future gentry of Washington, and innumerable girls from the good families of Boston. He did not resent his fate, but he did not welcome it, either. He was as apathetic about going off to Yale as he was about everything – high school, his friends, his girlfriend. It all got mixed up in his mind until it was nothing but a haze made up of faces, hallways, and house parties. They meant nothing to him. The bell rang just as he finished his cigarette. He dropped it onto the pavement, watching as the snowy ash scattered. Students were rushing out of the building now. Eager faces all milling around, excited for the weekend. A claque of Steff's friends soon congregated next to his car. He muttered something noncommittal to acknowledge their presence, but was soon staring transfixed into the rear view mirror, watching the pink car that was parked behind his, waiting for its owner to show herself. His heartbeat had quickened just a little from the anticipation, but his exterior remained unruffled. \"Hey, Steff!\" One of his friends said. \"What?\" \"Your folks are going to Paris in two weeks, right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"What do you say? Party at your place?\" \"Sure, whatever,\" Steff muttered, at which point his friend promised that it would be a wild party and went back to talking to the others. Finally, Steff caught sight of Andie in the rear view mirror. It was difficult to miss her. She always wore the most ridiculous ensembles of anyone in the entire school. Cheap clothes from thrift stores, or worse – made by her own hand. She had no concept of grace, save for whatever misguided commoner's idea of style she clung to. He regarded her with a combination of contempt and pity. He knew about her and her sort: ceaselessly striving to get out of the domestic squalor, to grab hold of any lifeline she could before her chance to escape her blue-collar life passed her by. But she was smart – he knew that too. Perhaps one of the only truly smart girls in a school full of sluts. He muttered some hasty parting words to his friends, not even looking at them as he made the decisive move out of his car and toward Andie, though he could not explain why. He had made advances to her before, each one of them rejected. Sheepishly rejected on freshman year, angrily sophomore year, exasperatedly junior year, and finally with a bitter honest sting this year. He supposed it was just his habit. Girls generally didn't refuse him. He could be very charming when he wanted to be, and the giggling morons didn't stand a chance when he trotted out his pick-up lines for them. Andie, however, never giggled and never took him seriously for even a minute. It was immensely frustrating. He wasn't used to rejection, and he didn't like it. He caught up to Andie just as she was about to get into her car. \"Oh, Andie, you look ravishing,\" he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. She paid him no attention. He leaned against the door. He hoped the old car wouldn't dirty his suit, but just at this moment, he was allowing a small crack to form in his cool demeanor. This was just a little bit desperate, and he knew that. He just hoped that Andie wouldn't realize it. \"So we graduate in a month,\" he continued. \"Now, I want to know when it is that you and I are gonna get together and do something.\" He knew he was just skirting the edge of outright crudeness. He knew Andie would regard it as what it was: a pointless display. \"Try never,\" Andie replied in an emotionless monotone voice. \"Well, I'm talking about more than sex here,\" Steff insisted. He had spouted off this particular line so often that the lie no longer had any conviction. It sounded hollow even to his own ears. \"No, you're not,\" Andie said with blatant contempt – Steff had a feeling it wasn't so much because she knew he was lying, but because of how little effort he had put into it. He suddenly felt something wretched and uncomfortable rising up in his chest. A squeezing, frustrating feeling. He wanted Andie to say something, anything that wasn't just flat-out rejection. He wanted her to look at him. Maybe not as a real person, but as somebody, at least. \"You know, I've liked you for four years, and you treat me like shit, you know,\" Steff said, a subdued tantrum making its way into his voice. \"I don't understand that. What's your problem?\" \"Can you get off of my car?\" Andie ignored him. The squeezing, uncomfortable feeling was getting worse. Steff was becoming angry. He knew it was all pointless, of course, but if he could just get a rise out of her... \"You know, I've been out with a lot of girls at this school. I don't see what makes you so different.\" He was certain that would get to her. \"I have some taste,\" she retorted without even pausing for thought. What a joke. Steff pulled a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket and drew one out with his teeth – a gesture he had practiced in the mirror many times. He was certain that he saw something change in her face for a split second as she saw him maneuver the cigarette with his lips and clamp it loosely between his teeth. He knew how he looked doing that, and he was pleased that she had noticed. \"You're a bitch,\" he remarked in one final attempt to get a reaction. But there wasn't one. He began to walk off, then turned around for one last jab at her pride. \"You know, I think you ought to see a doctor, 'cause that condition of yours could get a lot worse,\" he sniped. Andie said nothing. She merely looked at him through her large round glasses, mouth slightly open in disbelief. Steff got back into his own car and slammed the door shut. His friends had all gone off, leaving him alone. He saw Andie get into her car in his rear view mirror. He could see her sit still for a moment, her face ever-so-slightly perturbed. He relished the little victory. It was not much, but it was something. He had managed to make a little dent in that proletarian armor after all. With that, he pulled out of the parking lot and drove off. Andie sat alone in her car for a few minutes after Steff had left. She had gotten through another day. It would all be over soon, if only she could just hold on a little longer. People like Steff didn't make it easy for her. When he had started to pester her during her freshman year, she had been sure it had just been a mean joke. Now, she didn't know why he did it. Did he really want her to say yes? She considered how easy it would be to just swallow her pride and go out with him. Before, she might have been naïve enough to think it would involve a trip to a five-star French restaurant and a courtly ride home, but now she knew it would probably turn out to be some indiscriminate booze in the backseat of his BMW, followed by clumsy inebriated sex. It was an experience she could do without. Despite everything, she had to admit that Steff was charming in a way that was utterly despicable. She saw him lingering in the hallways sometimes, looking like a self-assured house cat that had caught a mouse. She knew he had skipped more classes than he had attended, but he got away with it. That was all on account of his rich parents. Whenever Steff's name drew too much unwanted attention from the principal, they would just come in and write a check. It was unfair, but Andie had long since accepted the world for what it was. People like Steff didn't need to worry about high school. People like her, however, had to scrabble and crawl after every meager test score if they had any hope of a real future. Andie started her car and pulled out of the parking lot. She was going to be late for work if she stayed sitting like this for too long. As she drove, she continued to think. She knew all too well what awaited her if she messed up in school. She'd seen it happen to her father. She hated coming home and finding him sprawled on the sofa in his robe and slippers, indolently watching the television, seeing nothing. He had been a wreck ever since Andie's mother had left them. Since then, Andie's life had become one long schedule. Her days were distended by incessant work of one kind or another. She had been busy every day for four years, and she couldn't wait for it all to amount to something. What made her angry were people like Steff who just got in her way. Or Duckie, who seemed intent on dragging her down into the squalor with him. As she drove past all the big houses, she was filled with a mixture of envy and self-pity. Even when the sight of the elegant neighborhoods filled her with hope, the same sight belittled her. She felt grubby in the presence of these houses. No matter how much she tried to look the part, she would never acquire the unmistakable glamour that came from having money. Every outfit she made was just a pale echo of the clothes she saw in stores, yet she could not deny that the methodical process of producing her own clothing was soothing. When she was comparing different fabrics or sitting at her sewing machine, she forgot everything. How her mother had abandoned her, how her father was spending more time sleeping and watching TV than working, how people like Steff made her feel, and all the rest of the miserable details that were heaped over each other. When Andie arrived at the record store where she worked, she took her place at the cash register and began to stare off into space. Then, as if the day needed to get worse, Steff walked in. No , Andie thought. Not here. When he noticed her, he smiled and walked up to the cash register. He leaned forward. Andie noticed that he had a cigarette tucked behind his ear. \"So this is where you work,\" Steff smirked. \"Can I help you?\" Andie asked, refusing to show any weakness. She didn't want to give him the satisfaction. \"I just came in here to look for the new Madonna record,\" Steff said, although it was clear he was lying. \"We don't have it,\" Andie said, although she didn't know if that was true. \"Are you sure?\" Steff asked. \"Can you check for me?\" Andie alighted from her chair and went to the New Records shelf. Anything to put some distance between her and Steff. She flipped through the records with some haste, and eventually said, \"We don't have it.\" \"You know, I'm throwing a party on the eighteenth,\" Steff said, sauntering up to her. \"You can even come if you agree to put on something half decent.\" \"No thank you,\" Andie snapped. \"Are you sure? It's going to be the last party before graduation. We're never going to see each other again,\" he said. Good , Andie thought. \"Still no?\" Steff asked. Why was he doing this? Did he really want her to come to his stupid party? Andie went back to her place behind the cash register. \"Suit yourself,\" Steff shrugged, and left the store. What had all that been about? He had called her a bitch just two hours ago, and now he was inviting her to a party? Andie decided to chalk it up to the fact that Steff was just messing with her. Trying to see if he could undermine her in some way. A week later, Steff saw Blaine talking to Andie. He had known Blaine since they were both kids. He knew Blaine's parents, too. He also knew their liquor cabinet fairly well, but that was beside the point. It was no mystery why Blaine had suddenly decided to talk to her. He had sensed that he was getting antsy before graduation, and that he would try something fairly soon. He had assumed that it would be tamer than this, of course. For Blaine, this was almost too bold. Blaine had always been a sniveling adolescent to him. The kind of guy who would grow up to go to his psychiatrist's office on his lunch break, before going back to the office and feeling sorry for himself. It was all because of his parents – that much Steff had to admit. If Blaine had grown up with people who loved and supported him, he might have been somebody else. But after a lifetime of having every dream and hobby ruthlessly analyzed and dismantled, he was a mere stripling inside. Steff cornered Blaine in the hallway and asked him about Andie. Blaine did his usual innocent routine, and it was clear that he was entertaining delusions again. Steff saw clearly how the entire thing would end. Blaine would receive the full treatment from his parents, and Andie would have to skulk back into the gutter, never to forget her brush with wealth. It was all too pathetic to be allowed to continue. Andie was just getting ready to go home from work when she saw Steff come into the store out of the corner of her eye. She whipped around with the most scornful look she could muster. If he had come to ask her to his party again, she knew exactly what to say. \"So I hear you're going out with Blaine,\" he said, catching her off guard. \"That's none of your business,\" Andie snapped. \"Actually, it is. Blaine is my friend, and I don't want to see him do this to himself.\" \"Is it because he has money and I don't?\" Steff paused and stared Andie in the eye. \"You can't be this naïve,\" he said. Andie wanted to say something back, but she knew that Steff was right. \"You're a smart girl. So do what smart girls do and call it off,\" he said patronizingly, before dragging another cigarette out of the pack with his teeth. In that moment, Andie could almost see the person Steff would become. His path had been set for him the very day he had been born, and there had never been a day in his life when it was possible for him to become something else. In ten years, this conversation would never have happened for him. It was only because the two of them were still young that they could find even the smallest bit of common ground. \"I don't have to do anything,\" Andie insisted. \"Suit yourself,\" Steff frowned. \"But when Blaine dumps you, don't say I didn't warn you.\" \"He's not like that,\" Andie argued – something that shocked her. She knew better than to argue with Steff. \"What do you really know about him?\" Steff took the cigarette out of his mouth and stuck it behind his ear. \"I've known him all my life. You barely talked to him.\" \"I know he's a damn side nicer than you, for one,\" Andie snapped. \"His parents would crucify him if they knew he was going out with you,\" Steff said. \"You're his experiment. His piece of low-grade ass before he graduates.\" \"Well you'd know all about that, wouldn't you,\" Andie said bitterly. \"I do, as it happens. And you should thank me for telling you, so you have a chance to rescue yourself,\" Steff said angrily. There was a moment of silence between them. Andie knew better than to believe a word he said, but her own pragmatism had been nagging at her since Blaine had asked her out. It was less a question of whether he really did like her, and more a question of whether he liked her enough to turn the rest of his life upside down. \"Blaine isn't going to save you,\" Steff said. \"You're both wasting your time.\" Andie refused to say anything else. If Steff believed for a second that she would listen to him, he was mistaken. Suddenly Steff stepped closer to her and lowered his face to hers. Before Andie could back away or ask him what the hell he thought he was doing, he kissed her without the slightest provocation. He didn't taste of cigarettes or booze, like she would have expected. Rather surprisingly, his mouth was minty fresh. She jerked away and promptly slapped him hard across the face. He stumbled back, his hair falling over his eyes. Even as he massaged the cheek that had taken the hit, he grinned triumphantly at her. \"You're a pig,\" she spat. \"I like you, Andie,\" he said. \"Go to hell!\" With a lazy smile, Steff slowly walked out, leaving Andie alone to burn hot with shame. It took her a moment to calm down. His lips had been so soft. Why the hell had he done that? He must have known she would retaliate, or he was the stupidest person she had ever met. Even if he was right about Blaine, she didn't care. She would never call it off. If only to make Steff angry. She wanted so much to find him and hit him again, and to keep hitting him for all the times he had carelessly stepped down from his cloud to send her mind reeling in turmoil. That said, he was the only one who had ever kissed her like that. The only one who had ever had enough guts or audacity to do so. She wished it had been Blaine instead. Even Duckie. Anyone but Steff. She wondered if he had gone off to tell all his horrible friends about her. They were all probably sitting in his car right now, laughing about it. With gritted teeth, she gathered up her things and locked up the store. As she drove home, she wondered if Blaine would ever find out. If Steff tried to make it seem like Andie had initiated it, it would be fairly easy for her to deny it. Steff just wanted to ruin her life. That was all it was. Nothing more. She would be happy when she never had to see him again. Steff's pulse was still thumping. He was proud of himself for finally having done something. At least now he could forget her. He could finally see her for the trash she was. He was certain that nothing he had told her about Blaine had made any difference, but he had never really thought that anything he said would change her mind. He lit a cigarette as he sat in his driveway. Soon, all this would be his past. He just had one last party to throw. Then a quick appearance at prom, a forgettable night of passion with his girlfriend, and then he was going to Yale, where the whole thing would start over again.

Those rights belong to John Hughes. Author's Note: One-shot based off the ending of Pretty in Pink, with a few artistic liberties thrown in for good measure. I'm still not entirely content with this, but regardless, I hope you enjoy it! Pairing: One-sided Steff/Andie, one-sided Steff/Benny, Andie/Blane He can't believe what he's actually witnessing. The world grinds to a halt as he watches her waltz across the floor, clad in a monstrosity of her own design, hand in hand with that… freak . A growl escapes his throat as he clenches onto his glass, wishing the tumbler could transform into flesh and bone. His grip only marginally lessens when he begins to feel it strain; he's not too keen on ending the night with a fistful of glass. Benny continues on with their conversation, oblivious that anything could ever be amiss; she curls in beside him, wiping an invisible speck away from his shoulder, a shallow excuse to get closer. He no longer bats an eye at her lewd remarks, her breath cloyingly sweet as she hisses in his ear, reeking of gin and mint. Oh, how he hates her. At his right, the screeching of steel alerts him to the possibility that Blane is no longer the spineless worm he's always pegged him for, if their history is anything to go by. A few weeks ago, all he'd have to do is whisper the right words, pull a few strings, and doubt would overwhelm Blane. Now he stands, loafers transfixed on the spot, no longer his childhood friend but a deer caught in the rush of oncoming headlights. It's as if he, too, can feel the severity of this moment. He makes no move forwards, nor does he dare resume his place; whatever action he takes next will cause the tides to shift, their game irrevocably changed. He should have known he wouldn't be the only one mesmerized by this little tornado, a chaotic whirlwind of scarlet and ivory, who slowly is exhausting all of his barricades. She'll always be the great anomaly in his life, the one puzzle that doesn't quite fit; she's the only girl that breaks the mold, a mixture of innocence and iron all wrapped in a pretty pink bow. She's everything, but she's nothing, nothing more than a blip on his radar. After a few beats, Blane comes to a decision of his own accord. He marches forward, a defiant little set in his shoulders, and Steff would be howling with laughter if the stakes weren't so dire. Instead, he steels himself with a swig of scotch before hurrying after his friend, flashing a wink and a one-liner at Benny; that should at least keep her satisfied for the time being. When he comes into range, he yanks Blane back by his shoulder, a sneer etched across his lips as he berates him; this little insurgence needs to be crushed under his heel, once and for all. Blane never really has understood his status in their game of kings and queens; he puffs himself up to be a knight when really, he's nothing more than a pawn. With a look of disgust, Blane shrugs out of his grip, dismissing him with a final, scathing retort; Steff's fingers flex, and it takes all of his self-restraint not to deck him. Instead, he falls back into place, his glacial orbs donning a leonine grace as he watches the pair. The inane chattering of his peers does nothing to diffuse the tension, their ignorance only serving to heighten his abhorrence. Across the room, Blane leans in close to Andie, his breath whispering against her skin; she takes a sharp inhale, her lashes fluttering shut at his words, a warm flush dusting the apples of her cheeks. As he brushes past her, a look of longing flits across her features, soft and wan, as if she doesn't yet have the nerve to dream. He feels as though he's going to retch. Then that… that thing , takes her hand and with a few small words, bolsters her fragile courage; Andie's eyes are shining when she wraps her arms around him, before gathering her skirts and rushing out the door. He slams his fist on the table, all of the anger rushing out him of him with a snarl; Benny shrieks, ripples of gold streaming down the front of her gown, clawing at his arm. A single look is all it takes to silence her, her eyes flashing dangerously as she folds her arms over her ruined gown. As he stalks out of the doors, she throws the glass after him, narrowly missing his head. Benny silently weeps at the table, her tears glimmering like the crystal now lining the floor; she throws back the rest of her drink, a mixture of jealousy and sorrow draping over her like a shadow. When he is safely hidden from view, he races down the corridors like a man possessed. His pulse is ringing in his ears as he darts through one abandoned hall after another, his features highlighted under the sheen of perspiration. If he can move swiftly, perhaps there's still a chance… A bitter chuckle escapes his lips. Here he is, enduring all of this torture, and for what? The beautiful maiden is swept away by the gallant knight, leaving behind nothing but the cruel and bitter viscount; no one will mourn his fate. Still, something compels him to rush forward, an incessant burn nipping at the back of his heels. Regardless of the outcome, he needs to witness this story unfold with his own two eyes; only then, will it be reality. The auditorium doors sway open, revealing stormy skies and sodden earth; he strides through the archway, each step measured with careful purpose, unwilling to draw any unnecessary attention. In the midst of this, a man whirls a woman into his arms, the hazy, fluorescent glow of the streetlights illuminating their figures. Steff pays no heed to the downpour, refusing to move a single inch, even as the rain saturates skin. The young woman bridges the distance between the pair, wrapping her arms around the young man's neck, ruby lips seeking their mate. They pull away slowly, each grinning ear to ear, before scurrying off into the night. He flicks a stray droplet away from his cheek, his lips curling with disgust, their melodic laughter echoing through the air. With a final glance, he turns his heel and leaves, a phantom she'll never deign to see. Fairytale ending were always such a cliché.

Maybe it's because I watched it for the first time as an adult, or maybe it's because I'm really not a fan of the \"Nice Guy\" trope, but to me, Duckie was kind of an ass, who tried to control Andie, semi-stalked her, and then treated her like crap when she failed to be what he wanted her to be (i.e. in love with him). He came good in the end but I never saw or wanted romantic chemistry between them. I liked Blane - how could you not? (those dimples, that smile) - but he was an unconvincing hero in the end. Too weak to stand by his convictions. So, neither of the alpha love interests went the distance for me. Nope. I came out of that movie utterly fascinated by the antagonist - Steff. How had he ended up this way? Why was he seemingly obsessed with Blane's relationship with Andie? And why had he wanted Andie in the first place? My problem is, questions like these lead to fanfics. Very random fanfics... The Seed The raspberry pip was well and truly stuck. Lodged in his back tooth. He spent the next hour trying to dig it out with his tongue. As an only child, company choices were limited. There were other children around – neighbours' kids; those who had been deemed suitable by his parents. But they hadn't been deemed suitable by him that day, so he'd sent them away. They'd gone, of course. They did whatever he told them to. One of the many reasons they were highly annoying. High school was purgatory for Steff. His whole four years there, there were only two things that stood out, that looked different against the unchanging, unrelenting monochrome. Blane was the first. Even if he'd wanted to hang out with his parents (something that wasn't really encouraged; something that he hadn't really tried since he was little), they were out that afternoon at a \"business bbq\". So his choices were calling back the kids he'd sent packing or spending time with the housekeeper again. Working at the pip stuck in his tooth seemed like a worthwhile alternative. Blane was a drop of colour in an ocean of grey. Just bright enough to draw the eye. When he told Steff he was shit, it penetrated the surface. He valued his opinion, his friendship, just enough for it to sting. He lay out on the perfectly manicured lawn, gliding his tongue over the ridge of the seed again and again, half-intrigued, half-annoyed at the sensation. There was an honesty to Blane, an openness he'd been drawn to from the start. At first sight it made him that much easier to mould, but beneath that sweetness was an undercurrent of stubbornness, a determination to go his own way. Steff could get around it. But only up to a point. So when he saw Blane talking to her in the school courtyard it hit him like a dull blow to the stomach, but it wasn't a surprise. Of course, they would want each other. Like was drawn to like. Though not in Steff's case. When he ate supper that evening, he pushed his tongue along the groove of his teeth to catch the last of the crumbs; it caught on the pip. It seemed more prominent than before. The sensation had become irritating, physically and emotionally. He determined to get rid of it. Andie and Blane were similar, but she was streaks ahead. Where he softly glowed, she brilliantly blazed. The undercurrent that ran through Blane was the bedrock of Andie. She would always go her own way. To the point that she didn't understand those who didn't do the same, was scornful of anyone who tried to cage her. She and Blane went well together. Their pieces matched. For a time. He tried flossing that night – something he tended to avoid, hating the feeling of thread forced between teeth – but he couldn't reach it. Steff had been two years at Brown when he learned that Blane was \"finally seeing a nice girl\". He was unsurprised to learn the undercurrent had only gone so far. That given time he'd given way, and taken up the mantle, the life – the girl – expected of him. He'd kept tabs on him via the WASP grapevine, with the half-intention of picking the friendship up again once his relationship reached its inevitable demise. Instead he found himself furious. After half an hour of poking at it with a cocktail stick, he was no closer to getting it out. A half hour more and he realised he'd actually driven it in deeper. Steff went home more often that semester, but avoided any functions that might bring him in contact with Blane or the McDonoughs. He'd drive around town for hours in his 944 Turbo. His parents had bought it as a graduation gift after he totalled the 911, something he'd actually regretted. He missed its flaming red colour. But they had informed him the Turbo's conservative paint job was more appropriate for Ivy League standards. Several times he found himself outside John Marshall high school, which made no sense at all. No one he knew went there anymore. He'd driven it in so deep he could no longer feel it, could not distinguish it from the rest of the tooth. The fourth time he drove there a passerby accused him of kerb-crawling. He raised an eyebrow in amused disbelief, lit a cigarette and blew the smoke in his face. High school girls were irritating enough the first time round. And it wasn't like he was short of tail in college. After a day or so, he forgot it was there. Assumed it had worked its way out on its own. He continued to enjoy the fruits of an Ivy League education, of privilege and prestige. Even if they had lost much of their savour. Even if they'd started to do so while he was still at John Marshall. Always the same tastes, the same sensations… the same endless circles of booze, blow and bullshit. Always the same people. That didn't mean he wouldn't pick the fruit when it was so low-hanging, though. Blondes or brunettes; black, white or brown. He wasn't choosy. Except when it came to redheads. He'd never found a redhead good enough to tempt him. After a few days more, the flesh around the tooth became puffy and enflamed. There was one whose hair was just about vibrant enough, though a touch too long. He was stoned off his ass so leaning into her came easy. He closed his eyes and buried his face in her hair, inhaling deeply. (The haze of pot made it easier to pretend.) But when she leaned in for a kiss, he shoved her away. Her lips were far too thin. It didn't occur to him to tell his parents; he deliberately chose not to tell the housekeeper. He knew she'd make him go to the dentist. He didn't like Dr. Keen. Didn't like the fact he called him \"Steffie\", didn't like that he was so familiar with him. And he didn't like feeling out of control, how small he felt in the giant chair. Or the indignity of sitting with his mouth hanging open. And, in his secret heart of hearts, he didn't like the sound of the drill. Every trip to the dentist he lived in fear it would be brought out. So he kept silent. He'd long since learnt the power of words. How it came in part from knowing when not to use them. Steff had often been bored in high school, and college was no different – it either came too easily to him or just wasn't worth the effort. Why bother trying at anything when the way has already been paved for you? (Why bother trying at all when every step of your life's been mapped out?) It had taken a cold threat of creating as public a scandal as possible before his father gave in and agreed to fund his sojourn at Brown instead of continuing the long-standing McKee tradition of matriculating at Princeton. Princeton was 262 miles from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Brown was only 50. An hour's drive away; maybe even less in his Turbo. He'd found himself plotting routes in Geometry, calculating how to shave minutes off the journey. He'd planned the journey to MassArt a dozen times, a dozen different ways. A journey he knew he'd never take. It reached the point where he could no longer ignore the sensation; it was a struggle to conceal the pain. The laws of proximity meant he wasn't shocked to walk into the party and find her there. Surprised, but not shocked. Since when were frat parties her scene? The fond but wary eye she kept on a drunken girlfriend nearby answered that question. She looked a little older, her hair a little longer; her clothes were still a disaster but she had this way of wearing them that made you forget that. She had never let herself be ruled by what others might think or say. A few days more and his struggles were useless: there was no denying the swelling of his jaw. He gave in. She was looking away, but he saw her tense slightly as if aware of someone's regard. She turned to look. Her eyes met his. Thankfully, the drill hadn't made an entrance. Instead, Dr. Keen was prying the seed out with some kind of hooked metal instrument. \"You were lucky, Steffie.\" His cheerful tones grated almost as much as the drill would have. \"It's grown a little infected but a little gargling with salt water, some antibiotics, and it should clear right up. If you'd left it much longer I would have had to take the tooth out. Or worse.\" Steff raised an eyebrow at him in enquiry, a rare invitation to continue talking. He was saying something that sounded like it might be interesting for once. \"Leave something like this too long and the infection can make its way into the bloodstream. By the time it reaches that point, it's near impossible to stop its spread. That's when it's dangerous.\" She raised an eyebrow. Unintimidated. Unbothered. Unimpressed. He'd almost forgotten how those molten brown eyes could tear holes through him. How their indifference could burn. His hands shook. His brain whirled. His heart stuttered. Only Andie had ever been able to make him feel these things. Weakness. Inadequacy. Bone-deep longing. Realisation swept over him in a wave of dizziness. She'd never been dislodged. She'd never left his system. The infection had been left unchecked for years. It was too late to root her out. He'd never be rid of her now. fin ","Summary":" A/N Okay, this one is so random.

Wiping them away as best he could he sat up in bed, covering his eyes at the bright light coming through his window and momentarily leaving him without sight. He had a splitting migraine, even worse than that time him and his cousin Leroy had gotten into their grandmothers liquor cabinet. It was all because of Andie- his true love. No matter what anybody told him- and he had heard lots of different things- he knew this to be true. He loved her and he hoped some day she would come to her senses and realize that she loved him too, but the chances of that happening seemed even bleaker after the events of the night prior. He hated everything about Blane McDonnagh from his stupid yuppie hairstyle to his name which in his opinion was not a name but rather a major appliance. But most of all he hated that he had the affection of Andie, the girl that he himself had been head over heels in love with for as long as he could remember. However what really irritated him was the fact that he knew exactly what she saw in him, he wasn't blind, he knew the guy was not unattractive and he also knew Blane had so much more to offer Andie then he did. With him she had a future; she could get out of the wrong side of town , have enough money to support herself and buy her father the nice house he deserved so much. They would have beautiful children together who wouldn't have to know what it was like to be a zoid, the rich kid's nickname for anybody whose parents didn't own an oil well. It made his stomach hurt to think how absolutely selfish he was being in not just giving his best friend his blessing to be with Blane, who was obviously the better choice for her. But he physically couldn't. Last night he was an asshole, he knew and accepted that, when Andie brought Blane into the club he had lost it. Dice-man never let him inside the club, the only reason he got in last night was because Iona told him she was his mother, but Blane comes strutting along one time and Dice-man rolls out the welcome mat. It was complete and total bullshit, the whole situation was. Running a hand through his bed ruffled hair he decided it was time to get up and face the day, no matter how much that was going to suck. Getting out of bed he threw on some halfway clean, at least they smelled clean, clothes from his floor, not in the mood to make a big production of putting together an outfit. As he walked into the doorway about to exit his room he stopped for a moment, hand pressed to the door frame and took in a sharp breath. It was Saturday, a day that usually meant time either spent at Andies house or hanging around her work, waiting for her to be finished. If she was busy with homework maybe he would ride his bike past her house a couple of times. But he had promised himself he wouldn't be doing that, and he was resolved in his decision, which left him kind of lost. 'What do people normally do on Saturdays?' he thought to himself, scratching the side of his head. ~~ Slamming his locker shut, louder than was needed, Duckie let his head fall against it- letting out the metallic whak of bone against metal. He allowed the sharp bolt of pain to shoot up into the back of his head, the first time in the last three weeks he had really felt something. The pain broke through the zombie-like lull his life had become. He hadn't spoken to Andie in over three weeks; since the night of her date with Blane. Sure she had tried to call him at least a few times a day, something which made him chuckle a little- thinking how he used to be the one bothering her daily with incessant calls. But nothing had changed on his part, she as far as he could tell was still with Blane and no matter how hard he wished he could just get over that, he couldn't. Letting his head bang against the locker a second time, he jerked his up at the sound of raised voices from a little ways down the hallway. Right by Blanes locker. \"Andie,\" he whispered turning to see what exactly was going on and whether or not he would have to come help her, he wasn't going to just stand back and let anything happen to her. Blane was leaning against his locker, arms crossed over his chest with a look Duckie couldn't quite distinguish in his eyes. Andie was standing in front of him, her face beat red which he knew from experience happened whenever she got angry. \"Just say it. I wanna hear you say it.\" She said in a stressed tone, she was trying to hold her composure. Not wanting to make a scene as usual. \"Andie, please, alright?\" Blane pleaded, looking around as if to make sure nobody was hearing this exchange. \"I wanna hear you say it.\" She whispered. \"A month ago I asked somebody else and I forgot.\" Quickly she pushed him into his locker, her calm exterior breaking as she began screaming in his face. \"You're a liar! You're a filthy, fucking, no-good liar. You don't have the guts to tell me the truth! Just say it!\" she yelled, making a tight fist and punching him in the chest. \"I'm not lying.\" His voice cracked, revealing the frustration he was feeling. \"Tell me!\" \"What?\" \"Tell me!\" \"What do you want to hear?\" She punched his chest again. \"Just tell me!\" \"What!\" he shouted for the first time. \"You're ashamed to be seen with me.\" He began to protest as she continued. \"You're ashamed to go out with me, you're afraid!\" she started wailing on him as she yelled, her composure completely gone at this point. \"You're terrified that you're god damn rich friends won't approve. Just tell me the truth! Just say it! Just tell me the truth!\" she stopped suddenly, backing up a step. It was dead silent for a moment before he spoke, \"You don't understand, that it has nothing at all to do with you.\" He whispered. Without missing a beat she turned and ran away. Duckie watched as a tear dripped down Blanes cheek, which he quickly wiped away. \"Andie!\" he yelled after her, but there was no chance of her coming back. After a moment of staring after Andie, Blane moved from his locker and walked down the stairs, getting out of Duckies line of sight. He wanted to punch the kid in the face more than anything. He was just overwhelmed with anger at not only Blanes behavior but the town they lived in and every single spoiled rich kid inside of it. Fists clenched at his side he was about to just turn around and head to his next class which he was already late for, but then he heard voices come from the stair case. Walking over and looking down he found Blane talking to that asshole Steff he was always with. \"The girl was is and will always be nada.\" Steff said, looking at Blane with complete disgust. Froze in his place Duckie watched as Blane went away and Steff threw his cigarette on the ground- stepping on it and heading up the stairs right in Duckies direction. As he reached the top Duckie moved away from the stairs, and waited until Steff noticed him there. \"You got a problem friend?\" he asked Duckie with a sneer and a condescending tone to his voice. When Duckie didn't say anything in response he turned and began walking away from him. That's when something inside of him snapped. He was fed off with the attitudes and the way the richies looked at them as if they were scum on the bottom of there shoes and he was about done with Blane and everybody he associated with. Andie was a better person than any of them would ever be and it drove him crazy that people like Steff would never see that. Running after him he lunged and tackled him to the ground trying his best to gain control and kick the shit out of him, but eventually he lost it and Steff took over. He punched Duckie in the face a couple times, then pulled him up and slammed him against a locker. This is when Duckie got it together and pushed Steff back onto the floor, punching him back several times. Teachers from nearby classrooms ran out and broke up the fight, but Duckie was not in the mood to get into trouble for this. Steff deserved all the pain he could dish out to him and more. Moving away from them he ran off down the hallway pulling down one of the stupid banners the prom committee had hung up and running off the same way Andie had. After his altercation with Steff in the hallway, Duckie had rode his bike straight home and had stayed locked in his room ever since. Periodically his parents would knock on his door ordering him out, but after a while would give up and walk away. No doubt the school had called and he was in serious trouble, but he didn't really care. There was nothing they could do that would making him fell as upset as he was right now, nothing they could take away from him. Prom? He didn't want to go to that stupid thing anyway. Walking privileges at graduation? It's not like he had any immediate plans for after high school, no college would take him and he was way too scrawny to join the army. He had no clue what time it was, though by the moonlight shining in his window he assumed it was some time after eight o'clock. There was a singular knock on his door and he turned away from it- curling into a ball and closing his eyes tight. After a minute there was another knock. \"Go away mom, I'm not hungry and I don't want to talk about it!\" He shouted. \"It's me Duckie.\" Said a soft voice from behind the door which he would recognize anywhere, though it had been a while since he had heard it address him. He stared at his wall for a moment before slowly standing up and opening the door for her, then returning to his post. Closing his eyes he waited until he felt the bed shift and a body lay beside him. \"Please talk to me.\" Andie whispered, laying a hand on his shoulder. He frowned, she either had cried recently or was currently and that wasn't okay with him. Opening his eyes, he sat up and looked at his best friend since childhood. She looked like a mess, her hair was sticking up in certain places and the whites of her eyes were turned red from crying. \"You look awful.\" He whispered with a wry smile. She choked out a small laugh before bursting into tears which she immediately tried to wipe away with the top of her hand. Duckie pulled her over to him, wrapping an arm around her shoulder and smoothing down the top of her hair, resting his chin on top of her head. \"You were right Duckie; I should have listened to you.\" \"I wish I wasn't right.\" He said honestly, even if he had told her that this was going to happen he hated to see her hurting like this. He had also said when she came crying to him he wasn't going to be there, but there was no way he could do that, he loved her way to much. There was a moment of silence where Andies crying died down and Duckie gently stroked the sides of her hair before she broke the silence. \"Why did you fight Steff?\" \"Do I really have to have a reason to want to punch that guy?\" he said dryly, earning a small smile and laugh from Andie. \"Well no, you don't. But why did you fight him instead of Blane, what did he specifically do at that moment that pissed you off so much?\" Duckie wasn't sure what to say to her, not wanting to hurt her feelings, but he figured the truth was best. \"He was just saying a lot of stuff about you to Blane which wasn't remotely true.\" There was another second of silence. \"Duckie…\" she paused. \"Why do you like me so much?\" Chuckling humorlessly and shaking his head, he looked down at her. \"Do you really have to ask me that?\" he asked, honestly surprised by how low her self-esteem was sometimes. \"You're the most amazing person I've ever met. You're smart, beautiful, you put up with me.\" She chuckled and rolled her eyes. \"You really love me, don't you?\" Andie asked, looking up and making eye contact with him for the first time. In an instant he made a decision he hoped he wouldn't regret, shaking his head in disbelief he leaned down and pressed his lips firmly to hers. There was a moment where she didn't respond and it felt like his heart might have broken out of his chest, but then her lips began moving against his. She pulled away from the kiss after a while and looked at him, her eyes widened. \"Andie, I live to love you.\" He said with a grin, moving a strand of fire engine red hair behind her ear. She looked confused for a second before breaking into a grin herself and throwing her arms around him- pushing him backwards onto the bed.

Or my sappiness. I'm just obsessed with Pretty in Pink, and madly in love with the adorable Duckie Dale. So it just seemed logical to write a fic about him. :P Well, here goes. RR, por favor? There was only one thing on Duckie Dale's mind that afternoon. Then again, that one thing tended to be on his mind most of the time. Whether it was during one of Mrs. Colin's boring European history lectures, or during Mrs. Dietz's excruciating gym exercises, or even while being lectured by Mr. Donnelly, the principal, for talking back to some teacher or another. He didn't care about any of that. One thing was certain, the only thing Duckie truly cared about in the world more than anything was Andie Walsh. But this was no secret. In fact, Duckie told her this a lot. But usually Andie dismissed it with an eye roll or a shrug, believing his obsession to be nothing more than one of his jokes. An eccentricity, perhaps. She never took his love for her seriously. And Duckie was fine with this. In fact, the only reason why he put on his goofball act was to protect himself from getting hurt. He knew Andie would never feel the same way. How could she? She saw him as a friend. Her best friend. Nothing more, nothing less. Duckie pondered this as he sat alone in the cafeteria Wednesday afternoon. He had cut algebra that day in order to save a spot for his beloved friend. She was getting fed up of having to sit outside everyday, due to the richer kids claiming all of the tables inside. So, being the devoted friend that he was, Duckie was determined to get a spot indoors for her. Not too close to the window, as she didn't like sitting in the sun, but far enough away from where the popular kids sat so they wouldn't be bothered. And if any of the richies tried to kick them out, well, then they'd have him to deal with him. True, he didn't have to go through all the trouble just to get a decent spot in the cafeteria, but as long as it made Andie happy, he was content. He truly intended on devoting his life to her. After all, he had truly loved the girl since he was nine. The memories of Shermer Elementary School may be distant to Andie, but to Duckie it felt like only yesterday. He would never forget the moment when he first saw her on the playground, watching her swing on the monkey bars. It seemed like miles off the ground at the time. Even then he had watched her intently, admiring her intense determination to reach that next bar, her short arms straining to grasp every one. Duckie smiled as he envisioned his young self watching her from the swings, remembering how her fiery red hair breezed as she continued her trek across the bars. As she reached for the next bar, Duckie had noticed her hand starting to slip. But Andie was not giving up so quickly. With her other arm, she reached with all her might, desperate to make it to the end of the jungle gym. But her other arm, tired from the day's recess, could barely grasp the other bar, and Andie's sweaty hand soon slipped off the monkey bars. He watched, startled, as she fell the few feet onto the ground, hitting the pavement with a slight thump. Duckie remembered seeing young Andie sitting there in shock for a few seconds, before she calmly sat up and wiped herself off. While she did so, Duckie had noticed a few tears beginning to well up in her eyes. Being the shy boy that he was at the time, he continued to watch from the swing set awkwardly, not sure of what to do. After a few seconds, Duckie began to walk over to the redhead, beginning to worry if she had hurt herself. \"Hey, are you alright?\" Duckie had nervously asked the young girl. She suddenly looked up, now aware that her tears were noticeable. She quickly wiped them away with her scraped hand. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Andie hastily replied. \"I just bruised my leg a little, that's all.\" \"Well, is there anything I can do to help?\" Duckie paused, and noticed a small trickle of blood beginning to seep out of the girl's knee. Andie began to notice as well, and soon her eyes began to well up again. She felt like a sissy, but there was no use trying to hide her tears at this point. Duckie, feeling sorry for the girl, began to dig through his pockets in search of a cure. He seemed to always have a ton of junk stashed away in the pockets of his jacket- buttons, pennies, bits of paper, bubble gum wrappers, paper clips, and- there! A Band-Aid. He quickly fished it out of his crowded pocket and walked over to Andie, knelt down next to her and unpeeled the Band-Aid's seal. Andie watched, teary-eyed and curious. No one had ever been this nice to her before. Duckie quickly got the Band-Aid open, and placed it with as much care as a nine-year-old could muster, onto Andie's knee. He looked up at her after he had finished this procedure, and, noticing her tear-stained face, knelt down again and quickly kissed the bandaged knee, as his mother had done for him numerous times. He looked back up towards Andie and gave her a shy but toothy childish grin. \"There! Now it's all better,\" Duckie exclaimed, glad to have helped his new found love. Andie looked at him, bewildered, but soon returned the smile. Since that day, Duckie had vowed to protect and take care of this girl, no matter what the cost. Now, sitting in the abandoned cafeteria, Duckie remembered the vow he had made those eight years ago. He had kept his promise. He had been faithful to her. He had been the best friend he could be. He gave his life to her, and wanted to be with her in one way or another for the rest of his life. And while Duckie could tell that Andie appreciated his doting, and while he knew that she cared for him just as much, he just couldn't bring himself to tell her what he had been bottling up all of those years. It's not like she would take his confession seriously, so what as the use? For now, Duckie was content with being her friend. She needed him, and he needed her. With all of the hardships the two of them had gone through in their lives, they both needed a friend that would be there for them and do anything for them, no matter what. And Duckie had always intended on living up to that, even as an awkward nine-year-old. The bell rang, indicating that sixth period was over and lunch had begun. Duckie soon began searching for the bright red hair in the mass of students flooding into the cafeteria, until he finally noticed Andie, walking alone and wearing one of her famous volcanic ensembles that he adored so much. She finally saw him, sitting alone at a table across the large room, and smiled, giving him the incredulous look that she usually gave him when he made gestures like these. As Andie began to walk over, Duckie couldn't contain his huge grin. Because no matter how insane she thought he was, he knew that she would always be grateful for all of the affection he showed her. And that made Duckie happier more than anything else. ","Summary":" I haven't written fanfiction is a long ass time...don't judge me. Or my sappiness.

Do you like someone else or something?\" He asked with a smirk. \"No,\"nI replied, while turning to try and open the door of my car he wasnleaning against. \"You'rennot going anywhere,\" He said with his evil smile fading. \" Yes, I am ,\"nI replied while fixing my anger filed glare straight at him. \"Okaynthen, you can go,\" He said in a lighter voice. \"Moventhen!\" I loudly said while gesturing with my hand to where he wasnstill leaning on my car. \"Onnone of these two conditions, that is,\" He said while laughingnlightly. \"Whatntwo conditions?\" I asked, while not really wanting to know what. \"Youneither go out with me this Friday night, or, you tell me who you really like,\" He said with his genuine, cold-hearted smirk. Inalready told you I like no one!\" I shouted in his face, starting tonactually get pissed off at this point. \"Ohncome on, how fucking dumb do I look?\" He more stated than asked. \"Indon't know, that's a pretty leading question, how dumb are you?\" I repliednin a matter-of-fact tone, while yanking on the car door's handle.nIt was no use, though. \"Intold you, you are not going anywhere,\" He said with a smile. \"And I'm telling you that I am, \"nI replied sourly. \"Whyndon't you get make this quicker and easier for the both of us,neither go out with me or just say who you like,\" Steff said in ancalm voice. \"Indon't like anyone !\" Inyelled, full on frustrated and angry now. \" Yes, you do. Inpersonally don't see the big deal on telling me,\" He said whilenshoving his hands deep into the pockets of his white blazer andnleaning back onto my car further. \"Youndon't see the big deal on telling you?! You'll go and tell allnyour rich fucking friends, that's the big deal!\" I shouted atnhim. \"Sonyou do likensomeone,\" He said with a huge smirk spread across his perfect,ntanned face. \"Whyndon't you just fuck off,\" I said while giving him a cold stare. \"Language,nEddie,\" He said with a smirk. \"It's Andie !\"nI said between clenched teeth. \"Whatever.nThey're pretty much the same thing,\" He said with a shrug. \"Youndon't even know my name and you want me to go on a date with you!\"nI screeched at him. \"Indo now,\" He said while laughing. \"You'renan asshole,\" I said while still tugging at the rusted door handle. \"Andnyou're a bitch,\" He shot back in a matter-of-fact voice. Inwas really pissed off by now, and unfortunately it was clear that henwasn't going to let me go. I mean, I don't want to lie to him andntell him I like someone, the last thing I want is a rumor aboutnmyself, but I really don't want to go on a date with him. I mean,nit's Steff .nSeriously though, it doesn't take a genius to figure out his idealndate. \"FinenI'll go,\" I said, finally giving in because more than anything Injust wanted to get home. \"What?\"nHe asked in shock. \"I'llngo on a date with you Friday, if you get off my car,\" I saidncalmly. Henquickly shifted his body off my car and started to walk away thennturned around one last time. \"I'llnpick you up at seven, where do you live?\" He asked. \"Um..\"nI trailed off, not wanting to tell him, nor anyone for that matter. \"It'snnot a hard question,\" He said while smirking, and waiting for mynresponse \"Well...I'llnbe working so you can just pick me up at the record store in thenmall,\" I said, quickly saving myself. I wasn't working but Incould just take a two-hour shift anyway, Iona won't mind, and thatnway he doesn't have to see my house. \"Okay,nI'll see you then, Eddie!\" He said as he turned. \" It'snAndie,\" I said,nticked off. \"Inknow,\" He said with a smirk, then he shoved a cigarette in hisnmouth and walked off. Inwatched as he got in his shiny red sports car, then recklessly drovenoff. Ohnwow, I certainly got myself an interesting date. Inthen got into my own car and started up the engine, and got it goingnafter a few tries. I then drove down the road, headed to my house. AsnI pulled into my driveway I stopped the car. I then got out to see anvery worried looking Duckie. \"What'snwrong Duckie?\" I asked. \"What'snwrong?! Where were you?! It's seven minutes and thirteen secondsnpast when you usually get home! Are you alright?!\" Duckie asked,ngetting very worked up. \"YesnDuckie, cool your jets! I'm fine, I was just talking to someone,\"nI said trying to calm him down. \"Whonwere you talking to?\" He asked raising an eyebrow. \"Steff...\" A/N: REVIEW!!! ","Summary":" 1Summary:nWhat if Andie had said yes to Steff in the parking lot? What doesnBlane do? And what does"},{"Movie":"Pretty in Pink","Title":"The Real Pink","Author":"Appello","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9777394","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I have loved Duckie for as long as I can remember, and since this somewhat random plot bunny attacked me tonight I felt now was as good a time as any to put my version of how this movie should have ended. This is a Duckie/Andie ship to the max, so fans of Blane/Steff may want to steer clear. This scene begins immediately after Blane and Andie's confrontation in the school hallway, where he tells her he cannot take her to the prom, and after Duckie's fight with Steff due to overhearing him insulting Andie. I'm honestly not sure whether anyone even reads Pretty in Pink fanfics, so would really love to hear any comments/feedback from people that do. Anyway, I hope that if somebody does stumble across this story, that they enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. And may the shipping of Duckie and Andie live on forever! :) THE REAL PINK Her vision was so blinded by tears she could barely see the parking lot. Andie strode forward, barely aware of where she was going. Her chest felt tight and her throat burned with unshed tears, but she wasn't going to cry, she refused to cry, she absolutely was not going to – her feet tripped over a rough edge in the bitumen, and she stumbled forward, only catching herself just in time. Despite her best efforts at control a sob ripped out of her, and she felt a tear dribble down her cheek. Pressing the backs of her hands to her face, she squeezed her eyes shut and tried to ignore the furious voices whispering inside her head. How could she have been so stupid ? She had allowed herself to think that Blane was different, that he had really liked her for who she was and not just because she was one of the few girls in school who didn't fawn all over him. But it turned out he was just like all the others. Too concerned about image to ever be seen with someone like her. Too worried about other people's approval, his parents' money, what society would think of him… Why had she ever thought he would be different? Taking a deep breath, Andie opened her eyes and blinked twice to clear her vision. She refused to cry over something so stupid. She had given him a chance and he had blown it – as simple as that. He was no loss, she thought viciously, just another spoilt rich boy who thought they were something special because of their daddy's money. But this idea did not give her much pleasure. After all, if he was a stupid rich kid then what did that make her ? Just another ditzy bimbo like Benny? She should have known it would all end like this… after all, hadn't Duckie warned her – Her eyes burned again at the thought of Duckie. He had told her, he had warned her that this would happen. He's gonna use your ass and throw you away, Duckie had said. Andie clapped a hand over her mouth as another sob seemed to rise up inside of her like acid. Why hadn't she listened to him? Duckie was her oldest, her bestest friend, why had she dismissed his words of caution so readily? If she had only listened to him then she wouldn't be standing here now, having humiliated herself in front of half the school and torn her pride to shreds. There was a crash behind her and she span around. Someone had just stormed out of the school, running at full pelt as though fleeing for his life. Andie stared, her eyes narrowing as the figure drew closer. Didn't she recognise that jacket? And that mop of brown hair and those ridiculous golf shoes... It looked just like – \"Duckie?\" she breathed. Her best friend was running across the parking lot now, completely oblivious to her presence. Without thinking she stepped forward and cupped a hand to her mouth. \"Duckie!\" Duckie jerked as though he had been shot, then whirled in her direction so fast he tripped and fell, skidding painfully against the asphalt. Horrified, she ran over to him. \"Oh my god! Duckie, are you okay?\" He sprang to his feet like a jack-in-the-box, backing away from her as though afraid she might come too close. Andie pulled up short and stared at him in confusion, surprised by his reaction. Sure, Duckie had been ignoring her ever since her date with Blane, and she knew he was angry with her; but acting like she had some kind of contagious disease was a little much. Her gaze drifted over him, taking in his appearance, and she frowned. Her friend was panting, and there was a long tear in his shirt as though someone had yanked on it. His clothing was dishevelled, there were red splotches on his cheeks, and his eyes burned fiercer than she had ever seen before. \"D-Duckie?\" she stammered. \"What's wrong?\" He stared at her for a moment, his chest heaving as he sucked in several deep breaths. She waited for him to speak but he simply continued to stand there. His silence was beginning to unnerve her. \"What happened to you?\" she tried again after a whole minute had passed and neither of them had spoken. Her gaze flitted to his ruined clothing and she frowned. \"Did you – did someone beat you up?\" He made a choking sound, and when her gaze returned to his face she saw that he was glaring at her in what appeared to be utter fury. \"Wh-what is it?\" she asked in alarm. \"Why do you assume someone beat me up?\" he hissed, taking half a step toward her before seeming to reel himself back. \"Why do you always assume the worst about me Andie? Has it ever occurred to you that – \" he broke off, clenching his jaw. \"I…\" Andie could feel tears threatening at the back of her eyes again. On top of everything that had happened to her that day, Duckie's erratic behaviour was just the icing on a very miserable cake. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered, her voice cracking just slightly. The furious expression on Duckie's face flickered. He took a deep breath, exhaling heavily before raking a hand through his hair. As he lifted his arm Andie saw that his knuckles were red and swollen. \"My God!\" she lurched forward and grabbed his hand before he had a chance to snatch it away. \"What did you do to yourself?\" she demanded, running her fingers over his bruised knuckles and ignoring his attempts to pull himself free. \"Duckie – \" she caught his gaze and held it, willing him to listen to her. \"Tell me.\" He ground his jaw, his eyes raking over her face, but she didn't look away. \"Please,\" she said, and his expression scrunched up as though she had played a cruel trick on him. \"I punched him,\" he said stiffly. She gaped at him. \"Who? Blane?\" He shook his head, mouth twisting in a sneer. \"The other one,\" he muttered. \"What… you don't mean Steff, do you? Steff Spader?\" Even when he gave a short, reluctant nod, she couldn't believe him, sure she must have somehow misunderstood. It was absurd to imagine Duckine punching anyone, let alone Steff Spader. \"No,\" she said. Her grip had slackened enough for Duckie to free himself. He took several steps back, bouncing on his feet as though he wasn't sure whether he wanted to break into a run or not. His hands swung together and she saw him wince when his injured knuckles hit the back of his other hand. \"You can't be serious,\" she said when he made no move to respond. \"I… I don't believe you.\" A very bitter, self-mocking expression crossed Duckie's face, and he shook his head. \"That's great Andie,\" he said, taking several more steps away from her. He wasn't looking at her now, she noticed, but staring off to one side instead \"That's really great. Yeah. I'm gonna go and just – I dunno, bang my head against a brick wall, or something.\" He turned to leave, but Andie grabbed a hold of his jacket sleeve to stop him escaping. \"Wait,\" she said hurriedly. \"Just – wait a second, would you? Why would you punch Steff?\" He shrugged a shoulder, his whole posture tense and agitated. \"Oh I dunno,\" he replied in a sarcastic tone of voice. \"Maybe cause I wanted to?\" \"Duckie, I've never even seen you hurt a fly,\" she said. \"Yeah, well, you obviously don't know my violent side,\" he joked. It was the first real 'Duckie' thing he had said all day, and she was so relieved to hear it that she actually laughed. He looked surprised at her response, and for half a second the anger slipped from his face and he looked more like himself. \"But seriously,\" she said, still holding tight to his jacket in case he tried to escape. \"What did he do to you?\" \"To me?\" Duckie's eyebrows rose and he gave her a disbelieving look. \"To me? Nothing. Well – nothing more than usual.\" \"So… I don't understand,\" she continued, speaking softly in case he got annoyed with her again. \"Why did you punch him?\" \"His existence offends me,\" he said evasively. \"Duckie…\" \"I don't know, alright Andie!\" he burst out, shaking his arm to try and get her to release him. \"I'm just – sick of it. I'm sick of all of them, of the things they say, the way they think they can talk about – about – they're muck-rakers!\" \"Muck-rakers?\" she raised an eyebrow, and his lips twitched. \"See, I pay attention in biology,\" he said earnestly. She smiled, feeling the tightness in her chest release somewhat as she did so. Not talking to Duckie had been making her miserable all week, and it was so good to hear his voice that all her other worries seemed to fade into the background. \"Listen,\" she began, knowing she owed him an apology. \"I – \" He pressed a finger to her lips, and her stomach gave a strange little jump. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said gently. \"But – \" \"Andie,\" he said, in a very familiar tone of voice. \"Today I have demonstrated that I am an exceedingly violent man. Do you really think it's wise to cross me right now?\" She rolled her eyes. \"Very funny.\" His eyebrows quirked. \"I'm glad you find my savagery amusing.\" She shook her head, but inside her heart was swelling with happiness. She hadn't realised how much she had missed her friend until she didn't have him anymore. Grabbing his good hand, she began to drag them toward her car. \"Come on,\" she said. \"You're gonna need a strong drink to cope with the pain, I reckon.\" \"Are you casting aspersions on my manliness?\" he demanded in mock outrage. \"Why I'll tell you I've had wounds twice as bad as this and – \" \"Shut up, Duckie.\" Andie had had too much to drink. Duckie could tell from the pink flush that spread across her cheeks and the way she was laughing at everything he said. He watched her with amused affection from across the table as she chortled over something or other, utterly distracted by how beautiful she looked in the dim lighting of whatever bar they were currently in. Her radiance so outshone everything and everyone around her that being close to her was like standing near to a very bright flame, both painful and enchanting. It took him a moment to realise she was speaking to him. \"Er – sorry?\" he said, blinking once or twice and pretending to be somewhat tipsy himself, though he had hardly touched his drink. He wasn't in the mood for alcohol. Andie and he were finally speaking properly for the first time since that rich-boy prick had taken her out, and he didn't want to forget a minute of how it felt to be back to normal. \"I said, \" Andy giggled. \"That I still can't believe you punched Steff Spader.\" He forced a smile, although inside his gut knotted painfully. He was going to pay for that one, alright, if he ever stepped back into that madhouse his parents called a school. Still, it had been worth it, if for nothing else than to see the arrogant smirk wiped off that git's face. And he, Duckie, would be damned if he was going to let anyone speak about Andie like that in his presence… \"You know,\" Andie continued, a frown creasing her features and making her look adorably cute. \"You still haven't told me why you punched him…\" \"I hate this song,\" Duckie said, flapping his hand in the direction of the stage and hoping to distract her from her current line of thought. Luckily, she was drunk enough that it actually worked. \"What!\" she squawked. \"This is a classic!\" \"Overrated,\" he responded coolly. \"You're overrated,\" she retorted. \"My dear Andie,\" he said without a shred of sarcasm. \"To be overrated one must first be rated.\" Her brow scrunched up as she digested this. \"Does that mean…\" she frowned again, and Duckie sat on his hands to stop himself from reaching out to touch her. \"Duckie, are you putting yourself down again?\" \"I'm sorry but I really hate this song,\" he said, fidgeting with his half-full glass of beer. \"It's just… I can't listen to it anymore,\" he stood up abruptly, knocking his chair over. \"I'm sorry but who organises these performances? Where's the quality control? They should look into it – I mean, we're paying customers. In fact, I demand a refund! I should get a refund for having to listen to this song!\" Andie had jumped up too, though she looked mortified at his behaviour. His rant had drawn attention, and several burly looking punks were glaring at him from nearby. Good. He didn't mind making a fool of himself, so long as it got her off the topic of his feelings. \"Will you stop it!\" she hissed at him. \"God Duckie you're such a – \" \"An incredibly discerning musical critic?\" he quipped. \"An outrageously tasteful gentleman? A stylish connoisseur of the modern era?\" \"A jerk,\" supplied Andie, and he gave her another forced smile. \"Come on,\" he said, holding out his hand to her. She was tipsy and it was time for him to take her home. \"Let's go before your daddy gets mad at me for making you miss curfew.\" She scrunched up her nose but took the hand he offered, letting him lead her through the crowded club. He liked these moments, the times when he knew that to outsiders they must look like a pair of young lovers, a boyfriend and girlfriend enjoying each other's company. Even though he knew it wasn't true, he still enjoyed creating the illusion. \"I'm gonna need your keys,\" he told her casually as they exited the club, nodding goodbye to the bouncer, who only glared back. Andie gave him a horrified glance. \"There's no way I'm letting you drive my car.\" \"Well, then we'll have to walk,\" he said with a shrug. \"It's only, what, twenty minutes to your house from here? We could do it.\" \"I'm not walking either!\" \"I'm afraid you don't have any other choice,\" he said, enjoying the way her eyes fixed on him, even if her expression was one of annoyance. It was enough that they were alone together and he wasn't competing with anyone else for her attention. \"I'm perfectly capable of driving myself,\" she argued. \"That's where you're wrong,\" he said, wagging his finger in her face. \"Now give me your keys or I will drag you home by foot, Cinderella.\" She groaned, but handed over the keys nonetheless. When they were inside and he was steering them onto the road, she put her head in her hands and mumbled something. \"What was that?\" he asked. She lifted her head and stared at him. \"I said, I don't know what I'd do without you.\" He felt his heart give a jerk, as it always did when she sprung these unexpected compliments on him. \"I… guess you'd spend a lot more time with your imaginary friends,\" he said quickly to cover his reaction. She snorted and slapped his thigh. He tried to ignore the burning sensation her hand left on his skin, concentrating on the road ahead of him. God knew if he crashed she'd never let him live it down. \"I'm serious though, you know,\" she said after a while. \"You're a special guy, Duckie.\" He groaned inwardly. Why couldn't she leave his poor harangued emotions alone for a night? If she gave him any more hope he might blurt out something that he would regret later… \"Duckie?\" \"Hm, what was that?\" He pretended not to have heard her. She sighed. \"Nothing, I guess. I'm glad you punched Spader though.\" This woman would be the death of him. \"Mm-hmm.\" \"He definitely deserved it.\" \"You betcha.\" \"You know he's always asking me out.\" The car swerved dangerously as Duckie swivelled to look at her. \" What ?\" \"Duckie!\" she yelled at him. \"Watch the road!\" \"What? Oh, right,\" he glanced back in time to narrowly avoid hitting a car coming in the other direction. Whoops. Heart pounding, and not just from the near accident, he glanced at her again, trying to gauge her expression. \"What did you say, just before?\" Andie was clutching her heart, and looked disinclined to answer him. \"About Steff Spader asking me out?\" she said at last. That son of a bitch. Duckie clenched the steering wheel so tight superman himself wouldn't have been able to pry him free. The girl was, is, and will always be nada. It was those words, uttered so casually by that smug prick, that had tipped him over the edge and caused him to launch himself so recklessly at Spader to begin with. And to think that the prick had asked – that he dared to even consider – \"Duckie?\" He jumped, almost forgetting she was in the car there with him. \"Hm, what? I know, terrible business, the poor Bosnians, the Lord only knows what's going to happen to them now…\" \"What are you even talking about?\" He should have punched that git harder. Duckie flexed the injured knuckles on his right hand. Maybe he could have another go? Get himself really suspended this time… \"Honestly, and you reckon I'm too drunk to drive,\" Andie shook her head and blew the hair out of her eyes. \"You're the one we should be worried about.\" He pretended to laugh, though he barely heard what she was saying. He was too busy picturing all the damage he could inflict on Steff Spader if he invested in a pair of steel-capped boots. They weren't really his style but perhaps in this case he could make an exception… \"When did this happen?\" he bit out at last against his better judgment. Andie had been staring out of the window and he probably should have let the conversation slip away, but his curiosity burned too greatly to allow it. \"When did what happen?\" she asked. \"The – the – Spader – you know, what you just said,\" he said, smacking the steering wheel for extra emphasis. \"You mean, when did he ask me out?\" Andie leaned forward, and in the light from a streetlamp they were passing under he saw that she was frowning heavily. \"Well, to tell you the truth it was more along the lines of he just wanted to sleep with me – \" \"I didn't ask for details!\" he interrupted in a high-pitched voice. The very thought of Andie sleeping with that rich git… if he wasn't careful he was going to run off the road again… \"When?\" \"Oh he's been doing it for ages,\" said Andie. \"Why haven't you told me?\" he demanded, trying and failing to keep the offence out of his voice. \"I guess I just never thought to mention it,\" said Andie casually. Too casually; he chanced a glance at her face and knew she wasn't telling him the truth. \"Well,\" he said, taking a left turn rather too forcefully and wincing as he heard the tyres skid. \"If he ever does it again, you make sure you tell me and I'll – \"Brutalise your knuckles again?\" asked Andie sarcastically. \"It'd be worth it,\" he muttered under his breath. \"What?\" \"Nothing.\" They had reached her house. Duckie frowned as he saw that another car was parked out front. And yet the house was dark and suggested her father had already gone to bed. Pulling up slowly, he scanned the front yard for signs of a visitor, and his eyes came to rest on someone sitting on the steps to the front porch. A very familiar someone, that he had only seen a few hours beforehand. \"What's going on?\" asked Andie, clearly noticing the scowl that he could feel had formed on his face. She followed his gaze and he heard her gasp. \"Is that… Blane?\" \"Don't worry,\" he said quickly, barely allowing the car to stop before he jumped out. \"I'll handle this.\" \"Duckie wait!\" He ignored her, stalking up the front path to where Blane sat waiting. He stood up quickly when he saw Duckie, his own expression wary. \"Er… I'm looking for – \" \"I know who you're looking for,\" Duckie said, making his tone as hostile as possible. He wasn't normally an angry person; in fact, Andie was quite right when she said he normally wouldn't hurt a fly. But the memory of Blane's words to Andie in the corridor at school that day was too fresh. And anyone that made Andie cry like that made an instant enemy out of him, the Duckster, for life. Blane swallowed. He glanced over Duckie's shoulder and must have seen Andie, because his face tightened. \"Listen, I only wanted to – \" \"No, you listen, you little toaster,\" he cut him off. \"I'm warning you now that I will rip your limbs off of your body, pulverise them into something that resembles hamburger mince, and feed them back to you with a straw if you so much as look at Andie the wrong way again.\" He paused for effect, enjoying the way Blane was gaping at him. \"Do you understand me?\" Okay, so maybe he watched too many Hollywood movies. But his words had certainly had the intended effect. Rich-boy looked absolutely petrified, and refused to even glance at Andie as she walked up to join them. \"What's going on?\" she asked, standing so close to Duckie that he felt himself literally swell with pleasure. His hand twitched as he thought about putting an arm around her, but he decided that would be overkill and settled instead for smirking at rich-boy, enjoying the odds currently in his favour. \"What are you doing here Blane?\" \"Uh – I just – came to – nothing – I mean – I'll go – so, um, bye,\" he scurried past them. Duckie didn't even turn to watch him go. He closed his eyes and listened to the sound of the car door opening, the rev of the engine and the screech of tyres as rich-boy fled back up the street. Ah, the sweet music of victory. \"What on earth was that all about?\" Andie mused as she fumbled with the door-key. Her movements were clumsy and she was obviously still tipsy. He watched her in adoration. \"Did you say something to him Duckie?\" She span to look at him quite suddenly, and he fixed a blank expression on his face as quick as lightning. \"Me?\" he said, blinking innocently at her. \"Now, why would you think that, Andie?\" \"Because you – oh never mind,\" the door opened and she slipped inside, gesturing for him to be quiet. He motioned zipping his lips together and followed her up the stairs. Andie fell onto her bed as soon as the door was closed behind them, groaning and scrubbing a hand across her face. \"Man I'm tired ,\" she said. \"Lucky we found this bed then, isn't it,\" he joked lightly, shrugging off his blazer and dropping it on the floor. \"We?\" said Andy slyly, her mouth curving upwards in a smile that made it all at once very hard for Duckie to breathe. \"You don't agree that it's fortunate,\" he continued as though she hadn't spoken, now kicking off his shoes. \"That after all the places we looked, we found one right here, at the end of our journey. Just when all hope was beginning to be lost!\" \"You're a dweeb, Duckie,\" Andie mumbled. \"Why thank you,\" he said, perching himself on the end of her bed and taking the opportunity to admire her while she wasn't looking. She was perfect. Utterly perfect. He could stare at her all night and still not have enough of her. \"I can't believe I ever thought Blane was different,\" she sighed, turning her head to look at him. \"You were right about him, Duckie. About everything.\" \"Well yes, I usually am,\" he said lazily. She smiled, and her hand reached out to cover his own. Duckie swallowed, feeling like a lump had formed in his throat, and his chest, and his gut… his arm tingled and he didn't dare move, lest she take her hand away. Her fingers were soft and warm; if he turned his hand, he'd be able to lace them with his own… \"Will you stay for a while, Duckie?\" she asked softly. This was too much. Duckie wanted to raise his eyes to the heavens and ask whatever deity might be up there if they thought it was amusing to tease him in this way; but Andie was still watching him, so instead he simply smiled tightly and said, \"Well, now that you mention it, I did leave my bike back at that nameless cesspit of terrible music...\" She snorted, and scooted over so that he could join her at her end of the bed. Duckie moved slowly, careful not to brush against her. He reached the headboard and tucked himself in like an old man, but Andie immediately rested her head on his shoulder and snaked her arm across his chest. Her thigh pressed against his under the blanket, and Duckie closed his eyes, praying that his body wasn't going to betray him. Gods knew he wasn't cut out for this kind of self-restraint. \"You're the best Duckie,\" murmured Andie, burrowing into his shoulder and causing all kinds of danger signs in his body. Breathe in, out. Count sheep. Don't think about her against you, don't think about her – \"You know that right?\" \"Of course,\" he answered, his voice breaking like a thirteen year old's. He cleared his throat. \"I mean, I get that all the time.\" \"Oh shush.\" Her hand reached up to stroke his neck, and he stifled a moan. This was impossible. He was too highly strung and the day had been too intense to handle this kind of pressure. His lower half was going to betray him and then she would banish him forever and he would be consigned to wandering the streets and picking up cigarette butts and playing a xylophone for his supper like he had seen that man at the end of the street do once and – Andie shifted. He glanced at her to find her staring at him with wide, curious eyes. Uh oh. That look could only mean one thing. \"What's wrong Duckie?\" she asked, confirming his fears. \"You look worried.\" \"Me, worried?\" He attempted to scoff, but it didn't quite come out the way he wanted. \"Please, I'm just – just – \" \"Just?\" Just really desperate to kiss you . \"Oh shit,\" he groaned, shaking his head like a dog to try and clear it. Everything was getting foggy. \"What is it?\" Andie demanded, clearly alarmed by his behaviour. Her hand clung to his, preventing him from making a mad dash for the door. \"Er… I just remembered, I've got a… an uncle from – from Ukraine, coming over tomorrow. Yep, damn uncle. Completely forgot that I had to – to vacuum the house and – and bake cookies and – I mean, I wish I could stay really but I – \" he was rambling, he knew he was rambling, he knew Andy knew he was rambling, but really what else could he do in this extremely compromising situation? Pin her to the bed and kiss her until she forgets her own name. \"Sweet Jesus!\" he yelped, leaping backwards and forgetting she still had hold of her hand. They both toppled off the bed, Andie landing on top of him and knocking the air out of his lungs. \"Duckie!\" she giggled, looking down at him from her position straddling his chest. \"What are you doing?\" This situation was approaching catastrophic proportions. He had to do something, and quickly, before he lost all control. But there was very little he could do when she was perched on top of him like she currently was. He could feel her thighs against him, the warmth of her body; he could see her breasts through the thin material of her shirt. He groaned, his hands trembling, powerless to stop his own reaction. \"Duckie?\" Andie's voice had changed, and he knew the game was up. He summoned one last, desperate attempt to avert disaster. \"You – you should get off,\" he whispered in a strangled voice. \"Go… back to bed Andie.\" \"What, and leave you here on the floor?\" she leant closer to him, smirking wickedly. Her breasts were almost touching his chest now, her lips only a few inches from his. \"I don't think so. Maybe I'll just – \" He rolled them over quite suddenly, so that she was lying on the floor, and before she could speak he captured her mouth with his. He groaned as their lips met, the tight ball of tension erupting in his stomach and causing his whole body to tingle with the ecstasy of kissing her. He couldn't help it, she tasted too good, her lips were too soft… With an almost superhuman effort of self-control, Duckie pulled back a fraction, enough to break the kiss and stare into her eyes. He was panting as though he had run a marathon, and he knew she must be able to feel the rather telling lump pressing into her abdomen. Andie's cheeks were flushed and her eyes a little glazed. She stared up at him in shock, as though unable to believe what had just happened. There was a moment's silence. Duckie held himself very still, waiting for the moment when she would leap to her feet and admonish him, ask him what on earth he thought he was doing, why he thought he had the right to maul her when she was innocently lying in bed ready to go to sleep… he winced as he imagined the accusations that were about to be thrown at him, the rejection that he had always dreaded, the certainty that came with the knowledge that she now knew, irrevocably, just how badly he wanted her… When she didn't move, and just continued to stare at him in shock, he opened his mouth to attempt some kind of explanation. Wild excuses ran through his brain, each one more unbelievable than the last. You had something on your mouth… I thought you looked like you were choking… I had a seizure… I'm actually madly in love with you… \"Andie,\" he croaked. \"I – \" She seized a fistful of his shirt and pulled him back down, her lips crashing back against his. For a second Duckie thought he must have been concussed; maybe he'd hit his head without realising it and this was all some kind of wonderful dream. But her body was warm and real beneath him, and he didn't have the strength to deny what she was offering. She was kissing him back. She was kissing him back. She was kissing him back. She was kissing him back. His hands slid down her body, the touch of her warm, soft skin almost burning him. He rolled again so she was back on top, straddling him once more, and there could be no denying what his body was announcing now. She must have been able to feel the pressure of his erection against her, but she showed no sign of stopping. Instead she whimpered, and her tongue flicked out to run along his bottom lip, sending him into orbit somewhere up around Saturn. Sweet holy lord Jesus, this was better than he had ever dreamed. With one hand, he stroked the silky hollow of her neck that had always fascinated him, while his lips continued to massage hers, and drew great satisfaction when he heard her moan softly in response. Oh yes, he could definitely get used to this… A car alarm erupted somewhere down the street. The sound took a moment to permeate Duckie's foggy brain, but when it did it was like a jackhammer pounding into his blissful, sweet oblivion. He felt Andie freeze above him, and cursed all the deities he had been heaping praise on only seconds ago for interrupting them. Clearly, the universe enjoyed tormenting him. Andie's eyes were wide as saucers as she drew back from him. He studied her reaction like a scientist pouring over a microscope, searching for any hint of regret or horror or disgust or any of the reactions he had been expecting when he kissed her. But all he could find was shock, and embarrassment, and perhaps a tinge of disappointment that the kissing had ended. \"Wow.\" Somehow he had found his voice. It sounded like dried up sandpaper exposed to a desert sun, but considering he had been doubting whether he would ever speak again a minute or so ago, he was willing to take it. Andie blinked. She pushed herself off him and slid onto the floor. \"Yeah,\" she said. Her voice was thick and reminded him of what it had felt like to kiss her. He tensed, and only the continuing car alarm in the distance prevented him from dragging her back to him. For a long time, neither of them spoke. Eventually, the siren outside faded to silence. Duckie was still lying on his back on the floor, staring at the ceiling and wondering if he had imagined everything that had just happened. He had spent so long convincing himself that Andie didn't share his feelings, that she would never respond to him the way he wished she would, that to see his conclusions so thoroughly contradicted had left him feeling somewhat adrift. Of course, he was floating on a cloud of happiness, but part of him was terrified that it was all just an illusion, and that at any moment it was going to burst and he would find himself back where he started, playing best friend to a girl he was hopelessly, irreversibly in love with. He jerked when he felt Andie's hand slide into his again. She lay down next to him, resting her head on his shoulder, and he put an arm around her to draw her closer. \"Duckie?\" she asked, her voice soft and tentative. He closed his eyes, deciding he could listen to her say his name like that for the rest of his life. \"Mm?\" \"Will you go to Prom with me?\" The smile that spread across his face right then could probably have powered its own lighthouse. Duckie certainly felt as though he had electricity coursing through him. \"Andie my love,\" he said. \"I'll be the best damn Prom date you've ever had.\" She laughed, and kissed his jaw. \"That sounds good,\" she murmured. \"Doesn't it,\" he agreed. \"You know, I think things are really starting to look up.\" And for the first time in a long time, he believed it.

Those rights belong to John Hughes. Author's Note: Drabble, future fic. I'm not really sure how I feel about this one, but regardless, enjoy! Pairing: slight undertones of Steff/Andie This isn't love, it's an obsession. The thought strikes her like a heavy handed blow and it's almost enough for her to pull her keys out of the ignition and go back inside, resuming another night of restless sleep. Almost, but not quite enough. After nearly sputtering out twice, the engine roars to life, the familiar purr soothing her nerves slightly. It wouldn't be long before it gave way to rust and age, but the idea of parting with her beloved little pink car made her stomach fill with dread. It was foolish of her to think that this would remain a constant in the chaos she called life, but it didn't stop her from holding on; the only things she had left these days were hope and dwindling dreams. The winding pathways are familiar, shifting and narrowing with every curve, and if she just looks at the asphalt, she can pretend things have never changed; the city is still full of life and the shops are buzzing with activity, the raucous laughter of youth filling the spaces in between. The little yellow slip above Trax catches her gaze and her knuckles turn white as she veers the car around, ignoring the heat beginning to pool around her eyes. Everywhere she looks is another reminder that time waits for no one; all the condemned buildings surrounding her are shrouded with melancholy and regret. The debris begins to lessen as she travels further away from the urban dwellings that riddle her memories and towards the area that haunts her dreams; perhaps, there's a chance that it's still standing tall and proud amongst the decay. She slowly parks the car along the side of the road, barely daring to chance a look at it; what she finally does see is terrifying. The once beautiful colonial home is now a phantom of it's former glory; the roof is concaving in, while the oak railings are rotting, and the once manicured lawn is now full of twisting vines and snares of weeds. The young girl inside her looks on with eyes of mourning, languishing every crack, every splinter; the woman she has become only sees the decay of the inevitable. Even armed with the knowledge of the present, nothing can ease the dull, all encompassing ache that is creeping it's way into her chest. Her trembling hand gropes for the shift, before she pauses, catching sight of something faint and glowing out of the corner of her eye; towards the house, there's flickering spark that quickly dies out into a burning ember. Her hands settle back onto the steering wheel as she peers out of the window; she can just barely make out a silhouette, curtained underneath the sagging terrace. The burnt sienna rises and falls against the darkness in dull, monotonous pattern; like a firefly that's forgotten how to use it's wings. After a few moments, a man walks out of the shadows, his step no longer filled with the jaunty swagger she once knew; his stance is now firm and solemn, a funeral march to ghostly notes. The moon highlights his silhouette, disarming her; aside from a few weathered lines, he looks almost identical to his former self. She had almost forgotten that he once lived there, all those years ago, back when the house was still full of life and splendor. She would think that he would be thrilled to see it's decline; after all, he had been watching it's descent from the wings, basking in the afterglow of lust and bourbon, the ruler of a lascivious hive of hormones and chaos. Her heart stops when those hardened, glacial orbs catch her own, illuminated by the light of nicotine. There are no formalities, no wooden stares, no sneers, just a quiet moment of understanding; they're the last two people left invested in this small town and soon, it will vanish too, leaving them orphans of a dying dream. He breaks her gaze, flicking the ashen remnants of his cigarette to the ground and for once, she thinks, she may have been wrong about him. While it might have been destructive, he too, loved this house in his own way. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own anything from Pretty in Pink. Those rights belong to John Hughes.

Always.\" Blaine said, causing Andie to flinch when he kissed her cheek. Wordlessly he turned and headed for the exit as tears filled Andie's eyes, and threatened to fall. \"Andie, you came here alone.\" Duckie said, smiling. \"Okay, you're right. He's not like the others. If you don't go to him now, I'm never going to take you to another prom ever again.\" She didn't know whether to laugh or cry, and suddenly she was more confused than she'd ever been in her entire life. What was she supposed to do now? She cared for Blaine; that was certain, but after he backed out on taking her to the prom, she began to rethink their relationship. Sure, he was gorgeous, but there had been so many times that he treated her badly. How could she not have noticed? He forced her into going to that awful party after she told him she was uncomfortable there. The last thing she wanted to do on a Friday night was hang out with his jerk friends; Benny and Steff. It was bad enough that she didn't want him to see her house, but being in that huge mansion with all those \"richies\" made her feel worse than ever. And there were the comments he made about hanging out with her friends and crawling under a rock? Just thinking about it caused a tear to escape, and she quickly brushed it away. She looked around quickly, hoping no one had noticed. \"Hey...\" Duckie said, touching her cheek. \"Are you okay?\" She sighed. \"You know what? I think I'm just gonna go home. This was a majorly lame idea. I don't know what I was thinking. Goodnight, Duckie.\" \"Andie, Wait!\" Duckie called as she rushed toward the exit. He hurried to catch up with her and when his fingertips brushed her shoulder, she whirled around to face him. Now the tears that threatened had started to fall. Damn... I should have stayed at home with Daddy. \"Duckie, I'm gonna go home. It was stupid of me to even think this was a good idea.\" She said, trying desperately to keep her voice from breaking. \"And miss your Senior Prom?\" Duckie asked, in disbelief. \"I'm sorry but I simply can't allow it.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Duckie smiled and motioned to a gorgeous boy with sandy blonde hair, and steel blue eyes. He wore a black tux with a grey bowtie and cummerbund that made his eyes seem brighter than they really were. \"Who's that?\" She asked. Duckie shrugged. \"Beats me, but he sure seems to know you. He's been checking you out all night.\" When she locked eyes with the boy, he smiled at her. Nervously she looked at Duckie, who nodded his approval. \"Well, what are you waiting for?\" Her mouth went dry as she slowly walked toward the boy. \"Hi.\" \"Hey.\" The boy said. \"Do I know you?\" \"Um... No actually, but I know you.\" At her confused glance, he smiled and extended his hand. \"I'm Eric.\" \"Andie.\" She reached for his hand, and gasped lightly when he kissed it. \"Andie. Yeah, that's right. I've always thought you had such a cool name.\" Eric said. \"Wow, that was... incredible.\" Duckie mused. Andie blinked, suddenly remembering that her friend was still there. \"Eric, this is Duckie, Duckie, this is Eric. Eric is...\" \"In your English class. I'm sorry. I should have said that before.\" Eric said, shaking Duckie's hand. \"English? Really? I don't remember seeing you in class.\" Andie said. Eric shrugged. \"I sit in the back, but I tend not to talk much. You know how Mrs. Davidson is.\" Andie laughed, thinking of her overbearing teacher. \"Totally!\" \"Well, I just wanted to formally introduce myself.\" Eric said. \"I'm sorry that I interrupted your date.\" \"She's not my date.\" Duckie said quickly. \"Although I wish.\" He added under his breath. \"What was that?\" Eric said. Andie shot Duckie a look. She'd known him so long that she could practically read his thoughts. After all, they'd been best friends forever. If it weren't for Iona and Jenna, he'd be her only friend. \"You're alone?\" Eric asked. Andie's face suddenly burned with embarrassment. \"Yeah, how lame is that, huh?\" \"It's not lame at all. I came here by myself, too.\" \"Really? Why?\" Andie asked, amazed that a guy would dare come to the Senior prom alone. Well, except for Duckie, that is. \"Well, it's the last dance we'll ever go to as high school students, so I figured I might as well make an appearance.\" Andie smiled. \"That's true.\" Eric was silent for a minute, unable to take his eyes off of her. \"Can I say something incredibly bold?\" \"Sure, I guess.\" Andie said, knowing that whatever he said couldn't possibly be worse than the things Blaine had said. \"You look absolutely gorgeous.\" Eric said. Andie felt her heart swell with emotion. No guy had ever said something so romantic, although Duckie, the sweetheart, tried his best to sweep her off of her feet. \"That's what I told her.\" Duckie said. \"She's stunning.\" \"Duckie...\" Andie said, blushing like crazy. To Eric she said. \"Thanks.\" \"No problem. It's the truth.\" Eric said with a smile. \"I've never seen a dress like that before.\" \"I made it.\" Andie said. He looked at her in amazement. \"Really? Wow... That's... incredible.\" \"Thank you.\" She said, suddenly unable to stop smiling. \"So... would you like to dance? That is if Duckie doesn't mind.\" Andie looked at Duckie, who nodded. \"By all means, go ahead.\" Eric took her hand and led her onto the dance floor. It must have been fate, but the DJ picked that exact moment to play her favorite song. The one she dreamed of dancing with a boy to some day. And now that day had finally come. At the Senior prom! Suddenly she felt like screaming with happiness. Instead she moved toward him and put her arms around his neck as they swayed to the most romantic song ever written. She moved closer, catching a whiff of his intoxicating cologne. \"You have a nice voice.\" He said. Her heart beat faster when she realized she'd been singing along with the words. \"Thanks. Wow, that's embarrassing. Sorry.\" \"No, really. I like it.\" Andie felt as though she were dreaming. Before she could stop herself, she laid her head on his chest and closed her eyes. She could feel his arms around her, and suddenly she was happier than she'd ever been in her life. She looked up and saw Duckie, watching them with a smile on his face. She smiled back, and blew a kiss to him. The song ended sooner than she expected. \"Well, thanks for the dance.\" Eric said. \"See you around?\" Andie smiled. \"I'll be right back, okay?\" \"Sure.\" Andie walked toward Duckie. \"Andie, what-.\" She opened her arms, hugging him tightly and then kissed him on the cheek. \"Wow... what's that for?\" He asked; his face reddening. \"For being so wonderful.\" Andie said with a smile. \"Looks like someone is waiting for you.\" Duckie said, pointing to Eric. \"Thanks, Duckie.\" Andie said as tears filled her eyes. But this time they were tears of happiness; for her dreams had finally come true. ","Summary":" \"I love you... Always.\" Blaine said, causing Andie to flinch when he kissed her cheek.

She rolled over and looked at the alarm clock on her bedside table. 2:38 AM. Normally she was a sound sleeper, and it was unusual for her to have woken in the middle of the night like this. Then she heard an undistinguishable noise from down the hall where Matilda's room was. Matilda! Jenny turned on her bedside lamp, grabbed her robe from the hook on the back of her bedroom door, and stepped out into the hallway. Sure enough, there was a sliver of light under Matilda's closed bedroom door. What on earth could Matilda be doing awake at this time of night! Jenny padded down the hallway and knocked softly on Matilda's door before pushing it open gently. \"Matilda?\" she said softly. \"Are you alright?\" Jenny was not expecting the scene that greeted her. She saw Matilda's bedsheets bundled into a pile on the middle of the bedroom floor, and Matilda, her light brown hair toussled from sleep, soundlessly closing the dresser drawer that contained her nightgowns. Matilda jumped when she heard Jenny, a nightgown and a pair of underwear clutched in her tiny hands. \"Miss Honey!\" she exclaimed nervously. \"I- I'm so sorry I woke you. Everything's okay, you can go back to sleep!\" Jenny noticed a large wet spot on Matilda's pink and blue striped nightgown and immediately knew what had happened. \"Matilda,\" she said gently, walking over to her newly adopted daughter and kneeling down to her level. \"Did you wet the bed?\" Matilda's eyes filled with tears that threatened to spill. \"I'm so sorry, Miss Honey. This doesn't usually happen. I- it's just this one time, I promise. Please don't be mad! It won't happen again!\" \"Matilda,\" whispered Jenny, gently stroking the child's hair. \"It's just a little accident, it's not a big deal. Why on earth would I be mad at you, sweetheart?\" \"I- I didn't mean to make a mess. I- I'll clean it up!\" Matilda stammered. \"Matilda,\" said Jenny, taking both of the child's hands in hers. \"You're not even seven years old yet, and you've just been through some very big changes in your life,\" Jenny reminded her, referring to the fact that only three short weeks ago Matilda's birth family had abruptly moved out of the country and abandoned her, leaving her in Jenny's care. \"It is so common for children your age to wet the bed once in a while, and especially given all that you've been through. And I certainly don't expect you to clean this up yourself.\" Jenny studied Matilda's downcast eyes and defeated expression. It was so unlike Matilda, who was typically so precociously self-assured and rational, to overreact like this. Then Jenny had a thought. \"Matilda,\" she said slowly. \"Has this ever happened before? At your old house?\" Matilda nodded, eyes still downcast. Now they were getting somewhere. \"Can you tell me what happened?\" Jenny asked gently. Matilda sighed, and reluctantly began to speak. \"I was four,\" she started. \"I had been out of diapers for a long time and I'd never had an accident before, but one night I had a nightmare and I woke up and I'd wet the bed. I wasn't sure what to do and I knew I couldn't reach the clean sheets from the top shelf in the closet, so I went and got my mom. I never should have done that,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"She yelled at me and said that I was disgusting and that only babies wet the bed. Then she said to clean it up and to never bother her with something like that again.\" Jenny was horrified. She could not even fathom treating Matilda the way Zinnia Wormwood had treated her own daughter. \"I only had a few more accidents after that, Matilda continued, \"but I always made sure to just clean it up quietly myself without anyone finding out.\" \"Oh Matilda,\" breathed Jenny, stroking Matilda's cheek. \"No child should ever be treated like that.\" If I had been your mother back then I would have reassured you and comforted you and helped you , thought Jenny fiercely. \"That's not even the worst part,\" said Matilda glumly. \"What happened next, sweetheart?\" asked Jenny, both scared to know just how horribly this poor child had been treated in the past, but also desperate to know so that she could better understand and help her. \"Then,\" Matilda continued, \"my dad came storming in to see what all the yelling was about. When my mom told him what I'd done, he grabbed me by the back of my neck and shoved my face into the pee on the bed, and then he lifted up my nightshirt and spanked me. Hard.\" Matilda took a deep, ragged breath. \"And he told me what a bad girl I was. When my mom was walking out of my room, she said to him, 'Matilda was such a MISTAKE. I should have just had an abortion when I had the chance.' I didn't know what that word meant- abortion- so I had to look it up at the library the next day.\" Matilda shuddered, as if physically trying to dislodge the memory of whatever results her research had shown her. Jenny felt her blood turn to ice in her veins. She inhaled sharply and met Matilda's gaze. \"Oh Matilda, how awful! I'm so sorry you had to hear that and experience that. That is so terribly cruel and, quite frankly, insane . You were just a little girl. You still are.\" Jenny could not imagine, in a million years, abusing and lashing out at a four year old child the way the Wormwoods had. A four year old child they were supposed to love and protect and take care of. A four year old child who had come to them for help . No wonder Matilda had been so scared and upset about what Jenny's reaction would be to her wetting the bed. Suddenly, the tears in Matilda's eyes that had been threatening to spill let loose. Jenny pulled Matilda towards her in a loving embrace as the small girl sobbed into the crook of Jenny's neck. Jenny gently placed Matilda onto her lap and held her as the child continued to sob, letting out all of the hurt that she had been holding inside of her for so long. Jenny stroked her hair and whispered soft reassurances. \"Shh, it's okay. It'll be okay. You're safe, and I love you and I want you. I want you so very much and I'm so happy that you're my little girl now.\" Jenny felt her own nightgown grow damp from Matilda's urine soaked nightgown, but that was her last concern. Her first priority, for as long as she lived, was going to be to protect Matilda and to make sure that she felt loved and safe and appreciated and wanted. It was the very least she could do after everything Matilda had done for her. As Matilda's tears finally subsided into soft hiccups, Jenny felt the exhausted child's head rest on her shoulder. The little girl was so worn out from her cry that her body had gone completely limp in Jenny's arms. \"Matilda, sweetheart,\" whispered Jenny. \"Let's go get you cleaned up and into something dry, and then get you back into bed.\" Jenny gently picked Matilda up and felt Matilda's little legs wrap around her waist and her arms curl around her neck. Jenny felt her heart swell with a maternal love so fierce that it almost took her breath away. Jenny had always wanted to be a mother, but never thought motherhood was something that would actually happen for her. She had been under her Aunt Trunchbull's control for so long, living in poverty and having her self esteem gradually chipped away as the years went on until there was practically nothing left. Eventually Jenny was left with such little confidence in herself that dating seemed out of the question. And until Matilda- wonderful Matilda- had come along and helped to banish Aunt Trunchbull and regain Jenny's home and rightful inheritance, raising a child as a single woman, on her pittance of a salary, had seemed out of the question. Jenny had felt such a special connection with Matilda from the very first day she walked into her classroom, before Jenny had any inkling at all of what Matilda's home life was like. She never could have dreamed back then that Matilda would eventually end up being her daughter. Matilda truly was a miracle to Jenny. Jenny carried Matilda down the hall to the bathroom and gently set her down. Matilda was still clutching the nightgown and underwear that she had selected from her dresser. Jenny took them out of Matilda's hands and placed them on the floor. \"Here, let's get you out of this wet nightgown.\" Matilda hesitated for only a brief moment before lifting her arms up in the air, allowing Jenny to pull the wet nightgown over her head. Jenny then pulled down Matilda's soaking wet underwear as the child resignedly stepped out of them. As Matilda stood before her, naked, looking so heartbreakingly little and vulnerable, it occurred to Jenny that this was the first time she had seen her new daughter naked. Not that seeing Matilda naked was something she had been anticipating, of course. It was just something that popped into Jenny's head, that most parents get to raise their children from birth, changing them and feeding them and bathing them. And even then, typically children as young as Matilda still need some help in the bath or with taking care of themselves. Matilda, however, had come into Jenny's life as a fully self-sufficient six year old. Jenny felt her face burn with anger as she thought of the reason why Matilda was so self-sufficient at such a young age. Matilda's parents were so neglectful and unloving towards Matilda that the child didn't have a choice but to learn to take care of herself. Jenny imagined that at some point Zinna Wormwood had to have changed baby Matilda's diapers (she couldn't imagine Harry Wormwood involving himself with ANYTHING regarding caring for his daughter) and bathed her, but she didn't imagine it was done with the frequency nor the love and care that Matilda needed and deserved. Jenny's only regret was that she had not come into Matilda's life sooner, sparing Matilda so many years of growing up feeling unwanted and unloved and constantly being told what a burden she was. Jenny, who had experienced a traumatic childhood of her own, was able to understand Matilda in a way that no one else in the young girl's life had ever even come close to. Matilda, likewise, understood Jenny wholly and completely. Both of them knew exactly what it was like to be so little and to feel so very alone in a big world, turning to books as an escape. The two of them had quickly formed a very strong emotional bond. But, unlike Jenny, Matilda seemed remarkably untouched by the trauma she had experienced in her young life. Despite facing daily verbal and emotional abuse and then complete and total abandonment by her family, Matilda was so brave, and strong and resilient. Sometimes Jenny had to stop and remind herself that Matilda was not a miniature adult, but a little girl who just happened to be wise and mature beyond her years. Jenny reached over and removed a pink washcloth from the towel bar on the wall, and ran the tap until warm water began to flow. She wetted the washcloth with warm water and began gently and lovingly wiping down Matilda's legs, which were coated in dried urine. Normally this was something that Matilda could have easily done for herself, but as it was 3 AM and Matilda had cried herself into sheer exhaustion, Jenny knew that right now Matilda was not the self-sufficient genius who had been bathing herself since the age of two, but a six year old little girl who needed to be loved and taken care of. \"Matilda,\" Jenny said gently as she wiped the child's legs. \"If this ever happens again, I want you to walk down the hall and come get me, okay?\" Matilda nodded unsurely. \"Sweetheart,\" Jenny continued, making eye contact with Matilda. \"I promise that I will never, ever , yell at you or hurt you or humiliate you. You can always come to me if you need help.\" Matilda nodded again with slightly more confidence. Jenny moved the washcloth higher up Matilda's legs until she was gently wiping Matilda's vagina and bottom. Jenny felt Matilda stiffen. She looked up and saw that Matilda's cheeks had turned pink and that she had turned her head away. It occurred to Jenny that since Matilda had been taking care of herself for so long, she probably had no memory at all of anyone taking care of her or touching her, let alone in such an intimate place on her body. \"Oh Matilda,\" Jenny said with understanding, her heart swelling with empathy for the little girl. \"There's no need to feel embarrassed. It's just me. I'm your mother now and I love you and I want to take care of you the way you deserve. Okay?\" Jenny smiled reassuringly at the little girl. Matilda nodded back. Jenny finished tenderly wiping the folds of skin between Matilda's legs and then retrieved the clean underwear, holding them out for Matilda to step into. An exhausted Matilda, barely able to keep her eyes open, stepped into the leg holes and stood patiently as Jenny pulled them up. She then lifted her arms so that Jenny could slip on her clean, dry nightgown. Jenny picked her up and kissed her cheek. \"Let's get you back to bed, sweetheart.\" \"What about the sheets?\" Matilda asked, rubbing her eyes. \"They're all wet and on the floor, and I didn't put new ones on yet.\" \"I'll tell you what,\" said Jenny. \"Tonight you can sleep with me in my bed. We'll take care of the sheets tomorrow.\" Matilda nodded, the first hint of a small smile creeping onto her face. Jenny carried the little girl down the hall and tucked her into bed. She then crawled into her side of the bed and reached over to turn off the light. 3:12 AM , she thought, glancing at the clock. Thank goodness today is Saturday and we can sleep in. \"Try to get some sleep now,\" Jenny whispered, gently stroking Matilda's soft brown hair. \"Mmm,\" sighed Matilda, already halfway asleep. \"I'm so glad you're my mommy.\" Tears formed in Jenny's eyes as she lay there in the dark, listening to her daughter's deep, even breathing. It was the first time Matilda had referred to her as mommy . She liked the sound of that. \"Me too, Matilda,\" she whispered. \"I love you so much.\"[Chapter 2] Author's Note: This was originally just intended to be a short story but I had so much fun writing it I decided to expand it. The next morning Jenny woke up and stretched lazily as she glanced at the clock on her night table. 9:15 am! Jenny could not remember ever having slept that late before. She looked over at Matilda, still asleep with her arms above her head like goalposts, and smiled. My daughter , she thought happily. I have the most wonderful daughter in the world. Jenny got up to use the restroom, and as she quietly tiptoed back to her side of the bed, she saw Matilda start to stir. \"Good morning honey,\" Jenny whispered, stroking Matilda's hair affectionately. \"How did you sleep?\" Matilda yawned. \"Really well. And… sorry again about last night. Thank you for being so understanding.\" \"Matilda, sweetheart,\" said Jenny, opening her arms for Matilda to climb into. Matilda scooted over eagerly and melted into her mother's arms, resting her head on Jenny's shoulder. \"You don't need to keep apologizing. Please talk to me and tell me what's on your mind so that I can know how to make you feel better.\" \"I guess…\" started Matilda. \"I guess I was just scared.\" \"What were you scared of, honey? I really want to understand.\" Matilda sighed. \"The past three weeks have been… the best of my life and the happiest I've ever been. I've never felt loved or wanted before and it feels like a dream come true that you adopted me. I was just scared that I had gone and messed it up. Like maybe you'd decide I was too much trouble and change your mind about wanting me.\" Jenny's heart broke for Matilda. \"Matilda,\" she said, pulling the child in even closer to her and kissing her forehead. \"You say the past three weeks have been the best of your life, but what you aren't taking into account is that the past three weeks have been the best of my life. Everything good in my life that I have is because of you. I was very lonely before you came along. Adopting you and becoming your mother, and having the privilege of being the person who gets to take care of you and protect you and love you, it's filled me with more happiness and more of a sense of purpose than I ever thought I could have. I wouldn't trade this for the world. As a matter of fact, you could wet the bed every night and it wouldn't change how much I love you and how much I love being your mom. Okay?\" Matilda nodded, wrapping her arms around Jenny tightly. \"I love you too.\" \"Matilda, is there anything that I can do to reassure you about things? Please tell me if there is.\" Well,\" said Matilda. \"My parents never told me that they loved me, or that they were proud of me. They never really said anything to me at all except to call me stupid or to yell at me to leave them alone. When you tell me you love me, and that you want me, and that you're proud of me, it makes me feel so good about myself. I think I already know deep down that you feel that way about me, but it just really helps to hear it.\" Jenny smiled. \"I'll tell you what, Matilda. From now on, I'm going to tell you I love you so much that you're going to get sick of hearing it and you'll beg me to stop!\" Matilda giggled. \"No way! Not possible!\" The two fell into a comfortable silence as they cuddled in Jenny's big comfortable bed. \"Matilda, what would you like to do today?\" asked Jenny after several minutes. \"We have a whole Saturday ahead of us with nothing scheduled.\" Matilda looked out the window and took in the grey skies and steadily falling rain. \"Can we make pancakes for breakfast and then cuddle in bed and read?\" \"That sounds like an amazing way to spend a rainy Saturday morning!\" exclaimed Jenny. \"What book did you have in mind?\" \"I borrowed To Kill a Mockingbird from the library,\" replied Matilda. \"Oh Matilda, I don't know,\" said Jenny hesitantly. \"While To Kill a Mockingbird is certainly a magnificent piece of literature, I think some of the subject matter is a little too adult for you.\" Jenny did not want her six year old daughter to read about rape, even if it wasn't described in explicit detail. One of the unique challenges of raising a child of Matilda's off-the-charts intelligence was keeping her intellectually stimulated while also keeping her in age-appropriate material. It was a very fine balance Jenny was still trying to learn how to strike. While Matilda's intellectual development was at an adult level, in every other way she was still an innocent six year old little girl who loved to have fun and play with her friends. After Miss Trunchbull left Crunchem Hall, Jenny created a specially structured schedule for Matilda. She moved her to a sixth grade class for math, science, reading, and social studies, but made sure that Matilda still had lunch, recess, music, and art classes with her friends her own age. While Jenny certainly placed utmost importance on providing academic curriculum that would keep Matilda engaged and challenged, it was almost an even higher priority to her that Matilda's emotional and social development remain on track with children her own age. Jenny wanted her daughter to have as happy and normal of a childhood as possible. Thus far, Matilda seemed to be flourishing with her new schedule, and was thrilled to have time built into her day to play with Lavender, Amanda, Nigel, and all her old friends. When Matilda started to protest, Jenny stopped her and said \"Sweetheart, I love that you want to challenge yourself and I support that completely, but you will just have to trust me that the subject matter in this book is not appropriate for your age.\" When she saw Matilda's disappointed expression, she smiled and said, \"Anyway, I have something I think you'll like even better.\" Jenny gently extricated herself from Matilda's arms and padded across the plush carpet over to her closet. She rummaged around for a minute or two until she emerged with what she had been looking for. \" Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone !\" exclaimed Matilda. \"I've heard about Harry Potter but I haven't read it yet!\" \"I think you will love it! Did you know that Harry is raised by an aunt and uncle and cousin who treat him very poorly? And, like you, he has magical abilities that ultimately end up helping him escape his situation and find a better life with people who love him and appreciate him. I think you'll really relate to him.\" Matilda's eyes lit up. Pancakes forgotten, she curled up against Jenny and opened the book to chapter one. Jenny and Matilda cuddled and read until they could no longer ignore their growling stomachs. Jenny glanced at her bedside table. 11:38. \"Matilda,\" she smiled, placing a kiss on Matilda's forehead. What do you think about pancakes for lunch?\" Matilda smiled that big gap toothed grin that Jenny adored. \"Yes, please!\" As they sat at the kitchen table contentedly chowing down on their pancakes, Jenny posed a question to Matilda. \"Matilda,\" she began. \"I had something I wanted to ask you.\" Matilda looked up curiously and met Jenny's gaze. \"What's up, mom?\" she asked. \"Well, started Jenny, breaking into a smile upon hearing Matilda call her mom . \"I know that your parents never provided you with any lessons or extracurricular activities of any sort, and I was curious if there was anything you wanted to try out. A sport, or an instrument perhaps?\" Matilda furrowed her brows and pursed her lips together in the adorable way that she always did when she was deep in thought. She only had to think for a few short moments before she shyly offered, \"Well, I've thought for a long time that it would be really cool to do gymnastics.\" \"Gymnastics!\" exclaimed Miss Honey. \"I had no idea that was an interest of yours!\" \"Well I read a book about it in the library and I've always admired the blend of strength and grace and flexibility it requires, not to mention the mental concentration,\" started Matilda. \"Plus Amanda Thripp takes gymnastics and whenever she talks about it it sounds so fun.\" \"I'll tell you what,\" said Jenny. \"I'll give Amanda's mother a call this afternoon and get some information about the gym Amanda goes to. Then I'll see what I need to do to get you registered in a beginner's class.\" \"Thank you thank you thank you!\" exclaimed Matilda, leaping out of her seat and wrapping her arms around Jenny. Jenny chuckled at her daughter's enthusiasm. Matilda was always full of surprises! Jenny had expected that Matilda would request something more cerebral, like piano or violin lessons, but Jenny was excited by the idea of Matilda trying a sport. She spent so much time reading and studying, which of course Jenny was thrilled about, but perhaps a sport like gymnastics would really help Matilda to be more well-rounded in her activities. \"Mom?\" Matilda asked. \"Yes, dear?\" \"I have a question for you too. I've been wanting to ask you for a long time but I wasn't exactly sure if I should. I don't want to upset you, but... I was just wondering… when you were a little girl. You said that the Trunchbull hurt you. What, exactly, did she do?\" Jenny inhaled sharply. \"Matilda, why are you asking?\" \"Mom, you know how you always say that you want to understand what I've been through so that you can help me better?\" Jenny nodded. \"Well,\" continued Matilda, \"I feel the same way about you.\" \"Matilda,\" she said, meeting the little girl's inquisitive dark blue eyes. \"Just like with To Kill a Mockingbird , you are going to have to trust me when I tell you that you're too young to hear of such things. My childhood was very unhappy, and it's my goal to make sure that your childhood is the exact opposite. It's just too disturbing to discuss. And I appreciate how much you love me and care about me, I appreciate it more than you'll ever know. But sweetheart, it's not your job to take care of me. I'm the grownup and it's my job to take care of you and protect you.\" \"Please, mom? I just want to know.\" \"No, Matilda. I'm sorry but the answer is no and that's final.\" As Matilda looked away and took another bite of her pancakes, Jenny watched her and thought to herself, NEVER. Never will your head be filled with the horrors of my childhood. The horrors of what she did to me. What she made me do. Never .[Chapter 3] Author's note: This chapter contains some sexual content. Jenny got off the phone with Jean Thripp feeling confident about enrolling Matilda at GymStars. Jenny had had a long list of questions to ask Amanda's mother. Of course she had questions about the cost and things of that nature, but the majority of her questions revolved around safety. Matilda's safety was the most important thing. Were the coaches competent and experienced? Was there adequate supervision? Did the instructors undergo background investigations? Jenny imagined that with gymnastics there would be instructors giving hands-on corrections and spotting, and she wanted to make sure that anyone who would be touching her little girl was safe. Jean Thripp assured Jenny that all of the coaches were wonderful and had undergone background investigations. Most of them were former elite and collegiate gymnasts. She also reassured Jenny that there was a comfortable viewing room for any parent who wanted to sit and observe, which Jenny found very reassuring. As Jenny hung up the phone, she glanced over at Matilda and smiled. Matilda, who was curled up in the big bay window with a book, appeared to be fully engrossed in the adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but Jenny knew she was listening keenly to Jenny's end of the phone conversation. Jenny walked over and sat down next to her daughter. \"Good news, Matilda,\" she said with a smile. \"Amanda's mom had nothing but wonderful things to say about Amanda's gym. I'm going to call over there now and see what I can do about getting us in for a tour and getting you signed up.\" Matilda broke out into a huge toothy grin and threw her arms around Jenny's neck. \"You're the best mommy in the whole world! Thank you!\" Jenny brushed Matilda's bangs off her forehead and gave her forehead a kiss. \"I love seeing you so happy and excited, sweetheart. I've got to say, I'm really marveling at the fact that just a few months ago I was a single schoolteacher living in a rundown cottage and barely scraping by, and now not only am I a school principal living in a big, beautiful house, but I'm a mother to the most wonderful little girl and I'm about to be a ' gymnastics mom '! It's amazing how much life can change on a dime.\" \"Still single, though,\" Jenny added with the shrug of her shoulders. \"Do you ever think about dating, Mom?\" asked Matilda with an earnest expression on her face. Jenny sighed. \"Honestly, Matilda, my life feels so perfect and content just the way things are right now. Maybe someday, but I'm still getting used to my newfound freedom and getting to do the things that most women my age have been doing for years.\" Jenny knew that most 30 year old women were much more experienced with men than she was. When Jenny was a teenager, most girls her age were getting their first kiss and testing the waters with fooling around with boys. Jenny, however, lived in constant fear of her aunt. If she did not come home straight from school and account for her whereabouts every minute of the day, her aunt would punish her. Making any kind of social plans over the weekend was out of the question. Jenny would be expected to be at home, cleaning and cooking. Jenny had never dared to even think about stepping a toe out of line because her aunt's punishments were so… humiliating. So awful. Jenny hated to think about it. Jenny was too embarrassed to admit to anyone that not only was she a virgin, but she had never even kissed a boy. A man. Up until two months ago when Matilda saved her from the life of servitude she had been stuck in since the age of five, Jenny hadn't even had the chance. She had no idea at all what to do! It was embarrassing to admit that she was just about as clueless as her 6 year old daughter when it came to relations with the opposite sex. Of course she had masturbated , Jenny thought to herself, feeling her face flush. The thought of feeling the thickness and the pressure of a man between her legs pushing himself inside of her instead of just her own fingers was so… so… \"Mom? Earth to mom!\" giggled Matilda, shaking Jenny's arm. \"Are you okay? You looked like you were a million miles away just now!\" Jenny cleared her throat. \"Oh my! I just got lost in thought there. Why don't you go on upstairs and take your shower while I call the gym? If we're lucky, maybe we can swing by this afternoon.\" \"Okay!\" agreed Matilda cheerfully, carefully marking her place in her book before setting it aside. Jenny watched her bounce happily up the stairs. What a wonderful, agreeable child , she thought to herself with a smile. How did I get so lucky? Jenny Googled the phone number for GymStars and pressed call. A cheerful voice answered, \"GymStars, this is Pam!\" \"Hi, Pam,\" started Jenny. \"My name is Jennifer Honey and I'm interested in enrolling my 6 year old, soon-to-be 7 year old daughter, in a beginner's class.\" \"Great!\" replied Pam. \"Well as the school year is winding down, the current sessions will be wrapping up soon and we've got our summer sessions starting in about three weeks. As luck would have it, we just had a cancellation and have one slot left in our Level 1 class that meets Mondays and Wednesdays at 4:30PM. Would that work for you?\" \"That sounds perfect,\" said Jenny. \"Wonderful!\" said Pam. \"I will warn you that classes fill up fast, so I would recommend that if you're ready to move forward with enrolling, to do it ASAP. If you're available, you can bring your daughter over any time this afternoon. I'm the membership coordinator here, so I'd be happy to give you a tour and go over all of the paperwork with you and answer any questions you may have.\" Jenny assured Pam that they would be there in about an hour and hung up. Jenny went upstairs to start getting ready. As she reached the top of the stairwell, the bathroom door opened and a stark naked Matilda emerged in a cloud of steam. \"Matilda!\" Jenny exclaimed. \"Where's your towel, sweetheart?\" \"I forgot it in my room!\" called out Matilda as she streaked down the hall, leaving a trail of small wet footprints. Jenny chuckled. Even though Matilda's wetting the bed the night before had embarrassed the little girl, Jenny felt that in an odd way the incident had been an essential bonding moment for the both of them. Matilda had always been more than just one of her students to Jenny, and in the three weeks since Matilda had become Jenny's daughter, the two of them had lived blissfully, almost as if in a fairy tale. But Jenny felt that behind all the levity, Matilda had a wall up that Jenny hadn't quite managed to break through. Based on what Matilda had said last night, Jenny knew that Matilda was afraid that it was all too good to be true and that Jenny would get bored of her or change her mind about wanting her. Jenny had a feeling that Matilda was trying to be on her best behavior and to be the perfect daughter, when all she wanted was for the little girl to be herself and feel at home. Jenny thought that the previous night, when she had gotten to hold Matilda and comfort her, and see her at her most vulnerable and help clean her, that maybe Matilda finally understood that Jenny was in this forever and that she wasn't going to abandon her. Whereas up until last night Matilda had still been calling Jenny Miss Honey , she was now saying mom and mommy with ease. Something had shifted since last night and Matilda just seemed so much more relaxed and comfortable today, which thrilled Jenny. 24 hours ago, Matilda would have been mortified for Jenny to have seen her without her clothes on. Now she seemed just like any normal, happy 6 year old in the presence of her mom. Jenny opened her closet to select an outfit for the day. It appeared that the rain had stopped for the remainder of the day and that it was actually shaping up to be a beautiful and sunny mid-May afternoon. Jenny selected a pair of khaki pants, nude ballet flats, and a pale pink and yellow floral print blouse. She laid the outfit out on her bed and then stripped out of her pajamas. She stripped off her clothes, pulled on her bathrobe, and made her way down the hall to the bathroom. As the hot water washed over her, Jenny ran the soapy washcloth over her skin. Once she was clean, Jenny continued to stand under the cascade of hot water, letting her mind wander back to where it left off earlier. She cupped her hands over her small, perky breasts and massaged them. She wondered what it would feel like to have a man's hands on her breasts. The thought of it gave her an excited, tingly feeling. She traced her fingers over her nipples, feeling them harden. As her breath quickened, she let one of her hands trail down her stomach, past the neatly groomed thatch of hair, letting her fingers trace the pink folds of skin between her legs. She explored the opening, allowing two of her fingers to slip inside. A moan escaped her lips. She moved her fingers inside her, slow at first, then gradually picking up speed. Jenny could feel her vagina swell and throb with desire as she imagined a man inside of her, thrusting himself in and out… in and out… Oh god, it felt so good. Jenny braced her left hand against the shower wall as she fingered herself faster and faster. She felt the tingly sensation continue to build until she felt the intense burst of an orgasm. Jenny had to bite her lip from crying out as her body quivered. It lasted for several long, satisfying seconds until it began to subside. Jenny knew it was perfectly normal for a woman her age, in her sexual prime, to masturbate and have fantasies. Still, Jenny felt like a naughty teenager for what she had just done and giggled. She turned off the shower and dried herself off. As she made her way back down the hall towards her room, she peeked into Matilda's room and saw that her daughter had dressed herself in her favorite dress- pale blue and white seersucker with small red strawberries embroidered throughout. She had just tied her signature red ribbon in her hair and was combing her straight brown bangs neatly over her forehead. She looked adorable. Jenny closed her bedroom door behind her and got dressed. She called the cab company, requesting pickup in ten minutes. One of the many things that made Jenny feel very behind other people her age was that she didn't have a driver's license. One of the first things she had done after her Aunt Trunchbull had disappeared back in early April was go to and obtain her learner's permit. One of the other teachers at the school, Alison Casey, who was about Jenny's age, volunteered to take Jenny out in her car twice a week after school for Jenny to practice. One of the many added bonuses to Agatha Trunchbull's absence was that the teachers had become more social with each other, finally having the freedom to enjoy their workplace. Jenny had really enjoyed the time she spent with Alison, and the two were becoming good friends. On the days that Jenny had her driving lessons with Alison, Matilda would walk home with Hortensia, an older girl who lived just three blocks over. Hortensia would stay with Matilda and they would play games or do their homework together. Jenny knew that Matilda was perfectly capable of minding herself for an hour and a half while Jenny wasn't home, but it wasn't legal to leave a 6 year old home alone and Jenny wanted someone home with her just in case. On the days that Jenny didn't have her driving lessons, she and Matilda would walk home from school together. Jenny could not wait to get her driver's license and buy a car. It would be so nice to have the freedom to take Matilda more places, not to mention being able to drive to school on rainy days. For the time being, she and Matilda were getting along just fine without, but it was a matter of pride for Jenny and she felt embarrassed by being a 30 year old woman without a driver's license or a car. One thing at a time, thought Jenny, as she made her way downstairs to wait with Matilda for the cab.[Chapter 4] Author's note: Trigger warning, this chapter contains descriptions of sexual abuse suffered by Jenny as a child that may be disturbing for some As Jenny and Matilda sat on a bench under the shady tree out front, with Matilda snuggled up against her, Jenny felt that life had never been better for her. Jenny's mind began to drift to a time when life had never been worse for her. \" What exactly did the Trunchbull do to you? \" Matilda's words echoed in Jenny's mind. As Jenny's thoughts continued further down the rabbit hole, she was suddenly no longer an adult woman sitting on a bench with her daughter, but was a naked five year old in a bathtub. Jenny sat in the tub, running the soapy washcloth over her skin, shivering in spite of the hot water encasing her small body. She could feel her aunt's eyes on her. Aunt Trunchbull always insisted Jenny keep the bathroom door open when she bathed, and would just stand there at the door, staring at her. It was so uncomfortable. Bath time was terrifying for Jenny. If her aunt thought she had missed a spot or not washed thoroughly enough, she would grab Jenny by the back of her neck and force her head under the water. The first several times it happened Jenny would scream in terror, choking on the bathwater and clawing at the sides of the tub in panicked desperation. Jenny, however, came to realize two things. First, screaming would cause her to swallow and inhale more water. Secondly, seeing Jenny's terror made her aunt… gleeful. Her Aunt Trunchbull enjoyed seeing her suffer. At only five, Jenny learned that, while she was completely at the mercy of her cruel aunt, the one thing she could try to control was her reaction to the abuse. Jenny always tried her best to remain stoic and not give her aunt the satisfaction of seeing her pain or fear. Of course, some times that was easier than others. When she saw her aunt coming for her, right before her big meaty hand would clamp over the back of Jenny's neck, Jenny would inhale as much air as her five year old lungs could hold, pinch her nose shut, and pray that her aunt relinquished her grip on the back of her neck before she ran out of air. Jenny always had to come straight home from school. There was cooking, and cleaning, and laundry to do. Jenny tried her hardest to obey her aunt's orders and not give her any reason to punish her, but if there was one thing about Agatha Trunchbull it was that she thrived on punishing Jenny. She would always come up with something, no matter how neatly Jenny folded the laundry, or how perfectly she prepared dinner. The perfectly baked garlic bread was \"burnt\", or the neatly folded towels \"looked lumpy.\" Jenny learned early on that she could never win and that it was pointless to think she could. Around the time that Jenny turned nine, her aunt's punishments took on a new sick and twisted form. Jenny had come home from school and taken the trash out. She grabbed a new trash bag to line the can with, but then glanced over and realized she hadn't yet preheated the oven for her aunt's dinner. She set the trash bag down on the table and raced across the kitchen to the oven, setting it to 350. Then, thoughts of preparing her aunt's dinner distracted her as she began bustling around the kitchen, gathering the ingredients and utensils she would need. Jenny was so absorbed in meal preparations that she hadn't heard her aunt sneak up behind her. \"What is THIS?\" hissed her aunt dangerously, her hot, fetid breath on the back of Jenny's neck. Jenny felt a shiver ripple down her spine. She turned around and saw that her aunt was holding the trash bag that she had not yet lined the can with. \"I- I'm s-sorry Aunt Trunchbull,\" Jenny stammered. I was getting your dinner ready and-\" \"Take off your clothes,\" her aunt hissed in a near whisper. As terrifying as it was to be yelled at by her aunt, it was even more terrifying when she spoke like this. Jenny knew something awful was about to happen. \"My- my clothes?\" asked Jenny with confusion. \"Now? I don't understand, it's not bath time yet, and I-\" \"TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES!\" bellowed her aunt, spittle flying from the corners of her mouth. \"You, Jennifer Honey, are a slovenly, lazy, nasty child and haven't earned the right to wear clothing in my house tonight. Take them off right this instant or I'll give you something to be sorry about!\" Jenny, quivering with fear, her face burning with humiliation, unbuttoned her dress with trembling hands and stepped out of it. Jenny stood before her aunt, her frail, malnourished body clad only in a pair of plain white cotton panties, shivering. \"And your underwear too,\" said her aunt with an evil glint in her eye. As Jenny slid her underwear down to the kitchen floor and stepped out of them, tears pricked the corners of her eyes. She took a deep breath and steeled herself. She would not let her aunt see her cry. Her aunt stood before her, her eyes running up and down Jenny's naked, trembling body. \"Finish making my dinner!\" ordered her aunt. Humiliated, Jenny resumed preparing her aunt's dinner. Stark naked. Jenny had never felt lower in her entire life. Her aunt only allowed her one meal a day, and on school days Jenny always chose lunch so that she could fit in with the rest of her classmates. Today had been a school day, which meant that Jenny was preparing a meal that she would not even get the chance to eat. Oh but her aunt would make her sit at the other end of the dining table and watch her eat. She knew it was torture for Jenny, whose stomach oftentimes audibly growled so loudly her aunt could hear it from across the long table. And she would smile every time she did. Tonight was even worse, because not only was she expected to sit, starving, watching her aunt consume a large hearty meal that she had prepared, but she had to do it naked. As time went on, Jenny's aunt found more and more occasions to punish her by denying her the right to wear clothes at home. Jenny thought that it couldn't get any more humiliating than it already was. That is, until Jenny's body began to change. Jenny was 13, and was on her hands and knees, naked, scrubbing the kitchen floor. Her aunt sat at the kitchen table, devouring a grotesquely large piece of chocolate cake, watching her. Jenny was no longer a young child but, due to malnourishment, was behind the rest of her peers developmentally. Most girls by now had been getting their periods for at least a year or two and were wearing bras. It was just within the past few weeks that Jenny had noticed small, barely-there breasts beginning to bud on her chest. Much to her horror, she had also discovered a few fine brown hairs beginning to grow \"down there\". She was self-conscious enough about these changes in her body, but lived in fear of what her aunt would do when she noticed. Then, one day, Jenny was setting her aunt's dinner down on the table in front of her, naked of course due to one of her many perceived indiscretions, when her aunt suddenly began laughing. Jenny always knew that something cruel was about to happen when her aunt laughed. \"Well look at that!\" exclaimed her aunt. \"Look at what?\" asked Jenny fearfully, her eyes at her feet. \"THIS!\" exclaimed her aunt gleefully as she roughly pinched one of Jenny's tiny, budding breasts. Jenny could not control her response and yelped in pain and humiliation. \"Little Jenny's finally getting some tits!\" Jenny's face burned. She remained silent as she stared at her feet in complete disgust and horror. \"Any other fun new surprises I should know about?\" cackled her aunt. Her aunt suddenly bent over at the waist, her face mere inches away from Jenny's privates, inspecting them. Jenny felt her aunt's hot breath on her privates and felt like she was going to throw up. \"Well look at that!\" she exclaimed. \"Little Jenny is becoming a woman.\" She reached her large, calloused hand towards Jenny's privates and, before Jenny even knew what was happening, her aunt had plucked one of Jenny's new pubic hairs and held up the small brown hair between her thumb and pointer finger, holding it in the air like a trophy. Her aunt cackled like a madwoman while Jenny tried to swallow down the bile that was rising in her throat. Less than a week after that horrible evening, Jenny got her first period. It was dinnertime and, like so many nights, Jenny was sitting naked at the dining table watching her aunt consume a meal she had prepared, while her own stomach growled with hunger. Her stomach felt extra achey today, which only made the hunger pains more excruciating. When her aunt was finished, Jenny got up to clear her plates. She happened to look down at the seat cushion and gasped. There, on the ivory upholstery, was a red stain. Now that she was standing up, Jenny could feel the wetness between her legs. Jenny panicked. How was she going to hide this from her aunt? What was she going to do? She could push the chair in and hope her aunt wouldn't notice, and then sneak down in the middle of the night once her aunt had gone to bed and try to clean the stain. \"What are you looking at, Jenny?\" her aunt asked accusingly, snapping Jenny out of her thoughts. What could possibly be so important that you are delaying clearing my plates?\" \"Um… sorry… I, um…\" Jenny stammered. \"What are you looking at?\" her aunt repeated more loudly. When Jenny couldn't find the words to formulate a response, her aunt stood up rapidly, her chair clattering backwards onto the floor. She paced across the room angrily and looked down at the seat cushion. \"WHAT did you do to my dining room chair, Jennifer Honey?\" hissed her aunt dangerously. \"I- it- it appears that I've gotten m-my first period, Aunt Trunchbull,\" Jenny managed to stammer. \"You've ruined my chair. You filthy, nasty, disgusting excuse for a girl. You need to be taught a lesson,\" sneered her aunt. \"No, Aunt Trunchbull. Please!\" cried Jenny. Any time her aunt decided she was going to \"teach her a lesson,\" it always ended very badly for Jenny. Once, when Jenny was seven, one of her aunt's \"lessons\" ended with a trip to the emergency room, under the guise that Jenny had \"fallen down the stairs\", and Jenny's left arm in a cast. But it was too late. Jenny watched her aunt storm across the room and grab the broom Jenny had been using earlier to sweep the floor. Using her brute strength, she snapped the broom handle in half, and turned to face Jenny with a cruel smile on her face. \"Please, Aunt Trunchbull, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! Please don't beat me!\" \"Beat you?\" her aunt laughed cruelly. \"Oh no, little Jenny. I have something else planned for you.\" As her aunt approached her menacingly with the broom handle, Jenny suddenly knew what was about to happen. She couldn't control the gutteral scream that erupted from her throat as the assault began. A scream that didn't end until ten minutes later when her aunt had finally stopped, leaving Jenny, lying broken and bleeding, on the kitchen floor. Somehow, Jenny managed to fall asleep that night, after tossing and turning for hours. Her privates ached, matched only by the aching shame in her heart. As Jenny drifted off to sleep, she thought to herself that this couldn't go on any longer. There was not one good, happy thing in her life, and she didn't want to live anymore. She decided that she would take her own life, and finally be reunited with her parents again. The last people who had ever shown her any love, whom she hadn't seen in so long. Jenny couldn't even remember her mother, and despite how fiercely she tried to hold on to memories of her father- King Magnus, even those memories were beginning to fade with time. The thought made Jenny so sad she felt like she could barely breathe. As thoughts of her pain and suffering finally coming to an end filled her head, Jenny finally drifted off to sleep. That night, Jenny had a dream. In her dream, she was an adult woman. She was sitting on the front porch of her house, only the house looked like it used to back when her mother and father were alive, and it was pretty and there were flowers and no chipped paint. It was a beautiful spring day and she was wearing a pretty floral dress. She was pouring tea. There was someone else sitting at the table. A little girl with brown hair. In her dream, Jenny knew that this girl was her daughter. The girl looked up at Jenny with the sweetest face Jenny had ever seen and smiled. A sense of bliss came over Jenny. Suddenly, the dream shifted and she was walking down a path with her father. Jenny was no longer an adult woman and was back to being 13. Magnus suddenly stopped walking and turned to face Jenny, taking both of her hands in his. \"Jenny,\" he said, urgency in both his voice and his eyes. \"HOLD ON, Bumblebee, hold on, please. Stay alive, it's not your time yet. What you've just seen is going happen for you. Stay alive for her. She needs you.\" With that, the dream faded and Jenny woke up with a start. At school that day, Jenny couldn't concentrate in her classes. Was it true? Was the dream real? Was she going to be a mother to an adorable little brown haired girl someday and be happy? Jenny couldn't explain it, but she knew that her father visiting her in her dream was real. And her father would never lie to her. Somehow, she was going to escape this hell she was stuck in and have a good life. She just had to hold on. That afternoon, Jenny sat alone at a small table in the library, working on her homework. She shifted uncomfortably, the wadded up toilet paper she'd stuffed into her panties chafing her raw, sore skin. Jenny stretched her legs out and felt her right foot kick something. Jenny bent down to look underneath the table and saw a blue notebook. She picked it up and opened it, figuring that the owner might have written his or her name on the inside cover. But it was blank. As a matter of fact, the whole book was blank. Jenny knew that she should turn the notebook in to the Lost and Found, as it certainly belonged to someone who was missing it. But she didn't. Jenny couldn't bring herself to tell anyone about what was happening to her at home. She was too filled with shame and, besides, who would believe her? Agatha Trunchbull was a former Olympian who had won two gold medals and a silver medal for her country. People respected her. No one except Jenny knew what she was like behind closed doors. But now, Jenny had a diary. A diary that she could tell everything to without fear of judgment. She had to keep it secret though. If her aunt found it she would probably kill her. Jenny heard other kids throw that phrase around loosely. \"If I fail this test my parents will kill me\" or, \"My mom will kill me if she knows I lost my necklace.\" But Jenny knew what Agatha Trunchbull was capable of, and she knew that if her aunt found her diary that she very well would kill Jenny, just like Jenny knew deep down that she had done to Jenny's father. But Jenny could write in her diary at school, if she got her homework done fast enough and had time leftover. And she could write late at night, after her aunt went to sleep. She even had the perfect hiding spot- the loose floorboard underneath the area rug in her bedroom. She knew her aunt didn't know about that, and would never find it there. This small act of rebellion against her Aunt Trunchbull made Jenny feel more alive than she'd felt in years. Jenny hastily finished her homework and then pushed it aside. She picked up the blue notebook, opened it to the first page, and began to write. \"Mom? Mom?\" Jenny was snapped out of her thoughts by her sweet little girl tugging on her blouse. \"Mom, the cab is here!\" said Matilda excitedly. Jenny stood up, took her daughter's small hand in her own, and made her way to the cab. ","Summary":" Jennifer Honey opened her eyes, taking in the pitch blackness of her bedroom. She rolled over and l"},{"Movie":"Matilda","Title":"Mackenzie Wormwood","Author":"PerkyGoth14","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12436386","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was a normal day in the Wormwood household, Matilda was sitting away from most of her family reading from a book she had borrowed from the library. She had been going to the library since she had been able to walk there. Zinnia was sitting on the sofa with her husband, watching the 'Million Dollar Sticky' game show. The other children were watching with their parents. A teenage girl who seemed to be stuck there and a pre-teenage boy who was into the show like his parents were, almost like a mindless zombie. Matilda glanced over at her family and then back to her book, becoming lost in the world the stories created for her. Zinnia let out her annoying laugh as she found the show hilarious. Harry laughed with his wife and only son. The teenage girl who was named Mackenzie glanced back over to her little sister. Matilda seemed absorbed in her book, but managed to sense her sister's presence and glanced up at her with a small smile. Mackenzie decided to join Matilda and gave a small smile. Harry was not going to be happy about that once he would notice while the others watched the rather trashy TV show. Matilda tried to quietly help her sister, sharing the reading of the book and trying to teach her sister to read. Zinnia didn't notice, but even if she would, she didn't care really. A knock was heard at the door. Mackenzie let her finger slide across the words like many kids Matilda's age did, but there was an issue for Mackenzie herself: She did not know how to read or write despite being in high school. Matilda quietly continued to help Mackenzie. She didn't seem to mind helping her sister. Mackenzie may have had a six-year-old sister who was very intelligent, but it was probably a good thing since younger sisters often asked their older siblings for help in this sort of thing and Matilda already knew most of this stuff since most of her life. \"Packages at this hour?\" Harry wondered as he went to get the door. When he answered the door, there was a young blonde girl, around Matilda's age, standing on the doorstep in a ballerina dress. \"Good evening, Mr. Wormwood, sir... I was wondering if Matilda and Mackenzie were in?\" she asked him with a respectful smile. It didn't show any teeth but was a genuine smile. \"Matilda and Mackenzie?\" Harry replied which made the girls soon turn over to the front door as they had company. Matilda looked over. \"Yes, sir, I was wondering if they could come out to play a little while, oh, and Daddy sent this over for you.\" the girl, or Lydia as she was called, said and held up a package wrapped in brown paper. \"Well... It's TV time... Eh, whatever...\" Harry shrugged as he accepted the package. Mackenzie soon walked over and smiled to see that it was Lydia. Matilda got up, hid her book away carefully, and then joined her sister. \"Thank you, sir,\" Lydia smiled. She then looked at Matilda and Mackenzie. \"Would you both like to come outside to play?\" she asked them. Harry mumbled as he then went off. Mackenzie smiled. \"I'm good with that, how about you, Matilda?\" she then asked her younger sister. \"Okay.\" Matilda nodded with a smile. She preferred to read but she could never say no to Mackenzie and Lydia. Lydia giggled and smiled, but still wouldn't let her teeth show. \"Let's go to the tree-house.\" she told them. \"Sure!\" Mackenzie beamed as she loved to climb. Matilda nodded too. \"Okay... But we gots to be quiet... Daddy fell asleep a few minutes ago.\" Lydia told them. \"Oh... Right.\" Mackenzie soon cupped her mouth. Matilda nodded. Lydia took them quietly past her living room window, and then into the backyard. \"Okay, follow me.\" she told them quietly and started to climb up into her tree-house. Mackenzie and Matilda followed after Lydia. Matilda followed carefully. Lydia gave them both a pillow to sit on comfortably. Harry sat down with his package while Michael and Zinnia were still into the show. Zinnia looked at Harry. \"Who was that?\" she asked. \"I think that was the neighbor kid Lizzie.\" Harry shrugged as he decided to check out the package. Mackenzie smiled to Lydia. \"Thanks...\" She said quietly and gently. \"Thanks, Lyddie.\" Matilda smiled. \"I thought you guys would need a bit of time away from families.\" Lydia said, and rubbed her cheek absently. \"Yeah... You have no idea...\" Mackenzie admitted. Matilda smiled. \"I borrowed another book from the library today.\" she said to their friend. \"Cool... Wish my daddy would let me get some books.\" Lydia smiled. \"You wanna check this one out?\" Mackenzie offered. \"It's a wonderful fable from what I hear so far... Sometimes I wish I could make up my own stories, but... I can't write... And I'm fourteen-years-old...\" she then expected Lydia and Matilda to laugh at her since that was how she was treated by almost anyone else she encountered, but she knew they wouldn't. \"If you want Kenzie, I can help you.\" Matilda said sweetly. Lydia smiled at Mackenzie. When she did, she showed some teeth and showed one of her front ones to be missing. \"Oh, you don't have to do that...\" Mackenzie told her little sister before gasping slightly at Lydia's teeth as she noticed a dramatic change. Matilda smiled at Mackenzie. \"I want to,\" she smiled. She then noticed the look and smiled slightly. \"You lost your first tooth finally?\" she asked. Lydia gave a small slow nod. \"Oh!\" Mackenzie beamed once she saw that was actually a good thing. \"Congratulations... You should be getting a visit from the Tooth Fairy!\" Matilda smiled. \"The... Tooth Fairy?\" Lydia asked tilting her head. \"You haven't heard?\" Mackenzie pouted. Matilda smiled. \"Well, Mackenzie can tell you all about it.\" she said. \"You'll tell me Kenzie?\" Lydia grinned. \"If you would like, I remember when I was your age though, I was kinda scared...\" Mackenzie giggled. \"But it's a sign you're growing up.\" Matilda smiled. Lydia looked like she was hooked on every word Mackenzie was telling her. \"Basically, you put your tooth under your pillow before you go to sleep, then the Tooth Fairy comes and takes your tooth, and leaves you a present with a wave of her magic wand,\" Mackenzie explained. \"Lots of times, money.\" \"Oh... Maybe she'll come to visit tonight then!\" Lydia grinned. \"Just remember to put your tooth under your pillow.\" Mackenzie smiled back and nodded. Lydia's smile then went away a little. \"What if you don't haves the tooths no more?\" she asked then. \"You could get your mommy or daddy to write a note.\" Matilda suggested. Mackenzie wasn't sure how to answer this one. Lydia nodded. \"I'll try asking Mommy,\" she said. She then hugged her friends with a smile. \"You guys are the bestest.\" she told them. Matilda smiled a little. \"You are the best too, Lyddie.\" Mackenzie also smiled. Lydia smiled happily. \"So, you boths want a juice boxes?\" she asked them. \"Ooh, yes please.\" Matilda smiled. \"Apple?\" Mackenzie asked. Lydia handed Mackenzie an apple juice box and gave Matilda her favorite too. She herself had an orange juice. \"Oh, yeah...\" Mackenzie smiled as she enjoyed the sweet taste of her apple juice. Matilda enjoyed her orange juice. \"Mmmm... Orange~\" Lydia hummed. \"Apple is better.\" Mackenzie teased. \"Nuh-uh, oranges is.\" Lydia said, sticking her tongue out. \"Yes, orange is better.\" Matilda joined in. \"Apples and oranges~\" Mackenzie randomly sang. Lydia giggled quietly. \"I wonder if Daddy will let me go to school.\" Matilda then said. \"It would be good for you.\" Mackenzie agreed with Matilda's decision to go to school. Lydia hummed. \"Maybe if you convince your daddy, mine will let me go too.\" she smiled. \"It has to be boring lying around home all day.\" Mackenzie said to the younger ones. \"Lying around? Daddy makes sure I pull my weight.\" Lydia said, sounding shocked. \"Oh, well, Matty tells me she usually just hangs out in the house and reads her books...\" Mackenzie shrugged. \"Okay, so you both work on your daddy, I'll work on mine to help us go to school.\" Lydia smiled. Matilda nodded, looking excited about that. \"Deal.\" Mackenzie agreed as she also would like Matilda to go into school, it wasn't fair that she and their brother went while she would be home alone all day, though she liked being away from their parents. Lydia smiled happily. \"Okay.\" Matilda smiled, also happier than she usually was. Mackenzie then finished her juice as she bonded with the little girls. Both Matilda and Lydia adored Mackenzie, and once they got away of subjects about parents Lydia seemed to open up more and cheer up. \"I'd really like to make my own stories, but... It's hard when you don't know how to write...\" Mackenzie frowned about her disability. \"I'll help you out, I promised.\" Matilda said softly to her sister. \"I have many great ideas...\" Mackenzie replied. \"Also, I would like to walk you to school on your first day if you can make it, Matilda.\" \"Yeah, that would be great, you, me, and Lyddie walking to school.\" Matilda smiled. \"I would love to.\" Mackenzie agreed.[Chapter 2] It took a bit of convincing, but soon Harry and Fredrick were convinced to letting the girls go to school. They had both served Ms. Trunchbull, the head of the nearby kids' school. Matilda was dressed in a nice dress with a ribbon in her hair. Lydia was waiting outside, her hair pulled back into a tight bun and was wearing a high-necked sweater and a pair of leggings and boots. All were new but looked a bit big for her. Mackenzie held the girls' hands when crossing the street and she walked with them to their new school. It looked more like a prison building than a welcome place of education. Matilda looked a little nervous. \"Kenzie, is it meant to look like that?\" she whispered. Lydia gulped quietly and squeezed Mackenzie's hand nervously. \"Erm... Don't worry, girls,\" Mackenzie soothed. \"You'll make lots of new friends. I'm sure it's nicer on the inside.\" Matilda hugged her sister. \"Will you be waiting to pick us up afterwards?\" she asked Mackenzie. Lydia bit her lip and then decided once Mackenzie left, she would take Matilda's hand. \"I will be right here.\" Mackenzie promised as she hugged her little sister back. Matilda nodded and then took Lydia's hand as they prepared to walk into the school. \"See you later, Kenzie.\" she said softly. Lydia held Matilda's hand gently, but firmly back. \"Have a good day.\" Mackenzie told them as she let them go start their first day of school while she would be at her own school for the day. \"See you later, Kenzie.\" Lydia added and then walked into the school playground with Matilda. Mackenzie smiled to them as she then walked away to her own school for the rest of the day. Matilda and Lydia both entered the school playground and looked around. There soon came a rather large woman as she shut the doors which made most of the students scream in fear. Another girl saw that Matilda and Lydia were new and decided to go see them. Lydia looked shocked towards where the students had screamed. Matilda looked to the girl who came towards them. \"You guys must be new.\" The girl said to them as the vile woman of the school sanctured out. \"Yeah, we're starting today.\" Matilda said quietly. \"Better stay here for now so you'll be safe from... Her ...\" The girl offered. \"Her?\" Matilda asked in a whisper. Lydia was looking scared in the direction of where Ms. Trunchbull was. \"That's the principal,\" the girl informed. \"Ms. Trunchbull.\" \" She's a principal?\" Matilda whispered back. \"You guys are new here.\" The girl then said with a nod. Matilda nodded. \"Y-Yes...\" Lydia finally spoke in a quiet voice. \"You better be careful,\" the girl told them. \"No one is safe from Ms. Trunchbull's wrath.\" \"Her wraths?\" Lydia asked, a little more scared now. Matilda looked to the girl her own eyes wide too. \"Trust me, you don't wanna mess with her.\" The girl warned. Other kids came to meet Matilda and Lydia to help warn them as Trunchbull approached a little girl with braids in her hair. \"What's she doing?\" Matilda asked quietly as she noticed Trunchbull was heading straight for the girl with pigtails. Lydia bit her lip, looking scared, but wanting to help that other little girl. \"I'm afraid it's not pretty.\" A boy told her shyly. Trunchbull came up to the girl known as Amanda with a riding crop. Matilda watched worriedly. Lydia let go of Matilda's hand and nervously scurried over to Amanda and Ms. Trunchbull. \"Ms. Trunchbull, ma'am... Are hairdos not allowed?\" she asked, politely and a little nervously. She would stop Amanda from getting into trouble. Amanda looked surprised that someone had come to her rescue. \"What are those?\" Trunchbull sneered as she gestured to the blonde girl's pigtails. \"My pigtails, Ms. Trunchbull.\" Amanda said, in her little sweet voice. Sensing trouble, having grown used to knowing the signs, Lydia looked up at Ms Trunchbull. \"I was playing hairdresser, ma'am...\" she told her, to get the attention off Amanda. \"Do you think Amanda is a pig, Little Missy?\" Trunchbull asked with a slight scowl. \"No, ma'am, I was trying out different styles and I was just going to sort it back out for her.\" Lydia said softly, and respectfully. Amanda could tell when not to speak up against this girl, but was very thankful. \"Amanda, do I allow pigs in this school?\" Trunchbull sneered. \"No, Ms. Trunchbull...\" Amanda said softly. Lydia quickly undid the pigtails and straightened the girl's hair out. \"All better now.\" she said quickly. \"See that it never happens again!\" Trunchbull replied with sharp words as sharp as metaphorical daggers going through an innocent and pure soul. \"Y-Yes, ma'am.\" Lydia gulped, looking wide-eyed with fear. Amanda nodded too. \"Next time I won't be so easy on you all.\" Trunchbull gritted her teeth. Amanda nodded again and looked nervous. Lydia half-cringed away from Trunchbull, but half-protected Amanda. \"Alright, get to class before I throw you all in the Chokey!\" Trunchbull threatened. Everybody headed to classes then. Lydia turned to look at the girl. \"Are you okay?\" she asked her softly as they went inside. \"Yes... Thank you for helping me.\" Amanda told her softly. Matilda smiled a little, Lydia was so nice. She wouldn't begrudge her a school friend and hoped to make some of her own too. \"Amanda got lucky.\" The girl muttered to the others as they were on their way to class. Inside the classroom, the teacher greeted her students with a smile and saw that she had two new ones and recognized them instantly since they were not in her classroom before. Amanda thanked Lydia again and then went and sat in her seat. Lydia joined Matilda again. Matilda looked nervously at the teacher, was she mean like Ms. Trunchbull? \"Okay, listen up, everybody,\" the teacher called gently to the students, she seemed like an angel on Earth in deep contrast to the principal who seemed to be the devil himself. \"We have two new students in our class, this is Matilda Wormwood and Lydia Crescent.\" Lydia instantly felt relaxed once she heard the teacher speak. She felt safer already, even safer than she ever felt at home. Matilda relaxed a little too, this teacher seemed nice. Amanda smiled sweetly, maybe Lydia would get to sit next to her. \"Matilda, why don't you sit with Lavender, and Lydia, you go with Amanda?\" The teacher appropriately named Miss Honey suggested. \"Thank you, Miss Honey.\" Matilda smiled, and went to sit next to the girl called Lavender. \"Okay, Miss Honey.\" Lydia said softly. Amanda smiled and pushed the seat out so Lydia could sit down. Lavender looked up to Matilda and smiled. \"Now you all remember how scary first days of school were, so I want you to be nice to Matilda and Lydia and make them feel welcome,\" Miss Honey told her other students. \"Could someone get workbooks for them, please?\" Matilda smiled back gently to Lavender. \"I will, Miss Honey.\" Amanda volunteered. Lydia bit her lip, not used to anyone doing stuff FOR her, she usually did it herself when she had to. Miss Honey was a wonderful teacher and a friend to everyone, but her life is not as beautiful as it seemed. Miss Honey held deep dark secrets though it caused her great pain. She did not let it interfere with her teaching. The woman looked out the window to the beautiful field of flowers which seemed out of place for such a school like this which seemed like a true nightmare come true. \"Well, girls, you've come on a very good day because we're gonna be learning everything we know so far,\" Miss Honey told Matilda and Lydia. \"Now, it's alright if you don't understand it because you're brand new, but if you do know the answer just raise your hand, okay?\" \"Yes, Miss Honey.\" Matilda and Lydia chimed in together. \"We've been working on two times tables,\" Miss Honey smiled to her students. \"Would anybody like to demonstrate?\" Almost everybody in the classroom raised their hands. Miss Honey then began to demonstrate with everyone, she asked them the problems and they answered together until she got to one that was difficult as she didn't expect them to know the answer since they were all only six. \"Pretty soon you'll be able to do problems like 13 times 379.\" \"4,927...\" Matilda said, a little slowly as she realised no one else had answered it. Lydia smiled at her friend, this was nothing new to her. The others looked to Matilda curiously. Miss Honey checked her workbook only to see that was actually correct much to her shock and amazement. \"It is...\" \"Wow!\" Lavender beamed. Matilda licked her lips that had gone dry with nerves, but gave a small nervous smile. Lydia smiled happily for her friend. \"Matilda, you know how to multiply big numbers?\" Miss Honey asked her new student out of surprise. \"I read a book on mathematics at the library.\" Matilda told her. \"You like to read?\" Miss Honey smiled to that. \"Oh, yes, I love to read.\" Matilda said softly. Lydia nodded, the girl did. \"What do you like to read?\" Miss Honey smiled. \"Everything... Lately I've been reading Dahl's Chickens... Charles Dickens,\" Matilda told her. \"I could read him everyday.\" she said. \"So could I,\" Miss Honey said with a smile. She then thought about doing something before. \"Okay, class. Get your workbooks, let's get to Section Three. I'll be back in a moment.\" The students then did their work the best that they could as she was going to visit Trunchbull to talk about how phenomenal Matilda was. Matilda also did the section, not trying to be boastful as she was just doing her work, but ended up finishing before the others. Lydia was a little bit slower, yes she could read and write but Math was not something her dad had helped her with. Amanda helped her a little, feeling happy to feel useful. Lavender felt stuck in certain areas and she felt blessed to have Matilda help her like she was. She was very bright and advanced despite being only six. Lydia was happy to be friends with the sweet Amanda, her first school friend was so nice. Amanda giggled a little, quietly though. It seemed to be a good first day for Matilda and Lydia, despite the nightmare they faced this morning. Mackenzie was off for a good while during lunch and decided to go visit Matilda and Lydia to see how school was going for them so far. Matilda smiled as Mackenzie came to visit at lunch time. \"Lavender, this is my big sister, Mackenzie!\" she introduced. Lydia was coming over with Amanda. Amanda looked a little shy, but smiled. \"Hi!\" Lavender beamed and waved to Mackenzie. \"Oh, hello there.\" Mackenzie smiled as she was happy that Matilda had made a new friend. \"My teacher is so nice too, 'Kenzie'.\" Matilda smiled. \"Hi 'Kenzie.\" Lydia greeted happily. \"Hello...\" Amanda said quietly and politely, a little nervous. Lavender smiled as she shook hands with Mackenzie. \"Hi... 'Kenzie.\" Mackenzie giggled and looked to Amanda. \"Hi, there~... And who are you?\" Matilda smiled. Lydia smiled encouragingly at Amanda. \"Amanda Thripp.\" Amanda said quietly, but with a small smile. \"Hello, Amanda,\" Mackenzie smiled back. \"I'm Mackenzie, but you can call me Kenzie.\" \"Hello, 'Kenzie.\" Amanda smiled. Mackenzie smiled as she became rather popular around the other kids. \"Can you stay with us?\" Lavender asked. \"Sorry, but I'm just here for lunch.\" Mackenzie replied apologetically. Lydia smiled softly and giggled as she hugged Mackenzie. Mackenzie hugged Lydia right back, she was like another little sister due to how close she and Matilda were with her. Lydia smiled happily. \"Your sister is so pretty.\" Amanda told Matilda. \"Yes, she is.\" Matilda smiled. Mackenzie blushed to their compliments. \"She's like a princess.\" Lavender beamed. Lydia nodded. Matilda and Amanda giggled. Mackenzie smiled as she spent her lunch hour with them until she had to get back to her own school. Matilda and Lydia hugged Mackenzie before they had to run back to class themselves. Amanda smiled. \"I'll see you at home, okay?\" Mackenzie told Matilda before going back to her school. \"Okay, Kenzie.\" Matilda smiled. Mackenzie gave Matilda a nice and tight hug before going off back to her school.[Chapter 3] Soon, after they had all done with school for the day, and Miss Honey had given Matilda a more advanced workbook they all got ready to leave school for the day and return home. \"That looks like some of my homework.\" Mackenzie said to Matilda. Matilda smiled. \"Miss Honey got it for me as the other stuff was too easy.\" she said softly. Lydia smiled at the two. \"I'm going to go home for a little.\" she smiled gently. \"Okay, see ya later, Lydia.\" Mackenzie said to their friend as she went home with her little sister. Matilda waved and then went to her house with Mackenzie. Lydia went to her house and noticed her little suitcase out on the door step. She tried to open the door and knocked on it but it was locked and there was no answer. She bit her lip, but sat on the steps. Maybe her parents were just out shopping and would be back soon. Mackenzie smiled as she walked home with Matilda. Miss Honey was on her way to her own place after she finished for the day. A little while later, when it was evening, Matilda was in her room, just finishing off her homework. She looked over to the door as it was knocked on. Lydia was sitting with her face against her knees as she was still waiting for her parents. Harry grumbled as he answered the door. Matilda came to her bedroom door and looked to the front door. Harry opened the door to see who it was. \"We don't do money, we don't take charities, we don't buy raffle tickets.\" \"Mr. Wormwood, I-I'm Miss Honey, Matilda's teacher.\" Miss Honey greeted a little nervously. Matilda came a bit closer. Mackenzie came out of her room curiously. \"What's she done now?\" Harry scoffed to Miss Honey before glaring at Matilda like she was a troublemaker. \"You! Go to your room right now! Right now! Beat it!\" Zinnia was enjoying the show still. Matilda went to her room, so not to anger her dad. \"Look, whatever it is, she's your problem now.\" Harry scoffed. \"There is no problem.\" Miss Honey replied. \"Then beat it, peasant!\" Harry scoffed. \"We're watching TV.\" Mackenzie hid a glare of disgust to her father's more interest in watching television than hear about Matilda's excellence in school. Matilda watched from her room again. Lydia sighed softly and she held her suitcase closer to her. Miss Honey was trying to talk Harry about Matilda, but it was no use and she soon decided to leave the Wormwood household. Mackenzie liked Miss Honey a lot better than her own mother and even wished that she could be her mother, instead of Zinnia. Matilda mouthed a thank you to Miss Honey as she had slipped the Wind in The Willows book to where Matilda could sneak it to her room. Lydia looked over at Miss Honey as she heard Harry shut his door loudly. Miss Honey nodded silently as she then went off and was on her way home. Lydia sighed softly. \"Hello, Miss Honey.\" she said softly. \"Oh, Lydia, what're you doing outside so late?\" Miss Honey asked gently. \"Waiting for Mommy and Daddy to get home... But it's been hours now... and I peeked in my living room and all our 'ormanents' are gone,\" Lydia sighed softly. \"My suitcase was outside too.\" she then added. \"Oh, my...\" Miss Honey put her hand to her cheek in deep concern about this. \"I-I think you should come with me.\" Lydia looked at her, a little confused. \"What if they come back?\" she asked quietly, but not sounding against the idea of going with Miss Honey. \"Do you know your phone number?\" Miss Honey asked. \"No, we don't have no telephone no more.\" Lydia said, but came over to the lovely woman. \"What if we left a note?\" Miss Honey then suggested. Lydia smiled and nodded. \"I like those ideas.\" she smiled. \"All right then.\" Miss Honey nodded with a smile as she decided to jot down a note in case Lydia's parents came back. Lydia picked up her suitcase, her hair down now so she looked even softer. Miss Honey wrote a note and taped it to the door before taking Lydia to where she lived now. Lydia held Miss Honey's hand. \"I really like you, Miss Honey.\" she smiled gently. \"I really like you too.\" Miss Honey smiled back as she held hands with Lydia, almost like the way a mother would to her child. Lydia felt safer again more than she ever had. Miss Honey smiled down to Lydia on the way to her home. Lydia smiled back up to her. Miss Honey helped Lydia into her home. \"Hopefully this is better than being at your own place just alone.\" Lydia looked in awe at the cute little cottage. \"It looks so sweet.\" she smiled happily. \"Thank you, my dear.\" Miss Honey smiled back as she led Lydia into her home. Lydia ended up sitting on her suitcase when they got in, so she wouldn't be taking up space. Miss Honey got herself settled in and decided to make some hot chocolate. Lydia looked at Miss Honey. \"If there's anything you want me to do to help while live here... Let me know.\" she said softly, used to chores to help out. \"Oh, you don't have to do chores, sweetie... \"Miss Honey replied. \"Buts I got to, so I won't be a burden.\" Lydia said, sounding surprised at no chores. \"You're never a burden, you don't have to worry about that.\" Miss Honey coaxed. Lydia blushed slightly and then jumped off her suitcase and carefully hugged Miss Honey around the waist. Miss Honey yelped in small surprise, but looked down and smiled to this. \"Do you like hot chocolate, Lydia?\" she then asked. \"Hot Chocolate... What is that?\" she wondered, the only warm drink her family ever got was coffee and she didn't like that. \"Maybe a taste can help convince you.\" Miss Honey offered a cup out to the girl to let her try it out for herself as the taste said more to what the drink was than just talking about it. Lydia blew on it carefully and tried it. Her eyes lit up and she looked up at Miss Honey in wonder. \"Did the fairies makes the recipe for this?\" she asked her eyes wide. Miss Honey giggled. \"No fairies here, but I made it from a recipe I learned many years ago.\" \"Is amazing.\" Lydia smiled happily and took another sip. \"I knew you'd love it.\" Miss Honey smiled back as she took her own cup. Lydia smiled and continued to drink her hot chocolate. Miss Honey smiled as they enjoyed their hot chocolate together and they both felt like there wasn't a care in the world for either of them. Lydia knew she should've been sad that her parents had left, but she couldn't find it in her to care now Miss Honey was around. \"Do you need pajamas?\" Miss Honey asked just in case. Lydia went to check in her suitcase and then found her nightdress there. \"I've got my nightie here.\" she smiled to the woman. \"Oh, and it's very beautiful, just like you~\" Miss Honey cooed, feeling a maternal instinct with the girl. Lydia smiled softly and giggled slightly. \"It was the one thing prettywise I was allowed to have.\" she smiled. \"I think you make everything pretty, Lydia.\" Miss Honey told her. Lydia smiled happily and hugged the woman gently. Miss Honey hugged Lydia back. Lydia relaxed into the hug and smiled softly. \"Miss Honey?\" she said softly. \"Yes, dear?\" Miss Honey replied. Lydia looked up at the woman. \"If my Mommy and Daddy don't come back for me... Would you be my new mommy?\" she asked her softly. She obviously didn't get that her parents had obviously ran away and left her. \"Y-Your new mommy...?\" Miss Honey's eyes widened, she wasn't offended, but was surprised at the offer. Lydia nodded and looked down shyly. She looked like she was worried as she had asked for something. \"I-If not is okay...\" she said quickly and quietly, not wanting to anger the woman. \"It's all right... I would be happy to, but I would need papers to make it official of course...\" Miss Honey cooed. \"It's what Magnus would've wanted too.\" Lydia smiled a little. \"Maybe Matilda would know where to get them from... She's smarter than me.\" she said, but she had no jealousy or anger in her tone, it was a simple fact and she adored her friend no matter what. \"Matilda is rather wonderful, and that older girl during lunch you girls saw seemed nice too.\" Miss Honey cooed. \"Matilda is, and the older girl was 'Kenzie... She's our big sister.\" Lydia smiled, having always assumed that Mackenzie was also her big sister too. \"Oh, I see...\" Miss Honey then said. \"She seems lovely too.\" Lydia giggled. \"She is...\" she agreed. Miss Honey giggled back, finding Lydia's laugh to be adorably contagious. Lydia smiled and hugged the woman gently again. Miss Honey smiled back as she enjoyed Lydia's company. After a night of the unexpected, but wonderful 'unofficial adoption' between Lydia and Miss Honey, they went ahead to the school. Lydia had her hair in double bunches again, but these ones were comfortable and no longer pulled her skin taut. Miss Honey smiled to Lydia as she got the classroom ready for the day. Lydia helped set up the classroom. Miss Honey smiled to Lydia's help. Lydia hummed as she helped. Miss Honey smiled as she worked with Lydia and they arranged the classroom neat and tidy for the other students. Matilda was ready to walk to school with Mackenzie, and was holding her book close to her chest and gave a smile to her sister. When they headed to Lydia's house, she noticed a note pinned on the front door. Mackenzie took the note, she tried to read it aloud, stuttering and stammering at the words, trying to remember her younger sister's teachings so she could be successful for her age despite being slightly dyslexic. Matilda only offered help when Mackenzie really needed help, but smiled encouragingly. Mackenzie nodded to Matilda and soon got through the note. \"Oh, her parents left!\" she then gasped. \"Oh, no...\" Matilda gasped back. \"Where is she then?\" \"I-I'm not sure...\" Mackenzie pouted. \"She couldn't have left without telling us.\" Matilda looked at the note and then gave a smile. \"She must've gone with Miss Honey after she came last night, she probably realized it would be too late to let us know.\" she said, recognizing the handwriting. \"You think so?\" Mackenzie asked, she seemed younger than her six-year-old sister now. Matilda nodded. \"You know Lydia wouldn't go with a stranger.\" she smiled at her sister. \"That's true...\" Mackenzie agreed. \"At least she's safe and had a warm night.\" Matilda smiled. \"Let's go then.\" she told her sister, holding her hand. \"Come along, we shouldn't be tardy.\" Mackenzie nodded once the mood lightened and they went back to Crunchem Hall. Matilda held her sister's hand tightly. Mackenzie smiled down to Matilda on the way to school. \"Kenzie, will you be visiting at Lunch again today?\" she asked her sister. \"I can do that if you would like me to,\" Mackenzie smiled down to her. \"They usually give us an hour off and I'm usually bored just sitting in there, but the good thing was coming to see you and Lydia.\" \"Yes, please.\" Matilda smiled. She would love it to become a regular thing. \"All right, then at lunch, I'll see you.\" Mackenzie agreed. Matilda smiled happily. Mackenzie walked Matilda to school and when the bell rang, she wished her little sister a good day at school while she would go off to her own for the day until lunch to check on her and Lydia, her honorary other little sister. Matilda hugged her and then went to her class. Mackenzie smiled to Matilda as she went to her own school.[Chapter 4] Matilda entered the school and went to her classroom and looked relieved when she saw Lydia was there. Lydia had laid out everybody's workbooks for the lesson when it started. Miss Honey smiled to Lydia's help. Lavender beamed as she came with Matilda as they were best friends now. The older girl who was known as Hortensia looked relieved that Matilda and Lydia survived their first day of school. The first lesson passed just fine until all the students were called to the Assembly Hall for some reason. Hortensia looked very nervous herself. Everyone just wondered what Trunchbull could possibly want. \"Bruce Bogtrotter?\" Trunchbull called out the name of a certain student. \"Would like Bruce come up please?~\" she then added in a bit sweetly, though everyone knew it was fake. Bruce nervously went up, knowing it was best he didn't disobey her. Matilda looked worried a little for the boy. \"This boy, Bruce Bogtrotter is none other than a vicious sneaky thief!\" Trunchbull sneered before glaring right at the boy who had a bit more weight than the other students did. \"You're a disgusting criminal, aren't you?\" \"What are you talking about?\" Bruce asked confused, but a bit politely. \"Cake! Chocolate cake...\" Trunchbull demanded. \"You slithered like a serpent into the school kitchen and ate it as a snack! Do you deny it?! CONFESS!\" \"I can't remember a specific cake...\" Bruce said quietly, not wanting to admit it. \"This one… Was mine and it was the most scrumptious cake in the entire universe.\" Trunchbull demanded. \"My mom's was better...\" Bruce retorted. This made everybody gasped in shock as it seemed like Bruce had filled out his death wish. \"It is, is it?\" Trunchbull replied icily as her demeanor. \"How can you be sure unless you have another piece?\" Bruce looked up at her confused, glancing at the plate on the table. A lunch lady came to serve cake to Bruce and the punishment would be to force the boy to eat it all which disgusted and horrified his fellow students. Matilda noticed that Bruce was looking ill at one point and started to shout encouragement. Lydia did so too. Soon enough, everyone else did. Trunchbull, obviously, did not like this at all. Bruce looked bleary-eyed at the assembly hall. With the support, Bruce finished the whole cake and even licked the plate and then cheered. Lydia clapped and cheered for Bruce. \" STOP IT! \" Trunchbull snapped at the cheering students. Only when the plate was smashed over Bruce's head did anyone stop cheering. They all then sat down and became silent. The entire assembly will stay five hours after school and copy from the dictionary!\" Trunchbull glared. \"Any children who object will be sent to the Chokey together!\" Lydia bit her lip and glanced at Matilda. Matilda was glad they weren't forced to stay in at lunch at least, she would have to let her sister know. Mackenzie came to meet Matilda and Lydia as promised, they seemed to take a bit longer than usual this time, but she soon smiled once they came to her. She had a container filled with a few cookies that she got from the cafeteria and she would happily share with them. \"Hi, Kenzie.\" Lydia smiled and hugged the girl. Matilda hugged her sister too. \"Hi, girls, want some cookies?\" Mackenzie asked before hugging them back. \"Ooh, yes, please, Kenzie.\" Lydia smiled. \"Please.\" Matilda smiled. Mackenzie smiled back as she popped open the container and handed cookies to them. \"What do you say?~\" she then prompted. \"Please and thank you.\" Lydia smiled sweetly. \"Yes, please and thank you.\" Matilda smiled too. Mackenzie smiled. \"You're welcome.\" Lydia smiled and enjoyed her cookie. Matilda ate her cookie too and then looked at her sister. \"Kenzie, we can't walk home with you tonight.\" she said with a small frown. \"You can't?\" Mackenzie asked curiously. \"How come?\" Lydia pouted at that in thought. \"Ms. Trunchbull is keeping the whole school behind after school.\" Matilda told her sister. Mackenzie sighed about Ms. Trunchbull being a very unfair woman. \"What does that old cow want from you guys now?\" \"She's punishing the school for cheering for Bruce.\" Lydia told her. Matilda nodded. \"What?\" Mackenzie asked flatly before sighing. \"Well, I appreciate you guys telling me... Hopefully Mom and Harry-I mean Dad will understand.\" Matilda tilted her head. \"Oh, did you guys notice if my dad and mom were back?\" Lydia asked, secretly hoping they hadn't. \"No, but we saw a note.\" Mackenzie replied. Lydia nodded. \"Miss Honey wroted it for me... So if my parents came back, they would know where I was.\" she smiled. Matilda bit her lip and glanced at her sister, she had been able to have a think about it and realized that maybe Lydia's parents had left the girl behind on purpose. \"Oh, um, I'm sure they'll 'turnip'...\" Mackenzie bit her lip slightly. Lydia nodded slightly, though her smile dimmed just a millimeter. Mackenzie then had a cookie with them, she was going to have a lonely walk home tonight though. Matilda hugged her. \"Don't worry, it should just be tonight.\" she soothed her sister. Mackenzie hugged the girls. She then stayed until they had to go back to their school and she went back to her own. Trunchbull was decent enough to at least call a school bus over to drop off the students back home. Matilda walked in through the door when she got home. Mackenzie was huddled in the corner of her bedroom and was heard crying. \"Young lady, where were you?!\" Harry snapped. \"Ms. Trunchbull kept the whole school after school was finished.\" Matilda told him, wanting to go and see her sister though. \"That's the biggest lie I ever heard!\" Harry yelled. \"See those packages?\" He pointed to a whole lot of packages that were by the door, \"They were left out for the world because you weren't here to take them in!\" \"Well, I couldn't come home on time if I'm kept after school by the principal.\" she replied. Harry glared at Matilda until Zinnia talked with him. Matilda managed to sneak off to Mackenzie's room and came into it. \"Kenzie, what's wrong?\" she asked quietly. \"Nothing...\" Mackenzie replied as she hid in the darkness before sniffling and grunting slightly. \"Kenzie, you can tell me.\" Matilda said softly and came closer to her sister. \"Just go to your room...\" Mackenzie trembled, she then dropped a wadded up tissue that had a red substance on it. Matilda noticed the tissue and her eyes widened. \"Please, Matty, go to your room...\" Mackenzie sniffled as she didn't want to subject her younger sister to what she had endured. Matilda didn't want to disobey, but had to and hugged her sister gently. Mackenzie hugged Matilda back, but then gasped as she quickly covered her nose as it was bleeding and she appeared to have a blackened eye. Lydia went with Miss Honey, after they checked if her parents had returned. Miss Honey held Lydia's hand as they came to the front door, she knocked on it just to make sure. Lydia listened quietly. The other next door neighbor, who was slightly crazy and didn't like the family normally, looked over. \"No use in knocking on their door.\" he told them. Miss Honey looked over with her arm around Lydia. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"They ran off, told me if the little one didn't find anyone properly to look after her, I was to make sure she was sent to the Orphanage.\" he cackled. \"What?!\" Miss Honey's eyes widened. \"They ain't coming back... So, if you ain't gonna look after her, I haveta take her to an orphanage.\" the neighbor told Miss Honey. Miss Honey stared back firmly. \"I'll look after her.\" \"Then this is for you.\" the neighbor said, and tossed a tied bundle of paper to her. Lydia flinched. Miss Honey also flinched, but accepted the papers. Lydia held tight to Miss Honey. \"See you later kiddo, have a nice life.\" the neighbor said and walked back into his house. Miss Honey sighed to the neighbor as she held Lydia back. \"Come on, Lyddie, let's go home.\" she then cooed to the girl. Lydia nodded to her teacher, and somehow knew that maybe it would be a little better now. Miss Honey held Lydia's hand as they went back to her place, or as it would be from then on, their place. Matilda pulled out a clean tissue she had in her pocket and carefully handed it to her sister. \"Pinch the bridge of your nose and just hold the tissue underneath.\" she said softly. \"Thank you...\" Mackenzie sniffed as she took the tissue and did as instructed as she felt quite miserable right now. Matilda heard Harry searching for them and her eyes narrowed and she wanted to slam the door and lock it. As she thought this, the door did shut and also locked itself, though she hadn't moved from where she was hugging Mackenzie. Mackenzie whimpered, she didn't even notice that, but she did hug Matilda back. Matilda held her sister close and made sure the nosebleed would stop. Soon enough, Mackenzie's nose dried up and she was good for the night. She checked the last tissue and settled down. \"I'm sorry, Matilda... It was my fault after all...\" she then sighed. \"I did promise Mom and Dad that I would bring you home with me every day.\" Matilda hugged her. \"It's not your fault, Kenzie.\" she said softly. \"Yes, it is...\" Mackenzie shivered. \"No, it isn't, you couldn't stop Ms. Trunchbull from keeping me after school.\" Matilda frowned gently at her sister. Mackenzie sniffled. \"Oh, Matty...\" she sighed as their lives were rather unfair. Matilda looked up at her. \"I'll sort it out.\" she said softly. \"Oh, Matilda, you don't have to do anything.\" Mackenzie replied. \"Yes, I do.\" Matilda told her with a firm look, but it was loving when she looked at Mackenzie. \"Oh, bless your little heart...\" Mackenzie cooed as she gently squeezed Matilda's hand as it reminded her of when Matilda was born and she was the only one excited and happy to have a new baby in the house. Matilda smiled softly. Mackenzie smiled down to Matilda before sniffling again as she held her younger sister who was much wiser beyond her years. ","Summary":" It was a normal day in the Wormwood household, Matilda was sitting away from most of her family rea"},{"Movie":"Pretty in Pink","Title":"See What's Become of Me","Author":"NiceIceEdward","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5842490","Passage":"[Chapter 1] He jogged every morning, through the undulating mist that blanketed the suburban, provincial style neighborhood. He jogged between manicured lawns and city maintained curbs. The strip of sidewalk he crossed before he reached the asphalt path through the park, was untarnished by idly tossed trash, litter or cracks. His was an affluent neighborhood. Every time his foot left the ground he considered it a subdued jump for joy. His whole person oozed the privileged existence he lived. The exceptionally fit body which pumped him across the concrete reflected the generally healthy state of his lifestyle. Attractive CEO, gorgeous trophy wife, his was the perfect family picture. His modes of transportation were suited to his every whim; The Land Rover for when he was active, the Ducati for when he was possessed of a rebellious whim. There was also the M3. He had genuinely never let go of his high school affinity with Bavarian Motor Works. Even his clothes reflected his position, though he wore only running gear. It had the carefully planned \"casual\" look to it; all the right symbols and logos, iconography for a generation. This too had been a high school fixation, that being a time where a name could raise the price of nothing into an expensive something. He jogged through the curtain of haze that had settled over the community, entering the park in the assumption that life would continue to be without peril or confusion. He had done well in convincing himself for over twenty years that life was as it should be. He had all he deserved and more, and nothing could take away his sense of entitlement. Nothing ever had, well, there was the girl. The steady rhythm of his exercise faltered for a moment. Thoughts of the girl always made him falter. He stopped and bent over to rest his hands on his knees, exhaling heavily from his rigorous activity. He shook his head, inhaled deeply, and stood straight again. He stretched himself, arms out, pulling his arms forward at the wrist to loosen his shoulder joints. Thoughts of the girl occurred occasionally to him. He allowed them no more time than the subconscious allows a fleeting glimpse of horror into a beautiful dream. Even now, he took up his run again, a little more energy thrown into it; a little extra speed motivating his travel. He followed his usual track, three times around the park and along the canal, then retraced his steps back to his home. He ran up the driveway and through the door under the carport. He grabbed the sweat cloth off the hook by the door, conveniently left there by his wife, Michelle. Michelle was a trophy wife, literally, he'd won her. It had cost him assorted bundles of cash, but when he had envisioned the perfect wife, he had seen Michelle. As he scrubbed the towel across his dripping head, her voice came through from another room of the house. With all the mismatched doorways of his very modern home, the direction her voice came from was nearly impossible to locate. \"Steff, are you logging on before your shower? I wanted to order a few things before we start getting ready.\" Shopping, the only thing she loved more than her inflated bank account. \"Yes, I need to check Email before I head into the office.\" \"I thought you weren't going in today. You need time to get ready.\" Michelle called. \"I never said that. I don't need time, it's a reunion. I'm not wasting valuable minutes on the decaying wreckage, who will be vainly searching out their lost youth at this pathetic event.\" \"You've been looking forward to seeing your friend again, admit it.\" Michelle said, as she entered the room through the opposing door. \"Yes, this is true. I have been looking forward to seeing him again.\" Steff responded, as he turned towards the stairs, up which his computer waited in his functionally perfect home office. \"What was his name again, honey? Bryce, Brad, something...Bri-\" As she asked, a face floated into the view of his mind's eye and stopped him at the foot of the stairs. He saw a young impetuous boy, with a fluff of strawberry absurdness floating at his arm, on the edge of a dance floor. A few bars of a long forgotten song wafted through his memory and his carelessly placed hand squeezed tightly on the bannister. He cut her off, \"Blane, Blane McDonough.\" The verdant blanket of grass across the yard declined slightly at the starkly shaped edges where the deep brown of richly fed soil held the trunks of several fruit bearing trees. The yard was large for the neighborhood of high end tract housing that Tonapah Hills claimed to not to be. The house behind him was a lightly toned shade of salmon pink with purple-grey slate roof tiles, which made him think of a thick skinned marine animal. The home of his ex-wife had such sharp cut lines, it reminded him of a slaughtered whale. The effect on him may likely have been latent feelings caused by his personal slaughter in the divorce. His heart bled out for the two boys who frolicked around the brightly colored playground set. Kenyon, aged 4 and Cameron, aged 7 had been infant and toddler respectively when Kristina had come to him with the last words he'd expected from their shiningly brilliant marriage; \"I am not happy, and I want a divorce.\" He and Kristina had waited nearly ten years to have Cam, and he still hadn't been ready really. When he asked her why she wanted a divorce, she'd said one word. It wasn't a bad word, there was no malice in her voice when she said it, and it wasn't cruel in itself. The connotations of the word were bad though, it wasn't an ugly word. In his opinion, it was a beautiful word, or to be correct, a beautiful name. Kristina had answered, \"Andie.\" He and Andie had walked away from their senior year hopeful, excited and ready to battle anything. They'd already gone up against their own fears. He loved Andie in a way that was no idle high school sweetheart love. Nothing could part them, so he'd thought. Andie was strong, he wasn't. When his parents warned him not to see her, he'd been strong. When they'd refused to give him any money, he'd worked for the summer so they could go out and do things together. When August came, his parents and Grandparents put their partnered feet down. He would go to an Ivy League university, or he was on his own. When his inheritance and future were threatened, he'd folded like the coward he now knew himself to be. Andie hadn't cried, or yelled at him. She'd simply looked into his eyes and right through to his soul, then turned and walked away and out of his life. Cambridge had been a blur until the day Kristina happened into the bar he was drowning himself in. She swept him out of his focused concentration on course work, and the downward spiral of his cluttered thoughts, and pulled him into the sunshine. By the time he'd graduated, they were engaged. Nothing held him back, nothing stopped him. One guest at the wedding gave him his only moment of doubt; \"Blane, I think you've chosen a perfect girl. I mean she's beautiful, bright and everything you deserve and need. I simply see it as the first chapter in a tragedy, because it's a damn shame that she isn't the girl you really want, and you will destroy it.\" Steff had spoken those words in the quiet of Blane's fathers' study, his new wife Michelle stood by his side saying nothing, but berating him silently with her eyes. He'd denied it then, but he couldn't deny it now. Steff had been absolutely right. And Blane had truly devastated the marriage. You can't give something away to anyone when it belongs to someone else, most particularly, your heart. He watched as Keny reached the top of the climbing wall on the playground set. He watched in a daze of old memories as Cam climbed up the first few grips on the wall and grabbed his brother's foot and began pulling. There was a sliding sound to his left, and a voice called out over his left shoulder. \"Cam, don't pull on Keny's foot, unless you plan on breaking his fall for him. You can you come in now if you can't behave.\" Kristina called from the kitchen window. The window began sliding shut, then suddenly slid open again. \"Blane?\" she inquired. Blane stood up, and turned around to look in the window at her. \"Hi Kris, I'm sorry, I just missed the guys, I hope you don't mind.\" His discomfort was apparent in the way he shifted his weight and tugged here and there to straighten his clothing. \"You could have called.\" now over her initial surprise, Kristina looked mildly annoyed at his presence. \"You should have.\" \"I would have if it had been a conscious decision. I was driving home from work, and I just sort of...ended up...here.\" he finished with a stutter. Kristina exhaled, and looked down with a very slight shake of her head. \"It wasn't where you really wanted to go, but they'll be glad this is where you decided to come.\" Blane opened his mouth to argue, but as usual, realized he didn't have any defense. Instead he just turned around again, and resumed his seat. About this time, the boys realized their Dad was over and ran toward him. \"Dad\" Cam called, while Keny followed with the less formal, but more heart warming; \"Daddy!\" The boys ran across the grassy lawn to the concrete patio area where their father waited. He knelt onto one knee in preparation for the hugs that were quickly approaching, wearing the smile that belongs to fathers when they look at their sons. A sliding glass door opened as he embraced both boys at once. The exclamations of joy and surprise from his sons momentarily drowned out the tinkling sound of ice cubes dancing inside a glass container. As he kindly evaded direct answers to his sons simple questions about why he was there, he turned his head to see what Kristina had brought out. It was a tray of lemonade, finger foods and a large bunch of green grapes. Blane's joy-filled heart was brought back to reality by his sons equally exuberant response to the snacks their Mom carried. As Kristina poured each boy a glass of lemonade, and finally one for Blane as well, he stood staring off into space. He held the glass in his hand carelessly, his eyes focused on a long past memory. Kristina watched his glazed expression for a moment before frowning and saying; \"What time will it start?\" He drew his attention away from the bright white clouds on which he'd been focusing. \"Hmm?\" He replied. \"I said, what time will it start?\" she repeated. \"What time will what start?\" he answered in confusion. \"I know you, Blane. You love your kids, but they don't bring you here randomly. You're worried about something, and I'm fairly sure I know what it is. So, what time does the reunion start?\" she asked. \"Oh, that, well...\" Blane shifted his weight and ran his hand through his short cropped hair, \"dinner's served at seven. Cocktails start at 5:30.\" \"You should go.\" Kristina said, pulling a string off his shirt. \"I don't know, I can't think of any reason I should.\" he said, frowning darkly at the hose he was rolling under his foot. \"Blane, you know exactly the reason you should go. You also know why you came by here, so I would remind you of that reason. Seeing me reminds you of the one you do want and-\" Blane cut her off, \"No, that's not why I-\" Kristina cut in on him in return, \"You don't know yourself as well as I do, and you know it. Do you want her to think of you as the same coward you were twenty years ago?\" she answered as she opened the last package of string cheese for Keny, who took it and ran headlong for the playground again. Blane stood regarding her with a slight smirk on his face. \"It's frightening you know, no one should be this transparent.\" She chuckled softly, \"You're not transparent, Blane. I just...I know you too damned well not to see you for what you are. I also happen to be smart enough not to be offended by it the way she was, or I'm not strong enough to be.\" she said, looking out across the yard. Blane stood with his hands in his pockets, but as she spoke the last words, he pulled them out and raised his arms to reach out to Kristina. She saw what he was doing and stopped him cold with a look. \"You have to do this. You have to either lay this to rest, or you need to go after what you've always wanted. Even your Mother says you're a shell of who you once were. Your cousin Whitney said 'Blane, he used to have a twinkle in his eye. He rarely looked serious, and he seemed to always be on the verge of getting caught with his hand in the cookie jar. When he lost Andie, he lost that twinkle. Now his eyes are just haunted.' She actually said she wished I could have met you then, as if I'd have had any better chance then, than I did four years later. Blane, go...go to your reunion and find your...self-respect.\" she laid her hand on his chest as she spoke the last words, and they both knew that her gesture was more indicative of what she meant than her words were. He covered her hand with his own, \"On our wedding day, Steff said you were everything I deserved. He was wrong, I never deserved you, few could.\" She smiled playfully and softened the act of pulling her hand out from under his, by saying in a joking tone, \"You're finally getting wise in your old age.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter II The table was covered with layers of drawings. Sketches of pieces and full ensembles of beautifully designed clothing. The designs bore a mark of class, distinctly above gauche. She was reputed to be \"hovering within the untouchable realm between D&G; and Chanel. Classic styles with a marked hint of the girl within.\" Her style had always been her own. The drawings were being unceremoniously lifted, shifted and then left in a state of bothered disarray by the beautiful red head who alternately moaned and spoke to herself. \"It was just here, dammit! What did I do with it.\" Every day and night had been spent working on her fall line. Her A.W. Jackson label was comparatively small in the world of big fashion, but her shows always received good reviews, and she had made enough to allow her Father to spend his last years as a man of leisure. She'd never troubled him with the confused and complicated proceedings leading to the financing of her opening for business. Both of them knew he was aware of where it had come from, but a silent understanding kept them from speaking openly about it. The door to her suite opened behind her. Assuming it was her assistant, she spoke to her without looking around; \"Iona, did you grab the Fall journal before you left?\" The voice which answered her was not only different from the one she'd been expecting, it was also distantly familiar. \"If I had, you'd be the last person I'd return it to. No amount of begging or flattery would be enough to get it-\" he was cut off by way of her petite body forcing him backwards out the door he'd just entered, as she threw her arms around his neck. He laughed boisterously and wrapped her in a heartfelt embrace. \"Duckie, thank God! Its nothing less than fabulous that you're here. Let me take a look at you.\" she stepped back and looked him over head to toe. Seeing his choice of footwear, she crooked one eyebrow at him and asked, \"Creepers?\" \"I had to bring the Duckster with me, so I wore the shoes, but I go by Phil now. These are actually my 15 year old sons.\" he grinned infectiously, and seeing the twinkle in her eye, he leaned forward to hug her again. \"It's amazing to see you, and you, are radiant.\" They shared another wide grin, and then chuckled, \"You still have Iona with you?\" the door behind him opened as he asked this, and Andie's oldest friend walked in, \"You bet your ass, sweetheart. Give this old girl a hug, it's good to see you.\" After a tight hug, Phil leaned back, \"You are looking lovely, Iona, but I'm afraid Andie still has you beat.\" Andie rolled her eyes, \"You haven't changed a bit.\" Duckie laughed, \"I don't know, there's a little bit more of me, and a little less hair.\" he said, taking off the hat he wore. \"Yes, but your style is still as unique as ever.\" she retorted, inclining her head towards his outfit. Iona sighed, and then moaned whimsically. They both looked at her, and she reached out to squeeze both their arms. \"It does me good to see the two of you chatting away like a century hasn't passed. Makes me feel young again.\" Andie rolled her eyes and and shot a mock indignant look at Duckie for his benefit. \"You are young, Iona. You've just been being young for longer than most people.\" Iona cast a tauntingly mischievous look at her friend and boss, and replied, \"Asses shouldn't be smart, it impedes their purpose.\" Looking mildly lost, Duckie looked questioningly at Andie, \"That's Iona's way of calling me a dumb ass. It's a farce, Iona despairs of all talk of asses in general because she's still mourning the loss of her own.\" Iona gasped and pointed at her hips, \"It's true, I've said it before, I had a great butt. Now though, whereas it used to sit happily just below the lower meridian, it's gone all Antarctic now.\" she finished, waving her hands dismissively. Andie and Duckie both laughed, and Duckie said, \"Well, Canada's still gorgeous, Iona.\" \"Bless your heart, little Duck man. I should have stolen you when I had the chance for 5 minutes.\" she smirked, then seeming to remember something, she hit herself on the forehead with her open palm, \"OH! The fall journal, I left it downstairs, I'll be right back.\" she whisked through the doors fast enough to be a danger to anything on the other side of them. As the door swung closed behind her, he turned back to Andie. \"So, a fashion designer? I always knew you'd go on to greatness.\" She chewed her lip a little in a way that nagged at old feelings he recalled from many summer's past. \"Hmm? I don't know about being great, but I certainly do feel great. I love my job.\" she said by way of explanation. \"It shows, actually, I found out what you were doing through my wife. She came down one day dressed for a party in this gorgeous dress. I asked her where she'd gotten it, and admittedly, how much it cost, and she said, \"It's an A.W. Jackson, she's not well known, but her designs are...\" he ended there, without going on. After several beats of pause, Andie couldn't wait any longer, \"My designs are what?\" \"I don't know exactly, my wife was speechless. Apparently, she couldn't come up with an adjective to describe how amazing your stuff is. Diane doesn't react that way to much, so I looked the designer up online. A.W.,\" he chuckled. \"I should have known. Is the \"Jackson\" for your Dad?\" Andie had been smiling widely, but at the mention of her Dad something wistful entered her expression, and her eyes dulled slightly. She said, \"Yes. He always thought I was ridiculous adding the Jackson in, but I know for a fact that it made him happy in the last years before he passed away.\" she smiled, but it didn't quite reach her eyes. Shaking it off quickly though, she continued, \"Enough about me, what are you doing? Where are you working? Who's Diane? You said you had a son, are there other children? Will your wife be here tonight w-\" Phil held his hands up in a warding off gesture. \"Whoa, whoa, Andie. Allow space to answer, before moving on to the next question. Olympic-level, linguistic-acrobat I am not.\" he laughed, and Andie giggled. It was a perfect moment to him. \"I'm sorry, go ahead, I'm just so excited to see you. Please, answer the questions.\" \"Let me see if I can remember all of those questions. Ok, first I think you asked what I'm doing, and where I'm working. I'll assume those are both basically the same question, the answer isn't interesting, but it pays the bills. I work for the Government.\" Andie grinned again, \"Get out! Are you a spy? God knows you were always on stake outs outside of my place when we were kids.\" Blushing a little Phil laughed, \"No, I'm DEFINITELY in a different department than that. I work for the Postal Service as a Mail Carrier.\" Phil slumped a little. \"I know it's very dull, but it's given me excellent insurance benefits, a great retirement plan, and guaranteed vacation two weeks out of every year in the district I'm in.\" \"Duc-...Phil, it's great that you deliver mail. Do you walk, or ride your bike?\" she said with a taunting tone. \"Cute, but no, I walk. Well...and drive.\" he rolled his eyes a little, \"Now as for the next questions, about my family. I've been married to my wife Diane for about eighteen years. We have two sons; Kevin my fifteen year old, and Keith who just turned thirteen last month. Diane has been in Kansas for the last two months caring for her Father, and the boys are with her. She just lost him this past weekend. She's helping her family with the arrangements and getting his things in order. So basically, Diane won't be able to make it tonight. Andie's ordinarily bright expression clouded, \"I'm sorry Phil. That's horrible, your poor wife.\" she stood regarding him for a moment as he nodded in agreement and looked at his feet. \"Hmm?...\" He raised his head and looked at her expectantly, in response to her questioning hum. She quirked her eyebrow at him as something glinted in her eyes. \"Is there such a thing as going stag...together?\" Amused, Phil replied, \"I think there certainly should be. We'll start a trend.\" Raising a stiff hand out and pointing at his feet. \"You don't intend on wearing those...\" she lifted her arm, \"or that , do you? I might have to go alone if you are.\" He laughed good naturedly, \"No, I wanted to come and see you before I went up to get ready, shall I?\" He asked, pointing awkwardly behind him at the door with both hands. Andie checked her watch, she tilted her head as she lifted her eyes back to him. \"Sure, I think I'd better start getting ready.\" \"See, that's just the sort of statement Diane makes that makes me very uncomfortable. I know when she specifies, \"START\" to get ready, it will likely be hours before I see her again, and the interim will be filled by a lot of secrets for beauty I will never be privy to...\" he closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. Andie recognized the deep breath of someone who was only getting started on his monologue and called out to him. \"Phil,\" she said softly. Surprised, he opened his eyes immediately and waited. She continued, \"The reunion?\" \"Right, yes, I'll go. We'll meet in the lobby?\" She winked and pointed at him simultaneously as if to say \"Right!\", then turned and walked away as Phil turned to walk to the door. As she glided through the door to her room he stopped with a hand on the door and watched her. Phil loved Diane dearly and with all his soul, but something about Andie Walsh still made him feel like a gawky teenager, incapable of any form of grace. *** Vaguely familiar faces were scattered around the foyer. The distant sound of the music from the time of her youth thumped rhythmically from the other room. There was a table outside of two sets of open double doors. It was from beyond these that the music wafted into the lobby. She stepped up to the table smiling at the two girls behind it. One of them was pretty, and youthful, only slightly aged. The other obviously spent a lot of money to preserve herself, but the years hadn't been entirely kind to her. The older one cut her eyes at Andie and grinned in a way that showed she was being polite, only for the benefit of those around her. \"Well, if it isn't Andie Walsh.\" Taken aback, she momentarily stared blankly at her. She willed herself to recognize the woman, but wasn't having much luck. As the woman handed her a label with her printed name on it, and a black and white thumbnail of her high school portrait, Andie smiled a little sheepishly and said, \"I'm sorry, I don't recall your name.\" \"Hello Carolyn,\" a voice over Andie's shoulder said. Catching the marked change in Carolyn's expression, Andie turned around and looked back, knowing who it was before she saw him with her eyes. He looked almost the same. Tall, cold blue eyes, fair skin, and an identical expression of predicted disaster she'd seen on his face the last time they'd met. He wore an obviously expensive and beautiful Armani suit. The woman on his arm outclassed him by several levels. She was gorgeous and looked curiously, but kindly at Andie as her husband addressed her with a slight tilt of his hand. \"Andie.\" \"Steff.\" she replied in kind. \"Honey, this is Andie Walsh, she briefly dated Blane when we were kids. Andie, this is my wife, Michelle.\" Michelle held out a well tanned right hand to Andie and warmly said, \"Hello Andie, it's a pleasure to meet you.\" Andie smiled genuinely at Michelle, \"I'm very pleased to meet you. Your dress is beautiful, and you look lovely in it.\" Steff looked slightly pale, as his wife replied. \"Thank you, you do as well. I wonder that you didn't keep her out of Blane's reach by holding on to her yourself, honey.\" Steff composed himself and smiled benignly, but didn't look away from Andie. \"Ah yes, but you see, Andie only had eyes for Blane.\" His expression returned to one of discomfort, and he seemed to drag his eyes away from her to look through the open doors. He turned to his wife, \"Michelle, I think I see Lee Campbell, I'd like you to meet his wife Stacey. She's better company.\" Michelle had the grace to look offended, \"Steff, that's a horrible thing to say.\" Andie felt her expression harden, and gritted her teeth as Steff responded to his wife's accusation. \"What's horrible about saying that the wife of a friend would be better company for you than I could be?\" Michelle looked mildly abashed and giggled in embarrassment, \"Oh! I thought you were...well, nevermind. Andie, will you please excuse us?\" Not able to accept the explanation as easily as his wife was, but liking Michelle despite her poor choice in men, Andie smiled at her. \"Of course, it's very nice to meet you, Michelle.\" \"I hope we'll see you inside, Andie.\" she said genuinely, and with that, Michelle walked between Andie and her husband, and continued into the room. Steff meanwhile held Andie's eyes as he said, \"That would be amazing .\" in a polite tone that dripped with a double meaning. He raised his eyebrows once at Andie and then turned in a way that said he'd wasted enough time talking to her. Shaking her head in disbelief, and chuckling, she turned around and walked into the restroom. After finishing a make-up and dress check, Andie walked back into the foyer. She made her way just inside the doors of the banquet room, to see if Phil had come in while she'd been in the restroom. She stepped another few steps in trying to see past the milling faces, scanning the tables and around the room. Andie fumbled her purse a little as she searched, and it fell to the floor. She knelt down to retrieve it, as two black shod male feet stepped into her view. The hem of the black dress pants above them had been tailored, but not well. It was hastily done, she could have done a much better job. She smiled assuming she knew who it was. She looked up as a hand came down to her as he spoke. \"Hi Andie.\" the voice said. Her smile faltered. She was expecting Duckie...Phil, but this voice she'd have known anywhere. She switched her motion mid-rise and stood without assistance. She steeled her expression, doing her best not to allow herself to sound any different than she had with anyone else. This was not just anyone else.

This fanfic is a Steff/Andie story. James Spader and olly Ringwald's combined perfectness influenced me to write this. I am not claiming to own Pretty in Pink. Nor, am I claiming to own the song \"Bette Davis eyes\". Chapter summary: This is a prelude Steff Mckee had been no stranger to the women of his school. His goodlooks and money made him one of the most desirable guys in highschool. Girls often threw themselves at him, eager to become his newest object of affection. He had used this to his advantage, and he had been with many girls. He didn't care for any of them, of course. He only used them to make himself satisfied. As soon as he got bored, he simply cast them off, and found new prey. He only kept one of them for about 2 weeks, maybe 3 is they were good in bed. He had earned quite a reputation and he honestly didn't care. If anything, he used it to his advantage. Picking up girls was always easy for him. At first the thrill of the chase was always exhilarating. But it became too easy. They were all too boring; too eager to go along with whatever he asked. Besides, none of them even compared to the girl he really liked.. But he couldn't have her. He knew it even before he started trying. So instead of actually flirting, or even just being friendly. He just criticised her and acted like a total dick towards her. He looked at her often, watched her from a distance. But never actually went up to her unless he wanted to insult was of a different wealth and social class to him. Money didn't really mean much to him. It was nice to have lots of it. But, that wasn't the reason that her was horrible to her. It was odd; Her arguing with him was more gratifying then spending a night with one of his adoring girlfriends. She had fallen for his best-friend and his best-friend had fallen for her. Blane was boring, and Steff honestly could not see what she saw in him. Steff had tried to get between them. Telling Blane that she was scum, too low for him. Even though he didn't really care about wealth status. For awhile Steff had actually succeeded and driven them apart. But they reconciled at prom. Infront of one of Andie's friends. What was his name? Duck? Anyway, Steff had witnessed the whole thing and he spent the next week in silent broke it off with Benny (one of his girlfriends). Benny was too clingy, anyway. And,Blane and Andie were practically inseparable. They spent the last month of high-school in each-others arms. On the day that they had all graduated, Steff wanted to say something to Andie. Maybe apologise for being such an asshole. But he didn't. He didn't feel right doing it. Better just to leave her alone and forget about it. Blane was going to Princeton university; all that studying had actually paid off. Steff was going to Yale University. Steff hadn't studied very hard, but had still managed to get above average results. Steff didn't know what college Andie was going to. He didn't really want to know anyway;He was trying to move on.[Chapter 2] Steff's POV Her hair is Harlow gold Her lips sweet surprise Her hands are never cold She's got Bette Davis eyes The lyrics conjure up images in my mind. Images of short red hair, pale skin and a pink pout filll my head.I turn the stupid song down. It always makes me remember. Remember...her. This song always reminds me of her. I don't know what Bette Davis eyes are, but I'm positive that she has them. I pass the interception and move into the lane leading off into Yale university. I took a gap year and travelled across Europe. I was originally meant to do the gap year with Blane. But the plan was cancelled when our friendship ended. I try not to think of Blane anymore either. I miss him;even if he was a bit boring. I heard from one of my other friend that he and Andie are trying to do the whole long distance relationship. It won't work. I predict that it will last 6 monthes, give or take. Blane won't be able to take the pressure. He's never been good at that. I haven't seen either of them since graduation. And I doubt I ever will. Travelling around Europe was fun. I met some interesting people. By that I mean, I met some easy European girls. My parents gave me this red corvette as a college gift. As well as a small fortune. They don't really give a damn about me though. I think they were just happy that I won't be trashing their house anymore. I'm honestly not that upset about leaving. I've lived there my whole life, but I've never liked it. Moving to Providence is probably better than staying. Maybe I 'll even find someone to make me forget about Andie. I drive my Corvette through the big brown gate leading up to Yale. The rolling lawns are filled with students just relaxing. I park my car and start walking up towards the large dormitory building with my suitcase packed with preppy clothes. I decided to live on campus. I don't want to miss all the big college parties! All the drinking and girls... I haul my heavy suitcase through the dormitory area until I find my room. I hope my roommate is someone actually cool. Someone like me. Or better yet, no one at all. I don't really like living with people, especially people I don't know I open my door...no one is there. The room is completely empty. There are two single beds on both sides of the room. A huge window takes up the wall space between the beds. The room is actually quite nice, even if it is a bit bland. \"Thank christ\", I grin. I claim the left bed and begin putting the items in my suitcase away. I make my bed with my silk bedding. I grew bored and decided to take a stroll around campus. See if there are any attractive girls. SORRY IT'S SO SHORT! I didn't have much time to write it.

Now with a very family life all of their own, Matilda and Miss Honey are very happy. One Saturday Matilda and Miss Honey sat in the kitchen eating breakfast. For the past week Matilda had been feeling bad about growing up and wanting to go out with her friends so often. She wanted her mom, Miss Honey, to get a man. \" You need a man, mom\" Matilda stated before shoving a spoonful of Cheerios in her mouth. \"No I don't, what makes you say that?\" Jennifer asked curiously. Jennifer Honey hadn't thought about dating in years. Matilda and her school always came first. However now that Matilda had mentioned it, and Jennifer didn't really want to admit it, she was right. Maybe if the right guy came along she go out with him, but only for the right guy. \"I'm growing up, I'll be going off to college soon, it might be nice for you to see whats out there\" Matilda replied. She didn't want to be too pushy, Matilda just wanted her mom to be happy. \"Really sweetie, I'm fine.\" She said not so convincingly, \" Perfect, in fact. I have you, the school, my home. I don't need a man to make me happy\" \"I know but someone could make you happier. I'm 16, you can tell me.\" Matilda smiled hoping she wasn't hurting her mother. Jennifer looked at Matilda and smiled. She had a great life but it could get better. \"I'll admit it, it might be nice. So if the right person comes along I won't be completely against getting to know them\" Jennifer said shyly. She wasn't so sure about the idea but it won't hurt. \"Speaking of men, I just hired a new 2nd grade teacher\" Matilda had a questioning expression on her face, \"Oh...\" \"His name is John Kingsley....I think\" Jennifer continued,\"King-something\". \"Where's he from?\" Matilda asked, it wasn't normal to have someone new in their town. \"London, actually. You know the other day when I stayed late. He knocked on their door looking for a job...Well you know Mrs. Dalloway needs maternity leave, so I hired him. He moved here from some boarding school in New York. I think he said he's been in the U.S. 5 or so years.\" Jennifer exclaimed, it will be nice to have a new face around school, she thought. \"Wow, seems nice enough\" Matilda said getting up from the table. Matilda and her best friend Lavender planned to go help the library, a part time job they loved. Matilda hugged Jennifer and started walking to the door, before stopping suddenly as if she forgot something. \"What are you doing?\" she called out. Jennifer coming around the corner, \"I think I go to school get some work done\", she started walking up the stairs to get ready, \" See you later sweetie\". Matilda left and Jennifer continued with her day. Second chapter up soon, this one was just to set up the story.[Chapter 2] Jennifer walked intonthe cool, freshly cleaned hallway of the school. She decided to walknaround, checking up on everything. She saw many teachers gettingntheir rooms ready for the new year. Hanging bulletin boards up,ncleaning cubbies, rearranging desks. This would be a great schoolnyear, she reached the second grade wing and could hear a radio.nJennifer poked her head into one of the rooms and saw the newnteacher. He was bopping his head to the music as he hung up somenposters. John Kingsley had comenfrom up state New York to help his sister who was battling cancer.nOriginally they had come from England, and John always wanted tonteach. He has short brown hair, is a very nice dresser, and anterrific accent. John looked over and saw Jennifer standing in thendoorway. \" Oh hello\" hensaid a little surprised she was there. \" Good morning, thenroom is coming along nicely.\" Jennifer exclaimed walking moreninto the room, her eyes looking over all the new touches John hadnadded. \"Thank you, thank younso much for the oppurtunity, I this is perfect.\" John replied.nHe was so excited, to get a job just for the year was great. \"Of course, one ofnour teachers had maternity leave so it was perfect timing.\"nJennifer said. There was a bit of annawkward pause, \" So how do you like it here?\" Jennifernasked. \"It's great, everyonenis so nice and friendly. I've had the chance to meet a few of thenother teachers. Everyone seems delightful' John replied, he reallyndid like it here. God his accent isncharming Jennifer thought, realizing shenhadn't said anything she finally said \" I'm glad you like it,nI've lived here all my life and it's always been wonderful.\"nJennifer started to walk back towards the door. \"Miss Honey...\"Johnncalled out walking into the hallway. Jennifer turned around. \"Jennifer, please\"nShe said, she always wanted to be on a first name basis with hernstaff they are just as important as she is. \"Jennifer, would younlike to go get a cup of coffee or something? I was thinking aboutntaking a break and I'd love the company\" John asked. He likednJennifer, her dirty blonde hair sparkled in the sunlight and hernvoice was comforting and he could tell she cared for her school. Jennifer was rathernstunned by John's question. Matilda really had perfect timing thisnmorning to talk about men. Jennifer although a little apprehensive tongo, eventually gave in. John Kingsley and JennifernHoney walked around the corner of the school to a little coffee shop.nJohn had coffee, while Jennifer had lemonade. \"How long have younbeen principal?\" he asked. Surely itnhasn't been too long, she's so young, henthought. \"Ten years, my auntnwas the principal before and...\" Jennifer hesistated, \" andnshe left. So I took over and added an upper school.\" \"Wow thats amazing,ndo you have any kids of your own?\" John asked, he secretly hopednshe wouldn't be married. \"Um, yeah well Inadopted her, ten years ago.\"Jennifer hesistantly said. Shendidn't want to give him her life story. \"I should have beennhere ten years ago. Seems like a lot happened then\" John joked. Jennifer laughed. \"You and your husbandnmust be very happy then\" John blurted out, Jennifer was a littlenshocked by his comment, she could feel red come to her cheeks, \"nNo, no husband\". John smiled \"nReally?! That is quite surprising.\" John realized in thatnmoment he felt relieved. He liked Jennifer she was sweet and kind.nShe seemed to really care about her daughter and the children atnschool. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Sorry it kind of endsnat a weird moment but I wanted to get something up. I've been reallynbusy, I'll try to get another chapter up soon. Keep commenting. I'mnnot to sure how far I'll take this. It all depends on what you think![Chapter 3] Sorry I haven't posted inna little while. School has been crazy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jennifer was enjoyingnher lunch with John. He was so sweet and thoughtful. He talked aboutncoming over from England and how much he enjoyed teaching. She talkednabout Matilda and former students. Just as John was telling her aboutnhis last teaching job, Jennifer's cellphone rang. \"Excuse me\"nshe said, rummaging through her purse. \" No problem atnall. I'm going to find the washroom anyway\" he replied gettingnup from his chair. \"Hello?!\"nJennifer answered. \"Hi, it's me. I justngot home and I just wanted to let you know. Hows school going? Do younneed any help?\" Matilda asked. \"No sweetie. I'mnfine. I'm actually have lunch with the new teacher I told you about.nJohn Kingsley\" Jennifer replied. \"That's wonderful.nWhen will you be home?\" Matilda questioned. She was so excited.nJennifer always thought about everyone else, sometimes she justnneeded to do something for her. \"Oh I don't thinknit'll be too much longer. But I'll call you if anything changes.\"nJennifer said sweetly. They ended their phonencall and she saw John on his way back to the table. \"Everything okay?! \"nJohn asked. \"Oh yes, it wasnMatilda just checking up.\" Jennifer replied. \"She seems like angreat kid\" he said. \"Oh she is, the verynbest.\" Jennifer smiled. She was so proud of Matilda. Since thenday the Wormwoods left life has been truely wonderful. \"Do you need to getnback to her? I need to go find a border for my new bulletin board sonit's not problem.\" John suggested. He didn't really want lunchnto end but wasn't sure if Jennifer did. \"I might have one ifnyou need it. I have a lot of my old teaching things at my house.\"nJennifer said. \"That would be songreat. It could really save me the money, but only if you don'tnmind.\" John was so excited. Maybe he could ask her out on a realndate, if he ever got up the courage. \"Not at all. Shouldnwe go now?\" Jennifer asked. They paid the bill andnsoon arrived at Jennifer and Matilda's house. Jen opened the door andnsoon realized Matilda was home. This would be the first time Jennifernbrought someone over that she really liked outside of school. Matilda put down hernbook and looked over at the door. She was so surprised to see a mannstanding with her mom. \"Hi...\" she saidnwalking toward them. \"Hello you must benMatilda, I'm John. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" John shook hernhand and smiled. \"It's a pleasure tonmeet you too.\" Matilda smiled. Jennifer put her arm aroundnMatilda. \"Would you likenanything John?\" Jennifer asked. \"I'm fine thank you\"nhe replied. \"Well if you'd likento sit down, I'll go find my borders for you.\" she turned andnwalked toward the kitchen to go to the basement. Matilda ushered John intonliving room. He sat down in the chair across from her. \"Oh are you reading Pride and Prejudice ?\"nhe asked. \" Yes, I just startednit. Have you read it?\" Matilda didn't really know what to say.nJohn seems like a great match for her mom. \"Many times,nLiterature is one of my favorite subjects. Pride and Prejudice is onenof my favorites\" John replied, \" Do you enjoy reading?\" \"I love to read....\"nMatilda said. Just as Jennifer came in carrying a box. John searched through thenbox and before long he was heading out the door, going back tonschool. Jennifer walked him to the door. \"Thank you very much,nI really appreciate this.\" John thank her on his way out. \"Of course, I'm gladnit's being put to use.\" Jennifer said. John started down thendriveway but quickly turned around. \"Jennifer?!\" hencalled out. She turned around and smiled. \"Yes?\" \"Would you like tonhave dinner with me sometime?\" he asked. \"That would benlovely.\" she replied. \"I'll talk to younabout it at school then?\" he said. \"That's fine.\"nJennifer said smiling. \"I'll look forward tonit.\" John said before turning around and leaving their yard. Jennifer turned around tonsee Matilda leaning against the stairrail. Matilda gave her a verynquestioning look. \"And...\" Matildanfinally questioned. \"And we will be goingnout to dinner sometime soon.\" Jennifer said before blushing andnwalking quickly toward the kitchen to make some tea. Matilda giggled and thenran after her. She found Jennifer standing by the sink putting waterninto the kettle. \"Is this like andate?\" Matilda asked.

The party was over. Alex was late for home. He did not feel like talking to Addy, he was tired of dancing. He did nothing more than charge the battery of his phone and lie down to sleep. Textopolis was already relaxing a little, after so much celebration and that fiasco with the missing Smiler. The Hacker no longer had her Crown or princess hair, returned to her usual Blue Hair with her black beret. \"Hey Lady hacker!\" A girl called after her spanish name Jailbreak jumped because of that scare she got, turned around and looked at Angel next to the blond Boy who was Crying, both had a small plate with a piece of Cake 🍰 \"Hello, Angel,\" she said. \"Good party,Rigth?\" asked the Blonde girl excited. \"Jeje,yes ... maybe we could do it another day.\" She ran her hand through her blue hair with some pity. \"By the way!\" Said Cryer, giving her the plate. \"Here you are! We gave the others some cake, you were the last!\" \"Oh ...\"she said taking the plate.\"Thank you ...\" The blond boy threw his arms around her while he was still crying. \"a pleasure to spend time with you! \"said while patting her. \"Hey ... can you let me go?\" Jailbreak said, smiling uneasily. \"Sorry about that ...\" Cryer drop her. \"Well, thank you very much for the cake.\" She said to them kindly and ready to leave. \"Oh, Jailbreak!\" Angel took her arm. \"I feel a little bad for your Boyfriend Gene \"Wait ... Gene?\" She replied nervously. \"He's not my boyfriend!\" \"Oh, Okay, so I better not tell you what happ\"Angel was interrupted by the one with blue hair. \"no no!. Tell me, what happened to Gene?\"asked With intrigue the blue hair girl \"You see, me and Steve went to leave him a piece of cake, but when I approached him, I managed to see that he was crying\"explained with some Pity.\"I asked why he was crying and why was he feeling bad, but still he did not stop crying. \"oh...\" Jailbreak put a deep face of concern. \"By the way, do you know what's wrong?\" The short yellow haired girl asked \"... thanks for telling me this and thanks for the cake, now if you'll excuse me, I must do something important.\" and without letting Angel say other words, he left that place. She walked all the way to the main entrance while she ate her cake. Once she had finished she left the plastic dish in the trash, but before doing that, she managed to see Hi-5, devouring his cake. The young man with a little overweight was sitting down,his mouth full of glaze and his blue flock that covered his light peach hair, was just as stained. -Hi! .- Jailbreak shouted, running to him. \"Oh! There you are Jails.\" he greet her by her nickname.\"I thought you went home.\" Hi-5 said. \"I ... I do not even have a house.\" She said a little a shamed. \"Oh,well...you can sleep in my house for Tonigth.\" He offered her whit a smile. \"Look, thanks for the offer, but that's not important ... Hi-5 ... do you know where Gene is?\" She asked something worried about the blonde Boy she loved. \"Oh ...\" he put on a sad face. \"Tell me where he is...\" she said desperately. \"...out there...\" The peach-colored haired boy pointed in the distance to that person. Gene was sitting on a bench, covering his face full of tears, and beside him was a piece of Cake. \"oh Gene ...\"whispered Jailbreak covering her mouth with her hands. She was about to go for him to comfort him, but he was stopped by the sturdy boy. \"Hey ... I'm going to talk to him\"Hi-5 said \"you just sneak and listen\" The blue haired one nodded. As she hid behind one of the Concrete Columns, she came close enough to see that Gene was crying. \"Jail ...\" he whispered as tears streamed down his face. \"J-jailbreak\" He raised his head and gave a little kiss in the air, letting it go far When she saw this the princess was open-mouthed and wide-eyed. Was he crying for her? No ... he could not be ... \"Hey Bro!\" He called it Hi-5 with great joy. \"Hello ...\" Gene greet in a very weak voice. \"Hey, my friend, what happened to you?\" He asked confused as he sat on the bench next to him. \"...\"did not say anything, he simply swallowed his pain as more tears fell from his green eyes. \"You look very bad, Are you still suffering from Steven's hangover?\"- asked in a funny tone\"As I remember, I was so drunk ...\" \"No ... it's not that ... just ... I was thinking ...\" Gene said as he turned his gaze to the sky. Jailbreak was completely attentive and doing nothing, had to know what was happening. \"Just ... I was just thinking about Jailbreak,\" he said at last as a small tear ran down his cheek. \"Oh, man... do not feel So sad, I know it hurts ... but there are many more pretty girls in Textopolis ... let's see \".- Hi-5 thought for a while\"Angel !, Angel is cute: \"Angel already has a boyfriend ... I put an enzyme finger and you can consider me dead...\" Gene answered something irritated. \"Well was a good choice ...\"he said with a laugh. Gene simply put a \"😒\" face on him and looked down. \"Oh! Oh, I know, how about one of the princesses?!\"responded with emotion \"They are beautiful and very attractive ...\" Jailbreak heard Hi-5,she put on a face of fury, so tired of those princess stereotypes, yes, she was one, but preferred to remain an emoji with blue hair. \"Oh Hi ... you really do not understand, right?\" He said looking into his eyes again. \"What?\" He asked confused. \"When she came into my life, everything changed, I had never felt this way for anyone ... ever ... I ... I loved her ... loved her more than anyone in this world, see her beautiful eyes Of gold, her true hair, her beautiful crown and still being as she is ... a strong woman ... a girl who can do what she does ... \"There were so many memories that went through her mind. The moment where they had danced together, that moment where he saw her eyes in Spotify, that painful moment where it was rejected but at least managed to touch his hand and that moment where they saw to shine to the song of the whale. \"Independent, strong, beautiful and intelligent\" he let out a small sigh of pain followed with new and fresh tears running down his cheeks \"Jailbreak is not only a princess ... it's MY princess, the one that makes me feel alive .. She took my emotions away ... she's the princess of my heart.\" But at this moment, Gene put a fist in his chest and closed his eyes in pain. \"but ... I know she does not feel the same for me ... so this kiss\" gave another😘 to heaven\"I give it to her ... because I will continue to love her until the end of our Universe ... although that means that I will continue to feel this emptiness in my soul ...\" \"...\" Hi-5 felt uncomfortable listening to this, I did not know how to respond, until he looked at the unscathed Piece of your friend's cake on the plate \"Eh ... are you going to eat that?\" The blond boy simply rolled his eyes and reluctantly gave up his dessert so that the pale peach hair devoured it. Jailbreak could barely assimilate what she just saw and heard. She had totally broken the heart of his beloved Gene. She had taken away his happiness and his love. Tears streamed down her eyes,her hand covering her mouth and her other hand on his stomach as her legs started trembled rapidly and her eyes were literally dilated. the bluehaired girl ran away, anything to remove that guilt she felt inside him now. She came to an alley where only one light lit the place and her body felt againt the light lit,where she fell to her knee,and began to cry in silence. She had accepted him, she was in love with him ... \"Gene ... please forgive me ...\" she whispered through tears as she remembered that moment where she broker his heart. Jailbreak did nothing more than take off her blue hair and black beret, exposing her brown hair and crown, looked at the dark sky and simply drowned in a sea of tears, guilt and regret. TO BE CONTINUED. Hello my people!, As you see, here started a book about this movie that personally, I loved ^^. As you see this is the English version of this fic, I apologize if there is any mistake or spelling. I speak English and I understand it but it is difficult to write. I ask patience for the chapters to come out because it will take some time to publish them since I have to translate them. And finally, this is a question of life and death ... Do you want a passionate chapter? ... Lemon ... Tell me in the comments if you would like to in the future write it 7v7. Well that's it, say goodbye: Vanilla sparcake[Chapter 2] Gene had left his bed, it was 3 in the morning and he had not slept at all, his eye bags were marked in his eyes and his desire to get up was nil. At night his desire to sleep were taken away by the blue-haired girl, who still did not leave his head. \"Well ... I guess I will not be able to sleep, so I better go to the kitchen,\" he told himself. He reluctantly got up and went to the kitchen. He started to pour himself a glass of Orange Juice, but still he kept thinking about the golden-eyed Hacker. \"Oh Jailbreak, why do not you come out of my head?\" He asked, sighing heavily. \"Because she's the one for you,\" a female voice answered, sounding rather bored. \"MOM?!\"He got up scared from the chair as a drop of sweat passed his brow (obviously he was nervous). \"What's going on,swetie?\" She said, stroking his blond hair. \"I only think of someone ...\" he said, sitting back in the chair. \"And that someone is that brown-haired princess?\" She asked \"How do you know?\" He asked, stunned. \"I know you Gene, I can see it in your eyes, I know those eyes and I can assure you that I know what it feels like to be in love ... and what you feel ... is love...\" she said touching his shoulder -... no Mom, she does not love me that way ... she confirmed it to me ... in the face ... \"... Auch ... \"he said with a very small expression of pain. \"The truth is I do not know if I'll feel this way again for someone ... my emotions remain true to her.\" He answered again, taking his juice. Mary was half pensive for a while, she had never seen her son Gene so awkward and sore. Until a very convincing idea came to her head. \"You know son?\"She took his hands and wiped the tears \"She told you that she does not love you?...\" \"Well ... not exactly ...\" He replied, still sad. \"Well, then ... he really rejected you?\" Mary said, giving her a very small gesture of seduction. Gene opened his eyes fully, his expectations rising as he began to smile. \"Mom...\"He got up and hugged her tightly \"Thank you\" \"go swetie...for the love of your life,\" she answered in his boring voice. And with that said, the blond boy got up and ran out of the house. \"Mary?...\"Mel had woken up. \"What is all this scandal?...\" \"Oh honey\"...- she caressed his cheek and then gave him a tender kiss.\" our little one is in love ...\" \"Oh God ... I'm not ready to have Grandchildren ...\" Mel replied rather nervous and with a drop of sweat running down her forehead. \"Wait ... and left at 3 in the morning?\" Jailbreak was still lying on that pole of light, did not want to sleep, that blonde boy was still in her mind while using her Blue screens decoding files. She had blue hair again, but the tears had not gone yet. The darkness that appeared at 3 o'clock in the morning was taking light. As she turned her gaze to the sky to look at the heart in her hands, she had responded to one of his kisses. Closing her eyes and putting that little heart against her chest. \"Well, I'd better go now,\" she said, standing up. She prepared her things and began to walk directly to her work. However she could not see where she was going and hit someone. \"Auch!\" she complained touching her head because of the pain she felt. \"Be careful fool!\" \"Oh ... Excuse me ...\"-The boy got up \"I was looking for ...\" The blue haired girl had finally regained consciousness and saw that the person who dropped it was actually Gene. \"Jailbreak?\" He asked in surprise. \"Oh, Gene!\" She rose quickly to give him a hug. Gene was astonished to see this, the girl hugged him tightly, while stroking her hair. It was as if they had not seen each other for years. \"Its been so long\" Jailbreak said in an angelic tone. \"Jeje, how funny, we barely saw each other yesterday\"said laughing at his very bad joke. \"... are you going to work?\" She asked, running her blue hair out of her eyes to see his beautiful face. \"Of course, it's your first day working after all,\" Gend said giving her a small elbow puch in her arm \"I do not know if I'm going to do it right,\" she said nervously. \"Do not say that, it's going to turn out great! I know you well enough to know that you're an expert in this.\" He said happily. \"You flatter me too much ... there are many better hackers than I, I'm just a princess and now...\" she said \"Well, I tell you, it's because you're the first ...\" He told her, watching her walk, lost in her beauty. That way was a very pleasant one for both of them, chatting and smiling, even something Flushing on both cheeks and tender looks for no reason at all. \"Well ... here we are ...\" she said as she opened the door with a cheat-code. \"Wow, great!\" Said Gene entering the place with great excitement. \"Well ...\" She gave a loud yawn. \"To the office ...\" Gene looked at her a little worried, she seemed to be very tired, and found her in the middle of the street. It seemed she was going to fall asleep at any moment. They reached the scanning room. The Blues Cubicles were dark and filled with dust. \"I think we need Broom, do not you think?\" Said the blond boy, running his hand over a cubicle, staining it with dust. \"Yeah ... but it's not coming yet ... we'll have to wait ...\" Jailbreak said, eyebrows wearily. \"Are you tired?\" Gene asked in a sweet voice. \"Yes ... I did not sleep much ... well ... to be honest, I did not sleep at all ...\" she said and then began to totter. She aimed to fall to the ground, Gene held her, but as he did so... his cheeks turned red. \"Look, if you want, we can rest for a while ...\" She said shyly. \"Of course ...\" she said as she settled into his warm arms. Gene lifted her and carried her in his arms to the scanner and laid her there in the chair and then sat next to her. It was not even a second when Jailbreak rested her head on his shoulder and gave a small \"mmmm\". Gene stood there for a while, very flushed by what just happened. At 5 minutes, he got up and left her there resting. However, the princess opened one of her tired eyes and watched him go. She quickly drew the kiss in her hands, tears began to fall. \"Gene ... one day ... our fingers will interlace, our lips will join, our hearts will feel each other ... and there will be the moment where I will know if this kiss is for me ...\" and with that said , The blue-haired girl fell asleep. TO BE CONTINUED. Hope you like!😍. Sorry if there are grammatical errors, misspellings or very poorly written words, im spanic and I do my best. By the way listen to the song that I leave there above, it is beautiful and I think its perfect for Jailbreaks sleepiness And again i asked you guys(please tell me) Do you want lemon?[Chapter 3] Alex was still sleeping, had his alarm at 6 in the morning, and it was still 5 o'clock in the morning. The citizens of Textopolis had awakened in good time and were strolling around the city. Gene had already returned. It was still an hour before work began. He had gone for some coffee for Jailbreak. When he came in,he realized that she was asleep while snoring softly. Gene could feel nothing but tenderness at seeing this,jailbreak had never been more cute than now. He very slowly approached her and watched her sleep. \"She's so beautiful when she sleeps.\" Gene whisper as he stroked her blue hair. \"mmm ... Gene\" She whispered his name as if she was a small child but said it very low so he could not hear much. He lay down beside her again, but decided to do something better ... He took off her black beret revealing her beautiful princess hair. \"It's better this way ...\" he said affectionately as he still stroked her hair. \"Mmm ... Gene,\" she whispered again, but this time looking at the blond. \"... if you only knew how much I love you ...\" he whispered sweetly. \"Steven is here Bitches!\" Cried a deep male voice. At this, Gene looked through the scanner glass. It was Steven the devil who was holding his hand with Angel. \"And here is the sexy and hot Angel!\" He said giving a kiss in the hand to his partner. \"Oh, Steven, what's up,\" she said, blushing. \"AGH !, WHAT A DAMN MORNING!\" shout the one with green mint hair (ice cream). \"Oh please, for you, every morning is damned.\" Poop said quietly. \"good you do not melt in this piece of Sh\" he keep an uncomfortable silence while he looked at him. \"No, no, calm down, finish your sentence,\" the dark-skinned man replied quietly. \"Good,they all are coming, better get prepared\" Gene got out of the chair but his gaze turned again to see the princess. \"Goodbye ... and good luck ... I love you ...\" He stroked her hair once more and then gave her a very small but sweet kiss on her forehead...Too bad she was asleep. - \"Hello Gene!\" Said Hi-5 greeting with happiness. \"Hello, my friend,\" he said, greeting him. \"Since when were you here?\" Hi-5 asked surprised. \"since 3 o'clock in the morning\" The blond haired boy answered. \"Wow ... at least these earlier than anyone ... and why were you awake at that time? ... I was snoring the whole night...\" the peach-haired boy giggled \"... i was with Jails, fixing a few things\" he answered nervous \"uuuh, you had the girl\" he replied with a mischievous smile. To which Gene simply gave a strong blush. \"And where is the lady?\" He ask, looking around. \"She's sleeping, when she came here she seemed to be very tired and I told her to sleep at least a little.\" He said, then let out a sigh. \"And God ... she's so tender when she sleeps\" \"And what do you expect, my friend?\" He asked excitedly. \"No Hi ... She does not love me ... well ... maybe she does... ahh! I do not know...\" \"Hello Gene!\" A female voice said behind him. The blond-haired boy and the sturdy boy turned around to meet the rabbit girls. \"Oh Hello Derkie Bunny, Hello Bunny Missy\"Gene creer them with a wink of eyes?. \"My friend Derkie just wanted to tell you something, my friend.\" Said Bunny Missy. \"Well ... I just wanted to tell you that I admire you a lot and that skill you have is very unique.\" Said Derkie with a smile. \"Thank you.\" Gene smiled at that nice compliment. \"wanted to ask me if ... you could make me a kiss face?... is that it is my favorite face, my job is only ... hehe ... you know ...\" she replied moving her ears nervously That request. \"... sorry Derkie ... but ... I can not do that,\" Gene said in the kindest way possible. \"Why not?\" Derkie said sadly. \"Why ... that would make me an infidel ...\" \"Who is it?\" Missy asked, confused. - Jailbreak was already awakening from its strong sleep, her eyes began to open. \"Oh, you woke up,\" one of his companions said to her. \"You can tell that you're tired ...\" \"Gene?,Honey is that you?\" She woke still half asleep. \"No ... I am Francis,\" replied his companion. \"Oh ... it's just you ...\" she said irritably. \"But someone left you a coffee, over there\"The bigger boy pointed to the table on the control panel. The girl finally regained consciousness and looked at the small cup of coffee? along with a note✉. Jailbreak took the letter in Her hands, which proceeds to read aloud. \"Dear Jailbreak: I know you're a little tired and I do not want you to have problems with your work, so I brought you this delicious coffee to make you feel better. With a lot of love, Gene. \" \"aaaaww\"said the boys upon hearing that message. \"Wow Gene\" She said with a sweet smile and followed that up she took some coffee. \"Well we turn this thing on?\" said the thinner decoder to turn on the scanner. While her colleagues were busy with the scanner she took the opportunity to peer into the doorway and see if Gene was nearby. But she could not stop thinking about last night. Those words echoed in her mind. \"I know she does not feel the same for me ... so i give this kiss yo her... because I will continue to love her until the end of our universe ... although that means that I will continue to feel this emptiness in my soul...\" Right now she felt a very strong Rage, a strong desire to cry, to scream in pain, to run to his beloved Gene and give all her romantic emotions in a beautiful kiss. But she could not, had already rejected him once, that had no arrangement. \"Incoming message!\" shouted one of the digits. \"All of you to your places!\" Jailbreak shouted through the microphone. When they said that,all the emojis went to their respective cubicles. Alex was talking to a new friend he had met recently: Peter Duke. He was wishing him a good morning and it was obvious he was going to use an emoji. \"It's already decided! ...we are go for Gene!\" Shouted the larger moderator. \"Jailbreak, the scanner!\" \"...\"she had her head down with tears in her eyes, guilt consumed her slowly again. \"Jailbreak!\" They pulled her out of her thoughts, quickly wiped her tears. \"Oh, yeah!\" She glanced over at Gene. \"Ready!?\" \"As you commanded my commander!\" Said Gene excitedly. But just as she was about to scan him, she looked at him in front of her. She looked at those eyes that she loved so much, was paralyzed and appeared, Gene was the same. Both had been trapped in the memories of the past that lived together. Jailbreak's smile had withered and her eyes only reflected pure pain, cold and fresh tears began to fall from her eh es. \"Jailbreak?\" Gene asked, seeing her face full of suffering. All the emojis began to murmur and to put faces of confusion by what happened with the princess hacker. \"G-Gene,\" she said with a hiccup attack. \"I ... I ...\" \"What ... what's wrong with you?\" He asked worriedly. She did not do anything, her hand moved away from the scan button and left the scanner, running and crying. \"I'm sorry ... I'm really sorry ...\" Jailbreak whispered taking her black beret and blue hair, her voice was broken and dry. \"What?\" Gene Asked Friar sullenly. \"I never wanted to hurt you ...\" she ran away. \"Jailbreak wait!\" Gene yelled at her, but she kept running until she could no longer see her. \"Very late!, Gene do your thing\".- said a moderator preparing the scanner. - That day of work was a real hell for Gene, hekept thinking about Jailbreak and her mournful departure. He was so distracted and sore that he could barely make faces during his workday. At last Alex turned off his phone and went to bed after having been sending messages to his girlfriend Addy and thousands of his friends. Everyone was already going home for tomorrow. Mary and Mel had seen what happened from above the cubicles and were very worried about their son. \"Gene?\" Mary asked, taking both of his son's cheeks. \"Sweetie, what happened?\" \"That girl left and not in a good way,\" Mel said, somewhat worried about both of them. \"Mom, dad.\" Gene said worriedly and started to cry. \"This ... this is not right ...\" \"What's the matter, darling? Please speak to us,\" Mary said, stroking his cheek. The blond-haired boy escaped from his parents' embrace and ran away. \"I have to find her! I can not bear to have her away from my side, she has gone ... and took my heart with her...\"and with a serious face,he went away from textopolis. \"Hey, what's wrong with my friend?\" Hi-5 asked as soon as he arrived with Gene's parents. \"I do not know, but we'd better go for him.\" Mel said,he aimed to follow his son, but was stopped by Mary who grabbed his hand and gave him a sweet kiss on the forehead. \"Its ok sweetheart, I know his gonna be fine ...\" she said, giving him another kiss but on his lips. \"Ok Mary ...i trust you\" Mel said embracing her beloved wife as sole consolation. - The blue-haired girl was on the floor, hugging her legs while crying in silence. Spotify's slow, romantic music was something that cried out when she was very sad. A perfect place to be able to let go your melancholy and sadness go. \"Gene...i love you more than you can imagine...\" she said watching the waves of music in the air, sharing different songs \"Forgive me Gene, forgive me for being so selfish and not think about your love and for Everything that you did for me ... I promise that I will not stop loving you ... I love you my prince, with every part of my heart ... With her decoding screen, she put a song to soothe that guilt in her soul. *Put multimedia music* She hid between her legs and continued to cry, until she heard a voice that took her out of her thoughts. \"I'm glad to hear that ... because I love you too ... my love ...\" said a sweet voice behind her. She quickly turned to see Gene with a rose in his hand and a cuite smile on his face. Very slowly he sat next to her, balanced his feet in the water of pixels. \"Beautiful song you put ...\" he said looking at her tenderly. \"oh Gene ...\"she said desperately and then burst into tears in his arms. \"I'm sorry, I'm really sorry!\" \"Jailbreak ... I do not have to forgive anything ...\" said the blond boy stroking his hair. \"I was selfish, I only cared about my well-being, not you, everything you told me was beautiful and I do not deny this feeling ...\" she replied as she wiped her tears \"I understand if you hate me and even if you do not want to be With me, I hurt you ... and there is no excuse for what I did ...what a princess I am ... I do not deserve this ... I like you just the way you are ... I like you ...\" She quickly pulled out the heart she had accepted and handed it to Gene. Gene gave a small sigh as he listened to the song. \"Jailbreak ... you are not a simple princess ... you are the princess of my emotions\"he said \"Huh?\" She looked up, Gene quickly wiped the tears and gently took her face. \"Since you got in all my life is in a different color ... absolutely everything, I always had emotions, but I never felt what I feel for you ...\" He stared into her eyes. \"What do you feel?\" She asked in an angelic voice. \"Love, love for someone, that sweetness of having you here by my side, that need to kiss you, to love you, to hug you ... you made me feel ...\" said Gene taking one of her hands and then kissing it softly. He quickly removed her cap again and caressed her hair again. \"You know, I love to see how you really are, a pretty girl with a heart of gold\" he continued touching her hair. \"Gene ...\" Her tears were now of happiness. \"Do not cry my princess ...\" he whispers, embracing her. \"Remember that you are a strong princess who is capable of everything and that you are the only one who makes me feel alive ...\" \"Gene ... I like you as well as you are...\"she said taking his hand to kiss her \"and when I say I like you ...it means I love you, I know I'm a simple princess, but you also made me feel ...You made me feel love for someone else but me ... your emotions are something that makes you unique and I do not want to be a princess waiting for her prince ... I want to be a princess next to her prince ... They were face to face, their lips did not resist, Their eyes were witnesses, the love between them existed. \"Jailbreak ...\" he said running her brown hair that covered her left eye. \"Gene\" She put a finger on a tear that ran down the blond's cheek. Very slowly Gene laid his hands on her beloved's hip and she around his neck, they remained static for a moment, they felt the breathing of the other, closed their eyes with caution and awkwardly joined lips. Gene was experiencing a new emotion right now, never felt like this in his entire life. Jailbreak felt he had gone to heaven just for a moment ... just for a moment That was the most apassionate,cuite and sincere kiss they ever had. They broke off the kiss and laid their heads to join their foreheads and join their noses. \"I love you Jailbreak, I'll never stop loving you,\" Gene whispered. \"I love you Gene, I'll always love you,\" Jailbreak whispered. And after that kiss, Gene took his beloved in his arms and took her home. TO BE CONTINUED.[Chapter 4] warning,this chapter contains lemon(erotic writting).

He could feel her, she had a smooth, white skin which was nice to touch \"Mom? Dad?\" Gene called into the dark room. Jailbreak hit the light switch and the room lit up. Gene and Jailbreak saw the married couple lying on the couch. Mary was sleeping peacefully next to her husband, curled up and hugged, while Mel embraced her and lay his head on hers. Also they were holding hands. A/N:yes,i ship MaryxMel,Dont hudge please -_-. \"Aaaw thast so adorable,\" Jailbreak whispered, looking at Mary and Mel asleep. \"Not as adorable as the girl I'm about to kiss.\" Gene whispered with a smile on his lips.

His back,Her lega,his chest,her lap. Gene increased the intensity of the kiss while stroking his beloved Jailbreak's. He took advantage and got on top of m her. \"Give love, please?\" She said with a slight blush on her cheeks. \"As you wish honey,\" Gene said with a mischievous look as he stroked her cheek and then her fair-haired princess hair. Jailbreak smiled shyly and looked down at his hand on her cheek. The blond boy kissed her again passionately again, the kiss began to go down her cheeks until it reached her neck. Jailbreak began to moan tenderly as her boyfriend began to kiss her neck placidly and proceeded to give some blades, Her hands hold his blond hair tightly. She recharged strength and took him down. \"My turn, sweetie.\" She gave him a quick kiss, to which Gene was brightly flushed. Jailbreak started down to his belt and took off his yellow jacket and began to kiss and bite Gene's lap and Abs, causing several moans from his lips. \"I-I love you ...\" Gene blushed. \"I know honey\" The brown-haired took off his pants leaving him in his underwear to continue her work. \"Do you like it?\" She asked as she kissed his neck. \"Yes ... it feels good,\" he said with loud groans. Jailbreak lay back on the bed, leaving Gene get Up again. \"Hey, you want me to go on?\" Gene asked as he reached her breasts,which were covered by her black dress. \"Yes, please,\" she asked shily. Lifting her off the bed, she turned her back on him,Gene slowly took off her dress from above, now she only had on her bra and gray underwear, her body was very pretty. \"Wait ...\" she said turning around to see his eyes. \"Calm down, I will not be brusque,\" Gene said quietly. \"no ... it's not that ... it's just that I want to clarify something else\" she said a little to be and also embarrassed \"us princesses do not have a nice body ... that I assure you it's just a Rumor ... I'm just a normal girl who\" she was interrupted by her boyfriend who silently mutes her. \"Hey, sweetie, I do not care how you look ... I love you because it's you ...\" she said giving him a kiss on the forehead. \"Fine...\"she said looking away somewhat embarrassed \"just be careful, okay\" \"You know I'll never hurt you,\" Gene said, stroking her cheek again. Gene slowly turned her around and went down to her hip where he began to kiss her back. \"Mmm, G-gene!\" She said, embarrassed as she squeezed a pillow. Alread excited, she got up and looked at his Lap which she found very attractive, was not so marked but he had a very nice physique. \"I do not know why you're talking nonsense,\" he said looking down at her. \"You're beautiful ...\" \"Do not say that, I'm sure there are better girls and much prettier girls,\" she said, covering herself with her arms. \"I doubt it\" he whispered. Jailbreak looked down, looking at what was inbbetween between his legs, she very slowly move her hand and began to massage her partners Sensitive área. \"Ow ... J-ja-jailbreak ... uff ... this is so ...\" the boy said between moans \"Oh God ...\" After those pleasant caresses. Gene left her underneath him, she was helpless, thirsty, wanted to make sure Gene was only for her. \"Jails, it's my turn.\" He said, looking sheepishly at his gray panties. \"Can I?\" She simply nodded her cheeks were more red than usual. Gene very slowly put his hands on that thin cloth that covered his legs and pulled it back, he very delicately got a finger in her sensitive area. \"Aaawww,Gene! This is so... ah, ah!\" She moaned with a soft tone of voice. The blonde loved to hear this, it was his first time after all and he wanted his beloved princess to enjoy it. Jailbreak had never felt so helpless and satisfied,she loved this moment that she was living, with her half-opened eyes he saw as Gene uncliped her bra and kissed one of her nipples and then feel like a warm tongue began to lick her while another hand began to massage Her other Bread. \"Gene,\" she moaned as she stroked his blond hair. \"God, Jailbreak ... I love you so much.\" Gene said kissing one of her breasts. \"I love you, too,you beautiful boy\" she whispered. He started to come down to kiss her again. Jailbreak did not expect it, but as he kissed her, he entered in her slowly. This caused Jailbreak to get paralyzed and give a small moan of pain. \"Wh-what's wrong? Are you okay?\" Gene asked with a little concern. \"no,i-its O-ok\"she said weakly with small tears of pain in her eyes \"just ... be careful, okay?\" \"As you wish, my love\" he said softly He began to move slowy inside of her, continued giving her kisses and caresses, anything to distract her from that pleasant pain she felt. Jailbreak's tears of Pain were gone, now they were only moans of pleasure that came from her lips, as she drug her nails to Gene's back and interlaced her legs aroun his hips. \"Aaah, Gene ... mmm\" moaned Jailbreak with angelic tone. \"You ... do you like it?\" Gene asked sweetly. \"S-yes ... that feels nice\" she told him as she hugged his neck. \"Mmmm, J-jails ...\" he said as he bit his lip, began to increase speed, increasing Jailbreak's moans. They continued for a time, enjoying this act between them, sharing the same passion, Sweetness and love. Gene felt that at any moment he was going to came an,he began to slow down the thrusts. \"Jailbreak ...\" He sigh heavily. \"J-jailbreak I think I-I'm going to...\" 'Gene ...\"she felt she was going to do it \"Aaaah ... ahhh!\"... They both uttered one last groan, they both reach the climax together. She felt a hot liquid running down her legs. They both fell, looking at each other with a tender and tired look \"That was beautiful,\" she said, covering herself with the sheets. \"Jails ...thank you\" Gene put his hand on her cheek. She smiled at him and kissed his hand and then kissed his lips. \"Thanks to you too,\" she said to rest her head and arms on her partner's chest and fall asleep. TO BE CONTINUED[Chapter 5] It was 6 in the morning, Alex was well asleep and did not feel like getting up, it was Saturday, a perfect day to rest until 9 or 8 in the morning. Mary had woken up earlier than usual, being hugged by her husband. She looked around,she had fallen asleep on the sofa. \"Gene will have come home last night?\" She whispered. Gene has been dating Jailbreak for over 2 weeks. And shes been really curious. She was about to get up, but warm arms threw her affectionately and she felt Mel give her a kiss on the forehead. She gave a small growl and very slowly escaped Mel's arms. \"Mary?\" Asked Mel, confused. \"Do not worry honey, I'm coming back,\" she said softly as she stroked his hair and set a small kiss on his lips. The blond woman, I walk aimlessly down the stairs to reach her son's room. \"Darling?\" She knocked on the door of her room. No Anders \"Gene are you there?\" Seeing that there was not much listening and no response, she proceeded to open the door ... only to take the biggest surprise of her existence. \"AAAAHHH!\"Gene and Jailbreak shouted as he entered. They both covered themselves with the sheets and looked at her in terror. \"Jailbreak!,behind me!\" The blonde told his partner. Jailbreak already somewhat frightened hid behind Gene and barely looked at her mother-in-law and her reaction. Mary could not believe what she saw, she was not stupid either, but she had many doubts and things running through her head. \"What ... how ... when?\" She gasped. \"Mom... I can explain!\" Said Gene with a bead of sweat running down his forehead. \"Sweetie, you should not explain anything to me,\" she said, still surprised and astonished. \"...Hello Mrs. Meh\"Greeting The princess-haired girl nervously. \"You can tell that the love between you two is strong ...\" Mary said. \"Wait ... are not you going to kick me out of the house or any of that?\" Jailbreak asked, calming down a little. \"Meh ...\" she replied quietly. \"Mary,Honey\" Mel was heard approaching. -What is all this ...HOLLY GOD ... - The blond man was very blushing when he saw his son lying next to Jailbreak. \"Aaahh!\" They both shouted again. \"we better leave them here...\" said Mary grabbing her husbands hand and closing the door. Gene and Jailbreak looked at the closed door for a while, then turned back to bed. \"Darn... that ... that was intense ...\"said Jailbreak running her hand over herface. \"Yes ... I wonder how much they saw.\" Gene said looking at her still amazed at what just happened. \"I do not know, but I do not think I saw much there,\" she told him as she lay back on the bed. \"Come on, you want something to eat?\" he said as he picked up her dress from the floor and gave it to her. \"Sure honey, by the way,you have sweet Bread for breakfast?\" She said taking her dress and turning her back to get dressed. \"as sweet as you?\" He smiled mischievously as he pulled on his jacket. \"Okay, enough.\" She laughed. \"Come, my princess.\" Gene took her in his arms and led her into the kitchen. \"Wow, if you're gentleman,\" she told him, leaning on his chest. - \"And how do I look?\" Asked Jailbreak putting on her Black Beret again. \"Well you look good ... but I like it better when you see your real hair.\" Gene said as he watched as she changed clothes. \"I dont know ... I do not want to be disturbed.\" She said something distressed. \"Why would theh bother you?\" Gene asked, taking her hand. \"Sometimes i asked myself why you can say such stupid things ... you're beautiful just the way you are ...\" \"... do you really think so?\" She said with a tender smile. \"Of course i do,silly!, that no time that I love you!?... and I do not love you because you are a princess, I love you because you are you, I like you as you are, the one I loved is MY princess...\" \"... okay ... but then do not complain if another guy stares at me\" She made a laugh, leaving her beret to one side. \"If another emoji tries to mess with you, believe me I will assure them that you are mine ... -said Gene a little serious. \"And believe me I will not let any girls out there leave me away from your side,\" Jailbreak said with a funny Smile Their hands intertwined and went to the entrance of the house, sitting on the steps of the stairs and saw the city, was very quiet and on the sidewalks they were very small flowers blooming. \"Mmm.\" Jailbreak chuckled as she watched her boyfriend smile. \"What's up?\" Gene asked, puzzled. \"Nothing ... I just love to see you smile ... your smile is more beautiful than Smiler's,\" she replied as she looked up at the blue sky. \"I do not think so, Smiler can not be compared,\" Gene replied, smiling as a strong blush on his cheeks. \"Well, believe me,\" she said, putting her hands on her cheeks. \"The girl who loves you is telling you this ...\" He kissed her lips, Gene could taste them and feel her cherry lipstick. It was such a sweet moment that he was afraid that his clumsy hands caressing her brown hair might ruin everything. Everything was beautiful ... until ... \"What the hell?\" Asked A voice foreign to them. Jailbreak and Gene got separates at the sound of that voice and saw that Hi-5 was in front of them. The light peach-haired boy was gaping and smiling. \"It can not be ...\" he said, laughing at happiness. \"Yes Hi ... it's happening,\" Jailbreak said, hugging the blonde in the back. \"Oh God!, I never came to think that this would happen!\" Hi-5 said jumping of happiness. Gene was inspired to take one of those little flowers that grew on the sidewalk, once he took it he placed it in Jailbreak's hair, this beautiful act made the princess haired girl blush and give him a very adorable look. Just as he was about to kiss her, she rose and ran as she laughed. \"What are you doing?\" Asked Gene confused as he watched her go. \"If you get to work before me Ill give you a kiss.\" She winked at him and smiled mischievously and then ran off. \"Oh yes ... that's my princess.\" He got up to follow her. \"wait,wait for me!\"said Hi-5 following them both And that crossing throughout Textopolis was the best love game they could have played, jumping, laughing and going through places they had never seen. From that brief moment where they came to work, I will not give you more details ... Never. TO BE CONTINUED.[Chapter 6] It was amazing,right? Already a year had passed since Gene and Princess Jailbreak had started a love affair, it really was a wonderful thing for both of them. Their love encounters were always before they started working and during the night. They interlaced their hands, joined their lips and their activities together were very pleasant. Jailbreak now had a larger heart where her only concern was Gene and his well-being. From that wonderful declaration of love. They were never the same, had begun a new love. However, at the beginning of the second year of Alex's school. Something strange began to happen. Jailbreak seemed to be hiding something, she was very sentimental and sometimes at bedtime she approached Gene to hug him as her only comfort until shr felt asleep, she seemed to be very thoughtful from time to time, as if it were something very worrisome,She was really unhealthy,whit a strong stomacheach and rally tires ... she was hiding something ... especially from her boyfriend. Gene at this moment was already very worried about her, he did not like to see her sad especially the silence and the pain looks in her face. That day It was night, Gene left the bathroom and went to get Jailbreak to go to sleep. \"Jails?\" Gene said, entering the room to look for her, and there she was, but she was asleep and with her hands in her belly. \"Gene ...\" she whispered as she slept. She looked like a tender Angel sleeping in a cloud. The blond boy looked at her tenderly and went to her to lift her into his arms and carry her to bed. Once there he covered her with the sheets and turned off the light, and then got hugged on the back by the princess. \"Good Night...i love you...\" she whispered. \"Love you too, dear,\" he said, then closed his eyes. It was 3 in the morning, Jailbreak did not slept much. Something was hitting her inside and did not allow her to sleep in peace. She was at the kitchen table, sipping a cup of coffee to put off sleep desires,you easily see the dark shadows under her eyes. \"How am I going to tell him?... no ... I dont want him to leave me...\" Said the princess a Little worried. \"My love?\" A male voice was heard. \"J-jailbreak? ... Honey, what are you doing at this hour?\" \"no ... I'm not so good that de could say\" She rests her head on the table. \"Jailbreak, did something happend?\" asked the blonde leaning his head on the table to see her tired face \"This month you havent been so well...\" \"It's nothing ... I just do not feel good,my Stomach kinda hurts and uuuhh! ...\"she Moaned in pain. \"Youre not sick, arent you?\" He said, stroking her brown hair. \"No... I'll be fine, I promise ...\" Jailbreak whispered as he took her hand to give him a small kiss. \"C'mon, let's go back to bed,\" Gene suggested as he took her hand. \"Can you carry me?\" She asked as she put on a doggy face and stretched her arms. \"Im weak... please?...for the little princess who loves you ...\" \"Okay ... okay.\" Gene chuckled, then carried her in his arms and carried her away. \"Wow, you got a little weight left, eh?\" Said Gene with a giggle. \"Maybe ...\" she said in a tired voice. \"You should stop eating so many strawberries,\" the blonde boy joked. \"Shut up,\" she said with a weak laugh. That User, Alex, who was once a shy young boy of 14 years old, was now a wild teenof 15, he has been Addy's Boyfriend for a year and was doing very well at school. But as always, the bigger you are, the more friends and social networks you have. And this time was no exception. It was the fall dance and this time he went with new friends, capture that moment with photos and turn off his phone for a while. That gave the Emojis the perfect opportunity to plan a party. So it was proposed that everyone will arrive early to work,organize and leave everything finished for tonight. Gene and Jailbreak had arrived at the same time and they met with Hi-5, although all the others were were looking at \"lady hacker\" by how destroyed and tired she looks. \"Are you sure you do not want to sleep for a while?,You do not look so good.\" Gene told his girlfriend with a little worry. \"Dude,its seems that you were in the recycling bin ...\"Hi-5 said a bit uncomfortable. \"I'm going to ... be ... okay,\" she replied a little dizzy. Her dizziness and wobble made her collide with the boy with red hair and horns. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Steven.\" The princess apologized. \"I'm a little tired\" \"You calm down,no problem\" said the devil without any discomfort. \"Hey Steven\" Gene greeting kindly \"hows Angel and Stevie? The news had become viral through all Textopolis and the surprise became gigantic when this had been revealed. It had been four months since Angel had given the news that she was expecting a son from Steven. They were going to be parents and they already had a name for the little one: Stevie. \"My beautiful Angel is resting,so our baby can good health.\" He smiled proudly \"But you do not look good, what happen?...\" \"Lasg night I felt several kicks in my belly and also some pain.\" She responded touching her belly with a strong expression of pain on her face. \"Are not you thinking of going to a doctor?\" Steven asked. \"With who? With Nurssery Ann?\" She giggled. \"Haha, how funny,\" Steven said sarcastically. \"Message incoming!\" shouted one of the moderators. \"Well, today Alex got up active\" Said Hi-5 surprised. \"to your places everybody!\"shouted Jailbreak with all the strength that remained \"I have to go, goodbye Babe!\" She gave him a quick kiss on the lips and ran out. \"Good-bye!\" Gene said as he watched her leave. Alex was on the Bus now with his best friend, both had their phones in hand as they quickly texted. \"Hey, you almost change places eh?\" Alex said to the boy with a cap. \"They're almost going to pick up Addy. \"ahg!, Okay: He said something irritated.\"Mai sent me a Text!\" \"and I got a text from Peter...\" said he noticed his phone, ready to send a new message. \"Are you going to the dance\" Before sending the message, he went to the Emojis section and went to look for \"?\". \"All right, Whinky Eye! You're the one!\" Said the thinner moderator. \"Very well then!\" He replied excitedly, made his face and sent the text. \"Perfect,\" Jailbreak said with a small yawn. It happened a 1 later and a new texg came from Peter. \"HELL YES?! Are you going to go with Addy?\" Alex was ready to respond. \"Of course, yes, she is my life\" \"It's already ... decided.\" Jailbreak said moving the scanner towards The girl with heart shape eyes but at that moment, her stomach began to thin out and to erupt it gently \"Heart eye!,your... you ... you follow...are you still...\" \"Hey girl, are you ok?\" Asked the blonde girl with Hearts in her eyes. \"Jail, Honey ... are you sure nothing's going wrong?\" Gene asked, more worried than before. \"I ... I ... Urp!\" She quickly covered her mouth as she swelled her cheeks. She quickly left the scanner and went to the girls bathroom, went into one of the cubicles and lift the Toilet coger and Set, got on her knees and did what she needed ... Barf... Alex left with his friends and Addy to hang out for a while before the party started, turned off his Wi-fi to not have Notifications and left messaging for a while. On the other hand. Jailbreak was in the bathroom, vomiting for the third time. She really did not feel well, he could not keep hiding this any longer. \"Oh God,\" she said, pulling the chain and coming out of the bathroom to wipe her mouth. \"I can not hide this anymore...but ... I do not want him to leave, maybe he wont take it that well...Oh God...what do I do?...\" The girl with princess hair said as she looked worried in the mirror. She took a paper towel and wiped her mouth,ready to leave but her boyfriend's voice stopped her. \"Im telling you Hi ... I'm worried sick for Jailbreak, if something happens to her,i dont know what could do...she has been in that state for over a month... she says that her stomach hurts and she is very Tired and with what happened today...gosh...It sounds like something is bothering her... it seems she's hiding something from me...\"he scrachted his blond hair. \"I do not know bro,\" said the sturdy boy, scratching his head rather uncomfortably. \"It seems she does not trust you ...\" \"How can she not trust me?\" He said surprised by what his best friend told him. \"Maybe she's afraid you'll say something and leave her ... or possibly get mad at her,\" Hi-5 explained. \"How could I leave my Beloved Princess?\" he said in a more serious tone. \"anything and no one will separate me from her, I do not care what the consequences are, I loved her and I will never top doing that...she Made me feel love,i will support her in the good and the bad and if I had to give my emotions and happiness and be only a \"Meh\" for her, then so be it!\" Jailbreak felt a deep happiness and tenderness to hear those words,her hands were made a fist in her chest while tears of happiness came from her eyes ... \"I love Jailbreak ... I do not care about obstacles ... I will fight for this love\" finished talking and there was a long silence. \"Wow...\"Hi-5 gaped at him and with a rare smile \"It is noticeable that the love between you and her is strong ... that sounds crazy\" \"Hi, when it's for love, anything is posible\" he said with a smile. \"and for you ...\"jailbreak whisper as she wiped her tears \"you took my words away\" And with a sweet smile, she came out of the bathroom. \"Well,i interrupt something?\" She asked slyly. \"Jails!,there you are!\" Gene hugged her tightly to see her \"I was so worried about you ...\" \"Everythings better,Ok... \"she replied stroking his blond hair. In a moment of happiness, Gene took her cheek and kissed her lips to which she also kissed him passionately. \"OIGAN!\" The Trio heard an emotional scream in the room \"this supposed to be a Fiesta!\" The screams of emotion were heard back there. \"Then let it begin!\" A glass got broken followed by a wave of shouts. \"What are we doing here?\" Hi-5 jumping of happiness \"Let's dance!\" \"Come with me M'lady?\" Gene said, kneeling and offering his hand to the princess. \"Jejeje, of course ...\"she simply took his hand and went to the party. Among all these people dancing, the couple who won the track was Gene and Jailbreak. It was not romantic music, if not music that gave the environment. \"Let's do Emoji Pop!\" Jailbreak shouted as she followed in her partner's footsteps. \"Your killing it Jailbreak!,Vamos!, Baila princesa!\" Gene said as he grabbed her waist and made her dance. Face to face and step by step. Neither could Alex be having a better time at the ball. Jailbreak felt totally confident this time, she was no longer afraid, she had already decided, she was going to tell her boyfriend something that happened a month ago ... To get the attention of everyone she climbed to the top and gave a loud cry. \"MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!?\" Everybody stay in silence and the silent music change to something slower and romantic. \"I ...\" She gave a heavy sigh. \"I have something to say...and it's especially for you Gene Meh... the emoji i love...\" TO BE CONTINUED. next chapter is the last one[Chapter 7] \"Me?\" Asked Gene surprised. \"Yes ... you ...\" She got off and walked to her beloved Gene Everyone in the place kept Silence, Gene was too popular and that for everyone was something to be admired. \"Gene ... I love you ... and I dont want to keep hiding this ... I dont want to be selfish and less a closed-minded... so I want to confess something ... and ... promise not to You're going to be angry\" \"Just tell me what happens, I'm desperate to see you like this,\" Gene begged as he took her cheek. \"I ... I ... I'm ...\" She swallowed in fear. \"You what?\" He asked desperately and with sweat running down his forehead. Hi-5, Mel and Mary were behind Gene, very attentive to what the princess was gonna say and everyone else was quiet meanwhile Ed Shreeran's song \"thinking aloud\" was in the background. \"...Gene...I...\"she sighed heavily and closed her eyes heavily \"I cant...I dont know if I'm ready ... or even YOU are ready for this...\" \"Jailbrean, take it from me!\" Gene took her face and stared at her. \"Look at me! You can tell me anything, that I'll never leave you or judge you, come on ... trust the boy who loves you.\" he took her hand while still looking at her golden eyes. She could no longer take it. Under her gaze and strong breath, swallowed saliva and her hands became a fist. She looked up and let it go. \"...I'm pregnant...\" The music was interrupted by a sudden \"Scratch\". Those words echoed in Gene's mind, he could barely assimilate what he had just heard ... he was going to be a father... And the reactions? Well...Hi-5 almost chokes on a piece of cake by hearing that. Mary was just like her husband, eyes wide open. The other Emojis said a loud sigh of surprise and the murmurs were soon heard. \"... sorry.\" Gene began to giggle. \"What did you say?...i didnt listen well...\" \"I'm ... I'm pregnant, Gene,\" she said taking heis hand. \"I'm going to have a baby soon ...a baby...our Baby. \"But ... but how?\" Mary said confused. \"If that happened a year ago ...\" \"Honey ...\" Mel began to think. \"Remember that a month ago Gene went to sleep at Jailbreak's house,at her mom's house?\" \"ooohhhh\" she said already catching the fact \"that makes more sense...\" \"You ... you ... are you ... pregnant?\" He said in astonishment. \"Yes ...\" She smiled faintly as she clasped her hands together. Whe are goin to be parents ...\" Gene ran his hand over his face as he gave a small sigh and began to think about the situation right now. Jailbreak looked worried and frightened by what he could tell her. -Jails ... this is why you felt so bad? .- Gene asked and understood what was happening. \"Yes ...\" she looked at him frightened. \"Are you annoyed?\" -Jails how can I be annoyed with you ... for giving me a gift as beautiful as this! .- he said smiling as he touched his belly.-but ... \"But what?\" She said, changing her smile as she listened. \"It's ... I'm angry that I did not say this before ...\" he said a little annoyed. \"... I ... I was afraid ...\" \"Scared of what?\" He asked, intrigued. \"afraid ... afraid that you would abandon me ...\" she said head down. \"I was afraid that you will leave me for this little one that I take inside ... I ... I want to have it ... i want this little one to be My child ... and I will give it all the love and love he deserve ... and i dont want him to grow up without his father ... I need you ... we need you ...\" Gene looked at her in silence for a while. I do not expect it but Jailbreak quickly embraced him. \"I love you ... I love you with all my heart ... and I do not want you to ever leave me ...\" whispered the princess as she stroked her blond hair. \"Princess Jailbreak ...\" Gene took her by the shoulders and stared at her. \"I will never leave you, and less for this that you told me, I love you and I will always be faithful to you. I will never stop loving you, you must not drown in doubts or fears, this creatire you have inside is not a simple creature ... is the best gift you could have given me in my life and believe me that I will give all I can to be the best Father possible, for our little one and for you...the girl of my eyes...\" \"Oh, Gene.\" She began to cry of happiness with a faint smile. \"Forgive me ... forgive me for not trusting you ...\" \"Calm down ... I just want you to make it clear that I will never leave you ... because I love you,\" he replied sweetly. \"Well ... I hope you dont mind,telling you that I already gave her a name.\" She laughed softly. \"Jakelyn Meh...nice name?\" \"Its beautiful...\" he whispered, taking her cheeks. And with that said, Both grabbed each other and give a beautiful and passionate Kiss. A long \"Aaaw\" was heard all over the place, followed by loud applause. Both were lost in space, it was just the universe between them, that feeling they had gone to heaven, that feeling they felt a year ago in Spotify. That beautiful feeling in theyre hearts... but on a new level. \"Wait a second!\" Shouted Steven, who was holding hands with Angel. \"If you two will be parents ... I want a special condition ...\" \"what,Steven?\" Jailbreak asked with a look of sarcasm. \"...can my son be friends whit yours?\" Angel asked curiously. \"Possibly ... if Stevie does not hit him with his trident.\" Gene made himself laugh. \"Hey, hey, this is not supposed to be a party?\" Asked the cool guy with glasses. * Music in the multimedia * Gene smiled with hearts in his eyes, it was his favorite song. \"Come Princess,\" said Gene grabbing his girlfriend from the waist. \"To dance!\" And with that the lights and the music started the most anticipated party. They were both focused on each other, enjoying that song and putting the faces of \"Emoji Pop\", Jailbreak was watching Gene's movements, as he made her turn and move her hip. \"good morning and Good nigth\" She sang the choir. \"i wake at the Twiligth\" Gene sing making her turn. \"its gonna be all rigth!\" they sang both \"we dont even have yo try\" \"its always a Good time!\" everyone sang. Its was heard the jumps and the \"Oh oh oh oh\" to the beat of the music. The party was getting hot, they were having fun big time, as if they were in the Justdancenow. Laughter, kisses, love, hugs and dancing was what was in that Ball. \"This is for you, my love!\" said Gene leaving his girlfriend to see the act that he had prepared. Gene did Emoji Pop with those eyes that represent love. ? ﾟﾘﾶ? ﾟﾘﾜ? ﾟﾘﾗ?. \"That's my Gene,wow!\" Said Hi-5, waving his bandana in the air. Jailbreak simply returned those kisses that her boyfriend had sent her. Mary was sitting on a couch watching as the party got bigger and bigger, but someone touched her shoulder and turned to see who it was. \"Mary Meh...\" Mel said with a rose in hand and a strong blush on his cheeks \"what our son said made me realize that you are one of the reasons why I am also layers of feeling Love ... you are responsible for my happiness and that is why I am eternally grateful to you ...\" He knelt down and took her hand to give her a tender kiss. \"I love you Mary Meh ...\" whispered Mel. \"Oh Mel Meh ...\" she threw herself on him and attacked him with kisses \"I love you my beautiful baby...\" Mel just smiled and cuddled his wife who was still kissing him. Gene continued to enjoy the dance floor until he felt like a hand grabbed him by the arm and took him, he noticed that the person who took him was his girlfriend Jailbreak, who was also Lauthing. They went quickly to the roof of the place, where they sat on the top of the ceiling and looked at the stars. \"I told you I'd never abandon you ... and believe me I'll never think of abandoning you or this little one,\" Gene said as he stroked his girlfriend's belly. \"And now what will become of us and our future baby?\" She asked, looking at the blue sky. \"I do not know ... but as long as I say feeling all this, I will always be by your side and when our son or Daugther is born...ill be the best of father...\" he replied taking his hand \"because what you did in me ...

Where they both saw the beautiful night full of constellation kites that formed a word... \"Genbreak\". THE END well,thats it,i hope you guys liked this fanfic,thanks for favoriting,and reading,i love you All ","Summary":" HUMANIZED CHARACTHERS!. The party was over. Alex was late for home. He did not feel like talking to"},{"Movie":"Matilda","Title":"A New Beginning","Author":"christinesdaae","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11139423","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It had been approximately one year since that day; since that ever so wonderful day; since that day a little girl by the name of Matilda Wormwood had leapt into the thin, frail arms of a lady by the name of Jenny Honey. Oh how wonderful that day was! It seemed that there was not a day ever to be better than this one. A young girl and her school teacher finally receiving what they had longed for and deserved throughout their entire lives before this day: a loving family. Though yes; the family was small, and yes, they did not have the happiest of backstories, they did have each other, and that was all that mattered. But as it has once been said, even the happiest of endings have their flaws. In every story ever told in this world, there has always been at least one person unsatisfied with its outcome. Whether this person is in or out of this story, whether this person is a protagonist or an antagonist, whether the story is a fantasy or a reality, this one person always will exist. One person not willing to accept what has already happened and only wishes to live in the past, to dedicate their lives to attempt to change that past and will not quit until they have reached satisfaction. And as much as I wish to say that this person was not a part of this story, unfortunately, like all other stories, this person is very much a part of it and is even more stubborn than most. This person was an overall nasty person to be around, the kind of person one would hope to never meet, though throughout a lifetime, it is most common to meet a person like this at least once and it is impossible to avoid it from happening. Despite the hope of this person changing, this person fails to be guided into the right direction and continues to make countless errors and poor decisions that only affect others negatively. This person was Agatha Trunchbull. Now many people believe that everyone has a speck of goodness in them, whether it is a large speck or a small speck, including myself. Though Agatha Trunchbull had a speck so small, even a microscope could barely see it. Any heart this lady had once had was now guarded by a thick wall of steel; so thick that it was nearly impossible to be broken. This lady had done a countless amount of horrible things in her lifetime, ranging from blaming children for things they had never done to forcing a child to practically be her slave, and to treat her very badly throughout her life too. It seemed that it was not right that she always found a way out of a bad situation and it seemed that she was nearly unstoppable, that was until the day that she was fooled by a bunch of schoolchildren into believing that she was receiving the punishment for all of her bad deeds that she had performed and would not be able to do anything about it. But like every other situation that Agatha Trunchbull had gotten into, she had found a way out. \"That nasty, slimy, revolting little, maggot! Thinking that she can, that she can just trick me like that, oh that gruesome creature will pay for this!\" The Trunchbull roared, kicking a small coffee table across the small, bare room. Unknowing of her poor reputation and identity, the man who had once rented this small cottage to Jenny Honey had now rented it to the woman's aunt, as he figured that he could use a little bit of extra pocket money. As long as she could pay him ten pence a month, he was fine with her living in the small little cottage and did not question her reasons for her want to live in this very place in this very location. If he had known the reasons why, he would never had agreed to allow her to live in the cottage, for she hadn't wanted to live there just for shelter: it was for something much more than that; it was to ruin the lives of those who she believed had ruined her life. Although many had taken apart in the action of doing so, she narrowed her watch down to the two people who she disliked most: the young girl and her schoolteacher. It certainly was not right for the Trunchbull to seek revenge on the two of them, as they had been fighting for what was right for all and were as kind and innocent as can be, though it seemed that their goodness and want to help others was what sickened her the most. Her envious self hated them for that, perhaps, it could be thought, for the fact that they were happy while she was not. She believed that she herself was to have that happiness, not them, and believed that her thoughts, ideas, and actions were right while theirs were not. The Trunchbull would never change her hazy perspective of what she believed was right and continued on with her everlasting path of poor decisions. So, as expected, she continued to formulate a plan that was so delicate that if one thing went wrong, all would fail and would drive her to a lower state than she began with. But the Trunchbull was willing to take that risk, for she thought herself a coward if she did not go for it. If the plan failed, she would only try again, no matter what it would take, for her stubborn mind would not let go of their victory and her loss. Yes; they would pay for their actions no matter what, whether they try to avoid her wrath or not. The Trunchbull would always tell herself this every night as she needed something to keep her going, for what else did she have left if she gave up this plan? She knew that she had nothing to lose and was willing to perform the craziest and most difficult of plans to get what she thought she deserved. The Trunchbull blew out the small yet steady flame from the candle once again, dreaming of better days than this one that she had lived through today and of revenge on those who had ruined her life. I honestly don't know where I am going with this story; I just really love Matilda, (book, movie, and musical) and am really disappointed to see the lack of fanfics in the fandom. So I'm going to kind of come up with the plot as I go along and hopefully it will turn out better than my other attempts at writing Matilda fanfics. So if you have time, please R&R; as I would love to hear feedback and make this story the best that I can, thank you![Chapter 2] \"Matilda, Matilda sweetie; would you care to fetch me some teabags? It would be much appreciated.\" Miss Honey smiled as she heated up the pot of water over the old stove, preparing to make the two tea. It had become a tradition over time: that they would both have tea together and chat for what seemed like hours at least once a week. It was absolutely perfect to sit outside for a little tea, as it was both perfectly shady and peaceful in this spot around this very time of the day. The little, old table sat on the porch, keeping it sheltered from receiving any weathering during the cold winter storms yet visible enough that you could see it from a distance. \"Of course Miss Honey,\" Matilda replied cheerfully, always willing to help out. There were never any arguments between the two for they were so happy to have each other that there wasn't any real reason to argue over small, silly things. They were both very kind and peaceful people who needn't worry about anything getting between them. The two of them would speak of any troubles they had over tea and possible ways to resolve them; it had basically become a tradition. The young girl fetched the teabags for the two of them as Miss Honey poured the boiling hot water into two mugs decorated with a lovely pattern of flowers. Out of habit, Matilda put each teabag into their mugs and sat down across from her old schoolteacher. \"Alright then, so Matilda, has there been anything that has interested you lately? You're studying physics at the moment, unless I'm mistaken?\" \"Yes Miss Honey, there has been. Have you heard of a particle accelerator? It separates one particle from another. I'm currently putting together a research project about them, they're very fascinating.\" Matilda smiled and Miss Honey smiled back, for she was so happy to see how far Matilda had already come in school. She was only six yet she was studying content for those in high school already, maybe even college! Sure, there were some things- many things that challenged her mind, though that was what made school interesting for the little girl. \"I haven't heard of one, could you tell me more about them?\" Miss Honey replied, always interested in what interesting facts Matilda came upon both in and out of school. She concluded that it was impossible to ever be bored once in a conversation with Matilda, for she was so bright and intelligent that one could never be bored with her. So the two spoke not only about particle accelerators, but of many other topics too. Though Matilda never dared bring up the Trunchbull. Although there were many mysteries left undiscovered by her, she had no intentions of making Miss Honey uncomfortable just for her own benefit. She could only imagine the holy terrors that occurred throughout Miss Honey's childhood, but never mentioned her thoughts to anyone. Miss Honey couldn't help but smile, watching the little girl speak passionately about various topics. It brought her so much joy to see Matilda full of passion, of bliss. Only a year ago, she had been forced to limit her passions and turn them into small stories she could only share with Mrs. Phelps. But now, now she had moved so far ahead from those days, without being limited. And that was what made her happiest of all. But soon enough, nighttime fell and the two were forced to end their wonderful conversation and get ready for bed. Neither wanted to be exhausted in the morning. So with heavy sighs, the two of them brought their dishes to the sink, Miss Honey dismissing Matilda to prepare for bed, promising to give her a goodnight kiss before heading off to bed herself. So she picked up one of the teacups and delicately washed it with a small sponge, being sure to make it so clean that it would shine. But she felt a presence in the room and suddenly knew that Matilda hadn't left yet. \"Miss Honey, do you ever wonder if Miss Trunchbull is still out there?\" Matilda asked this quietly, not wanting to appear to know any more about this topic than she did. Gently, Miss Honey put down the teacup in the sink and stared out the window, trying to come up with a satisfying answer. \"Well, I… I, I shouldn't think so. She did seem to be deathly frightened of Magnus and what he could do. I'd say that she is probably long gone and won't ever think of returning,\" she said in a hushed voice, as if her cruel aunt could hear what she was saying this very moment. The truth was that she feared the day that Matilda asked this question, for she really didn't know where she was or if she had moved on or not. But she desperately hoped that her answer was right, for imagining the horrors of her return was far too much for her to take. Hearing the awkward silence that Miss Honey's answer left behind, Matilda decided both not to respond, and to not ask any further questions. So the girl quickly headed up the stairs to her room, preparing for bed quickly and then picking up one of her newest favourite books: The Phantom of the Opera. She read page after page, almost dreading the time that Miss Honey would enter her room and tell her that it was best to go to sleep. But of course, that time came rather quickly and soon enough Miss Honey knocked on her door gently before slipping through a small sliver of its opening. \"Matilda, I should think that it's best that you turn the lights out. I'm assuming that you don't want to be tired for school tomorrow.\" She smiled at the girl and walked up to the side of her bed, Matilda handing her the book after dog-earing the page. Matilda saw that Miss Honey was now wearing her pajamas too, unknowing though if she actually was going to go straight to bed after this; but that wasn't important. Walking up to her large bookshelf slowly, Miss Honey placed the book in its correct position, then returned to the side of her bed, tucking Matilda in under the covers. Once she knew that Matilda was comfortable, Miss Honey bent down and planted a soft kiss on her forehead. \"Good night Matilda. Sweet dreams, I love you,\" she said with a warm smile, then turned off the lights as she exited the room. But as she gently closed the door, she began to feel a strange anxiety inside of her, one which followed her all the way to her room, even after she turned the lights out and tucked herself under the covers: 'What if Matilda's question had a different answer than the one she had given her? What if her Aunt really was going to come back eventually?' These anxieties began to pile up on top of her, until she came to the conclusion that she was just being ridiculous. Miss Trunchbull wouldn't return, would she? But despite the growing anxiety inside, she managed to dismiss them for now in order to fall asleep, for if she didn't, she wouldn't sleep a wink. As she began to fall into her dreams, she realized how silly it sounded, that Miss Trunchbull would ever return. She had yet to realize how correct her anxieties were.[Chapter 3] By the time that Matilda awoke in the morning, she had entirely forgotten about the conversation she had with Miss Honey the night before; all that was in her head was the excitement about the weekend. Despite how much the girl enjoyed and thrived in school, she still did enjoy a little time off to curl up in a corner and read a good book. Once she finished dressing herself for school, she found Miss Honey downstairs preparing breakfast. \"Good morning,\" she said as the girl walked in. She also had nearly forgotten about last night, though if she were to be reminded of the conversation, her anxieties would return. \"Did you have a good night of sleep? I hope so, for I sure did not.\" She softly laughed, though at this point, she could hardly recall what kept her up throughout many times of the night. She assumed that it was for the better, as she did have a class of students to teach today and no time to fuss over silly ideas. \"Yes, I did.\" Matilda replied, deciding that it would not be a smart idea to question why Miss Honey had not slept well, for she'd rather start the day off bright and blissful. \"That's wonderful, I'm grateful that at least one of us did.\" She responded, flipping a pancake one last time before serving the others onto two plates. After pouring some maple syrup on the two, she brought the plates to the kitchen table, Matilda responding with a cheerful ' Thank you ' as she was handed her plate. Soon enough, Miss Honey and Matilda arrived at Crunchem Hall Primary and Secondary school; many students had loved the school and learned so much once Miss Honey became the headmistress that they had practically begged her to start up a secondary school; and that was exactly what she had done. Matilda waved goodbye to her former schoolteacher as she headed off to the secondary school's campus which was not located too far away. \"Have a wonderful day Matilda!\" she responded back as she began to head in the opposite direction. \"You too!\" the girl called back. Miss Honey smiled, knowing that today was a new day and that it could be better than the last. As she signed in and dropped off her things in her office, she paused and spent a moment staring at the closet door where the \"Chokey\" had once been. It brought back many horrid memories, but also reminded her of how grateful she was to have those days of predicament only be thoughts of the past. Once she got ahold of herself, she realized that it was nearly 07:45 in the morning, meaning that class would start soon. Quickly stashing her things under her desk, she quickly fixed up her appearance one last time before entering the classroom in a calm demeanor. \"Good morning everyone,\" she said with a warm smile, slowly strolling to the front of the classroom. \"This morning, we will first be starting with some math problems. If you all would take out your notebooks…\" After what felt like a short period of time, it was lunchtime already. Matilda headed toward the primary campus, where she would go and eat lunch with her friends; Miss Honey believed that despite her high academic ability, it was better for her to hang out with those of her own age rather than those ten years older. As usual, once she entered the cafeteria, she sat at a table with Lavender, Bruce, Alice, Amanda, and a few others. \"I'm so nervous for the English quiz later! I know that I know everything, but what if I forget it all?\" Amanda exclaimed, receiving a few giggles from the others. \"You'll do fine, trust me. I'm sure that it won't be half as hard as you think that it will be.\" Matilda responded with a soft smile as she took a bite into her sandwich. \"It's easy for you to say! You're super smart!\" They all laughed again before Lavender began to change the topic. \"Speaking of school, what have you been learning about Matilda?\" She asked with wonder, always interested to hear about everything , despite the fact that she had no idea what more than half of the things were. \"I'm currently learning trigonometry, physics, and a few other subjects. Some of them are rather difficult though.\" Matilda continued on, all of her friends listening to her in awe, despite the fact that they had no idea about most of the things she was talking about. After what only felt like minutes, lunchtime ended and Matilda quickly said goodbye to her friends before rushing off to class, everything that she had asked about the previous day completely out of her mind. And as for Miss Honey, everything seemed to have cleared out of her mind until the very end of the day as she wrapped up class, cleaning up the classroom as all of her students spoke amongst each other. \"M-Miss Honey?\" A little girl asked as she approached her schoolteacher. Even though the school year had hardly began, Miss Honey had done her best to remember all of her new students' names and successfully recognized the little girl, despite the fact that she hardly spoke in class. \"Yes Patricia, is there something that you need? Feel free to ask me anything.\" She responded with a smile, setting down the rag she had been using to dust off one of the bookshelves to turn to her. \"The older kids have been talking about someone known as… as the Trunchbull? I think that's her name. D-do you know her? They said that she's horrible…\" She asked quietly, playing with her hands as she looked down at the ground. After a moment of silence and pondering over memories of her horrid aunt, the schoolteacher finally answered. \"I-I… Yes, yes I do. I should think that it's best that she's forgotten though. I'm sorry, I think it best if I don't tell you anymore.\" The little girl seemed almost disappointed with her answer, though chose not to ask about her again and sorrowfully walked away instead. As much as Miss Honey wanted to make the girl happy, telling her about Miss Trunchbull would surely spread her name around the campus and horror stories of the previous years would show up again; that was the last thing that she wanted for all of the students, for them to all be reminded of all of the predicament that was forced upon them. She managed to plaster on a warm smile for the rest of class, not wanting to show any signs of being even the slightest bit unhappy. Though being reminded of the horrid woman had piled all of those anxieties back onto her as she was all that was on her mind. This was the very classroom in which the Trunchbull had run away from as she believed that the ghost of Magnus was haunting her. It really was clever of Matilda to think of such a scheme, as most five-year-olds could not even think of a plan even half as clever. The fact that her aunt was incredibly superstitious contributed to the plan positively, but what if she wasn't entirely convinced that the writing on the chalkboard was from him? ' What if she realized that the only student who wasn't gasping in awe was Matilda? And if she figured that it was only a magic trick of some sort? Get a hold of yourself, Jenny! You're being ridiculous!' she thought to herself as she dismissed the students for the day. As she headed to her office, she could hear giggles of excitement coming from many of the students as they ran off to their parents, probably excited to head home and watch all of their favourite television shows over the weekend. Matilda, on the other hand, despised the T.V. and preferred to head to the library from when it opened early in the morning to the minute that it would close around 17:00 in the evening. She smiled, happy to know that at least some students still appreciated literature. After she slipped on her soft pink cardigan, she picked up the rest of her things and slipped out of her office, locking the door behind her. Once she made sure that there were no students still in the school, she headed out of the building and locked the doors behind her, meeting up with Matilda at the gate. Rather than driving to and from school as most would, Miss Honey preferred to walk home as she enjoyed the short walk with Matilda. \"How was school?\" She asked the little girl as she took her hand and began heading onto the path that would lead to their home. \"It was wonderful. I think that I did well on both of my exams today!\" She responded back with a smile, lightly shivering as a harsh breeze blew past her cheeks. \"That is wonderful! I'm sure you've done very well on both of them, you're the brightest girl that I know.\" Miss Honey responded back, lightly pulling the girl closer to her as another breeze brushed passed them. Matilda blushed as she huddled closer to her. \"T-Thank you.\" She shivered, and once again, Miss Honey noticed, deciding to do something more about it. Despite how sharp and cold the breezes were, she stopped for a moment and pulled off her soft cardigan, wrapping it around the small girl. \"Here, you need it much more than I do.\" She smiled as they began to continue on. \"B-But you'll be cold an-\" \"I'm alright, you needn't worry.\" Miss Honey reassured her, keeping the girl close to her as she still was cold, though she certainly felt better knowing that Matilda was warm at least. Throughout their calming walk, Matilda spoke of her day: things that her friends had told her about, a new novel that she was reading, and what she was learning in school; some of which, she didn't know herself. Miss Honey also spoke of her day: different students that had captured her attention, what she was teaching at the moment, and other small things, though she did not mention the conversation that she had with the young girl as she didn't want Matilda to suffer from the same anxieties as she herself was suffering from. Once the two arrived at their home, they both smiled in relief as if was beginning to grow quite chilly outside, despite the fact that it was only the beginning of autumn. Miss Honey quickly fetched the keys out of her purse and thrust the door open quickly, scrambling in after Matilda so as to keep the cold breezes outside rather than inside. \"Well, I think that we both can agree that despite how lovely it is to catch up with each other on the way home, it certainly isn't as fun when it's so chilly.\" The two softly laughed, slowly warming up in the heated home. Miss Honey prepared some tea for the two as Matilda worked on her homework, smiling as she took a chocolate from her father's old jar for both herself and Matilda. What they did not know was that they were both being watched at that very moment, the one watching them filled with both anger and envy of their happiness and their content feeling about their lives. Agatha Trunchbull peered in through a small window in the kitchen, ducking down whenever one of them would look in her direction. \"Those two nasty maggots, believing that they can take my happiness away from me and keep it all to themselves!\" She whispered angrily to herself as she walked away, realizing that it probably was not the smartest idea to peer in on them for if they were observant enough, she could be spotted and the entire plan that she cooked up could be ruined. Sighing in exasperation, she headed off back to the small cottage, kicking open the gate and slamming it closed behind her. \"How could they ever believe that I am gullible enough to fall for that scheme?\" She asked, throwing a box across the room. She had never learned how to cope with her anger, so she took out her frustration on objects around her, though it didn't benefit her in any way as it only left her with broken furniture. \"I will make them pay for what they have done one day…\" Miss Honey kissed Matilda goodnight once more as it was already quite late at night. As she headed off to bed, her anxieties followed her, though she somehow managed to push them aside once more as her exhaustion took over. She fell asleep feeling silly for trusting in these anxieties. After all, she believed that they were only in her head and that Miss Trunchbull was far away from London… I apologize for taking so long to update! I volunteered this summer at a children's art camp and then recently started school, though I will try my hardest to update much faster![Chapter 4] I'm so sorry for taking so long to update! I've been in writer's block for a while, but I've finally managed to write two more chapters, so I hope you enjoy! She had no idea of what to do. What was the best thing to do; what would cause more suffering than the other. Agatha Trunchbull paced through her narrow \"cottage\", or shack as she preferred to refer to it as. The woman had spent a countless amount of days watching over her enemies, learning each and every detail about them and being sure to take note of everything . Every routine, every friend of theirs; of course, only the ones that came over to their home. No, not their home: her home that she so rightfully deserved. If only she had retained her usual persona that day, rather than cowering down like a puppy. No one ever made the Trunchbull cower, appear pathetic. Just the word itself tasted foul to her. And to think that the pathetic schoolteacher and a child outsmarted her and ruined her reputation! The two of them would obviously have to pay, but in what way? Jenny was easy to deal with; just taking control of the meek woman's life would break her all over again. But the little maggot… well, she deserved a special treatment. It was her who had stolen her dignity at every given opportunity, her who had taken Jenny out of her grasp. The girl needed to suffer more than anyone else, but what would break her ? She was so strong-willed, so spirited from those silly books of hers that she would most certainly be the more difficult one of the two. With a sigh, Agatha sprawled out all of her research that she had obtained from the library. She hated the library, though she did have to admit that it was a valuable source of information, revenge included. The woman flipped through the pages, casting ideas out of the question aside. Physical pain ? No, it wouldn't bother a child as stubborn as her. It would hurt her, but not cause enough suffering to destroy her. Control? No, only a woman as timid as Jenny would be deeply affected by it. Emotional pain? Perhaps, though she would have to play with a certain area of the girl's heart. \"How could I not think of that before?\" The woman's expression brightened significantly, with a grimace morphed into a smirk as a substantial idea emerged in her thoughts: Jenny. Months flew by in a flash with Matilda and Miss Honey failing to experience anything out of the ordinary. School went by with only the slightest of difficulty for Matilda, and no further questions regarding the Trunchbull were asked to Miss Honey. They had finally received the privilege of escaping from the past, as even the teacher's nightmares had seized to occur. \"Good morning class. I hope that you've all had a lovely weekend, and that you'll have just as lovely of a week. Firstly, we'll begin with some handwriting.\" Monday morning groans came from the class, though the shuffling of notebooks and pencils followed soon after. Miss Honey smiled, and then proceeded to neatly print a few words on the board for her students to copy down: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog . It was great practice for learning how to print the alphabet, and would also at the same time reveal which children did not practice over the weekend. Most students seemed to be doing fine, though others struggled with copying the more difficult of the letters down. Without a word, Miss Honey went over to assist those who needed assistance and to thank others for practicing. Smiles began to fill the room as the students each received compliments on their particular handwriting. Positivity enveloped each and every person, and soon the classroom began to become the home of another thriving day. \"I still don't know what to do for Miss Honey's birthday tomorrow. I'll definitely make breakfast for her, but what else can I do without her finding out ahead of time?\" Matilda asked Lavender before taking a bite of her turkey and cheese sandwich. It would be Miss Honey's first properly celebrated birthday since she was a little girl, so it had to be special. \"You should buy her lots and lots of lollies! And then share some with me too.\" Lavender grinned as she grimaced at the small salad she had been given for lunch, then tried her hardest to force it down her throat by pretending it was cake. Matilda laughed as she tossed away her trash. Maybe she would just make her a card. She could pour her heart out into it, and then have some tea and cookies with her. No, that's too simple. I need something more extravagant. \"Oh, I have an idea! Maybe you, Bruce, Alice, and I could all surprise her, and then we can all have tea and cookies, and of course, lollies.\" Lavender's eyes brightened up as she heard the idea, and she abruptly nodded. \"Yes, yes, yes! That's perfect! My mom will probably be fine with it, and she doesn't need to know about the sweets. I'll go tell everyone about it!\" And with that, she went running off, calling out to all of them. Matilda only laughed, and then headed off to class while picturing Miss Honey's expression once she glanced upon her surprise. The rest of the day flew by in a flash, and soon enough, it was the morning of Miss Honey's birthday. Matilda had rehearsed the first few words she would say to her at least one hundred times, though she knew that she would most likely go off-script at one point or another. A steamy warm breakfast sat on the table, along with two cups of breakfast tea. Matilda listened with excitement as she heard footsteps heading down the stairs, and then saw Miss Honey's head stick out from the other room with an amazed expression. \"M-Matilda? You've done all of this for me ?\" Miss Honey blinked back tears as she walked into the kitchen with awe clearly displayed in her expression. \"Happy birthday!\" Matilda rushed over to her quickly, and then enveloped her in a huge hug. Miss Honey hugged her back tightly, unable to believe the sight before her eyes. \"So first we'll have tea and breakfast, and then I have a big surprise for you after school. You'll have to take your time though, because I'll need at least half an hour to set up.\" Matilda grinned and received a small giggle from Miss Honey, who was giddy with joy. The two of them sat down at the table, though only of course after Matilda had served Miss Honey first. They then took their time while eating and spoke in between sips of tea and bites of cinnamon toast. As expected, the morning went by rather quickly and soon enough, they found themselves parting ways as they headed to school and work. \"So we're going to surprise her when she gets home?\" Alice asked Matilda, confirming their schedule. \"Yup. She's going to take her time after work, and then she'll come home and find a surprise party awaiting her. It's going to be the best birthday ever.\" \"Definitely,\" Lavender said, picturing the delicious sweets that were to come, and of course, her old teacher's reaction to her wonderful treat. \"Thank you Miss Honey,\" the last child in the classroom said as he hoisted her tin lunchbox into her backpack, then followed her friends out into the halls. Someone had found out that it was her birthday, and her students had chosen to give her a complimentary \"happy birthday\" song, which completely warmed her heart. No one had even acknowledged her birthday in years, and to have so many people wish her a wonderful day was astounding. She looked back upon her day so far with a cheerful smile. And to think that she still had another surprise in store! The blissfulness was almost overwhelming! With delicate fingers, the teacher took her time organizing her desk and the entire classroom. It was nearly spotless, though she wanted to be sure to give Matilda all the time that she needed. When at last there was nothing to do to improve her office or classroom, Miss Honey locked up the school and headed out. She was already happy enough, though she still couldn't hide the excitement she had for Matilda's \"big surprise\". As she briskly walked home along the pavement, she noticed a small note taped to a tree. With a slightly perplexed expression, she approached it to find that it was from Matilda. Miss Honey, meet me at your old cottage. A lovely tea and sweets party awaits you. Sincerely, Matilda At her old cottage? That was certainly an odd place to choose for a party. But nevertheless, Miss Honey slightly altered her route to make her way back to what she once called her home. Throughout the walk, she found herself imagining the party, a real party for her ! It almost seemed too good to be true! Happy thoughts continued to swirl around her mind, making her more excited than ever. She soon approached the cottage, finding the gate leading inside tangled with more weeds than before, and the flowers surrounding it almost all dead. It made for a sad sight, as it had looked so much nicer before, but she supposed that she should've expected to find it in that condition. After all, the farmer didn't seem to care much about the little home. \"Matilda?... Matilda?\" Miss Honey asked as she headed through the gate, wondering where the girl could be. The place was nearly dead silent, except for the quiet tapping of a foot and the slight creaking of the floorboards inside. She couldn't help but feel a little apprehensive, though still made her way in anyway. No cheers or \"surprise's!\" came; instead the teacher's first sight inside was of a crate with two hot tea cups on it, as she expected, but Matilda certainly wasn't there. Instead, her worst nightmare sat right at the makeshift table, dabbing her mouth with a handkerchief. \"Hello Jenny. It's been a while, hasn't it?\" \"Where is she? School ended almost an hour and a half ago and I really want the lollies,\" Lavender whined from her hiding place behind a chair. \"And I really want the cake,\" Bruce said, feeling his stomach grumble. \"Yeah, Matilda, where is she?\" Alice asked with a yawn as she leaned back against the wall. \"She'll be here any minute now, I guarantee you. Just hang in there,\" Matilda whispered to everyone, though still stole a glance at her watch. It read, 4:30 . Why wasn't she back yet? Surely the walk home from school wasn't that long. With a deep breath, Matilda decided to be patient. \"I-I…I have to go,\" Miss Honey stuttered with widened eyes, not taking her eyes off of the large woman. \"Sit. Jenny, I insist .\" Agatha's tone told her that it wasn't a choice. She hesitated and placed a hand on the door, but once she saw her aunt begin to stand up, she rushed over to the \"table\" and sat down, too afraid to risk facing her wrath. \"Good girl. Now, have some tea and we'll talk about a particular event that occurred in your classroom last year.\" Agatha's wicked smile faded into a grimace as Miss Honey stared down at her trembling hands without even taking a glance at the cup before her. \"Have some tea,\" Agatha repeated, lifting her niece's chin up to adjust her gaze. Miss Honey didn't say anything in response, though she still did lift the tea cup up to her mouth and took a sip, barely managing to keep herself from spilling all over herself. Her fingers shook so terribly that it was an extreme difficulty to even pick up the cup, though she still continued to take small sips in order to please Agatha. She could only wonder what the evil woman wanted with her. \"Now that you're all situated, why don't you tell me how exactly that little maggot was able to write on the chalkboard without touching the chalk? I know it wasn't Magnus that wrote that, I'm not that stupid to fall for your little lies.\" Miss Honey's eyes widened as she heard Agatha's words and she nearly dropped her tea. \"I-I don't know what you're talking about. She did no such thing. It's impossible to lift up a piece of chalk with your min-\" \"Don't you dare lie to me, Jenny. I know that you and that disgusting maggot were behind it all, and I need you to admit to me that she did indeed do that, and I need you to tell me how she did that.\" She looked at Miss Honey with a glare, and then continued on. \"Then you can go off and enjoy your little birthday,\" she said in a singsong voice, watching her niece with a stern expression as the woman finished her tea and placed the cup back onto the crate. \"I-I'm not going to put up with this any longer. I…I'm leaving,\" Miss Honey stated in a firm tone, standing up and turning away from her aunt. She wouldn't… couldn't be pathetic any longer. She didn't have to listen to Agatha any longer, so she would not tolerate being treated awfully ever again. \"I wouldn't say so. Did you, perhaps, notice a little bit of an odd taste in the tea?\" Agatha asked with a smirk, watching as Miss Honey came to the realization of what was happening. The teacher's eyes widened again, and she went running out the door, though already felt too weak to scream or shout. She couldn't leave Matilda behind all alone, so she had to make it back home. A drowsiness came upon her as she pushed the gate, the oh-so heavy gate, open, and soon enough, blackness cloaked over her. She collapsed onto the dirt ground, not making it more than six feet out of the cottage. With a calm expression, the Trunchbull stood up and headed outside to her niece, satisfied that her plan was going just as she had anticipated. Jenny was now with her, and she could finally begin her revenge on the little maggot that had ruined her life. Agatha kneeled down beside Miss Honey for a moment, muttering a few angry words to her, and then lifted her thin body up and brought her inside. Yes, everything was going just as planned.[Chapter 5] So sorry for my absence! Thank you for the reviews, and I hope you enjoy! \"Matilda, it's getting late. Is she really coming? My mum is going to come pick me up soon,\" Lavender whined, fumbling around with her fingers while Matilda paced around the room. She paused at her friend's question, trying to think of an answer herself. Matilda truly had no idea of where Miss Honey had run off to in order to kill only thirty minutes, and her lack of an answer only led to self-doubt? \"Oh my gosh, maybe I gave her the wrong information!\" Matilda exclaimed, causing all of the children to look at each other with horror. \"But I couldn't have, I distinctly remember telling her that she could come home after thirty minutes,\" she continued, ponding over all of the possibilities of possible miscommunications. \"Uh, Matilda, I've already eaten the cake. I'm sorry, but I couldn't resist,\" Bruce apologized over his full belly, cake smeared all over his face, hands, and shirt. Matilda wanted to be angry at him, but she was too angry with herself to care. She felt that whole situation was probably her fault anyway, as Miss Honey would have probably already had her share of the cake if there hadn't been a miscommunication. \"It's okay Bruce, don't worry about it.\" Matilda returned to her pacing, though picked up her speed as well. Her friends glanced at each other with concern, and then headed for the door. \"I think that I'd better go home and do my homework. Wouldn't want to upset my mum! See you tomorrow Matilda!\" Lavender excused herself while stuffing a handful of candies into her pockets. \"I-I, uh, have to go home now. Bye Matilda,\" Bruce said while picking up one last plate of cake on his way out. \"And I think that I should go too. I have to do my chores. See you tomorrow Matilda,\" Alice quietly said, watching her friend with concern as she exited and gently closed the door behind her. Matilda stared at the door for a moment, filled with utter shock and an underwhelming feeling. This was not how Miss Honey's special day was supposed to go. She was supposed to come home and be surprised, and have a wonderful birthday celebration. Where was she? She paced around the empty room a few more times, and then the girl decided to call the school. Perhaps she truly had told Miss Honey the wrong information, and perhaps she hadn't even left in the first place. She picked up the phone, typed in the correct phone number with absolute precision, and then listened for someone to answer. The phone rang, and rang, and rang. You are calling Crunchem Hall Primary and Secondary School. I'm sorry we cannot get to you at the moment, but if- Matilda ended the phone call and stared at the wall for a moment, attempting to process the situation. Miss Honey was not home. She was not at school. Where could she have gone off to for so long? \"That's it! The library!\" Determined that her estimate had to be correct, Matilda threw on her coat, fetched her keys to the house, and ran outside with a wide smile on her face. How silly! She must have given Miss Honey the wrong time, and instinctively, she would go to the library to read. Or maybe she had indeed given her the right time, but Miss Honey had gotten so lost in a book that she lost track of time. Both situations could have easily happened. Within fifteen minutes, Matilda made it to the library. She could practically smell the scent of books as she watched some employees carrying boxes inside, and knew that her teacher had to be there. \"Good evening Mrs. Phelps. How are you doing today?\" She asked, causing the librarian to jump in alarm. \"Oh hello Matilda. I didn't even see you there!\" Mrs. Phelps caught her breath, adjusted her glasses, and then stared at the child for a moment, and then glanced back at her watch. \"Matilda honey, it's seven thirty at night! The new series you requested won't be coming in until tomorrow… unless you're here with a story?\" She asked with hope gleaming in her eyes. Matilda hated to be the one to crush it, but she wasn't sure of what else to say. \"Um, no Mrs. Phelps, I'm sorry. I'm here to find Miss Honey.\" Matilda half-smiled at the librarian, waiting to find out where Miss Honey was. In the adult section? In the young adult section? She always seemed to want to read everything the same way that Matilda did. \"Well Matilda, I'm afraid that this isn't the right place to find her. I did happen to see her pass by earlier, even waved at her. Why isn't she at home?\" Mrs. Phelps asked, and then watched as the young girl's eyes began to water. \"Oh no, don't be upset, child, I'm sure Miss Honey's at home right now and is probably worrying about you like crazy. Go on then, you don't want to be out too late. Unless you have a stor-never mind. Have a nice evening Matilda.\" She gave the girl a pat on the back and then continued on with her book sorting. Without wasting any more time, Matilda ran off in the direction of her home, desperately hoping that Mrs. Phelps's words were true. Although she hadn't found Miss Honey at the library, she had certainly gained valuable information: Miss Honey did leave the school earlier. She did not know how much earlier, but she left nevertheless. Maybe she had gone shopping and was having difficulty choosing which laundry detergent to buy, or maybe she had taken herself out for tea; the possibilities were endless. After a very long stroll home, Matilda shakily pulled out her keys and unlocked the door, just to find silence awaiting her. A tear streamed down her cheek, and then many more followed. Where could Miss Honey be? It was eight thirty at night, far too late for her to ever stay out. No miscommunication could lead her to come home that late. Knowing that there was nothing else to do, Matilda picked up the telephone that she had tossed aside earlier and dialed a number that she had never imagined dialing again. \"Yes, I would like to speak to an officer. I want to file a missing person report.\" She cracked open her eyes, bit by bit, squinting at the bright light disorienting her vision. Tears formed as she continued the strenuous effort of forcing open her eyelids, and she tried to wipe them away, but her hands were stuck. She decided to move step by step, beginning with opening her eyes. 1…2…3! Her eyes opened wide, and a pain engulfed her immediately, resulting in more tears down her cheeks. She didn't care about that. What she cared about was her situation: where she was, what was happening, and why she couldn't seem to move her hands. She blinked over and over again, attempting to adjust her sore eyes to the bright surroundings. With much effort, she managed to get a brief glance of the entire room. It was painted white, though the surface had multiple dirt and grass stains smeared across it. She didn't know why, nor did she care at the moment. All she wanted was to see Matilda again. Where was she? She made note of the fact that she was on a rough surface, certainly not a bed like she had expected. She attempted to wiggle her wrists, only to find that she could not. With a tight glance down, she noticed coarse rope was wrapped around them. Her eyes widened, and she tried to wiggle her ankles. The same thing happened. She was immobilized. Her instinct now was to call for help, but similar to her previous two attempts to get up, she found that she could not speak. Another piece of that rope was in her mouth, serving as a makeshift gag. What had happened? Despite her failed efforts to move and speak, she continued trying to perform both of the actions, struggling against her restraints and crying out for help as loud as she could, though nothing but a few breathy noises could be heard. The light shone down on her for a few moments longer, and then it abruptly shut off. Despite this, she did not quit her attempts of escape, hardly even noticing the difference in lighting. Loud steps echoed suddenly echoed through an air vent, the sound of a whip touching bare skin following along. She paused her movement and began trying to shout, as if it would stop the person approaching the room she was in. The footsteps then paused, and she caught her breath, her chest moving up and down repeatedly. A tall, intimidatingly tall from her point of view, person then popped up in front of her, scaring her beyond belief. Her whole figure shook with fear, and she nearly passed out once she glimpsed upon the person's face. \"We have unfinished business. Let's have a chat, shall we?\" \"Yes, she's been gone for many hours. A description? Blonde hair, blue eyes, petite figure, I'm not sure what else to describe. What she was wearing last? A floral dress, maybe a pink cardigan. That's all? Thank you very much, I really hope that you can find her soon.\" Matilda ended the phone call and wiped a few more tears off of her cheeks with the sleeve of her shirt. It was official, now that she had filed a report. Miss Honey truly was missing. She pulled at her head of tangled hair, grunts of frustration escaping her lips. If only she had just stuck with a card! Then Miss Honey would be home, and they would both stomachs full of birthday cake, and they would be happy. But the reality was that Miss Honey was not at home, and Matilda's stomach was not full of cake, and she was alone, and she was not happy. \"Miss Honey, where could you be?\" She asked out loud, receiving no response but silence. Matilda would certainly be spending the night at home alone, for the first time ever. Without a smile, she headed upstairs and changed into her pajamas, and brushed her teeth, and pulled out her book, but she could not keep her mind on any of the words. Not when Miss Honey was missing and in possible danger. It was only eight forty-five at night, much earlier than she usually went to sleep, but she decided to do so earlier, for what else was there to do? She still did have school tomorrow, and she would most certainly go if only to spread the word of the missing Miss Honey. Matilda fluffed her pillow and tucked herself under her blankets, and she turned off the light, but she could not sleep. Not when the person most beloved to her was missing. She stared up at the dark ceiling, her eyes threatening to spill out more tears. But she did not allow them to, because she needed to be brave. For both herself and Miss Honey. She shook her head wildly, only for Agatha Trunchbull to grab her chin in a firm grip and force eye contact between them both. \"Jenny, you know how this works. You do as I say, and you do not get hurt. You don't do as I say, and you spend time in the Chokey; yes, I have made a new one, if you were wondering. It is no bigger than the others though, so you should do as I say.\" Miss Honey stared up at her in horror, her eyes watering with total fear. Her aunt stared back for a moment with a grimace and lifted up a hand. Miss Honey feared the worse and anticipated a blow. Instead, Agatha's hand reached over to her niece's gag and untied the knot, allowing the coarse rope to fall alongside the petite woman. \"It's time to go over what really happened that day.\" Once again, thank you so much for the kind reviews! I cannot guarantee when I'll update next, but I'll try to do so as soon as possible! Hope you enjoyed! ","Summary":" It had been approximately one year since that day; since that ever so wonderful day; since that day"},{"Movie":"Pretty in Pink","Title":"Every Duck Has His Day","Author":"My Reality is Fiction","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5258881","Passage":"[Chapter 1] DISCLAIMER: I don't own Pretty in Pink or its characters. Although I do own the idea of this plot. READ AND REVIEW PLEASE!! :) Author's Note Ok, this is my first PIP fanfic. I decided to write one because A) the movie is fantastic and B) there's only one other fic on this listing. Sad Day. Hope you enjoy!! ps. Andie goes slightly OOC at the end. Sorry, that's just how it ended up. I like it, you might not...I apologize :) He knew he loved her as far back as the fifth grade. She had given him part of her oatmeal-raisin cookie and half a juice box and that had been that. From that moment on, Philip \"Duckie\" Dale had committed himself mind, body, soul, and bicycle to ensuring Andie Walsh's complete happiness. She was his best friend. It could be argued that she was his only friend, but Duckie was sure that even if he had had more, Andie would still have been top of the list. She was everything a guy like Duckie could wish for in a girl; funny, pretty, she had a great butt, and he was crazy about her. Too bad she was completely clueless. \"Hey, doll face,\" Duckie smirked, sliding in front of Andie's locker and peering at her from above his sunglasses. \"Duckie, get out of the way, I'm gonna be late for class,\" Andie moaned, shoving him aside. Duckie rolled out of the way and ran into a couple of girls coming out of a classroom. \"Hey watch it, jerk!\" one of them snapped. \"Sorry, truly, honestly,\" Duckie apologized, bowing repeatedly. The girls started to back away; looking thoroughly convinced he was insane. Duckie called after them, \"I'll have my insurance company pay for any damages! That's a lovely sweater, by the way! They'll be fine,\" he added, turning back to Andie. She rolled her eyes and started taking books out of her locker. \"I been thinking,\" Duckie continued, now leaning against the wall, \"what if I just…dropped out?\" \"Are you nuts?\" Andie laughed, slamming her locker shut and turning to look at him. \"That's still being debated,\" Duckie smiled. Andie snorted and started down the hallway. Duckie followed her. \"I'm serious, Andie, I could drop out.\" \"Duckie,\" Andie said, stopping dead in the middle of the hallway and staring at him, \"we have four months left until we graduate.\" \"Sounds like the perfect time to me,\" Duckie shrugged, \"right in the homestretch, right when they think they've got you sucked into their little collegiate plan, WHAM! You quit. Am I a genius, do I know how to fight the power?\" Andie opened her mouth but Duckie held up his hand. \"Don't answer that, it'll ruin the magic.\" \"Go to class, Duckie,\" Andie laughed, turning her back on him and hoping she could still make it to Biology on time. \"All right then,\" Duckie yelled through the crowds of kids hurrying off to class, \"I'll save you a step at lunch! And don't bring Italian this time, it makes me gassy!\" He saw Andie try and make herself even smaller than she already was and smiled to himself. He was going to marry her. When the lunch bell rang, Duckie rushed outside to get a good spot on the steps. He spread himself out and then looked anxiously around for Andie, who showed up a few minutes later and plopped down next to him. \"Sooooo,\" Duckie started the minute she sat down, \"I was kinda thinking that you and I might work on those stupid History papers tonight. I have this nagging feeling that I have no idea what the Russian Revolution was really about.\" \"Why do you say that?\" Andie asked, pulling out her sandwich and ripping off the crusts. \"Because I've slept through every class since November\" Duckie said, stealing a crust and popping it into his mouth. \"Well, I wish I could help but I'm busy tonight,\" Andie said. She took a bite of her sandwich and didn't look at him. Duckie frowned, then laughed it off. \"What'dya mean? What are you doing? Does Iona need you to work for her or somethin'? Cause we can work at the record store, I don't mind.\" \"No, Duckie, I'm not working late,\" Andie said, still not looking at him. Her cheeks were pinker than normal. Despite the fact that his stomach was clenching unpleasantly, Duckie kept a smile firmly plastered on his face. \"Well, what then?\" He asked, shoving a couple of chips in his mouth. \"I…um…well, I have an engagement,\" she muttered. \"A date, you mean,\" he said bitterly through a mouthful of Ruffles. Andie looked up, jaw set in firm determination. \"Yes, a date. I have a date, Duckie. Is that a problem?\" Um, Yeah! He thought quickly. His face must have shown what he was thinking because Andie looked at him strange. Duckie squirmed and gave an uncomfortable little chuckle, shoving her playfully. \"Naw, you know, I just wanna know who the lucky guy is so I can give him the run down. You know, tell him all about the shotgun I like to polish while watching do-it-yourself taxidermy tapes, that kind of stuff.\" He flashed another winning smile but Andie didn't look completely convinced. Starting to feel himself sweat, Duckie gathered up his lunch and shoved it into the pockets of his blazer. He needed to get out of here. \"Yeah, um, I'll catch you later, honey. I got classes to skip, teachers to piss off,\" he slapped a quick kiss on her cheek, \"call you later.\" Then he ran off to hide behind the auto shop until school let out. So she had a date, so what? She'd had plenty of dates before now and they had never come of anything substantial, why should this loser be any different? Maybe she didn't even like him, maybe it was a dare or she felt sorry for the poor twerp, or maybe her dad had set it up and she couldn't back out of it. Yeah, that was it. Jack had set her up with one of the deadbeats he met down at the unemployment office. Andie was too nice, she'd never say no to something her dad wanted. Finally calming himself down, Duckie leaned against the brick wall of the auto shop and slid down to a sitting position. He'd call her later and everything would be alright. She wasn't walking out on him; it was all just one big misunderstanding. I mean, Andie wouldn't just dump him for some…some… guy. Would she? Duckie called Andie's house the first time around nine. Jack told him she still wasn't in yet, but he would be sure to give her the message. He tried again at nine-fifteen and nine-thirty, but still no luck. At nine forty-five he rode his bike passed her house, and then circled the block for an hour until Jack showed up on the front porch and told him to go home, promising he'd have Andie call when she got in. By eleven-fifteen, however, Duckie was starting to get nervous. His fingers were itching to dial Andie's number again but he was afraid of upsetting Jack, so he sat on his hands to avoid temptation. At eleven-thirty Duckie started pacing his room, and by midnight he was literally hyperventilating. Finally, just as a path was starting to wear in his carpet, the phone rang. Duckie shot across the room and over his bed, successfully knocking the receiver across the floor. He dove for it and jammed it against his ear. \"Do you have any idea what time it is, young lady?\" Duckie said severely, putting a hand on his hip even though no one could see. \"Your mother and I were worried sick!\" There was a silence on the other end of the phone. Duckie paused, listening. Was she there? Was it even Andie? \"Andie?\" He asked, his tone considerably gentler. There was a small sound on the other end of the phone, almost like someone crying. \"Andie? Andie, what's wrong?\" \"C-can you come over?\" She choked. \"I'll be right there.\" Duckie parked his bike on the patch of grass next to the Walsh's garage and then scrambled up the lattice leading to Andie's bedroom window. Normally he would have just gone through the front door, but something told him that Jack might not be too happy to see him this late at night. So, instead, he hoisted himself up on the roof under her window and looked inside. Andie was sprawled out, face down, on her bed in her pajamas. Her body was shaking, and Duckie could tell she hadn't stopped crying since getting off the phone with him. Very lightly, he tapped on the glass. Andie's head shot up at once. Her mascara was running down her face and her eyes were bloodshot. Duckie felt his insides twist. What had that goon done to her tonight? \"I'm s-sorry I asked you to come over so late,\" Andie sputtered as she pushed the window open and allowed him to climb inside. \"But my d-dad's already in bed and I didn't know who else to talk to.\" \"It's alright,\" Duckie said, closing the window behind him and guiding her back to the bed. They sat down. \"What's going on? What happened?\" \"Duckie, my date was horrible!\" Andie wailed, throwing herself forward on the bed. \"He—he,\" but another wave of sobs racked her before she could finish. Alarmed, Duckie grabbed her shoulders and pulled her up again. \"Andie, he didn't try nothing, did he? I mean, this guy, he didn't…you know…try to—to,\" Duckie stumbled around awkwardly, trying to put what he meant in delicate terms, but Andie was already nodding. \"Y-yes!\" Andie sobbed, wiping her streaming eyes. Rage, white-hot, cataclysmic, volcanic rage coursed through Duckie. His whole body felt like someone had tried to jump-start it, and he found himself shaking so intensely it resounded in his ears. \"Who is he?\" Duckie demanded. \"Who is the bastard? I'll kill him, Andie, I swear to God I'll kill the son-of-a-bitch! Who did it?\" Andie shook her head again. \"No,\" she said firmly despite the water that was still cascading down her cheeks. \"No, Duckie, you can't! Please, please promise me, you can't do anything! It'll only make more trouble.\" \"Andie, this guy tried to—I can't just sit back and let him—Andie, get real here!\" \"Please!\" She said, grabbing his hand and looking him deep in the eyes. Duckie started to argue again but melted the minute her eyes met his. He thought it was stupid, but if Andie wanted it to be so…then, it was so. \"Fine,\" he said softly. He saw her relax. \"Why'd you call me then, if you didn't want me to run out and go G.I. Joe on this guy?\" Duckie asked after a silent moment. \"I…I just needed somebody…you.\" Andie said quietly. \"Well, here I am.\" \"Yeah,\" she managed a small smile. There was another awkward pause. \"You should—er—get to bed,\" Duckie muttered. \"I'll just let myself out.\" He was halfway to the window when Andie called out to him. \"Duckie?\" He turned. She was already under the covers and pushed all the way to the right of her small twin bed. She looked like she was having a very hard time coming to a decision about something. Finally, she spoke. \"Could you…do you think you could…please stay? I don't want to be alone right now.\" Duckie blinked at her, unsure he had really heard what he thought he had just heard. Unless he was imagining things, which he might be, she had just asked him to spend the night. In her bed. While she was in it. In pajamas. Without a bra. He suddenly got the intense urge to pinch himself. Then he remembered what had just almost happened to her. Shame crept up on him, how could he stand there thinking about Andie braless after what she had just told him. She needed him to be a friend, a shoulder to cry on, and his brain was going all horndog on him. Come on, Duckster, get it together. \"Please?\" Andie repeated again, pulling Duckie out of his momentary coma. \"Um, yeah,\" He said somewhat awkwardly. He kicked off his shoes and dropped his blazer on the floor next to her bed. Then, nervously, he climbed under the covers next to her. Timidly, Andie scooted over and rested her head on his chest, her arm draping across his stomach. \"You don't mind, do you? The bed's so small,\" Andie said. \"No,\" Duckie said, his voice slightly higher than normal. \"No, nope. No, you're fine.\" Slowly, he let his arm fall over her shoulders. Her skin was warm and soft. Duckie bit his lip and prayed he would be able to make it through this ordeal without her feeling the embarrassing erection that was already creeping up on him. Andie nuzzled her head against his chest and gave him a gentle squeeze. Duckie stifled a pained moan. \"You're my best friend, you know that?\" Andie said, her voice slightly muffled by his shirt. \"I don't know what I'd do without you.\" \"Oh,\" Duckie said, patting her hair, \"I'm sure you'd manage somehow.\" \"No, I mean it.\" Andie pushed herself up so they were face to face with each other. \"You're the best friend I've ever had. I've never met anybody else I can talk to like I can talk to you. And tonight…who else would have understood tonight?\" \"I—I dunno,\" Duckie muttered, his eyes unable to decide whether they wanted to look at her eyes or her mouth. \"I don't think I'd survive high school without you,\" Andie said softly. \"Oh, I think you'd manage,\" He said, his voice shaking slightly. She was so damned close. \"No,\" Andie whispered. Something passed over her face, and she blinked at him as though she had never seen him before. \"No, I don't think I would.\" Andie's mouth was suddenly pressed tight against his. Surprised, Duckie pulled back a little, but Andie kept kissing. She ran her fingers through his hair and leaned closer. Duckie looked around for something that would help him, something that would make her get off. He wanted Andie, God knows he wanted Andie, but he didn't want her like this, not while she was all vulnerable and easily manipulated. This wasn't right, not like this, not now. Duckie grabbed ahold of the headboard and used it to pull himself away. Their lips parted with a loud, wet smack. \"I gotta go, Andie,\" Duckie said quickly, throwing himself off the bed and clumsily slipping on his shoes. \"I'm really sorry. I just—I got stuff—My grandmother's in town—cake in the oven—I'll call you tomorrow!\" He grabbed his blazer, shoved open the window, and just about jumped to the grass below. Duckie walked his bike home that night, he was shaking too hard to steer properly. After years of waiting, years of kissing his pillow and pretending it was Andie, years of making himself look like an idiot, he had finally got his moment. Unfortunately, he couldn't enjoy it, he felt too low. He wondered vaguely what Andie would be more angry about, him kissing her back or him jumping out of the window to avoid kissing her further. Whatever one she chose, Duckie knew he'd never been able to win the arguement anyway. God, why'd she have to pick now? Why'd she have to pick tonight? Why couldn't it have been at the prom, or the record store, or a desert island two months from now? Duckie kicked a rock across the street in frustration. Still, it had been a good kiss, tainted a little by her impaired judgement and the fact that she was almost deflowered, but good all the same. He wondered if maybe, tomorrow, a week from now, sometime over the summer, she'd let him kiss her again. The right way, the way she was meant to be kissed. Something inside him doubted it. Oh well, maybe he'd try, maybe he wouldn't. It didn't really matter right now. At any rate, he'd call her in the morning.[Chapter 2] DISCLAIMER: I don't own Pretty in Pink. READ AND REVIEW PLEASE! Author's Note Thanks to everyone who review/added my story to their favorites, I really appreciate it! I originally wrote this story as a oneshot but decided, after reading my reviews, that I couldn't leave Duckie hanging like I did. So now this story is looking to be about 3 chapters long. I hope you enjoy chapter 2, and keep an eye out for the conclusion!! Andie awoke the next morning with a terrible headache and an even worse sense of foreboding. Immediately, Duckie's face came to mind, and Andie's stomach churned like she had something very large and wriggly living inside it. She had kissed him, she had kissed her best friend and now she had to get up and face him at school. What was she going to say to him? \"Hey, Duckie, sorry about kissing you last night, my mistake. Let's forget it, ok?\" It sounded lame just thinking it. But what was worse, what was really causing the serpent in her stomach to writhe uncontrollably, was the fact that a part of her really didn't want to forget about it. It had been…well… nice . Better than nice, great, magnificent, the best damn kiss she had ever had in her entire life. And even worse still, it really hadn't been all that much of a mistake. She had wanted to kiss him. Now, however, she wasn't so sure that had been the right move. Duckie loved her too much, loved her like her dad still loved her mom, a woman who had walked out on them three years ago without so much as a second glance. She knew what happened when people loved that strongly, it only made them that much easier to destroy. Andie wasn't going to let Duckie end up like her dad, and she sure as hell wasn't ever going to be her mother. As if on cue, the phone rang. Andie let it go to voicemail, knowing full well who was on the other end. She couldn't face him just yet. She needed the drive to school to figure out the best way to avoid breaking his heart entirely. Andie was kneeling on the floor, sifting through the bottom of her locker for a spare pencil, when a pair of all too familiar white shoes appeared next to her. Her heart jumped. \"Good mornin'\" Duckie said, beaming down at her. \"You know, this is a very becoming angle for you, the way the fluorescents are hitting you is simply ravishing.\" \"Hi, Duckie,\" Andie mumbled. She closed her locker and straightened up, looking at the floor rather than his face. It didn't take Duckie long to figure out what was wrong. In fact, he would have been surprised if he had been greeted any other way this morning. The standoffish vibe Andie was emitting was exactly what he had expected from her. Typical Andie; cut them off fast and quick. No use in letting people dangle around, it'll only hurt more if they did. Her way of dealing with uncomfortable emotions was like how other people dealt with band-aids. Still, Duckie forced himself to play dumb and keep a smile plastered on his face. Mostly so he didn't go to pieces in front of her. \"You seem kinda spacey. Didja have a nightmare last night?\" He asked. Andie didn't answer. He tried a different approach, \"Wanna go to the nurse? If you slip her a Twinkie she'll let you sleep all the way through homeroom. I could go with and keep you company,\" He added. \"Maybe if we both give her something we'll be able to skip until lunch. Not like I was planning on going to class anyway…but for you, I mean.\" His laughter died away awkwardly in the silence Andie was still forcing upon them. Duckie stuffed his hands into his pockets and bounced a little on the balls of his feet, clicking his tongue uncomfortably. \"So, those Bears are lookin' good,\" Duckie said in another feeble attempt to make conversation. \"You don't watch football, Duckie,\" Andie said finally. \"Well, I've been thinking about taking it up.\" He chuckled, she didn't laugh. \"Come on, Andie, what does a guy have to do to get you to talk to him? What does your breath smell or something? Cause I swear if you ran outta toothpaste this morning I—\" \"Duckie, stop it,\" Andie snapped. \"Just stop talking, ok?\" \"Why, what did I do?\" He asked, raising his eyebrows. \"I'm just trying to get you to actually be in the conversation.\" \"I'm trying to!\" Andie said, her voice turning shrill. \"But you just keep going, you won't shut up!\" \"Well, I'm shut up now,\" Duckie said, not bothering to keep the hurt from his voice. Andie looked away from him again. She really didn't want to say what she had to say. A picture of her dad floated in front of her eyes and her resolve strengthened a little. She couldn't break Duckie's heart that horribly, she couldn't be her mother. It was best just to end anything that might have happened right now. \"Duckie, I didn't mean to kiss you last night,\" Andie said quickly, staring at his shoes rather than his face. \"It was a mistake and I hope you can forgive me. It didn't mean anything and I'm sorry if I confused you.\" Duckie had known the words were coming eventually, he had even imagined her saying them to him as he lie in bed last night. But in real life, the sound of rejection stung a hell of a lot worse. \"I see,\" Duckie said quietly, running a hand over his hair. \"I really am sorry, Duckie,\" Andie repeated, reaching out to touch him. Duckie tensed but let her hand fall on his arm. \"Yeah, well, it was a mistake right? Mistakes happen all the time, what'cha gonna do?\" Duckie's heart felt like it had leapt into his throat, which was tightening painfully. He started to back away from her. \"I'm just glad I could help, you know, be there for you and everything. What are friends for, right?\" Duckie chuckled and his voice cracked. He coughed to cover it up. \"Look, I gotta get going…I'll—er—I'll see you later.\" He turned and started down the hallway. \"I'll save a seat at lunch!\" Andie called after him. Duckie waved over his shoulder and continued walking, his throat now burning. Getting a drink at the nearest water fountain, he came to two conclusions. The first was that he wasn't going to have lunch with Andie today; the second was that, for the first time since sophomore year, he would actually go to his classes. At least there he would be able to think about algebra or history and not about her. Andie had to be the worst friend in the history of ever. As she watched Duckie disappear into the sea of kids scurrying to classes, she felt, if possible, even worse than she had this morning. She wondered if Duckie would actually show up for lunch and doubted it. The look in his eyes had told her everything. He would disappear when the bell rang and probably not turn up for the rest of the day. Blinking back the tears that had suddenly appeared in her eyes, Andie hurried off to her class. Just as she opened the door, a tall, good looking boy with piercing eyes ran into her as he passed, knocking the books out of her arms. \"God, I'm sorry,\" he apologized as he bent to pick them up. \"I didn't see you.\" \"It's ok,\" Andie said distractedly, her thoughts still with Duckie. She took her books back and moved to her usual seat. A moment later, the boy plopped down in the seat next to her. \"I'm Blane, by the way,\" He said, offering her a crooked smile. \"Andie,\" she said, smiling a little in return as the bell rang. Duckie sat in Algebra, doodling absentmindedly on the desk, and trying to keep his mind off of Andie, who, incidentally, was two doors away and sitting third desk on the right in the second row. Not that he was thinking about her…she just always sat there, it was fact, he couldn't help it if he knew where she sat. Frustrated, he brought his pencil down a little too hard on the desk and the tip snapped off. Great, now he'd have to pay attention to math. He turned his attention to the chalkboard but couldn't focus. All the numbers and letters seemed to be rearranging themselves to look like Andie, and he found his mind darting back to where she sat two doors down. Maybe class was a bad idea, maybe after the bell rang he'd just get on his bike and head out to the mall, spend the rest of the day cruising around the sidewalks and checking out the thrift stores. Hopefully then, when she wasn't still so close, he'd be able to empty his mind a little. Duckie doubted it, though.[Chapter 3] DISCLAIMER: I don't own Pretty in Pink READ AND REVIEW PLEASE!! 3 Author's Note Here it is! The epic 4,000 word ending to Every Duck Has His Day! Thank you to everyone who has reviewed and favorited my story, particularly Marty's Girl, MysteryGirl2000, Italiangeek1, Duckie9848, and Drygionus! You guys rock out loud! Please review and tell me what you thought. Remember, reviews are love :) Enjoy! Andie Walsh has a boyfriend. He had heard the words, plain as day, come out of some preppy, khaki skirted Richie girl's mouth as he was taking a drink from the water fountain. Duckie spat water back into the fountain bowl with surprise and the Richie girl grimaced before herding her friends away. Duckie watched them go, mouth gaping, spit and water trickling down his chin. It wasn't possible. Andie couldn't be dating someone, she'd have told him, she told him everything! In all honesty, however, Andie hadn't really been telling Duckie much of anything lately. Ever since she had kissed and rejected him, Duckie had been doing his best to avoid contact with Andie, even going as far as suggesting he had homework that needed doing. It wasn't because he hated her, or was even still all that upset over what she did; he had forgiven her ages ago. No, he was mainly avoiding her because if he stood by her or spoke to her for longer than five minutes his heart started to feel like someone was trying to drive a tractor through it. For the past month his conversations with Andie had been limited to \"Hi\", \"Bye\", or \"Maybe tomorrow\". Nothing very deep, it's true, but Duckie was sure Andie would have mentioned something as monumental as a boyfriend! Wiping the spit from his bottom lip, Duckie shook the idea from his head. It was crazy, Andie having a boyfriend that he didn't know about. Those girls must have been talking about somebody else, or they got their information from a bad source. Either way, it couldn't be true. Andie would have told him, he was positive of that. Duckie left the fountain and headed off down the hallway towards Andie's locker. If there was ever a time to try talking to her again, now was definitely it. She was there, fiddling with the combination. He paused and watched her, a smile tugging at his lips and his heart fluttering a little in his chest. She was too beautiful. Taking a deep breath, Duckie started forward again. Before he reached her, however, a boy appeared out of nowhere. Duckie stopped, watching, his heart skipping about ten beats. The boy leaned against the lockers and pushed a few stray hairs out of Andie's face. She smiled up at him, her whole face lighting up. Duckie looked away, the familiar pain stabbing at his chest. When he looked back the boy was gone, but Andie remained. Summoning courage from somewhere deep inside of him, Duckie sauntered up to her locker. \"Long time no talk,\" Duckie said. Andie, who hadn't noticed him, jumped a little. \"God, Duckie,\" she said, clutching her chest, \"you scared me.\" \"Sorry,\" He apologized. Then, in a would be casual voice, he asked, \"Who's the guy?\" \"What guy?\" Andie asked, her cheeks going pink. Anger flashed through Duckie so quickly he almost didn't know what to do with it. Ok, so there was a guy. Ok, so she hadn't mentioned him. Ok, so he had found out through a third party. Whatever, he didn't care about that, he could take that. What he couldn't take was being lied to face to face. Did she think he was that stupid he couldn't put it together? Or, maybe, she thought he was too fragile to handle the truth. Well he wasn't a piece of china, he was a person, a person who deserved the know what the hell was going on! \"Andie, I'm not blind, ok…I saw him. Who is he?\" \"A friend,\" Andie murmured, closing her locker and starting down the hallway. Duckie followed her. All right, she wanted to play games. He'd play along. \"A boyfriend, maybe?\" he pressed. \"No,\" Andie said a little too quickly, \"why would you say that?\" \"Sure looked like a boyfriend to me,\" Duckie said, falling into step next to her. \"Funny, I was under the impression we were friends. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a general rule that friends tell each other about changes in their relationship status? I could be completely off base; I did leave my best friend handbook in my other pants this morning.\" \"And correct me if I'm wrong,\" Andie threw back, stopping suddenly and rounding on him, \"but I thought best friends don't just stop talking to each other for months on end. Maybe if you had tried speaking to me I would have told you about him!\" \"Oh yeah, Andie,\" Duckie sneered, \"I really wanted to talk to you after being tossed in the reject pile. Sorry, I forgot the only one who's feelings matter is you!\" \"What are you talking about?\" Andie snapped. \"Who is this guy, anyway? Some Richie?\" Duckie laughed humorlessly. \"Does he have a big car, Andie? How about his house? I bet that's huge too. And, you know, I guess that's all that matters, isn't it? Things, stuff, lots of stuff, because how on earth can anyone be happy without all that shit filling up their life, right?\" \"What are you talking about?\" Andie repeated, her voice going shrill. \"I'm talking about us, Andie!\" Duckie yelled. \"You and me!\" \"There is no you and me, Duckie,\" Andie said through her teeth, her voice shaking. \"WHY NOT?\" Duckie bellowed, his uncharacteristic outburst empowering him to go further. Andie started to speak but he cut her off. \"I'll tell you why, Andie, because you're scared. You're scared of me, you're scared of actually falling in love, but most of all I think you're scared of being your mother!\" Andie gaped at him. \"That's not true,\" she said quietly. \"It was a mistake; I told you it was mistake.\" \"Bullshit,\" Duckie spat, crossing his arms. \"It wasn't a mistake; you know it wasn't a mistake! You saw me that night, really saw me for the first time, I watched it happen. You wanted to kiss me, Andie, why can't you just admit it?\" Duckie paused and took several deep breaths. The next time he spoke, it was gentler. \"It wouldn't be that horrible, you know...being with me. Hell, I might even make you happy. More than what's-his-name, probably.\" \"His name's Blane,\" Andie said. \"Charming,\" Duckie muttered. There was an awkward silence. Duckie coughed. \"What do you say, Andie?\" he asked quietly. Andie looked at him and then away. He was right, he was absolutely right about everything, but Andie still couldn't face it. She wanted to be with Duckie, she just didn't know how to be with him. Andie felt like she was trapped in some kind of limbo. She couldn't go back to the way things were before and she was scared shitless to move forward. That's why she was with Blane. Blane was safe, and boring, and totally predictable, and he never pushed her in a direction she didn't want to go. Duckie was just too frightening. He made her feel vulnerable, and vulnerability was weakness. So, taking a deep breath she looked up and said: \"Blane's waiting for me.\" And she walked off towards the stairs. Duckie watched her go with an odd feeling of emptiness. She was actually going, actually walking away from him. He hesitated for half a second and then ran after her, determined to have the last word. \"Andie!\" he called. She turned halfway down the stairs and looked up at him. \"I'm not going to be around forever, Andie. I've let you kick my heart all to hell for eight years and I still come crawling back. Well, not any more. You've got to pick, Andie. Either you want this Blane guy or me. But if you pick him…well…I'm not gonna stick around much longer.\" Andie's eyes went wide. Duckie shrugged and stuffed his hands in his pockets. \"I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna waste any more time on somebody who doesn't give a shit.\" Andie made to open her mouth but Duckie was already striding away. She lingered on the stairs, torn between running after him and breaking down in helpless tears. Then she remembered Blane and the ride to the mall he promised her and ran off to meet him. It was all over, Duckie could just feel it; he didn't have a chance in hell of winning Andie. How could he compete with Blane? Duckie thought bitterly how wonderful it must be to have money. All his childhood, people had told him he could do anything he wanted to when he got older. What a slap in the face it was to wake up and realize what they really meant was \"anything you wanted long as you have a way to pay for it\". Apparently, those terms also applied to who you got to be with. Duckie leaned against a locker and knocked his head back against the wall. If it really turned out he had to give Andie up he wasn't sure he would be able to go on. Living without her would be like living without oxygen. He only hoped he'd be able to make it with a few shreds of dignity still intact. Pulling his head away from the wall, Duckie caught sight of a poster hanging directly across from him. Vote Now For Prom King and Queen! Prom…that was coming up soon, wasn't it. It was like adding salt to an already festering wound. Maybe he wouldn't go. No, he'd go. What if, by some miracle, some freak of nature, Andie actually picked him? He had to go for that very reason, and if he got dirt kicked in his eye again (like he undoubtedly thought he would), he'd just take it like a man. It was about time he started standing up for himself, anyway. Today had been a good start. Andie leaned her forehead against the window of Blane's car. He was driving her to work at the mall and going on about some party one of his friends was having that weekend. Andie wasn't paying any attention; she was too busy thinking about what Duckie had said to her. Would he really leave her forever if she chose to stay with Blane? That hardly seemed fair. They had been friends forever, how could he just stop that easily? Andie heaved a sigh and Blane looked over at her. \"You haven't heard a word I've said, have you?\" he asked, laughing a little. \"What?\" Andie's head snapped up and she looked at him. \"Oh, no…sorry.\" \"What's the matter?\" Blane asked. \"Nothing,\" Andie said. Blane gave her a look, Andie rolled her eyes. \"I had a fight with my best friend.\" \"What's her problem?\" \"Well, actually—\" Andie started, then stopped. She had been about to say \"she's a he\", but decided against it. She really didn't want to have another fight at the moment. Coughing, Andie continued, \"She's a little upset I'm dating you.\" \"What?\" Blane exclaimed, laughing again. \"How come?\" \"She…she doesn't think you're good enough for me,\" Andie said. \"Well, what do you think?\" Blane asked, taking her hand and kissing it. Andie smiled a little. \"I think you're just fine.\" Blane grinned at her and then turned back to the road. Andie slumped against her seat. Somehow she felt even worse than before. Blane was fine, he was a sweet guy, she had said so herself. So why couldn't she just get Duckie out of her mind and focus on him instead. It should have been relatively easy. It wasn't. Prom Night Duckie stood in front of the mirror in his bedroom and made a face at his appearance. The suite the lady at the thrift store had found for him was a little too mainstream for his tastes, but the price had been right so he had bought it. He had done his best to make it his own, adding a bolo tie and slipping on his usual pair of shoes, but he still thought he looked like something out of a J.C. Penny's catalog. \"Well, Duckman, you've sunk to a new low,\" he muttered to his reflection, adding a last dollop of grease to his hair. Duckie gave himself a final once over. He smirked. \"I gotta say, for a guy who's about to go down in flames, you look pretty damn good.\" Turning from the mirror, Duckie fished his sunglasses out of a discarded blazer. Then, slipping them on his face, he flicked off the light and closed the door behind him. Thirty minutes later, Duckie was lounging at a deserted table in the middle of the Crystal Hotel's ballroom. A hundred or so of his classmates were dancing around him, having the time of their lives. Duckie, on the other hand, was busy trying to flick playing cards into an ashtray. It wasn't particularly the way he had envisioned his senior prom going, but it killed time. What he was really waiting for was Andie, but so far she hadn't showed up. He was just beginning to doubt that she was ever going to show when he looked up and saw her come through the double doors, looking more beautiful than he had ever seen her. Andie had spent all day fighting with herself. One the on hand, she had Blane. He was reliable, he was handsome, and he was boring her to death. On the other hand, she had Duckie. He was sweet, he was loyal, and he was the only person in the entire world who made her feel like her feet weren't firmly planted on the ground. Andie still couldn't shake how nervous that made her feel. And she still wasn't quite sure she trusted herself to not turn into her mother, that was a ghost Andie knew would haunt her for a long time. There was a knock on her bedroom door and her father, Jack, came inside. When he saw her sitting in front of her vanity, all decked out in her prom attire, his face broke into a brilliant grin. Jack crossed the room and planted a kiss on the top of her head. \"You're so grown up,\" he said, sitting on the edge of her bed. \"Just beautiful.\" Andie turned around in her seat to look at him. \"Thanks, Daddy,\" she said, smiling. Jack's grin faltered a little and then turned into a frown altogether. \"What's the matter?\" He asked seriously. Andie blinked at him and then snorted, \"You always know, don't you?\" Jack stared at her. Andie sighed. \"I don't know if I want to go to the prom.\" \"Why not?\" Jack asked, moving closer. \"It's…a lot of things,\" she muttered. Jack was quiet a minute. \"You know, Phil hasn't been by lately,\" he said carefully. \"Yeah, he's part of the problem,\" Andie sighed. Jack grinned a little. \"Not a fan of Blane, is he?\" \"You could say that,\" Andie smirked. \"He also…well, he thinks that we…He pretty much told me…\" \"He loves you,\" Jack finished for her. \"Yeah,\" Andie said, wilting. \"And you love Blane?\" he asked. Andie bit her lip and looked at her hands. Jacked tilted her head up, \"You don't love Blane, do you?\" \"It's not that easy, Daddy,\" Andie said, getting up and crossing to the window. \"I should love Blane; he's good for me, for us. He's got money and he's smart, and he'd never make me do anything I didn't want to. He never pushes my buttons, and he's crazy about me, and I'm bored out of my mind!\" \"So, don't date Blane,\" Jack advised, as though he was telling her to go out and pick up a loaf of bread. \"Oh, Daddy,\" Andie moaned, wiping her eyes, which had suddenly gone moist. \"What? Don't date him! He bores you, so get rid of him. Who doesn't bore you?\" Andie was quiet. \"It's Phil, right?\" Andie nodded. \"So, date Phil!\" \"I can't!\" She cried, spinning around. \"Why not?\" Jack asked, now totally confused. \"Because he reminds me of you and I don't want to be my mother!\" Andie wailed, tears now spilling down her cheeks. \"Hey, come on now,\" Jack cooed, jumping up and enveloping her in his arms. Andie buried her head against his chest. \"No more of that, you'll ruin your makeup. And what do you mean you're afraid of being your mother? Sweetie, you couldn't be your mother in a million years.\" \"He scares me,\" Andie mumbled against his chest, wiping her eyes. \"He scares me and I feel so out of control around him. Why?\" Jack laughed a little. \"Well,\" he said slowly, \"I can't say for sure…but maybe, maybe it's because you love him too?\" Andie looked up at her father and he smiled down at her, and for the first time she just allowed herself to feel what she had been blocking up for the past month and a half. He was right, she did love him, and if she didn't do something fast she might just lose him forever. \"Daddy, I need to get to the dance,\" Andie said, breaking out of the hug and looking around for her shoes. \"Can you drive me?\" \"What about Blane?\" Jack asked, raising an eyebrow. \"I'll call him later, he'll understand.\" Jack nodded and left the bedroom to go start the car. Andie slipped on her shoes and checked her face in the mirror. The damage wasn't too bad; actually, it wasn't bad at all. Her cheeks were rosy and her eyes were sparkling like she'd never seen them do before. She was glowing. Chuckling at herself, Andie ran out of the room, not bothering to turn out the light. Duckie stood paralyzed for a moment, she had quite literally taken his breath away. It wasn't until she walked up to him and started to speak was he able to pull himself out of his trance. \"Hi,\" Andie said timidly. \"Hey,\" Duckie said, smirking slightly. He cast a look over her shoulder, \"where's Blane ?\" \"I didn't come with him,\" she breathed. Duckie blinked. \"What'dya mean?\" \"He's not my date,\" Andie repeated. She reached out and took his hand in hers. Duckie's heart spun around completely in his chest. \"But I thought he was a great guy?\" He said weakly, praying she was suggesting what he thought she was suggesting. \"He is, and he's going to make some rich girl very happy.\" Andie grinned at the look of surprise on Duckie's face. Then she turned serious. \"Duckie, I'm so sorry, I've been an idiot. Everything you said the other day—\" Duckie started to speak but Andie held up her hand, \" everything you said was true, especially the part about my mother. But I think I'm ok now. At least, I want to give it a shot.\" \"You mean that?\" Duckie asked, eyeing her uncertainly. \"Because I wouldn't blame you if you ran out of here screaming for Blane. The kid's got a car and everything. I mean, some girls are ok with riding on handlebars, but I've never really, you know, pegged you as one of them.\" \"I don't care about the car,\" Andie reassured, taking a step closer to him. \"And think about his house!\" Duckie continued, still not believing her. \"The best I'm gonna be able to give you is a Coleman tent. Until I win the lottery, that is…which I have a really good feeling about, by the way.\" \"I don't care about the money,\" Andie said, wrapping her arms around his neck. \"And he's a really handsome guy,\" Duckie said, more to tease her at this point than anything. \"Think about how beautiful your kids would be. You'd be able to enter them in all sorts of demeaning little pageants. Parade them around like show dogs, maybe turn one into the new Gerber Baby.\" \"Duckie, shut up,\" Andie smiled. Duckie smiled back and then, very slowly, he brought his lips down to meet hers. It was even better then he remembered it. Andie's lips were soft and moist and tasted slightly of cherry. Must be her lipstick, Duckie thought vaguely. He tightened his grip around her waist and kissed her deeper, making Andie's head spin. When they finally broke apart, they were both out of breath. \"Andie, don't freak out,\" Duckie said, running his hand down the side of her face, \"but I'm in love with you.\" \"Me too,\" Andie whispered, nuzzling his hand. She tilted her head up and kissed him again. \"How long do you think it'd take you to set up that tent?\" The End ","Summary":" DISCLAIMER: I don't own Pretty in Pink or its characters.

One, two, three, four...yeah, fifth- time this past half-hour. Glancing around the big, empty room, I kick the hideous beige wall beside me. \"Air,\" my mother calls into the room, \"is that your choice?\" \"Fine,\" I sigh in return. \"What?\" she calls. \"I said fine!\" I say in a louder, aggravated tone. Sickeningly bright sunshine pours into the room from the open window across from me. I hate sunshine. Alright, no I don't. Not usually, anyway. I just hate everything today. I hate moving vans, and moving men, and cardboard boxes that will make my sheets smell like avacados, and I especially hate beige, blank walls. Beige blank walls are dreadful. \"Great!\" my mother calls perkily. \"I'll take the other one!\" \"Of course you will,\" I grumble as my mother shouts to the moving men where to bring my stuff. I sigh. Now my brand new bedroom will smell like sweaty men, I think, pressing myself against the wall as my bed frame is shoved into the room. \"Ooh, Arial!\" Mom yells from the hallway. She peeked her head in as Chandler the Moving Man lazily dropped my box full of old yearbooks on the dusty carpet. \"You must come look at the living room!\" \"Must I?\" I sigh, pushing past Chandler the Moving Man and following her out to the living room, which was also sickeningly sunshine-y. \"Isn't this love seat darling?\" my mother coos, sitting on the pink and green love seat in front of the wide window. My mother isn't necesarily old. She recently turned thirty-eight, but she acts twenty. She's been this way since she and my father got a divorce a or so ago. It bugs me. She doesn't seem to understand that I want a mother, not another girlfriend. \"It's precious,\" I humor her. \"We can put those little throw pillows Grandmother Doris made for us on it.\" \"We could!\" Mom agrees happily, her entire face lighting up. \"That'll look great, Arial!\" \"Yep,\" I say, rolling my eyes. Mom doesn't notice. She's too busy instructing some moving men- Arnold and Daniel- on where to put the sofa. I look around the bare room. These walls are a green color. Ugly, but better than my beige bedroom. The entire house is ugly. I hate it. \"I'm going on a walk,\" I say, grabbing my jean jacket off the ground where I had previously thrown it. \"Have fun!\" Mom chirps, beginning to unroll our big throw rug. \"Sure,\" I mutter, opening the front door. It slams shut behind me as I pull on my coat. Needless to say, I'm very unhappy about our moving. Mom and I used to live in a tiny town in Michigan, where we'd lived forever. Of course, that was when Mom and Dad were still married and we all shared a nice house. Then the fighting, cheating, seperation, and finally divorce shoved my mother and me to Chicago to live closer to her sister. Dad has the nice two-story house by all my friends. Part of me wanted nothing more than to stay with dad, but I also knew Mom would end up doing something crazy by herself. So I moved to Chicago from pretty Battle Creek. I kick a pebble as I walk down the sidewalk, hands jammed into the pockets of my jacket. Some people ride past me on bikes or drive by in cars. I ignore them as much as I can. I'll have to deal with them tomorrow at school, so I practice ignoring them now. I've never been to a new school, and new kids rarely came to Battle Creek, but according to movies I've seen, new kids are instantly labeled as outcasts. I can only hope that isn't true for this school. I circle the block and end up back in front of the house. The moving van is gone now, though there are still some boxes stacked up on the porch. I pick a few up and carry them in to find my mother in the kitchen, organizing cutlary drawers. \"Hey, Air,\" she greets as I enter. \"How was your walk? Did you meet any new friends?\" \"No,\" I answer stiffly. \"Well, you can make some tomorrow, then!\" says Mom happily, shutting the now organized drawer. \"Great,\" I say. I sling my coat over my shoulder. \"I'm gonna go start putting together my room.\" \"Okay! Call me when you're finished!\" \"Mmm,\" I hum in response before exiting the kitchen and going to my bedroom, which still smelled like sweat. My bed is already put together (Thank you, Chandler the Moving Man, I mentally add as an apology to my silent snarkiness), so I open box after box to find my blankets. I bring one of the purple sheets up to my nose and sniff. Grapefruit. Well, at least it isn't avacado. I put the sheets and blankets on my bed before collapsing upon it and falling asleep, still fully dressed. \"Morning!\" Mom sang upon barging into my room without invitation. I moan. \"No.\" She laughs. \"Come on, Arial, it's time to wake up.\" \"No.\" \"Air!\" She pulls the blankets off of me. \"You don't wanna be late for your first day!\" \"No, you don't want me to be late. I have no moral turmoil on the subject of tardiness.\" Mom laughs again. \"Come on, sweetie, I made you breakfast. Waffles and bacon.\" \"That does sound delightful...\" With a heavy sigh, I heave myself from the bed. Half of me was expecting to see the tiny Michigan apartment we lived in while Aunt Wendy searched for an appropriate Chicago-ian house for us. I'm greeted by beige walls. Stupid beige walls. Stupid sunshine from still un-covered windows. \"Come on. Breakfast, then shower. I'll give you a ride on my way to your aunts.\" \"Thanks, Mom,\" I say, stretching my arms out. My shirt is wrinkled and, like my sheets, smells like grapefruit. \"Tell Wendy I say hello?\" \"Of course,\" Mom promises. \"Hurry up. Your syrup is getting cold.\" \"Thank you, Mom,\" I say, following her out the door. After a delicious, filling breakfast, hot shower, and eight minute car ride, I arrive at the school. Some kids park cars, some chain up bikes, and some- like me- wave goodbye to their parents. Everyone has a friend or boyfriend or girlfriend they instantly find and speak with. I walk awkwardly through the center of these groups, apologizing in a low voice as I do so. The woman at the office gives me my schedule, books, and locker assignment. I thank her and find my locker, hastily shoving things in as my textbooks make dramatic dives to the tiled floor. \"Damn,\" I groan when the bell rings and students rush to their first period classes. My locker door finally manages to shut as I look at my schedule. Mrs. Ernest, room two-thirty-nine. Where the heck was room two-thirty-nine? \"Excuse me!\" I say swiftly to a boy walking casually down the hall. It's as if he doesn't notice, or perhaps care, that he's late. He looks my way and tilts his dark, round sunglasses down his nose to look at me. \"Yeah?\" he asks. \"Hi,\" I begin, \"I'm Arial Dawson. It's my first day.\" \"Arial Dawson,\" the boy repeats. \"Lovely to meet you. Really, charmed. Duckie Dale.\" He holds out his hand, which I shake. \"Yeah, hi. Can you point me in the direction of Mrs. Ernest's room?\" \"I can indeed.\" He takes me by the shoulders and turns me around. \"Right about that'a'way,\" Duckie says, adjusting me just barely so I'm pointed slightly to the left. \"Right, thanks. Now could you give me directions?\" \"I certainly could,\" says Duckie, \"but are you sure you should be walking so much?\" \"Excuse me?\" I frown. \"I mean, it's only your first day with legs. I'd be a bit more careful if I was you.\" I groan and Duckie looks quite pleased with himself. \"Little Mermaid jokes? Really?\" \"Oh yes,\" he replies. \"And now that I know you dislike them, more will be coming your way, little Arial. I assure you.\" He takes my schedule from my hands and looks at it. \"You go down this hall, turn right, and it'll be the last door on the left of that hallway.\" \"Thank you,\" I say, taking my schedule back. \"Tell Flounder I said hello!\" he calls after me. I shake my head and keep walking. \"This food looks disgusting,\" I comment, my nose wrinkled up. \"It is disgusting,\" my new friend, Taylor, agrees. \"Wait until you get a taste of it. You're gonna wish you didn't have taste-bubs.\" \"They're serving fish?\" someone asks from behind me. \"Mermaid, are you sure you're comfortable eating this? Was this one of your friends?\" \"Hey, Duckie,\" I say, rolling my eyes. \"Do you know Taylor?\" \"Unfortunately,\" Taylor inserts. \"Hi, Phil.\" \"Phil?\" I repeat. \"Taylor here doesn't acknowledge my real name,\" Duckie explains. \"Or your existence,\" Taylor adds, causing me to laugh. \"You will respect your elder, missy!\" says Duckie. \"Elder?\" I say. \"Phil failed last year.\" \"I decided to kindly lend my presence to another year,\" Duckie says. \"Everyone loves me so much here.\" \"Sure,\" Taylor scoffs. \"Denial,\" Duckie sings. \"Now, I'm gonna go eat. You lovely ladies are completely welcome to join me if you'd like.\" He blows a kiss before turning and walking away. \"He totally just blew you a kiss,\" Taylor exclaims, mockingly excited. \"I can feel my heart pound in my chest,\" I joke in monotone as the lunch lady slaps a glob of mashed potatoes onto my tray.[Chapter 2] \"Hey,\" Duckie greets as he sits down a little while down the table from where I sit with Taylor. \"Hi,\" I reply with a slight smile. Taylor offers up a small wave as well, which Duckie returns. Instantly, he pulls out his Geometry text book. \"Grody,\" I comment. \"Why are you math-ing?\" \"Because we have a test,\" he reminds me, a slightly pained expression on his face as he continues to pour over the book. I frown. Based on what I've heard, Duckie never cared about doing well in the past. Teachers have made comments on his old work ethic before, and it sounds nothing like what I see. \"Right.\" I shake my head slightly and continue eating the greasy spaghetti (or at least I think it's spaghetti) the lunch lady served me. Another boy comes up and joins us. \"Hey,\" he says to Duckie, who smiles back briefly. He looks at me. \"I'm Chris.\" \"Arial,\" I reply, smiling at him. \"Nice to meet you,\" he says, smiling back. He looks at Duckie. \"Is Andie supposed to come home this weekend?\" Duckie's face falls noticeably, though it's still directed down at the textbook. \"No,\" he says. \"She can't make it.\" \"Who's Andie?\" I ask. \"My best friend,\" Duckie answers, looking up at me. \"She's in college now.\" \"And she was here with you last year?\" I clarify. He nods. \"Yeah.\" He turned his eyes back down to the book. \"I miss her.\" \"Aw.\" Taylor and I share somewhat of a sad glance. -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- \"I'm home,\" Duckie calls as he steps into his house. As per usual, there is no reply. There never is when he arrives home after school. \"Please, no pictures,\" he says sarcastically as he slings his bag down to the ground. Five steps later, he's in the kitchen. A step later, he's at the fridge. With a heavy sigh, Duckie realizes there's no food in the fridge. Why is he so surprised? They never have any food. Just booze hidden around the house. He shuts the fridge and turns for the living room where his bag still sat. The homework in it wouldn't finish itself. He sighs and drags his bag to his bedroom. In the back of Duckie's mind, a litte voice tells him to call Andie. She could definitely help him with it. But she was, of course, in college. He knows he can't just ride his bike to the Walsh house and prance around her bedroom any more. He frowns a little. He hasn't seen Andie in three weeks now. He misses her so much. But she was busy with Blane. Duckie frowns even more. That name still makes him mad. Who would ever name their kid Blane? Duckie looks at the History book in his lap. The second he sees \"Civil War\" he's bored. He groans and covers his face with his hands. He has to stay in school in order to get a good job. His mother barely makes enough money to support them as it is. Anything he can help with, he jumps on it. Even if it means trying in school to please his mom. -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- I roll over on Taylor's bed as I take a big bite of RedVine. \"I just don't see how you're having so much trouble with this.\" \"Because science is a bitch,\" is my friend's reply. I laugh and strain my neck a bit to see her work. \"Freckles are a dominant trait,\" I inform her, taking another RedVine-y chomp. \"Ooofff course they are,\" Taylor sighs, flipping her pencil over to erase her answer. \"Would that mean the kid has a hundred percent chance of being freckled?\" \"No,\" I say. She groans. \"See, the dad is heterozygous, so he has big-f little-f. The mom is recessive, so she has both little-f. So that means that in the right column, there's little-f little-f both times, so the kid has a fifty-fifty shot at freckles.\" Taylor turns slowly to stare at me. I blink. \"Give it here.\" I hold out my hands. \"Yippie!\" She slaps the textbook into my hands. \"I owe you, Air.\" \"Yeah ya do,\" I grumble, though I honestly don't mind. I love science. \"So,\" Taylor says as I work, \"I saw you talking to that tall, redhead guy earlier.\" \"David?\" I ask. \"I don't know. I wasn't the one talking to him.\" \"Touche.\" \"Isn't he a richie?\" I look up at her. \"A whatie?\" \"A richie. Did you guys not have richies in the arctic?\" \"Oh shush. My old home is a state away.\" \"Sure, sure.\" \"Anyway,\" I continue, \"a richie?\" \"Someone with a lot of money,\" Taylor clarifies. \"His family is really rich.\" \"Ohhh. Now the name makes sense. But I don't know if David's a richie. I didn't ask.\" \"Why were you two talking, then?\" she asks. \"Gosh, Mom, ease up. It's not like I'm pregnant. Yet.\" Taylor laughs and I go on. \"He just wanted to welcome me to the school, I guess.\" \"What makes you think that?\" \"Because he said 'Welcome to our school.'\" \"Oh. Yeah, I guess that's kinda a giveaway...\" I laugh and tap my pencil. \"What about that Chris guy?\" \"Chris Craddick?\" she asks. \"The one that sat with us at lunch.\" \"Oh, yeah, that's Chris Craddick. What about him?\" \"He was cute.\" I shrug. \"He got a girlfriend?\" \"I don't know,\" she says, \"I've never really talked to him. But you know what?\" \"Hm?\" I look at her. \"I know something that will solve all our problems.\" \"Do tell.\" \"Finish. My. Homework.\"[Chapter 3] I tap my pencil against my desk as Mr. Barkley drones on and on about the hypotenuse of a triangle. I don't care. Like, at all. About ten minutes after the first bell, Duckie stumbles into the classroom. Everyone turns to stare at him. \"Mr. Dale,\" Mr. Barkley greets him. \"You're late.\" \"Yes, I am,\" Duckie agrees. \"Thank you for noticing, sir.\" I hide a small snort of laughter behind my hand. \"Have a seat, Mr. Dale,\" Mr. Barkley says, gesturing to a seat beside me. Duckie moves over and sits at the desk. I smile at him and he nods back. \"As I was saying,\" Mr. Barkley continues. \"At the tip of a triangle you...\" I stop listening again. Duckie seems to be paying very close attention, though his expression is pained and slightly confused. It's easy to tell he's lost. A note lands on my desk. 'Tell me you understand this stuff.' I glance back at the sender to see David-the richie I had told Taylor about. I scribble back my reply. 'It'd be easier to shove a watermelon in my ear than understand any of this.' He smiles slightly at my reply and writes back. 'Damn. I was hoping you could help me.' 'If I could, I would. But if I tried, we would both be worse off.' 'Bummer.' I grin at him and crumple the note up in my fist. David has been friendly to me ever since we first started talking. And he keeps me company in History, which is nice. \"Hey.\" A wide kid nudges Duckie. \"Nice shirt. Do you think you're mom will notice you took it?\" Some of his friends chortle. \"Why would she?\" Duckie asks. \"It belongs to your girlfriend.\" I laugh aloud, covering my mouth with my hand quickly. But not before Mr. Barkley sends a glare in my direction. I smile politely back before tapping Duckie's foot with my own. \"Nice one,\" I congratulate. \"I know,\" he says coolly, as if proud of himself. I smile a bit. \"Yeah,\" the kid says, \"good one. I'm surprised you could string that many words together in the first place.\" \"Mr. Ryngould.\" Mr. Barkley slams the chalk down on the ledge of the board. \"Is there something you would like to share with the class?\" \"Uh, no,\" Ryngould says back. \"No, I'm fine.\" \"If you're sure...\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then can I go back to teaching my class now?\" Mr. Barkley questions. \"Yes, sir.\" He flushes slightly as one of his friends laughs at him. \"Nice job, Bruce.\" \"Shut up, dickwad,\" Bruce mumbles. -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- I flip through pages in The Old Man and the Sea. My mom keeps bugging me to read it. Honestly, I don't see what the hubbub about it is. Even the title bores me. Some old guy and an ocean. Woohoo? I hear a book slam shut from behind a shelf. It's swiftly followed by the crumpling of paper and an exasperated groan. I ignore it. I shove the book back onto the shelf. My fingers trail across the spines of books, not landing on anything specific. Finally, I grab a big book rumored to be scary. It's relativity new-called Pet Semetary. I flip through it for a moment before hearing another groan. The source of the noise grumbles under their breath. A moment later, after there's another groan, I walk around the shelf. I see Duckie. He's seated at a chair, science textbook open in front of him on a table. Crumpled papers sit around his work. \"Duckie?\" I say. He looks up. \"Oh, hey,\" he says. \"How ya' doin'?\" \"Peachy. And you?\" \"Been better,\" he replies. \"I'm so lost.\" \"What are you doing?\" I ask, walking to the table. Notes about traits, reproduction, and Punnett squares are scattered. \"This,\" he answers, holding his arms out to gesture to his work. \"I just don't get this.\" \"Heterozygous means you have two different genes,\" I tell him. \"Hm?\" He looks up at me. \"Heterozygous. Hetero means different, so it'd have to be different. So where it says that Warren is heterozygous for brown hair, he would have both a dominant and a recessive trait, but the recessive trait won't show. So it'd be big-b little-b for him.\" Duckie stares at me. \"You're good at this stuff?\" \"I'm great at this stuff,\" I correct him. Without taking his eyes off me, he kicks the chair beside him out. \"Please, mermaid. Join me.\" \"Well, if you insist.\" I sit and take one of his papers. \"What do you need help with?\" I ask as I scan his notes. \"Just about everything.\" \"That's my speciality,\" I say happily. He grins. \"Well, let's start with these.\" I gesture to the Punnett squares on the paper. \"What don't you get?\" \"It would be easier if you asked what I did get. That would take us less time.\" I laugh. \"Okay, well, an easy way to remember the difference between heterozygous and homozygous is by thinking of sexuality. Homosexuality means liking someone of the same gender, and homozygous traits are the same.\" \"So...\" He looks at the word problem. \"Karen is a homo?\" \"She's quite homo,\" I agree, glancing at the problem as well. \"Or her hair color is, at least.\" \"Warren will be pissed,\" Duckie comments. I laugh. \"Just a bit, yeah.\" I pause. \"I had a boyfriend named Warren once. I sneezed halfway through kissing him.\" I expect Duckie to make a sound of disgust, but instead, he bursts out laughing. \"It wasn't funny!\" I say, surprised at his reaction. \"He never spoke to me again!\" He only laughs harder. \"Duckie!\" \"No talking!\" Mrs. Opper, the old librarian, barks at us. Duckie stifles his laughter behind his hand. \"It wasn't funny!\" I protest, now in a whisper. \"The entire school called me Arifail for, like, a year!\" This little tidbit only makes Duckie laungh harder. \"Duckie!\" \"I-I'm sorry,\" he gasps. \"I-I'm really sorry. J-just...\" He shakes his head. \"Arifail.\" He laughs again. I fold my arms over my chest. \"You done?\" I he's finally finished laughing. \"Oh, come on, mermaid,\" says Duckie, \"that was hilarious.\" \"No it wasn't!\" I argue, only to have my hand smacked by a ruler. \"Whisper!\" Mrs. Opper hisses at me. \"Yes, ma'am,\" I mumble, holding my ruler-ed hand. She stalks away and return my glare to Duckie. \"Look, mermaid,\" Duckie says, \"if you can't laugh at yourself, it only hurts more when other people do.\" I let his words buzz around in my head for a moment. They make a surprising amount of sense. \"Yeah,\" I say, \"I guess you're right.\" Duckie grins. \"I usually am, Arifail.\" \"No.\" \"Okay, mermaid.\" I roll my eyes, but I smile slightly. -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- \"Hey,\" I call upon entering my house. \"Hey honey!\" Mom calls from the living room. \"Guess what I bought!\" \"A rocket?\" I ask sarcastically as I open the fridge. My mother laughs. \"Close! No, I bought a new lamp for your bathroom!\" \"That's cool,\" I say as I take a swig of Dr. Pepper. \"What happened during your day?\" she asks, walking into the kitchen. \"Oh, nothing big.\" I shrug. \"I got that new Stephen King book from the lib...\" I blink as I look at her. \"Are those my pants?\" \"Don't they look great?\" Mom asks, looking at her legs. \"I was doing your laundry and found them. I was thinking about wearing them on my date tonight.\" \"You got a date tonight?\" I ask stupidly. \"Yeah! His name is Cameron. He's got a little boy, about eight I think, and he's so cute! Cam's wife passed away when Mark was two years old. Tragedy, but hey all that means is-\" \"Look, Mom,\" I say with a small sigh, \"I would love to hear about Cam. Really. But I gotta go do my homework.\" \"Don't you usually do that in your free period?\" Mom questions. \"I was gonna,\" I reply, \"but I started helping this kid with some science.\" \"Hmm,\" Mom says. \"Yeah. I never got around to doing my own because Duckie also needed help with so-\" \"His name is Duckie?\" Mom repeats. \"Well,\" I say, slightly defensive now. I mean, she married a guy named Fischer. \"It's just a nickname. His real name is Phil, but everyone cal-\" \"That is so cute!\" Mom exclaims. I blink. \"Um...you think it's cute?\" \"I think it's precious!\" she says. \"What's he like?\" \"Well, um,\" I say, slightly flustered, \"he's pretty funny. Um, he-\" \"What does he look like?\" she continues. \"Um...well, he's got brown hair and, uh...he's pale-ish and his eyes are...\" I squint a little, trying to think of Duckie's eyes. \"His eyes are brown.\" \"Ohh, brown eyes,\" my mother coos. \"I love brown eyes!\" I stare at her blankly. \"I gotta meet this boy!\" \"Uh...\" I turn slowly. \"I'm gonna go do my Calculus...\" I walk to my bedroom, ignoring her call of 'Aww Air!' \"I'm supposed to be the one freaking out about high school boys,\" I say as I enter my room. -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.- \"Welcome to hell,\" Duckie greets as I sit in my Calculus class. I usually sit with the seat to my left empty, but he fills it today. \"I've got an all-expense pass,\" I reply. \"Did you, uh, finish last night's homework?\" he asks. \"Uh...sorta.\" I pull the worksheet from my bag. \"I did the first five or so before succumbing to doodles.\" \"Oh?\" Duckie looks at my paper. \"The turkey in the corner is awesome.\" \"That's Frodo Baggins,\" I say. \"You name your turkey doodles?\" he asks. \"No, it's a character in the book...never mind. It's obvious I can't draw.\" \"Hey, this lamp looks good!\" He gestures to a doodle by question thirteen. \"That's a tree.\" Duckie pauses. \"I hope you can write.\" I laugh as Mr. Barkley enters the classroom. \"Ah,\" he says, \"Mr. Dale. Nice of you to come in on time.\" \"My pleasure,\" Duckie replies. \"I appreciate the crowd you gathered for my arrival.\" He spread his arms out to gesture to all of the class. I grin. Mr. Barkley rolls his eyes. \"So,\" he begins, \"let's review your homework, shall we? Ms. Franklin, on number one did you...\" I begin to zone out and continue my doodles. After a few minutes, Duckie leans over to my desk and begins to add on. The small sun in the upper right corner now, thanks to him, has clouds around it. I add an umbrella floating across the sky. He adds a stick figure attached to it. We continue this until Mr. Barkley calls on me. I look up from what is now a dragon attacking a small village. \"Yessir?\" I ask. \"What did you get on number sixteen?\" he asks. \"Uh...\" I look at my paper. Sixteen had a pineapple beside it. \"I got, um...\" I look up. \"Four.\" The class sits in silence for a moment. \"Four?\" Mr. Barkley repeats. \"Yes.\" I nod. \"Would you like to tell the class how you got that answer?\" he continues. \"No.\" \"No?\" \"No.\" I shake my head. \"No, sir, that doesn't sound like something I would enjoy at all.\" Duckie snickers slightly as the class turns to stare at me. My cheeks redden. Mr. Barkley and I stare blankly at each other, neither breaking our gaze. \"Do it anyway,\" he finally says. \"I don't think it would be very beneficial to the class, Mr. Barkley,\" I reply. \"Are you trying to tell me you didn't do it, Ms. Dawson?\" \"Yes. I am.\" Mr. Barkley heaves a deep sigh and calls on David. I look at Duckie after a moment to see him smiling a bit. \"Nice one, Arifail,\" he comments. \"Sorry,\" he adds at seeing my expression, \"I'll use your real name. Mermaid.\" ","Summary":" I cross my arms, a frown spreading over my mouth for the fifth-fifth? One, two, three, four...yeah,"},{"Movie":"Collateral","Title":"Damage","Author":"Her House Of Cards","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4852058","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The moment just before sunrise is easily the most beautiful time of the day. At no point in the day is it any quieter, nor is there a time when the world feels quite so still. Still to the point where one must wonder if time truly has stopped and we are all caught in an eternal loop where the pre dawn hours are here to stay. The stars were nearly all but gone, fading into the dark back drop that remained night for the time being, already making way for the sun that was waiting for its turn in the sky. Yet then again, maybe time had stopped afterall, or at least just for the man that sat alone on the MTA, chin touching his chest. The train car jostled as it was pulled along the tracks, signs and lamp posts quickly going past the window behind him. The thought of purgatory crept into his slow working brain, the product of hallucinations brought on by blood loss and pain. Trapped in his dying body, forever riding in the subway car, alone, looked over and forgotten. That would be his afterlife. The blackness swept over his vision so quickly it caused the hallucinations to disappear just long enough for logic to rise to the surface. As quickly as he seemed to have lost it, his mind was back. Vincent's mind. And just like the poet Dylan Thomas, he would not go gentle into that good night. Not yet. Though his mind was there, death was still treading far too close for comfort. He blinked hard to fight back the darkness crawling into his vision. His lung was punctured and possibly even collapsed. He would die within hours without surgery of some sort, that is if unconsciousness from blood loss didn't take him out first. The slow movement of his hand to his belt was like moving a block of lead, controlling any of his digits became akin to brain surgery. But he could feel the small cellphone there, somewhere. Finally he'd corralled the metallic object into his lap and pressed speed dial. An emergency number he had only used once nearly five years ago. If the recipient of his phone call hadn't moved or changed his number there was a chance of survival. The voice on the other end came out in a quick bark with an odd lilt that could only belong to one person. Mustering up all his strength, Vincent lifted the phone as close as he could to his mouth. He could barely lift it past his chest. His tongue rolled around in his dry mouth a second before he found his voice. \"Vincent.\" He said into the receiver. The voice on the other end paused and began to shout somewhat angrily into the phone. His tired mind could barely comprehend the man's words. \"It's Vincent.\" He tried to shout back, instead it came out disheveled and with a few droplets of blood that now trickled out the corner of his mouth. \"I need help...\" As far as he could tell the voice now carried a worried tone, a sign that the man had remembered him afterall. Without caring about what the man had actually said, he continued. \"MTA. Next stop...\" His eyes blurred as he tried to make sense of the digital readout above the doors. \"Alameda Street...\" A few more droplets of blood spilled over his lips, hitting the phone. Another wave of darkness. Another attempt at blinking it away. \"Shot, in the chest...\" He said. The darkness crept into his vision again and this time there was no fighting it back. The next thing Vincent was aware of, was arms, three or four, picking him up and pulling him to his feet. His head fell back and his eyes attempted to open. All he could see was the dark sky and hints of red shooting through it. All was still and all was quiet. The most beautiful time of the day. \"Walk with me, Vincent. God damnit.\" The voice of the arms said, muttering under his breath. Desperately Vincent tried to do his best to make his feet obey, and walk along the asphalt. But his body no longer felt like his own. Now he was a victim. If the world truly was survival of the fittest, mother nature was trying her best to blot him out of existence. His mind worked in fragments. A moment ago he'd been half carried, have dragged across asphalt while the pre-dawn quiet fell around him. Now he was in the back seat of a car, laying across crumpled papers and fast food containers that smelled of mold. Lying on his back he watched the lampposts go by. One by one illuminating his body and the crimson that stained his front. Occasionally he heard police sirens and thought he saw the red tint of lights. He probably imagined the later. The gentle beat of drums followed by the unmistakable cry of a trumpet from Miles Davis whispering through the speakers made his vision clear for a moment, and forced him to once again find his voice. \"Turn the radio off.\" He said. The silhouette of the man at the wheel moved to look behind him. \"The radio isn't on, Vincent.\" Once again his awareness became spotty and before he knew it he felt himself being carved into while a mask of sorts pumped air into his body. Shouts soon followed and sleep claimed him like a heavy blanket. Then finally he awoke. His throat was dry and his mouth even drier. Vincent's tongue felt like sandpaper as it attempted to wet his lips. A few hard blinks and the cold, dark room came in clear. He was naked and covered with a stained sheet on a makeshift hospital bed. Tight bandages wrapped around his chest. Breathing too deep caused him to feel like his body was going to split in half, so he kept his breaths small and quick. \"I almost died didn't I?\" Vincent said to the man he sensed resting out of sight. \"Yes. You woke up twice during the surgery. \" The man's English accent was thick and tone matter of fact. \"You kept asking if you were dead or dying.\" Vincent could hear the man take a drag off a cigarette, and see a wisp of smoke float through the air as he exhaled. \"It's just like you to feel as if the world is ending when you don't have control of something.\" Vincent's eyes darted around, scanning the room. It was sparsely furnished, seeming more like a basement than anything. There was one light bulb hanging in the center of the ceiling. Being so close to it somehow made the walls ten times darker than they actually were. \"How long have I been asleep?\" \"A day and a half. And don't say I should've woke you. Trust me when I say you needed the rest.\" He moved, or so Vincent was willing to assume when he heard the sound of chair legs against the cement floor. The man slowly came into view, coming from behind and rounding the bed, ending up near his sheet covered legs. He was middle aged, older than Vincent by a handful of years though his hair was just now beginning to show flickers of gray around his ears. Thin wire glasses set perfectly on his sharp nose, giving him a rather distinguished look. It was the cigarette he brought up to his lips that ruined it. That and the fact that in place of his pinky and index finger were two small nubs. \"And recovery?\" Vincent asked. \"How long will that take?\" \"Oh by all means. Don't thank us.\" The man shot back. The word 'us' forced Vincent to turn his head and look past him, toward the half open door to see a young girl in scrubs sticking to the shadows. The single light in the room made the studs in her lips and ears shine. Vincent could barely make it out but he was willing to assume she had violet highlights running through her jet black hair. The last time he'd seen her, she'd been ten, child-like, and loud. Now she'd become a withdrawn teenager as well as her father's second hand. A hand he was in desperate need of these days. \"Thank you, Nigel. Constance.\" \"Its Stacey now.\" She said softly, not moving from the doorway. \"Just Stacey.\" \"Recovery. How long?\" He asked again. \"A good month.\" Nigel said in a rush of smoke. \"I've got some drugs for you to take the edge off the pain. Needle or pill. You can choose.\" \"Neither.\" He said testing the limits of his movements by rubbing the tiredness from his face with both hands. The pain nearly caused him to vomit but he hid it well. \"I don't want anything that'll fog my brain. I've been out of it for long enough.\" \"How long have you been in L.A.? Usually I keep my ear to the ground with these sorts of things. I figure I would've gotten word that you were in town.\" \"It was only a day. Was supposed to be in and out. Five jobs. Just like before. I guess its safe to say there was a kink in my plans. Only accomplished four.\" Nigel let his cigarette dangle from his thin lips and pulled the sheet down to Vincent's stomach. Constance, or Stacey as she was called now, shrunk back into whatever lie beyond the door. \"So you failed.\" He mumbled. The cigarette looked as if it could fall at any moment, skill or rather the over practice of a bad habit, kept it in place. He pressed on Vincent's chest and it took all of his control not bring his fist up and catch Nigel right in the throat. \"And who shot you?\" \"A cab driver.\" ","Summary":" The moment just before sunrise is easily the most beautiful time of the day.

His reverie was interrupted as a man came dashing into the back seat. \"Drive, now!\" Glancing in the rear-view mirror, Max froze as he saw a familiar face. \"Yeah, I know the drill,\" he replied mildly, trying to hide his fear. Vincent looked up, shocked, as Max pulled away, then went back to scouting the area, seeing if he was being followed. When they were on the highway, Vincent sat back and relaxed, stretching out. \"You know, I'm actually surprised.\" \"What, that I'm driving a limo?\" \"Yup. Didn't think you'd have it in you to buy one.\" Max paused. \"Well, truth be told, it's not mine. I'm just the driver.\" Vincent clenched his jaw and forced a smile, frustrated. \"I see. Well, I'm sure with technological advancements, the limos of the future will be able to function so a 90-year-old could drive them.\" \"Very funny,\" Max said brusquely. \"At least I have a dream and am working towards it.\" Vincent's body tensed. \"And I do what I do just for fun, is that what you're saying?\" \"Yeah, maybe!\" Max said, staring into the rear-view mirror. Vincent's eyes opened wide for a split second, incredulous, and then he went back to casually scouting around. \"Well, go on!\" Max said loudly, egging him on. \"I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you,\" Vincent replied sarcastically. Max frowned, not sure how to respond. He'd be surprised if he wasn't already on Vincent's hit list, being able to identify him. But he didn't want to broach the topic just yet. Vincent gave a sniff. \"And you and Annie? Anything came of that?\" \"Well, we saw each other for a while. But she was caught up in work, and meetings – she said she just wanted to be friends.\" \"Friends? What the hell is that?\" \"Yeah, I know, right? But what the lady wants, the lady gets. That's how I roll.\" \"See, that's why you're such a loser. Always going along with what other people tell you to do.\" Vincent made a 'tsk' sound. \"Now take me to the corner of 10th and 2nd.\" \"You expect me to do that after what you just said?!\" Vincent leaned forward. \"Don't worry, Max. Doing what an armed assailant wants you to do doesn't make you lose any more of your masculinity.\" Max gave a sniff. \"Well, not in the U.S., anyway.\" Vincent raised an eyebrow, but looked placated as he could see that Max would comply. \"So are you a clone or something?\" Max asked, looking in the rear-view mirror. Vincent chuckled. \"Where was the blood, Max? Wasn't exactly gushing out. But, of course, you'd only know that was a discrepancy if you had an internet connection and access to Wikipedia.\" \"Internet?\" Max asked, confused. Vincent's eyes snapped to his. \"Hey, I'm kidding,\" Max said, chuckling. Vincent looked angry, then pursed his lips and went back to looking at the view. \"My Ma knows how to use the internet, now,\" Max said almost mournfully. \"Every night I spend time on her laptop trying to get rid of viruses from her visiting gay porn sites. I keep telling her not to do that. And you know what? The nurses actually encourage it. Says it keeps her mind active .\" Vincent smirked, shaking his head. \"Your Ma. She's something else.\" Max took a deep breath, steeling himself to broach the topic. \"Hey. I wanted to thank you for not killing Annie. You liked to have a perfect record, right?\" Vincent grinned. \"I still have a perfect record. I killed the people who knew I didn't have a perfect record, at least, the ones who'd be in contact with any future clients of mine. It was easier.\" \"Easier, right,\" Max said, a bit disheartened at Vincent's coldness and unsure of where he now stood. \"Hey, Annie said it was an unrelated mob war.\" \"Pfft. You think the only way I can kill someone is a double-tap to the head and chest? Please.\" \"Well, thank you,\" Max said, pulling in to the destination. He'd never tried being grateful with Vincent. \"You're welcome,\" Vincent said, getting out. \"And thank you for not killing me .\" Vincent stopped walking, and stood still. Then he turned back and leaned through the window. \"What the hell are you going to do? Not brake if I'm crossing the street? I always look both ways when I cross the street, so I'm sure I'll be safe from you.\" Max raised an eyebrow bitterly, not liking the pressure, despite his position. \"Well, aren't you a good boy.\" \"Don't try me, Max.\" Vincent rolled his eyes and walked away. Max nodded slightly, and relaxed, knowing that Vincent really was sparing him. As long as he hadn't put a bomb in the fucking limo, that is.

I'll make it so that he thinks you're with me.\" A silent but grateful look on Annie's face said it all, and she took off sprinting. Max took off running in the other direction, pausing near a pillar. Vincent rushed into the station, and immediately saw him. Max waved his arms as if he were ushering someone out of view. Not fooled, Vincent scanned the area, and located Annie. Yet, to Max's surprise, Vincent took after him. \"Oh shit,\" he muttered as he changed tactics and boarded a train. To his dismay, Vincent leaped so far that he would put a professional ballet dancer to shame, and climbed on the back of the train. When they came to the first station, Max knew that Vincent was outside, aiming a gun at him. He wasn't smart enough, didn't have enough training, didn't believe in himself enough to think of a way out if he stayed on the train. May as well face the music. He stepped off onto the platform, not making any sudden movements. He was surprised that Vincent didn't immediately fire, knowing how efficient he was. Of course, the train left without any deviation from its existing schedule. If there was anyone else on the train, they pretended to not notice. The deafening roar of the train diminished quickly and suddenly, his sense of safety also decreasing, forcing him to face finality. Vincent strode closer, still aiming the gun at Max's head. \"So this is what happens to the good guys. You're not making a good case, here. I'm sure even Annie would agree.\" Max knew that Vincent could see through any act of his, so he didn't even try to talk his way out of it. But there was something niggling. \"Why'd you go after me, anyway?\" Vincent chuckled. \"I don't work for free. The club was under surveillance, and I doubt he'd be in any position to pay me. So that means I work for myself. And you're the only one who can identify me.\" He had a chilling grin, much like the time when he introduced himself in the cab. \"Which was your plan all along - to kill me,\" Max retorted, challenging him. There was no way he'd be manipulated into feeling like he'd stuffed up, and Vincent was out for revenge. \"Sure,\" Vincent replied mildly. \"But you think after all we've been through, I wouldn't just let you go?\" Max stared at him, eyes narrowing. Vincent was taunting him, calling to his soft side to try and find some humanity within him worth saving. Instinctively, Max sprinted for the side of the station and leapt over the railing, into air. He landed with an 'oof' on the roof of a building that was thankfully there, rolling and desperately trying to sprint over the side again, out of view. With a cry, he fell, clutching his knee as the sound of the gunshot reverberated in the neighbourhood. He slid to a stop a few centimetres from the edge. So close, and yet so far. He heard a thud as Vincent leapt down. Rolling to face him, Max levelled his gaze. \"Just shoot me and get it over with,\" he said through gritted teeth. He meant every word he said - he was going to die with some dignity, dammit. \"Now why would I kill you after I just saved your life?\" Vincent said, amused. There was something in his manner which still seemed predatory. Max's eyes squinted, then he rolled over slightly, peering over the edge to a ten storey drop to the street. It would have been an instant death, for sure. Still unconvinced that Vincent would spare him, he turned to face him again, a frown on his forehead. He'd bet his last dollar that Vincent simply wanted to savour the kill, as opposed to an impersonal ten-storey drop. \"See, getting to know someone before I kill them really is bad for what I do,\" Vincent said, putting his gun back behind his waist. He then bent down, his face very close to Max's. \"Prove to me that letting people live is the right thing,\" he whispered. There were so many unspoken threats evident in his words. Vincent then turned around and made his way back to a ladder leading to the platform. He paused. \"Then again, if people really are as apathetic as I've made them out to be, I have just killed you.\" He then disappeared out of sight. Max sighed, still in shock that he was allowed to live. For once, he genuinely doubted whether Vincent actually did something good, even though he couldn't fully commit to that conclusion. Eventually, someone noticed his yells AND rang 911 for help. -0- It had been a few months since the incident. Feeling hungry, he decided to get a good ol' American burger. Pulling over, he walked into the nearest McDonalds. The customer ahead of line was irate, spewing insults to the poor cashier. Max found himself going on a mental vacation, to his island in the sun. Only, at the moment, that island was occupied by Vincent. Had Vincent turned over a new leaf and shown some kindness? If so, he really was better off for meeting Max. But could Max say the same thing about himself? He'd been taught to show some spine during that fateful night, but did he really continue to display that courage these days? His attention came back to the present as the customer's voice raised in volume, continuing to complain about frivolous things and demanding a free meal. The cashier was humbly apologising, but did refuse to give a complimentary meal. ' Good for you, man – you stand up for yourself ,' Max thought, wondering if he should intervene. Delaying for a second longer, his decision was made for him as the irate customer stepped away and stormed out, hurling one final insult. Max decided he'd be extra polite to the cashier to make up for the dregs of humanity. Putting on a smile and raising his eyes to make contact, he froze. Before him was familiar short-cut grey hair, and cold, calculating blue eyes – all with a McDonald's uniform. Despite his fear, Max started to laugh. Vincent looked livid. He tried to collect himself. \"Shit, man, I'm sorry – it's just, I know what you want to do to these people.\" \"Really.\" Vincent sounded deadpan. \"Hey, man, I'm sorry,\" Max said soberly, trying to make up for his previous rude slip. \"You killed my career. What do you expect? Got to make a living somehow,\" Vincent said sarcastically. Max remained still, trying to ascertain the extent to which he was telling the truth. Vincent leaned forward, eyes intense. \"It's just an interim thing,\" he said in a low voice, all but echoing Max's previous words about building towards Island Limos . Max still looked wary. \"So did you get the girl?\" \"No. I couldn't do it just in case I was playing into some plan of yours.\" \"You fucking idiot.\" Now Max tried very hard to suss Vincent's intentions, considering Annie's safety was now a factor. Knowing he was out of his depth regarding psychological warfare, all he could do was stare at him. Vincent broke the silence. \"Anyway, you're affecting my efficiency.\" \"Oh… right. A big mac, please.\" \"And would you like fries with that?\" \"Yeah. A shitload.\" -0- Max sat at his humble breakfast table, staring at his bowl of cornflakes as they crackled into sogginess – yet another reminder that there was a time limit on all the good things in life. For some reason, he didn't call the police about the sighting. Perhaps it was because of his own safety, but perhaps it was also because he wanted to give Vincent a chance at turning over a new leaf. Then he read in the paper about a murder at McDonalds. Fuck. He jolted as there was a loud banging at the door. Opening it, he saw the police. \"Hello, Sir – the district attorney, Annie Farrell, has disappeared. We want to know if you have any information about her whereabouts.\" \"Er.. n-no… Sir.\" \"Well, if anything comes up, give us a call.\" The policeman gave him a business card, then walked away. Fuck. The phone rang. Max looked at it almost fearfully. \"Ma? Is that you?\" he sarcastically spat. \"Very funny,\" said Vincent. \"Meet me at the south-west airplane hangar at the abandoned airport in an hour.\" \"And why would I do that?\" \"If you ever wanted to know what I do in my free time, you'll come.\" Max remained frozen, hearing the dial tone. He knew too well to go against his wishes. -0- Walking in, he saw Annie tied to a chair and gagged. She looked terrified. \"What's this, Vincent? Dating advice?\" Max's words might have been interpreted as jovial, but his eyes were dead serious. \"May as well be,\" came the reply with a smirk. \"The early bird gets the worm, and she gets up nice and early.\" Something inside Max snapped. So far, Vincent had been acting professionally, but what he was insinuating was anything but. He strode towards Vincent, not flinching at all at his quick-draw, his signature pistol aimed straight at his head. He stopped one centimetre from touching Vincent's pointed gun. Vincent gave a sniff. \"OK, no funny business. You made me lose out on my paycheck before, so I'd like some compensation.\" \"I doubt that I could afford it,\" Max said. \"And if you're talking about taking my limo deposit, let me tell you that you can shove a limo up your ass.\" \"I know you can't afford it, Max,\" Vincent said, blinking quickly. \"But she can.\" He smiled. \"Letting people live really is the right thing.\" \"You know the United States doesn't bow to extortion. You really think that she'd cough up some of her personal money for a stranger?\" \"Maybe. Now that she knows you'd willingly put yourself in danger for her. The second time, too.\" \"Now, look here,\" Max said with a steel gaze. \"I've had enough of you playing around with me and anyone else in my life.\" Vincent's eyes showed slight surprise, but still had the cold and calculating look, knowing that Max was no real threat to him. Without wasting a beat, Max bent down and undid Annie's bonds, removing her gag. \"Come on,\" he said, putting an arm around her and helping her towards the exit. Normally, he'd be surprised that he made it out without being shot, but he was too angry to do so. -0- Max pulled over to the side, going on a mental vacation. Fortunately, it was much easier to do in his newly-rented limousine. He'd basically collapsed from shock a day later from what he pulled off. But it made him so much more grateful to be alive. The next day he'd asked Annie out for a date, and registered his limo business. The sound of the back door of the limo opening snapped him out of his reverie on an express to LA. \"Sir, we'd normally require a booking, but as it happens I'm free at the moment.\" \"I'm glad to hear it. I'd heard that your company is so fantastic that your clients never want to get out at their destination. I want to see if that's true – what you've learned.\" Max froze at the familiar voice. \"Yeah, well, one thing that I learned from you – this!\" He grabbed a shotgun that was under his front seat and aimed it at Vincent. \"You really do know how to make someone feel at home.\" Vincent stretched his legs out, put his hands behind his head and closed his eyes. \"But surely you aren't going to lose your dream over little ol' me? How are you going to explain all the blood? Vigilantism is still illegal.\" \"I'll just say that someone got their period.\" Vincent chuckled. \"Get me to LAX.\" Fuck. Well, it was one way of getting rid of him. And more legal. Putting the shotgun under the front seat, he pulled away. \"I gotta hand it to you, Max - you definitely look like you're from the hood a bit more. And you learned it all from little ol' me .\" Max's eyes narrowed at the prod – a white man teaching a black man to be from the hood? Even though he knew it was making him into a more-rounded person, he was still pissed. \"Hey – I can see you've changed, yourself. And you still make mistakes - that's why you don't get to know your armed attacker. Harder for them to get scared, you know.\" \"I'm not sure if you should consider the fact that I've let you live a mistake. Being a perfectionist, I really don't like to make mistakes.\" \"And I'm not sure if I should call you a softie or not.\" \"A softie ?\" Vincent opened his eyes and leaned forward. \" Really not hearing the gratitude,\" he added almost flippantly. \"Hey, I don't know you, man. But I do know that any kind of gratitude is bullshit. You take what you want from people, and you always will.\" \"Yes, I do,\" Vincent said, proudly, matter-of-factly. There was a silence. \"How about some music?\" Max murmured, flipping the switch. Both of them physically jolted as Taylor Swift blared loudly from the speakers. Despite everything they'd gone through, Max never saw a more deadly glare from Vincent. \"Sorry!\" he said, flicking it to some soft jazz. \"Passengers before were teens, and they like this shit.\" Vincent sat back, relaxing again. \"And did they want to leave?\" \"Let's just say that's another reason I carry around a shotgun.\" Vincent chuckled. The rest of the ride was spent in comfortable silence. Max pulled in an area where there wasn't much security. Vincent straightened his jacket. \"Here you go,\" he said, offering six crisp hundred-dollar bills. \"Nah, man – on the house,\" Max said, waving it away. Now outside, Vincent leaned through the window. \"Thanks – I owe you one.\" He turned and quickly strode into the airport. \"No, you fucking don't!\" Max yelled after him. Vincent briefly raised a hand in a wave as he walked away. Max just shook his head as he looked at Vincent's diminishing form. Then it struck him - the way he was carrying his briefcase reminded him of a heavy case full of cash. Fuck. -0- -0- A/N. (OK, if it's not clear, the implied ending is that Annie paid Vincent the amount he would have received, thus buying safety from Vincent for the both of them. But just because there was a clear financial motive doesn't mean that Vincent couldn't have another reason. And it would be smarter on his part to kill any witnesses, rather than bribe them. Thus, he was showing some almost brotherly affection. In my mind, anyway.) I fully believe that in the movie, Vincent intended to kill Max the entire time. Why? He didn't want to show his face to get the hits again, but he'd showed his face to Max. He'd told Max that he should give the girl a call, even though (I think) by then he knew that she was one of his target, therefore she'd be dead. That's cold. But these characters are so fantastic – I wanted to play around with them in an AU where that wouldn't be the case. You know it's a good film if you've read the Wikipedia synopsis AND you're still entranced when watching the film. ","Summary":" \"Go there!\" Max hisses. \"Run!

The lights came back on. Max unclenched his eyes. To his surprise, he could feel no bullet wound. He could still see Vincent, bleeding from his jaw, still holding his weapon and keeping it trained at Max. Max tensed, expecting Vincent to pull some surprise move. Vincent ejected the magazine out of the stolen guard's pistol and reached in his back pocket for a replacement. It wasn't until his empty hand reached the pistol grip when he realized that, for once, there was no reloading. He looked furious, as Max could observe. He glanced down on the ground, looking contemplative, looked back at Max through the shattered glass, and sat down on the metro seat. Max eased his way into Vincent's compartment, keeping his weapon trained on the eerily calm killer, barely noticing that his own gun was also empty. Max carefully sat down on the seat facing Vincent. His beating heart skidded down to its normal routine, as the adrenaline supply to his body slowly ceased. It was then that Max finally realized he could put his gun down. Vincent showed no signs of posing a threat; he simply sat there calmly, though it was not the same type of calm he had previously shown throughout the evening. Instead, Vincent was looking at the ground, apparently as surprised as Max was at the turn of events, trying to figure out what had happened. Vincent pulled open the right side of his jacket to reveal the unmistakable stain of blood. His face betrayed his irritation at what had happened. There was no question that Max, an everyday Joe, had succeeded in this duel where Vincent, an expert killer, had failed. It should have been different. Max should have been on the floor with a bullet in his head, just like the jazz man and the man in the club. And yet, here they were, just two men sitting on the metro facing each other, as though it were just another ride, just another night. Annie cautiously came in and slowly sat down next to Max. She never took her eyes off of Vincent, the man who had very nearly murdered her twice, once in her office and then again on the train. Vincent looked as though he were struggling to understand how this had happened. He broke into a smile and quietly laughed. \"We've had one hell of a night, haven't we, Max?\" Max didn't say anything. Instead, he just gave Vincent a strange look. This man was bleeding from his jaw and gut, sitting facing both the man who shot him and his intended target, and he was laughing it off. \"Don't…don't worry about that hit. We're almost to the…the next stop,\" Max replied, still a little breathless from the exchange. Vincent laughed again, wincing in the process. \"This? Ah, I've had worse.\" He glanced at Annie, then turned back to Max. \"Wow, she's even more gorgeous than her picture.\" Annie paled. Max still said nothing. Then, with a pained expression, Vincent reached into his jacket and retrieved a small roll of bills. Smiling, he tossed into Max's lap. \"Here's the rest of what I owe you. Take her somewhere nice, show her a good time.\" Max looked up and almost gave him a questioning look. Vincent nodded to him. \"Remember what I said, life's too short.\" Max nodded back uneasily. Vincent paused, looking down, and then glanced back up at Max. That charming smile of his was gone. He had deflected the reality of the situation as much as he could. Now, however, the bullet in his gut, and indeed his own mortality, were both starting to weigh on him. \"Got a question for you, Max. Answer me truthfully.\" He paused, either because he was afraid of the answer, or it was getting harder to speak. \"A man gets on the MTA, dies.\" He paused again. \"Think anyone will notice?\" Max almost felt shocked by the weight of the question. He knew what Max was really asking. He silently nodded. Then, with an appreciative smile, Vincent dropped his head over his chest, and died. Max sat back and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He felt so many conflicting emotions right now that he wasn't even sure what to say or feel. Annie, on the other hand, kept a wary eye on Vincent. The train rumbled to a stop at the present station. Max stood up and gently brought Annie to her feet, trying to keep his eyes away from the opposite seat as he guided her out of the train and slid his hoodie over her frail frame. Then, as an afterthought he turned back to Vincent's still form. The one man who, in one night, had forced Max to confront the shadows of his own soul, just as Max had done to him. Now, just as he had appeared in Max's life, he was gone. Max realized he was still staring as the doors closed. He started to guide Annie to the curbside to hail a taxi. He tried to ignore the irony in this. He turned and looked back one last time at the man in the box. \"See you around, man.\" ","Summary":" I do not own the rights to the movie \"Collateral\".

The next stop would notrnbe for another fifteen minutes, far to long for him to avoid Vincent.rnThe lights flickered, then came back to normal power. \"Max!\" Vincentrnroared from the other compartment. \"I do this for a living!\" Max pushed Annie tornthe side, stepped out to the middle of the cab, and raised his stolenrnH&K; .45. Vincent did the same, aiming, prepared to kill. The lights flickered. BLAM! BLAM!rnBLAM!BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! The noise was deafening. Max'srnears were ringing loudly, Annie was sitting on the ground, with herrnhands on her ears. Max recoiled as thernlights came back to full power. There were three bullet holes in therndoor in front of him, and the glass panels. The slide on the H&K; handgun was lockedrnback, meaning the gun was empty. He looked through the broken glassrnin the door. Vincent was bent over, coughing. Max gingerly opened therndoor and stepped through, pointing the empty gun at the hitman.rnVincent wheezed a little more and sat down. Max did the same. Vincentrnmoved his suit jacket aside. There was a black bullet hole inrnVincent's white shirt. He was having obvious trouble breathing.rnAnnie walked in and took a seat next to Max. \"We're almost tornthe next stop.\" Max said quietly. Max suddenly felt sorry for thernman, despite that he had tried to kill him a moment earlier. Vincentrncoughed a few more times. He slowly unbuttoned three buttons on hisrnshirt and looked under the cloth. There was no blood. Vincent rappedrnhis knuckle against the hard white material under his shirt. Then itrnhit Max what it was. A concealed bullet-proof vest. He had seen themrna few times before. Alarm shot through Max, eradicating the pity hernhad been feeling a moment ago. Vincent stood, rubbingrnhis chest, ignoring the blood that was still oozing down the side ofrnhis head. \"No, I'm fine, thanks for the concern. Just wasn'trnsure for a moment if the round penetrated the vest, though.\" Hernglanced at Max's shocked face. \"I'd think of all people, you'drnunderstand planning ahead, Max.\" He stepped a few feet back, andrnraised his handgun, which, unlike Max's, was loaded. Annie criedrnout in terror. \"It does surprise mernthough.\" Vincent said. \"You drive a cab for twelve years, then onernday you're suddenly willing to die to save a girl you met a fewrnhours earlier.\" \"Wait!\" Max said.rn\"Can't you just let her go? Four out of five, you did eightyrnpercent of the contract! You killed all the witnesses, how could theyrnindite those people?\" \"Give me one goodrnreason why I should let her go.\" Vincent said coldly, now aimingrnthe pistol at Max. Max had no doubt that if he failed to answer,rnVincent would kill them both. His pulse started racing again, and hernfelt slightly dizzy, just like when Vincent had killed the jazzrnplayer in the club, killed the man after sitting down and having arndrink with him. \"Because… you'rernthat coyote we saw on the road. Roaming around a concrete junglernfilled with people you can't understand, killing for food andrnpleasure, acting completely without a conscious.\" Max said. He wasrnprobably going do die anyway, so he might as well say whatever hernfelt like saying. \"You've lost the very human traits ofrncompassion and remorse and in the end you've turned into nothingrnmore than an intelligent animal.\" Vincent didn't movernfor a few moments, repeating what Max had said in his mind, aboutrnthose coyotes that crossed the road on the way to Club Fever. He hadrnbeen surprised, really, that Max had bothered to stop for the animalsrnand had not just kept driving... Max stared at Vincent,rndefiant. He wasn't afraid anymore. The train rumbled to a halt, and therndoors slid open. Vincent calmly put the pistol in his holster andrnexited the train, without looking back. A minute later and he wasrngone from sight. The doors slid shut and the train rumbled on as thernlight of dawn started to brighten the train. Two and a half years later… A well-dressed manrnpaused outside a business office, glancing up at the sign. IslandrnLimousines , the building said.

He walked past a line of rooms, and stopped outsidernthe door marked Island Limosines' President/Owner Max Durocher Maxrnopened the door, putting a small suitcase down on a chair, andrnflipping through the mail on his desk. Next to the computer was arnpicture of him and Annie in a church, both grinning hugely andrnshowing off rings to the photographer.

I realize the part where Vincent lets Max and Annie go may not have been totally in line with Collateral, but I felt since the ending was so sad I needed to write a cheerier alternate ending.

I don't own Collateral. Henwas just sitting there, just staring at a business card. Vincentncleared his throat and leaned toward the yellow cabs window. \"Hello?\" ThenAfrican American man glanced back ward adjusting his glasses.\"Uh,nyeah... \" \"Let'sngo to... \" The man wasn't paying attention, Vincent bobbed hisnhead,\" You free? Or... \" Thenman didn't reply, Vincent tightened his hold on his briefcase andnheaded to a cab that was pulling up to the curb. If that man was toonbusy for Vincent he didn't honestly care. All he needed was a taxinand the driver to go with it. As soon as he finished the job thensooner he was out of L.A. The cabbie called him back. \"Yeah,nyeah, sorry... \"Vincent took a step backward and climbed into thencab. If this man proved to be as inattentive as before for thenduration of Vincent's stay he would have to get a new cab. Hendidn't appreciate mindless, incompetent workmanship in any aspectnof the modern work force. \"Where to?\" Vincentnrelayed the memorized street like a small child recited their homenaddress. As soon as he uttered the street it could be oblitered innhis mind as useless information. He had a one time appointment at thenplace. \"452 South Union Street. \" Henhad several hits, asking more himself then the cabbie he said outnloud,\" How long you think this'll take?\" Checking his watchnVincent was startled to receive a reply. \"Fourteennminutes. \" Wow, that was rather precise. AmusednVincent asked,\" Fourteen? Not fifteen? Not thirteen?\" Thenman shook his head as he turned a corner, \"Two minutes to get ontonthe 101. Transition to the 110 to the 10 and exit on Normandie isnfour minutes. North on Normandie is five minutes. Two minutes tonSouth Union 'cause there's roadwork. Thirteen plus one for \"shitnhappens.\" Vincentnchecked his watch again, he'd pegged this man down as somethingnelse entirely but perhaps he'd been wrong,\" Mind if I time you?\" Thencabbie shrugged nonchalant, and Vincent pushed his luck,\" What do Inget if you're wrong? A free ride? \" Thenman grew stiff as he headed onto a ramp. Vincent had a feeling thenman could navigate his way in L.A. with his eyes closed. At last thencabbie uttered,\" An apology...I already offered up the free ridentoday. \" Anwoman perhaps, what he wasn't attractive enough? Vincent asked,\"nTo whom?\" \"...some girl.\" Bingo, causally Vincentnreplied,\" Did you ask her out?\" Thenman's pained expression in the rear view mirror said it all. No hendidn't. Vincent's mind flashed back to the business card, thatnwoman, she must have been a full fledged professional business woman,nway above a mere cabbie. Vincent's gaze didn't soften as thencabbie stuffed the card under a rubber band on the visor. Asnthe cabbie drove out to downtown the man changed the subject as hendrove, \"First time in LA? \" Vincentnshook his head, \"No. To tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can'tnwait to leave. Too sprawled-out. Disconnected. You know...? Butnthat's me. You like it here? \"He added. \"Itsnhome,\" The man replied. \"17nmillion people. This was a country; it would be the fifth biggestneconomy in the world. But nobody knows each other. Too impersonal.nBut that's just me...you know... I read about this guy. Gets on thenMTA, here, and dies. Six hours he's riding the subway before anybodynnotices. This corpse doing laps around LA, people on and off, sittingnnext to him, nobody notices. \" Vincentnpaused after his little speech. Maybe he disliked L.A. because itnreminded him forcefully of the negative aspects of his work; he knewnso few people and those he did know could care less about him. L.A.nonly made Vincent discern this even more then ever. Thenman didn't seem to know what to say, \"I see your point. Yeah... \" Sensingnhe'd made the man uncomfortable Vincent chose to change thensubject. Glancing around he asked,\" Cleanest cab I've ever been in.nYour regular ride? \" \"Yeah.nI share it with the dayshift guy.\" The driver said tonelessly. Vincentnglanced out at the L.A. night, so different from the day; it createdna whole new world. \"Prefer nights? \" Noddingnthe man said,\" People are more relaxed, you know? Less stress, lessntraffic, better tips. \" Itnfelt like he was at a company party or something, \"You getnbenefits? \" Puzzled the driver said,\"Like sick leave?\" \"Retirement?nHealth and welfare?\" \"It'snnot that kind of job. \" Halfnjoking half serious Vincent said,\" Start a union. \" The drivernseemed like an able man. \"Me,nspecifically?\" \"Why not?\" \"Lastnthing I need is a reason to keep driving a cab. It's temporary. I'm nfillin' in, you know, while this other thing I'm putting togethernis shaping up... \" Sensingna lie Vincent dug a little further,\" How long you been driving? \" \"Twelvenyears.\" Did putting things together encompass the nerve to actuallyngo off and start his own little thing? Eh, Vincent wouldn't benhaving this cabbie for much longer so it didn't matter. \"Hardlyntemporary... \"He said dryly,\" Really? What else are you puttingntogether? \" Thenman hesitated,\" I don't talk about it. No offense, but... \" Vincentnsmiled, at this point he didn't honestly care,\" None taken.nTalkers and doers. Like you, I like doers. \" Theynwere pulling up to South Union Street apartments. It was a rundownnpart of L.A., partially deserted and quiet. Various lights and thendarkness combined to change the whole atmosphere. Time to get down tonhis job. Closing his briefcase Vincent checked his watch. \"Fourteennminutes. Man, you're good... \"The man had been exactly right.nPrecise, he liked that. If he could keep this cabbie for the night itnwould make things a whole lot smoother. Thenman pretended modesty. \"Lucky with the lights.\" GrinningnVincent said,\"Yeah, sure. You probably know the light schedules,ntoo.\" Henhad to do this right or the cabbie would be too noble to accept.n\"Listen...I'm in town on a real estate deal. A closing. One night.nI got five stops to make, collect signatures. See some friends. ThennI got a six a.m. out of LAX. Why don't you hang with me for thennight...? \" Yeahnthe man had standards,\" I'm not a hire car. It's against regs...\" Vincentnscoffed. Pulling out his wallet he said,\" Regulations? These guysndon't pay you sick leave. How much you pull down a shift?\" Thenman glanced away and uttered,\" Two-fifty, four hundred. \" \"I'llnmake it six hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX and Indon't have to run for the plane.\" Vincentndrew several crisp hundred dollar bills from his briefcase. Fanningnthem in the air like a magic trick he watched Max's expression. Whoncould resist crisp money? Besides Vincent thought, it was the middlenof the night no one would honestly care what the cabbie did in thisnworld of darkness. \"...takena chance.\" Thenman hesitated again,\" Man, I don't know.\" That was nonsense heneither said yes or no and far as Vincent was concerned he'd as goodnas said yes. \"Yes, you do.\" Thoughtsnparaded across the cabbie's face, finally he succumb. \"Yeah.nOkay.\" GrinningnVincent offered his hand. They shook hands firmly. \"Cool. We got andeal. Here's three hundred down. What's your name?\" \"Max.\" Vincentnsaid it out loud; it was a memory trick to make it easier to rememberna name, \"Max? I'm Vincent.\" Climbing out of the cab Vincent wasnsurprised when Max called after him. \"I can't double park here... \" Oh,nthat. \"I'll meet you in the alley behind the building.\" Walkingnsteadily to the building foyer Vincent glanced around at the sadnpathetic existence the people that lived there led. Really, they hadnno purpose no true drive; they just lived on the day to day. Theyndidn't even know each other. Of course it was L.A. SlowlynVincent ascended the stairs, the view of palm trees and downtown L.A.nrising into view with each step he took. Here Vincent was the bringernof death in the black night lined with artificial light. Thenman had known what Vincent had come for the moment he opened thendoor. And for some odd reason he'd stumbled to the back of thenapartment. When Vincent shot him the man fell clean out the window. Itnhad been easy enough. Heading back out Vincent suddenly realized thatnthe cabbie Max had parked out back. Entering the alley way he knew henhad only choice… Stoppingndead in his tracks Vincent assessed the situation. The man had fallenndirectly on the car; consequently Max was standing outside the cabnlooking mortified. His gaze turned to Max and it was clear he fearednthat Vincent thought he'd killed the man. But that was nonsense mannhad fallen on top of the cab. \"en- He fell on my cab...!\" Max yelled pointing at the body on hisncab. Vincentnremained where he was. \"You always stutter?\" Thenman seemed puzzled by his honest question, once again pointing henexclaimed,\" Well, yeah. Yeah. Guy fell on my mother fucking cabnfrom up there...! \" Vincentndidn't look at the body but continued to watch Max his thoughts inna whirlwind. \"I think he's dead. \" Almostnmuttering Vincent said,\" two .45s and did a high dive onto hisnhead. It's a good guess.\" Maxnreturned Vincent's stare while Vincent tried to make a decision.nFirstly he needed to clean the body up; it would be a shame to havento kill Max. The man was so professional and assiduous, much likenhimself. Perhaps he could talk some sense into the man. \"Youn- you killed him?\" Max asked at long last. Vincentnraised his eyebrows,\" I shot him. The bullets and the fall killednhim.\" Everythingnpaused a beat, so Max had finally figured it out. A look of terrorncame across Max's features as he began to comprehend what wasnhappening. Backing away Vincent pulled out his 5 H+K \"Red-light-green-light? Light's red.\" Vincent said as Maxnfroze. \"You can run, but you'll die tired.\" Max nodded and raisednhis hands into the air. Vincent resisted the urge to roll his eyes,n\"Put down your hands. Are you cool? Say \"I am cool.\" \"Younare cool.\" Vincent shook his head.\" No. You say you arencool.\" He seemed puzzled by this but he said it anyway,\"Inam...I'm cool.\" Vincent made his decision, placing his gun back innhis pants waist he said,\" Okay. Help me out here\" \"Withnwhat?\" Vincentngestured to the body with a sweep of his hand. Approaching the car henspoke to Max,\" El gordo decided to get some air and not take thenstairs. So we go to plan B. Pop the trunk. \" Maxnwas still looking blank.\" My trunk?\" Wasnit not self evident?\" I can't leave him here. So unless you wantnhim riding up front with you...and given the hygiene...and hisnsphincters let go... \"Vincent said with a sniff. Max popped thentrunk and circled to the front of the car. In one swoop Vincentngrabbed the corpse by his bathrobe lapels and heaved the body into ansitting position.\"Gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift withnyour legs... \" Maxnwas looking sick. He made a shaky move to the car. Vincent waited fornhim. \"I don't think I can do this.\" \"He'snonly a dead guy. On three. Uno. Dos. Three.\" Rolling the corpsenoff the hood Vincent took hold of the legs. Max with a grimace andngroan took a firm hold on the arms. \"Got it?\" Maxnseemed replussed,\"Yeah.\" With slow progression they moved to thentrunk. Vincent was beginning to think Max was taking this better thennhe thought when Max let out a yelp and dropped his end.\" What?\"nDemanded Vincent. Replied Max,\"His hand moved! His goddamn handntwitched!\" Thatnwas it?\" It's a spasm! Jesus, don't be such a girl... \" Havingndumped the body within the trunk each man paused to catch theirnbreath. Looking down into the interior Vincent asked,\" Never heardnof a treadmill? \"Shutting the trunk he took to using Max's waternbottle to clean off the top of the hood. Max remained frozen where henstood. Vincentncontinued to mutter to himself,\" Six liters of blood in the averagenAngeleno, he's gotta dump all his...on your cab.\" With one lastndousing he was satisified,\"Okay, that's good enough.\" Vincentnheaded to climb back into the cab then noticed Max was still justnstanding there. \"Uh, look...why don't you, like, take the cab... \" SlowlynVincent said,\"Take the cab...\" Maxngrew a little more confident. \"Yeah. I - I'll chill. You know.nAnd...they don't check. You know? They don't. They don't know who'sndriving these things. You, me...\" Vincentntilted his head to the side and pretended to accept Max's offer,\"nAnd you promise you will never tell anybody? Right?\" Maxnnodded his head vehemently but Vincent wasn't amused,\" get in thenfucking car.\" Theynwould have to stick together. Besides Vincent was impressed with Max.nThe man could handle himself but he was also docile enough fornVincent to handle them. Vincent needed a good cabbie who he couldncontrol, Max was it.

Please don't flame me! From Ida (Max's mother)'s point of view. Contemplation of Vincent and her son. Not slash. However, if you feel the need. Take it however you want. Since he was little I'd always known Max would be different. He was quieter -less confident- then his brothers. A mother always knows. I admit I probably didn't give him enough attention until all his brothers were gone. By then he'd already become who he is. Shy, insecure, indecisive. Though I'd never admit it to anyone else (what mother would?) Max had never had any real nerve. He always let other kids bully him around, steal his stuff, all that. But he's a good son. The only one who comes and visits me every night. I suppose my other sons are too busy with their families. Max needed a family. No matter how much I like the company I'd like it ten times better if Max finally commited. The last time he had seen me he was real nervous. I ignored it, thinking it was nothing. I was more interested in the stranger he brought with him. Max had never brought anyone in with him before. I could tell Max didn't like him being here. He was a strange man. Yet I felt as if he was just a child who needed love. He seemed needy to me. I felt like slapping Max upside the head for not noticing but then again, he's never been able to pick up things like that quickly. He could take years if you let him. The man - who's name is Vincent (I can't remember if he introduced himself that night or if I'm just remembering his name from the news) - was proper at best. I felt he was kind of taunting Max. As I said, he reminded me of a needy child. I wasn't really sure at first what Vincent and Max's relationship was. To be truthful, I'm not even sure now. When I first saw the news cast I was scared. The police had at first suspected Max until a nice lady name Annie saved him. I kind of wish Max had ended up with her. I suppose Vincent needed him more. Vincent's body hadn't been found. Two days after the investigations Max had disappeared. I had known - as only a mother does. I hadn't informed the police until later that week. Just tonight my worry finally stopped when Max called me. I was happy, I was beginning to think I'd made a mistake when I let him go. He'd told me he was Mark - his older brother. We both knew it was him but I played along. Mark was somewhere in Mexico on vacation with his wife. I discreetly asked if he was still in Mexico. I could practically hear Max's grin as he realized I understood. I asked him about his 'wife' Camilla. He answered that 'Camilla' was fine and doing well. He didn't exactly give me any details. He also mentioned that he and 'Camilla' were working out some problems in their relationship and that they were becoming better friends. And by that I knew he meant that they had developed a weird sort of understanding. The closest Vincent could get to friendship at present - based on my impression of him. I had asked him about Ann (One of Mark's girlfriends from highschool). Of course meaning Annie. I asked if he regretted leaving her. He had answered that someone else had needed him more. Besides they were still good friends and she would still be there if he ever got back (I got the feeling he was saying that just to please me. We both knew that there was no going back). With a final goodbye the call had ended. I knew Max had changed. I could practically feel the confidence and decisiveness in his voice. That was a big change. I started to cry. Before I could start into a real fit my phone rang again. It was another call from 'Mark'. An awkward voice broke the silence. \"uh...Hey, I justed wanted to let you know that I'll call you sometime soon, 'kay? Love ya Mom.\" Click. And I was proud. ","Summary":" AN: OOC and kinda sucky.

This is the first time I have dared enter the world of Collateral so I would appreciate any and all feedback I receive. Disclaimer : I own nothing- although I wish I could hire Vincent… -chuckles wickedly- Summary : A murder on the MTA… Rating : PG- there's a little blood in there; not half so much as my other stories though. Red Light Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! BANG! The unceasing sound of gunshots exploded in his ears, throbbing, aching, in one long hollow sound that made his head hurt as he squeezed his eyes shut tight. He felt only the painful recoil of the weapon in his hands as his finger flexed again and again and again until a hollow click revealed that he had no more bullets in the chamber. Max slowly opened his eyes with his ears ringing as the lights flickered on overhead. The gun still felt hot under his fingers. He slowly lowered it, trying not to start- and failing- as he saw Vincent staring at him through the shattered glass of the metro's sliding door. The Heckler Koch was still aimed at his head but Max only watched numbly as an empty magazine clattered to the rubberized floor and slowly Vincent withdrew another from within his coat pocket but it slipped from his fingers, sliding harmlessly to the floor, and bouncing thrice ere it settled. The assassin did not bend to pick it up. Instead, he glanced around as though disoriented, a crease of irritation marring his smooth brow, and after a moment, disappeared from view. Slowly, cautiously, Max, with gun still raised, stepped over the dividing area between the two cars, his worn shoes crunching on shards of glass. When his shoulder brushed past the sliding door, he stopped, gun still poised, still ready, knowing that even a lax snake could strike without warning. Aside from the patch of blood steadily spreading over the pristine white of his shirt, Max would have thought him merely resting his tired feet after all that running. Vincent's face was still cut from when Max had crashed the cab which was a miracle that they had walked away from. Dried blood clung to the side of his face too where the cab driver's bullet had hit him. Max still remembered the rage that had coursed through his veins at that moment when he had seen that man poised over Annie, a gun to her head. He had lost control then. Now, he was not so sure. Now he was just afraid and had reacted out of pure instinct- survival and self-preservation. He had adapted to the change in the environment and come out on top. Finding that his legs would no longer hold him, Max sank onto the hard plastic chair opposite. His heart still pounded under his ribcage like a jackhammer and he could just see Annie's ashen face peering at him from the metro doorway. Even now a small part of him wanted to finish the job, to put one more bullet in that wretched man's sternum and another in his head- as he had to so many people that night. But the rest of him recoiled, screamed, all of his mother's lessons of morality and the sacredness of human life resounding in his head. His stomach was in knots. The gun twitched and lowered. Finding that the spiraling of his heinous thoughts was quickly becoming overwhelming, and the silence suddenly oppressive, he cleared his parched throat as he felt cold sweat slide down his back. \"We're almost there if-\" If what? If you needed help? Is that whathe wanted to say? Did he want to help this man? The one that had managed to rip his life apart in a sum of ten hours…? 'I like to think of myself as a friend…' That's what he had said at the hospital. Is that what he wanted to be? A friend to this madman who had spent the better part of the last few hours trying to kill them? Max didn't know whether to curse Vincent or thank him- so much of his life and way of thinking had changed this night. He hoped for the better. Vincent just looked at him with those flat, black eyes. Those eyes reminded Max of the coyotes they had seen on the highway in Koreatown. Emotionless. Predatory. An empty gaze, though wary- those eyes that missed nothing. A killer's eyes. For a brief moment, Max wondered what he was thinking. What was he feeling at this very instant in time? Did he still feel as though life didn't matter now that it was being taken away from him by the trickle and drop? Did he regret his life and what he had made of it? The choices… or lack thereof… that he had or hadn't made? 'You don't know what anyone else is thinking.' Max remembered the ugly look Vincent had given him when he had said that and the taxi driver knew he had struck a nerve in the cold heart of the villain. Vincent had given him a sharp witticism to cover the turmoil up- even Max saw that through his review mirror. It had been a deplorable evasion to cover up the truth You're low, my brother. Way low. Vincent had looked askance at him, shocked, hurt maybe- it was difficult to tell with his frosty implacable countenance. The words he had shot right back at the cab driver, full of bitter anger and venom had cut him to the core- scared him too as he realized that the assassin was right. All of his dreams had gone up in smoke that night: too little, too late. Unrealized. Unfulfilled. An irreparable breach had been torn in his heart to which he had been blinded until this man came along. All of the missed opportunities that he had never taken advantage of as he squandered twelve years of his life waiting for something that would never happen unless he took the initiative. Everything couldn't be perfect- as this night had undeniably proved. He didn't feel his aching muscles, his pounding head, the stinging pain where shards of glass from his shattered cab's windows had torn into the flesh of his palms and arms. All there was, was this moment. The sleek silver fox glanced down at his blood-soaked shirt and briefly closed his eyes, at last seeming to feel the pain of his wound. The Heckler Koch lay across his lap, empty. His breathing light, strained. Max could only listen, letting his own gun drop from his nerveless fingers. In and out. In and out. You still breathing? Vincent's voice echoed in his head as those dark eyes looked up into his. Vincent's soft voice recalled his attention, neither weak with pain nor strained as he would have thought but soft, almost faint though with a touch of the dry humor that Max had come to know so wellin the last eight hours. \"Max. A guy gets on the MTA here in L.A, dies…\" he paused, his gaze unfocusing slightly as he struggled for breath for a moment. At last, his eyes returned to Max's. \"Do you think anybody'll notice?\" Vincent asked softly with a slight incline of his head. Max knew what he was really asking, almost pleading. Will anyone remember me? Did I matter? Will someone one day remark that I, Vincent, was here? Max only nodded, somehow wanting to reassure him though he knew not why. His heart tugged with sadness for this man- killer though he was; it was only a small facet in a myriad diamond. So much had happened tonight and somehow he felt that despite the danger, the threats, the pain, he had been given a chance and faced his problems head on where before he had simply avoided them. This man had helped him see that dark corner of himself that he had pushed aside. Max watched as slowly, the elegant head sank onto his breast and Vincent's eyes closed. The gun slid from his lap to clatter upon the floor. Max took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes, wiping away the stinging tears that threatened to fall. \"Do-do we leave him here?\" Annie asked quietly, the merest quaver in her voice as she looked at the cooling cadaver with some distaste. \"Unless you want to take him with you,\" Max replied, unconsciously echoing Vincent's earlier words. In his own perverse way , Max thought, Vincent might have liked to stay here-like this- bloody and cold . Then he certainly would be noticed, remembered. Nothing had changed really for him- he had been dead for a long time before this night. Max felt the slight near-imperceptible jerk as the MTA slowed and glided smoothly to a stop. The doors whooshed open and Max jumped up, not wanting to linger in this suddenly horrific place of death. He knew he would read about this night in the papers a few days from now and it would seem so unreal, so distant. Like a bad dream. He dumped his own gun into the nearest trash bin, wishing he could wash his hands. Wrapping his arms around Annie's small shoulders, he half-supported her and himself out of the subway. She hugged herself tightly, chilled by the cold wind that whipped up to greet them as they emerged from the stuffy train car. Max immediately removed his coat and draped it around her, not feeling the cold himself. Looking back once, he saw the silver form of the metro beginning to pull away from the station. The soft hiss of the metro rails and the ceaseless stir of traffic below them seemed a quiet music for the repose of the dead. Over the fading light of the street lamps, the pale blue glow of dawn was staining the shredded clouds. A light morning breeze blew chill. And he remembered. Author's Notes I thrive on reviews!

In this first one, it's set a few days after what happened, and Gene and Jailbreak are hanging out, plus have fun Oh man, I'm tired, after that party, but hope Gene is alright. It was a few days after everything that had happened, when Gene had saved Textoplis from disaster so right now, a certain Purpke skinned female named Jailbreak was just hanging out, plus she, Gene and High Five were going to hang out after work, if their user Alex did not need them. She was happy, that she had not stayed in the Cloud, because she would have missed Gene, plus was just hanging out seeing High Five hyper, guessing he had snuck into Candy Crysh again, hoping that Alex their user did not know, or he might think the phone was acting up again which they did not want to go through again making Jailbreak sigh. \"Dude, chill, or take an nap Ojay?\" she told him She'd been surfing on the Spotify sound waves again, like she and Gene had the first time they'd did it making her smile plus her mom had been surprised that she'd came back to the phone since she had w since anted to be herself, which she thought could only happen on the Cloud, until Gene had opened her eyes. \"Jailbreak, you okay?\" she heard a voice ask, seeing Gene there, making the smart princess happy. \"Hey Gene, High Five was being a little hyper, again.\" she said to him hearing him chuckle. He hoped she was alright, knowing before, Textoplis had thought of him as a malfunction but now, things were different which was good but he and Jailbreak were having fun, since Alex and Addy were on a date giving Gene an idea going to find those photos of Paris, from Alex's trip to Paris since that would be romantic, making Jailbreak grin summoning a bird to take them, making Gene grin. \"Yeah, I know, Hogh Five was impressed the last time I did this, but he promised not to tell.\" she told him. They were having fun just flying around, surprising the other emojis that lived in the city making them laugh hysterically arriving at their destination but sitting at a table together in Paris, making Jailbreak blush, because she liked being aroubd Gene from the first time they'd met in the Piracy app, knowing his parents approved of Jailbreak, but hoped her mom would along with her regal sisters. \"Yeah, they're curious about the emoji boy that convinced me, to embrace my tiara, you know?\" Jailbreak told him. Later that early morning or around two in the morning, Gene's parents were relieved seeing him home, guessing he and Jailbreak had been having fun, seeing him nod telling them, making Mel and Mary grin at this hoping things would work out.[Chapter 2] A/N Here's more of the stories, but hope people are enjoying, you know? So in this one, Gene is hanging out with Jailbreak at where her family lives, but he is nervous about it, in case her mom and sisters don't like him, which is weird because he is awesome even to Jailbreak like she said in the movie. Jailbreak sighed, because her mom and regal sisters wanted to meet Gene, who had convinced her to not live on the Cloud but she was not liking being badgered by them, so was already up but in magenta pyjamas, changing from them into her normal attire, hoping that Gene would not be freaked out by them breathing deeply. \"I need to get breakfast, before going to work.\" she told herself, making her sisters get it, seeing her in her normal attire wondering why if she wore her tiara to work, why she didn't wear her princess dress there. \"Because it's not a party, plus my friends need me.\" Jailbreaksaid to them \"Girls, leave your sister be, as she is happy.\" their Mpm told them. Jailbreak was inviting Gene over to the castle that she, her mom and her sisters lived in, but hoped High Five would not geek out too much, like when she summoned that bird, but was eating unicorn shaped pancakes, hoping that Gene was alright because she cared about him, going to where the emojis worked, when Alex used the phone. \"Morning Jailbreak, you alright?\" Gene asked her when she arrived there. \"Yeah, but nervous about later, you know?\" Jailbreak told him. \"Hey your family are probably great, you know?\" Gene told her. Tbat made her grin but hoped that things would go well, plus was helping the others get ready, in case Alex needed them plus used the scanner when that happened, which made her happy that she could feel free to be herself,despite being on the phone still, plus was living with her mom and sisters which had surprised them, but was happy she had came back. Later, it was after work but Gene was getting ready to go to where Jailbreak lived, but a little anxious hoping Jailbreak's mom would like him along with her sisters, deciding to just be himself leaving his house, going to the castle where Jailbreak's family lived ringing the doorbell as one of the other princess emojis who were Jailbreak's sisters answered it. \"Oh it's you, our mom and us were expecting you.\" she said, letting him in. Gene was curious, because he knew that High Five would ask him a lot of questions about tonight, so good he did not tell him, or he would have wanted to come seeing Jailbreak in her regal attire, making his expression change to hearts for eyes, making her giggle making her sisters surprised. \"Why're you surprised, as I thought Jailbreak told you.\" Gene said to them. \"Sort of, but it is cool, and see why my sister likes you.\" she said. He saw Jailbreak in her princess attire, making him blush making her grin, as they were going to the dining room, but Jailbreak noticed that he was feeling shy around her sisters making her get it, helping him to relax which was good.[Chapter 3] A/N Here's more of the series and thanks to the person that reviewed, but I do like the movie and it annoys me when peopke ask me why or how can you like the movie, when we are supposed to form our own opinions about things but before I saw the movie, I was unsure until I saw a trailer for it, and it looked awesome and funny to me like the Angry Birds movie which I also love, plus I really like Jailbreaker as she is awesome. Sorry about that, but I had to explain that as that reviewer kind of surprised me but if you don't like the movie or saw it just for the short before it, then why are you reading this series? Now that I have addressed that, let's get on with things. In this one, Jailbreaker has the sniffles but hiding it from everybody, including Gene but he persuades her for him and the sake of the phone, to go home and rest. It was the next day, but Jailbreaker was not feeling so good, but it was like a cold so she was hiding it from her mom but also her sisters, because she also wanted to go to work, blowing into a tissue getting ready leaving the castle, walking sluggishly to work which made some of her fellow emojis curious or worried, wondering if she was alright hearing her say that she was alright seeing Gene and High Five exchange a worried look. \"Jailbreak, you sure you're alright, you're sounding a little meh, you know?\" Gene said hearing her sneeze. \"I'm okay Gene, don't worry alright?\" Jailbreak replied to him making him unsure, seeing the others agree that something was wrong with the purple skinned princess, hoping that she just needed rest taking her to the castle that was her family home, not caring if he got sick. Her mom and sisters were surprised, but knew that their stubborn sister was sick with sniffles but taking care of her. \"You should get back, but she'll be okay, Gene.\" Jailbreak's mom told him. He was going back to work, but would check on Jailbreak, after work and was distracted by thinking about Jailbreak hearing Alex say that Addy was home sick, so knew he was probably worried too but after work let out, he was going to where Jailbreak and her family lived, going to her room seeing her asleep, cuddling a p,ush princess emoji, which he found cute. \"Hey Jail, how're you feeling?\" Gene asked softly seeing her begin to stir with bed hair. She was surprised that he was here, smiling but feeling a little better despite holding the plush in her arms blushing. \"That's good because I was worried about you, you know?\" Gene told her[Chapter 4] A/N Here's more of the stories, but thanks to Damander E and Velcoraptor for reviewing who also loved the movie besides me which makes me happy, but hope you enjoy, oh and Cordy Mills, thanks and I love your idea and might have to draw a human Jailbreak since I can see her in my mind right now, plus your suggestion sounds awesome and maybe human Gene and Jailbreak should go to Alex's school. Sorry about that, but I got this review a few seconds from somebody named Cordy Mills, who suggested an intresting idea to me and I might have to write it, as it sounds intresting Jailbreak was excited, because she and Gene were going on a date in Candy Crush which made her grin, because it reminded her of the first time she, him and Hi-5 had went there hoping that Alex woukd not think the phone was being weird again or go off when Alex was in class again, but not telling Hi-5 where they were going as it was just for her and Gene, knowing Alex was having Addy over. At least we can have fun, and not have certain doom happen, or worry that Gene might get hurt. She was getting ready for work, leaving the castle, but was meeting Gene for breakfadt to go before work, plus her sisters and mom were busy doing their own thing, hoping that they were alright going to the cafe she was supposed to meet Gene at seeing he had saved a table for them, making her grin, because she loved her emotional boy. \"Alright, you made it, but you okay?\" he asked her, seeing her nod sitting down at the table facing him, and the place was busy since Cafe Pixel was pretty popular in Textoplis so happy to get a table. \"So, how're your foljs, Gene?\" Jailbreak asked him, since her mom and Gene's parents were pretty friendly with each other. \"They're good, Jail, and happy about us, you know?\" Gene replied to her seeing a waiter bring pancakes making the both of them excited to dig in, but Jailbreaker was putting an napkin around her neck, making Gene grin, guessing she was showing her regal side being a princess emoji, but happy to be one in her own way. \"Yeah,my mom and I had a long talk about that, after we kicked Smiler's butt, she gets it now.\" Jailbreak said seeing Gene had a little maple syrup on his lip, trying to help wipe it off, accidentally kissing him, making his expression a surprised but happy one, plus Jailbreak blushed too, unaware other emojis around them were surprised but they did not care what they were thinking. \"W-We should go soon, or we're gonna be late, you know?\" Jailbreak said, paying for breakfast as they were leaving, making the other emojis at work grin seeing them including Hi-5 making Jailbreak roll her eyes at him hearing him. \"I was just trying to wipe syrup off Gene's lip alright?\" she said making him stop knowing she got angry easy. She really did love Gene, but stunned they'd just had their first kiss at breakfast and it had been random too, letting it go as she could still feel the syrup on her lips grinning despite her purple skinned cheeks going violet getting to work, since Alex needed them to help him express himself, which he was becoming good at, especially with Addy making her and Gene grin. When she got home to her family's castle, Jailbreak saw her sisters excited, guessing they'd heard what happened with her and Gene but she was telling them what had happened, making them surprised along with their mother who was happy about this knowing Mel and Mary, Gene's parents were just as surprised making Jailbreak roll her eyes, going to her room.[Chapter 5] A/N Here's more of the stories, but thanks to everybody who has reviewed or favourited or followed plus happy the movie has a section on here, plus I posted an new Emoji Movie story about Gene and Jailbreak turning into humans. In this one, Gene doesn't show up at work, which worries Jailbreak and hangs out with him realising he is sick but will get better Jailbreak was worried, because she had not seen Gene all day st work, which really bothered the purple haired and skinned princess, because he was always there, but keeping her worry to herself while at work guessing that maybe his folks would know what had happened to him, deciding to go to his house so to see if he was alright. She was leaving work after the working day was done, walking to where Gene and his parents lived ringing the doorbell seeing Gene's mother, Mary there happy to see her there. \"Oh hey Linda, Gene's in his room, but in bed.\" she told her making Jailbreak worry, running upstairs like when she, Gene and Hi-5 had been chased by the bots, entering Gene's room, hearing sneezing sounds which eased her worry a bit seeing \"Gene was not looking so hot hoping he was alright poking his shoulder gently. \"Jailbreak, what're you doing here?\" Gene asked coughing, covering his mouth so he would not infect her. \"You didn't show up at work, so I was worried about you.\" Jailbreak told him. \"I caught a cold, and my foljs thought it better, if I stayed home, in bed.\" Gene told her. He knew that Linda cared about him, since they had met and went on that awesome adventure, plus knew that she preferred everybody else call her Jailbreak, but only let him call her Linda, blowing into tissues making Jailbreak chuckle at him because it was cute knowing that everybody got sick, and that he would feel better in a few days, plus saw that Mel and Mary were going out so decided to stay, since her mom and sisters were throwing a ball. \"Are you hungry or thirsty, Gene?\" Jailbreak asked him. \"I guess I could use something to drink.\" Gene said seeing her leave his room, going downstairs to the kitchen finding orange juice, hearing that it was good for emojis that had colds, pouring some into a glass hoping that it might help make Gene feel better, because she'd been looking at his cube all day today. \"Thanks, but stunned, that you were worried about me all day?\" Gene said while drinking. \"You're welcome, as I care about you.\" Jailbreak replied to him. He grinned in reply at this, hoping that she would not get his cold, because he loved her hoping that her mom and sisters weren't mad at her, for being here seeing her roll her blue eyes at him playfully.[Chapter 6] A/N Here have more of the stories, but thanks to Cordy Mills, and AdoreLoveStories for reviewing along with the guest that inspired this chapter, but hope you enjoy this. In this one, we go back in time to Gene's first day of school where he first met Hi-5 but also Linda who help him with some mean kids who pick on him for being different. It was early morning in Textoplis, as a young five year old emoji boy named Gene Meh awoke, excited for his first day of school which he'd been looking forward to all summer, but was getting ready, hoping his parents were up going to their room, seeing they were still asleep knowing how to wake them up jumping on the bed surprising both Mary and Mel. \"Sorry guys, I'm just excited about my first day of school!\" Gene said smiling. \"I know, but go get ready sweetie.\" Mary told him seeing him leave their room. \"The other kids might be weird towards him, he is different, you know?\" Meals aid. \"Mel, you know that Gene can't help being... different.\" Mary replied. They were getting ready for the day, and Gene's first day of school seeing him at the table, making Mary happy that their son was different, wanting to prepare him for what other kids might say to him, once they realised he was different, making breakfast but also Gene's lunch hoping he would make a friend that woukdn't care that he was different plus taking him to school in a little bit. On the way there, Gene was happily talking about things, but excited arriving at the school seeing a lot of emoji kids running aroubd and playing, finding the kindergarten playground, seeing a lot of emoji kids Gene's age playing on play equipment but Gene noticed some of them pointing at him and whispering. \"Hey there, I'm Gene, it's my first day!\" Gene said smiling. \"If you're a meh, how can you be so happy?\" little pizza asked. \"I-I was just born that way, like my mom says.\" Gene replied. The other emoji kids saw his expression change to an nervous one, making them giggle making fun of him, saying he was a malfunction, and that he'd never work on the phone when he grew up, making little Gene upset running into the jungle gym, making the other kids chuckle going inside, except for one. It was a little purple skinned girl emoji with purple hair wearing a black hat, and a black dress not happy that the other kids were mean to Gene for no reason just because he was different, which was not fair going into the jungle gym, seeing Gene curious as to why she was there. \"Hey there, I'm Linda, but what's wrong, because those meanies pick on you, just because you're different?\" she told him. \"I can't help it, I was born like this, Linda but you like me, right?\" Gene said. \"Yes, as my mom says that different isn't bad, that it's a good thing.\" Linda told him. Gene liked what she just said, but was feeling braver to go inside, taking Linda's hand going inside stunning the other kids, but another kid their age, that looked like a hand that had a band-aid on his finger approached. \"Hey there, I'm Hi-5, you're the new kid, that's causing quite a stir?\" he said to Gene, seeing him nod. \"Yeah, but you're not gonna be mean, like the other kids?\" Gene asked hiding behind Linda. \"No, you're pretty intresting, Gene.\" Hi-5 told him making Gene feel better, as they were sitting at a table by themselves co,ouring, surprising the kids that a princess emoji was friends with a malfunction like Gene seeing her stick out her tongue at those kids. \"Thanks you guys, as the day didn't start so good.\" Gene said smiling again which relieved Linda, because those kids bothering him had made it disappear so was glad he was feeling better seeing it was lunchtime[Chapter 7] A/N Here's more of the stories, but thanks to those that have reviewed and favourited, so hope you all like this update. In this one, Gene decides to propose to Jailbreak, which should be intresting After many dates, Gene and Jailbreak were deciding to take the next step, and get married but Gene was wanting to propose to Jailbreak properly since he loved her a lot, so Hi-5 along with his parents were helping him with it by making a romantic dinner for just him and Jailbreak which was where he would propose to her. \"Yep, she's going to love this, because you care for her.\" Mel told Gene, but he had an engagement ring that he wanted to give Jailbreak, feeling sweaty making that anxious expression he'd made on his first day on the phone. \"You should just relax sweetie, as Linda loves you, and you love her.\" Mary assured him. Gene was beginning to relax, but going to get ready but hoping that Jailbreak would love his proposal sighing after taking a shower hearing that Linda was here taking deep breaths going downstairs, blushing, because she looked so pretty. \"Hey, just be you, alright?\" Hi-5 whispered wearing his fedora making Gene lead Jailbreak into the kitchen having dinner, plus MelandMary were watching, hoping that it would go well, hearing Jailbreakexcited, after Gene popped the question. \"Yes, I will marry you, Gene.\" Jailbreak said kissing Gene making him excited, plus Mel and Mary were very happy about this, planning the wedding already hoping things would go well, and maybe they would become grandparents making Jailbreak giggle at Gene's reaction to his mom saying that. \"We have to wait and see, Ms Meh.\" she told him. \"Sorry, but I am pretty excited, about this.\" Mary said. Jailbreak was imagining them becoming a family, and having kids making tham grin, but they were eating ice cream sundaes but eating slowly so they would not get a brain freeze, having fun plus Hi-5 along with Mel and Mary were giving them privacy, yet still watching quietly, finding this very cute knowing they were meant to be. Later that night, they were outside looking at the stars in the night sky, plus seeing a shooting star, both Gene and Linda were making a wish. \"What did you both wish for?\" Melasked. \"We can't tell you, or it won't come true, dad.\" Gene said to him making Jailbreak grin. ","Summary":" A/N So yesterday I saw The Emoji Movie which was funny, and cool plus I now have another female cha"},{"Movie":"Pretty in Pink","Title":"Pretty in Black","Author":"stodgysays","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12974495","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Hey guys. I'll catch up later.\" He looked over at a fashion showroom on Madison Avenue as a group of men in suits kept walking on. One flashed his middle finger in his direction. Steff McKee's eye fixed on the girl laying out a sheet of fabric on a table. Her auburn hair was slicked back revealing her profile to him. Steff immediately recognized her. He pulled a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it while still oggling. When she turned her head to look out the window, her face showed a slow sign of recognition before he saw her mouth his name. Steff He walked to the entrance went through. Andie Walsh already stood there silently creating her battle plan. She wore a mid-length black spaghetti strap dress over a tight t shirt. A simple black ribbon was tied around her neck. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked curtly. \"I have an internship for a broker in the city this summer. I saw you while I walking back from a business lunch.\" Steff balanced himself on the door frame. \"Yes. I can smell that business lunch on your breath. Did you bother to even eat or just have a liquid lunch? Now before you can call me a bitch, what do you want?\" \"Chill, Andie. I just wanted to say hello. It surprised me to see you here. That's all. I'm allowed to be polite. I'd be a dick to just walk past without saying something.\" Steff's words should have surprised her but the delivery was the same as she expected. \"Here's my card in case you want to do something,\" Steff said handing her his business card. Before she could look up from reading it, he was already gone. Andie saw the card out of the corner of her eye. She has placed it on her workspace. Her eyes rolled to the ceiling. Steff was the biggest asshole from high school. He harrassed her, embarrased her and controlled others around her to sway their favor from her. The other rich kids from school never got to Angie. Steff made her blood boil. Her relationship with his best friend did not last but a month into college. She couldn't balance the course work and guilt of spending so little time, so she called it off with Blane. She didn't feel too bad about it, either. Her eyes kept wandering to the card all that week. On Friday, after her shift she picked up the card deciding to throw it away. As she walked to the bin, she pocketed it at the last minute and exited the showroom.[Chapter 2] \"It's Steff.\" he answered his phone on the fourth ring. He was laying down on his bed balancing an ashtray on his knee. Silence. \"It's you, isn't it Andie.\" \"Yes. I'm calling to let you know that I don't want to go out anytime and I'd appreciate if you...\" Steff cut her off, \"Cut the crap. I'll pick you up tonight. You live in the loft above your showroom.\" \"Did you follow me?\" Andie was flabbergasted. \"Yep...8 sharp.\" Steff said. \"Wait...Steff...\" Andie heard a click on the line. Steff straightened his suit and loosened his tie. His fingers ran through his still shaggy hair. He pushed the buzzer next to the name \"A. Walsh\". \"Yes.\" Andie's voice said. \"It's Steff. Come on down.\" A minute or two later, Andie pushed through the side stairwell in a black t-shirt dress with a high slit up the thigh exposing a pair of fishnet stockings. She wore black leather booties adorned with metallic spikes. Her face only had light makeup despite the harshness of her ensemble. \"This is different.\" Steff remarked looking her up and down. \"I didn't come here to take any shit.\" \"Jeez Andie. I didn't say I didn't like it. You really need to relax.\" Steff smirked at her. \"Let's get this over with.\" Andie strapped on her vintage Chanel crossbody bag. \"We are just going for dinner. I'm serious, Andie, you can relax.\" He opened the door to the black card as Andie slid in. He climbed in behind her and told the driver to head out. \"So tell me, Andie. How did you end up here?\" \"After I graduated from Drexel, I interned with a designer that worked with LaCroix. He liked my designs and helped me set something up here. I wanted to move back home but my dad...wait why am I telling you all of this? What are we doing? Steff, you were such an ass in high school. Is this a sick joke?\" \"Andie, I already know about your dad. My family owns the funeral home where you had him cremated. I bet it was relieving. You had to work at that record store all through high school to support him,\" Steff said. \"You don't know what you are talking about,\" she spat back. \"I made it my business to know. I wasn't lying when I said I liked you for 4 years. Well, like 8 now. I still think about it. So, you're doing well. Good. Your style has changed...for the better. Fashion school helped.\" Steff smirked at her again tracing his finger across the fishnets peaking through the slit that exposed her thigh. Andie jerked her skirt down and looked straight ahead. Steff continued, \"Let's play a game\" \"What?\" she asked. \"I let you insult me all you want.\" Steff began. Andie pursed her pouty lips. \"But, for each insult you owe me another date.\" Steff tugged on the hem of her dress and let it go tauntingly. The car stopped and a moment later, the driver opened the door for her to get out. Steff led her to the stairwell leading to a restaurant. Grabbing the door for her, he whispered, \"Yes or no?\" \"Fine.\" Andie replied. During dinner Steff talked loquaciously as Andie sat with her arms crossed. He talked about college, and his internship, and his future job on Wall Street that he already lined up after the summer. Andie looked bored even as she ate her fish dinner. \"Well, let's get you home, Eddie.\" Steff smiled knowing that would set her off. Andie's eyes widened at him, but she remained silent. The ride home felt uncomfortably long to her. Steff leaned up and told his driver to pull over. \"Ok. I get it. You don't want to be here. Or maybe you do. That's why you picked up the phone in the first place. Here, I'm trying to do the right thing. I'm trying to show you I'm not going to dick you over. You need to make a little effort.\" \"Steff, can you just please take me...\" He cut her off by pressing his mouth to hers softly. He pulled back to look at her. Andie's chest heaved up and down. Steff moved in again slowly dragging his lips over hers. Feeling her kiss him back, he continued pressing his lips to hers. He heard her sigh causing his hands to grip her thigh. With his usual boldness, he sucked on her bottom lip tugging it before breaking away from the kiss. A pack of cigarettes appeared from his jacket pocket as he pulled one out using his teeth before offering one to Andie. She shooked her head no. She felt suprisingly calm considering she just kissed the person that made her stomach sour for all of high school. But, high school was long gone. The driver took her home as she let Steff trace his fingers along the skin that peaked through her stockings. Occasionally, he would tilt her head over to his to kiss her again. The car rolled to a stop in front of the showroom and Andie leaned over to kiss Steff goodnight; her full lips firmly pressing his. \"Deep down, you're still shit.\" Andie said smirking. \"That's another date. See you tomorrow night.\"[Chapter 3] Two dates later, Andie applies her lipstick and fixes her hair in the mirror while waiting for her bell to ring. When it does, Andie peers down expecting to see Steff suited up leaning against his car service. She mentally prepares herself for another chic restaurant and long car ride of making out. Steff had begun testing her boundaries on their last date by inching his hands higher and higher up her thighs to feel the material of her underwear before she told him to back down. \"You're such a tease\". He turned her on more than she expected. Something about how he looked at her and his low voice invaded her thoughts at night as she brought herself to release. It became clear to her that she would sleep with him very soon. Blane was her first and inexperienced. Steff probably possessed more bedroom knowledge considering his rumored exploits. The second buzz snaps her out of her thoughts, and she jogs down the stairs and walks out onto the sidewalk. Instead, he is pacing in khaki pants and a navy, pullover sweater. He runs his hands through his hair and smokes. \"Let's go,\" Steff says grabbing her hand. \"Where is the car?\" \"We are walking to the subway.\" Steff is looking straight ahead pulling her along. They get to the nearest station and walk toward the booth. \"Come on. Put in the coin, already,\" Steff stammers impatiently. Andie glares at him as she does what she is told. He does the same and they enter the turnstiles. He grabs her hand again and starts pushing through the crowd to get on the needed train. They sit and Andie asks, \"Where are we going?!\" \"The Bronx. There is something I need to do.\" After an hour long ride, he leads her up to the street, four blocks and to a filfthy parking lot. Prostitutes lean against the chainlink fence propositioning johns. Steff walks up to a man in a sleazy suit. Andie sees him pass him a large roll of bills. Walking back to her, he looks at her for the first time all night. \"Alright. That's done. Where should we eat?\" Andie stands with her hands on her hips. \"No.\" \"You know, I don't need any shit right now.\" \"Then, why are we here?\" He looks up letting out a slow breath. \"I had to settle some coke debts for the brokers Downtown. The intern has to do all the shitty work. Do you see any hotshot Wall Street guys down here doing this?\" Andie links her arm in his and leans her head against his shoulder in reassurance. That must really stink for him , she scoffs to herself. They eat gyros off the street on their way back to Manhattan. She thinks to herself how stabilizing the city is that two people with backgrounds like theres could join easily without any question. They walk around the city all night talking until finding themselves back in front of her loft. She leans against the nearby wall, and Steff presses his forehead to hers holding her around the waist. Andie presses her mouth to his and says, \"This was my favorite date so far.\" \"Watching me talk to a fucking dealer? I thought I had a hard-on for trash.\" Andie rolls her eyes and turns to unlock her loft. She goes through the door and he pushes it behind her, but she peaks her head out again and inquires, \"Well, do you want to come up?\"[Chapter 4] p style=\"border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.5; color: #2a2a2a;\"Andie kept things pretty simple: a bed, dresser, couch, a drawing desk that doubled as a dining table, and the clutter of high school mementos confined to a box hidden at the bottom of her closet.

She nodded, and Steff took the opportunity to ram his tongue in her mouth and press her back on the bed. She reached down to unzip his pants while he bit at her neck. A foil packet appeared from his back pocket before his erection sprung free. Andie pulled her panties off and allowed Steff to position one leg over his shoulder after putting on the condom. /p p style=\"border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.5; color: #2a2a2a;\"The rough sex was nothing compared to the intense eye contact.

I'll catch up later.\" He looked over at a fashion showroom on Madison Avenue as a grou"},{"Movie":"Pretty in Pink","Title":"Pride and Privilege","Author":"tea.and.madeleines","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10754197","Passage":"[Chapter 1] She was beautiful, of course. He had an eye for beauty, which made sense. Steff had been surrounded by the finest things all his life. Consequently, he knew how to recognize them. But her clothes, goddamn. A poor imitation of that New Romantics bullshit. Yet that was part of her appeal, in a way, because she needed him. She needed someone who could polish her. She was a diamond in the rough. If she were his, he'd take her into the city for a full day and leave with a whole new wardrobe. Pleated skirts and clingy turtlenecks in every color of the rainbow. Silk blouses. Benetton sweaters. A shorts suit. A gold cuff. Lingerie, definitely - a sheer white babydoll. Steff's imagination was spiraling quickly into dangerous territory and had latched onto the image of Andie in the babydoll, through which he could see nipples the same color as her full, pouting coral lips. \"Mr. McKee.\" The sound of authority broke through his rosy reverie. He was sitting in the back row of math class. Mr. Kershaw was glaring at him from the front. \"Though it is the last day of the school year, the last day of your high school career, and the last class of the day, I don't think it's outrageous to expect participation in mandatory class discussion.\" Steff leaned languidly forward on the desk, partially to further annoy Kershaw (bad posture among students was his particular pet peeve), and partially to conceal what was going on in his pants as a result of the daydream. \"Yes, well, if you could just repeat the question, sir ,\" he drawled. Kershaw's glare intensified. \"We were going around the room sharing summer plans, plans for next year, and goals for the future.\" \"Bermuda...Yale...CEO and president of McKee Enterprises,\" Steff deadpanned while pulling a cigarette from his pocket and sticking it between his teeth, signifying the end of the discussion. He tuned out once more as other students chimed in with their petty summer camping trips and no-name colleges . He had more important things on his mind.[Chapter 2] Andie pushed her way out the front door of the high school and breathed in pure freedom. She wore a pair of blousy, highwaisted peach shorts and a dark, short-sleeved button up, finished off with her signature pearls and a single dangling earring. Predictably, the outfit was a result of her creative talents: the shorts were made from an old pair of pants, and the shirt from curtains. She descended the stone steps, her white oxfords clicking, unable to repress happiness as she left the school for the last time. Then she stopped. Parked directly behind her car was a very shiny, very familiar red Porsche preventing her from pulling out. Her mind raced. She could back into it anyway, smashing into the car's side - sweet revenge. But she couldn't afford repairs, and her own car's trunk would inevitably be crushed. Cursing under her breath, she walked slowly over to the offending vehicle and knocked hard on the driver's side door. The tinted window slid away, leaving her face-to-face with a pair of dark aviators, which Steff took off as he looked her up and down. \"I'd say I was sorry to hear things didn't work out between you and Blane, but I'd be lying.\" He rested the tip of his tongue between his teeth, a smirk playing around his lips. \"I'd say I wish you would jump off a bridge, but - oh, wait, I'd be telling the truth.\" Steff's face fell, just for an instant, before he recovered himself. \"I do enjoy your sparkling wit, Andie, but let's be serious for a second here. When are we going to do something, just you and I? I've been trying to get you to go out with me for 4 years. Blane lays eyes on you and a week later you're sticking your tongue down his throat. Now, how exactly does that figure?\" \"Maybe because Blan e isn't an asshole . See the logic?\" \"Mmmm. Well, keep telling yourself that. You think the only reason you two broke up a week after prom was because he'll be at college prep this summer? That he wasn't ready for long distance? Let's just put it this way: I wouldn't ditch you after I finally got some. But I'm the asshole?\" And at that, Andie snapped. \"SHUT UP! Would you just shut up ?\" \"I said it would be more than just sex, Andie. And I meant it.\" She scoffed. \" Right . What about Benny, Steff? What about her?\" \"Dumped after prom. You really are out of the social loop, you know that? I mean, if you want me to level with you...yeah, she's still been on the back burner, but she'd be gone like that - \" Steff snapped his fingers \" - if you were in the picture.\" Andie smiled coldly and rolled her eyes. \"No, Steff. I meant the way you treated her. Don't remember? Here's a hint: it was like shit. Why should I expect anything different?\" Steff paused. \"Some of it was for your benefit, you know. In the bedroom at the party, when she was baiting you? Did you realize that?\" \"But not all of it. Right, Steff? Does treating girls like trash make you feel like a big man? Well, sorry, but I'd prefer to not be verbally abused. Thanks for the offer.\" There was silence between them for a moment, filled only by the ebullient voices and shouts of other kids filtering through the parking lot. When Steff spoke again, it was in low tones, though his face revealed nothing. \"Andie.\" Had his voice just cracked as he said her name? \"Get in the car.\" Her eyes slitted; her lip turned up. \"Are you high? Why the hell would I do that?\" \"You take the keys. Sit in the driver's seat. You can move the car while I talk.\" \"But - \" Steff was staring at her, his eyes as flat and bored as ever. Without breaking eye contact, he fished into his jacket pocket and extended his arm toward her, Porsche keys in hand. After a moment's pause, she took them. Steff opened the door and stepped out, then held the door open for Andie and gestured like a footman. She climbed inside and sat, staring at her knees. Steff circled the car and, in a moment, was in the passenger seat. \" Well. Now that we finally have some privacy.\" His voice had regained all of its former cockiness. Andie scowled and remained soundless. \"You don't know this, Andie, but I think you should. Blane - goddamn, this is hard to say...well, he pegged me at the prom. About you.\" Steff switched into a slightly stupid sounding, yet otherwise accurate, imitation of Blane's voice: \"'You buy everything; you couldn't buy her.' 'She thinks you're shit, and deep down you know she's right.'\" Steff paused, pressing his lips together. \"There you go.\" Andie ran her tongue along her teeth, saying nothing, facing straight ahead, and not looking at the boy whose eyes were fixed on her. She stuck the keys in the ignition and revved the engine. \"Oh, and, uh, my psychiatrist says I project my rampant self-loathing onto other people. Well, she didn't actually tell me...I read her notes while she was out of the room. So. If that makes you feel any better...\" His tone of voice was sarcastic, but the words didn't feel like a joke. Something in his words struck Andie as sort of, well...sad. She let the car glide forward, freeing up her beloved pink junker. \"Damn. You're a natural, Andie. I'd let you drive this all the time, if you wanted.\" She put the car in park, finally looking up at Steff, who was still staring her down. Her thoughts were running at a million miles an hour; she always thought she knew his game. Now, she wondered how much she had been wrong about. And yet...if she said yes, even to one date, she was playing with fire. What would Iona tell her? That she needed to gain the upper hand. Manipulate the manipulator. With her face unreadable, she slid a hand over the linen on his thigh. She watched his mouth part helplessly with lust; his eyes had dropped from her face to her hand. She moved it farther still, to the inside of his upper thigh, and squeezed her fingertips into his leg. \"Great. Pick me up tomorrow at 8 from the record store. And I'll drive.\" Without missing a beat, Andie removed her hand, opened the door, and sauntered to her own car without looking back.[Chapter 3] It was hard to say exactly why she agreed to a date. A combination of curiosity, confusion, frustration, and...attraction? As much as she hated to admit it, Steff was a babe of the highest degree. His straight nose, his haughty eyes, his sculpted lips, his boyish chin...there was no denying it. But that hadn't stopped her from denying him before. No, there were other factors this time - the failed relationship with Blane being one of them. The spark had faded so fast. And though he had technically been the one to initiate the final break up, it was fairly mutual. There wasn't a whole lot to fill the gaps between kissing; conversation didn't flow easily between them. She was in the house's only bathroom, doing her makeup in the clouded mirror; her dad shouted to her from the kitchen. \"Andie? You going out tonight?\" \"Yeah, I'm just going to Trax for a little, and someone's meeting me there, so I'll probably be out late. Just go to bed whenever you're ready, don't wait up, and leave the door unlocked for me, 'kay?\" \"Honey, I thought you were putting the boyfriend thing on hold for awhile!\" She shook her head vehemently. \"NO. No, daddy. This isn't a boyfriend thing, it's just...I'm just kind of obligated to do this. End of year get-togethers, you know.\" She shrugged and half smiled through the lie. ... It was 7:30 when Andie pulled up at Trax. Steff was already standing under the overhang by the front door, his fair hair like a halo in the night, playing with his lighter. His eyes flickered upwards at her. Damn. She thought she would have had time to slip in through the back door, unwind with a good record and a shot or two of the sake that Iona kept in the supply room, and maybe give Duckie a call. Instead, she had to steel herself quickly as she walked toward the entrance. \"Funny, I wouldn't have guessed you'd be the early type.\" He smirked. \"I don't need to be fashionably late, Andie. I'm punctual when I want to be somewhere, and I'm not when I don't.\" Andie stared him down for a few seconds before dropping her gaze. \"So. What do you have planned for the night? Private plane? Or taking me to a back alley?\" \"Dinner, actually. You look stunning, by the way.\" \"Oh...\" She was wearing a knee-length brown tartan skirt, an old pair of her mom's tall leather boots that were actually pretty nice despite her aversion to wearing them, and a lacy white top made from a pillow sham. \"But you'll look better if you put this on.\" He tossed her a roll of fabric, which unfurled in her hands. A pale pink, monogrammed, men's sweater. Steff's sweater. Her reaction was instantaneous. \"Go fuck yourself.\" Steff moistened his lips. \"Here's the thing, Andie - you don't have to wear it. I certainly can't make you. But I want you to be comfortable and I want you to have a good time, and I think a little costume change is key in order for that to happen where we're going. Just a little foresight I had; I thought I'd bring it so you had the option.\" Andie seemed to be visibly struggling with a response before she finally got words out: \"I'll decide when we get there.\"[Chapter 4] \"No. I'm not turning here. It's a dead end, Steff. \"Relax. We're going in through the back. VIP, if you will. There .\" Pulling down the tiny side street, Andie's gaze followed Steff's pointed finger to an unassuming wooden door with a small engraved plaque next to it. Spago . \"Do you know it?\" A smile played around Steff's lips. \"No.\" She was lying, of course. It was only the most famous restaurant in the city. Opening the door and stepping out of the car, Andie hesitantly took the sweater from the leather seat and knotted it around her shoulders. Steff watched her smugly. … The digital clock in the car glowed 11:00. The streets were empty. Dinner was long over. Andie had been dumbstruck by the glamour of it all, though tried not to show it. Steff had lapped up every minute of it. He knew the chef through his father, and asked the kitchen to make her something special; in defiance, she said her favorite food was grilled cheese. The waitstaff came out with pancetta and gouda on a baguette, fried in truffle oil. Now, they sat quietly in the car outside Steff's as he finished his cigarette, preparing to drive her home. Andie gazed out the window into the warm summer night. \"You know, I used to drive by here all the time to look at this house. Before I knew it was yours.\" Steff smirked. \"Well, yeah, I guess it's nice if you're into that sort of thing.\" Andie acted like she hadn't heard him. \"Do you know what it's like to want something so bad, while knowing that it will never, ever be yours?\" \"I have - \" Steff wet his lips as his eyes skated up and down Andie \"- some experience with the feeling, yes.\" \"Like...I'll never have money like that. I'll never live like that. It wouldn't matter if I wasted my whole life dreaming about it. And...well, the thing is, I'm sure you don't think your house is half as beautiful as I do. What I think about it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all.\" \"You're right. There's people who matter, and people who don't. But I want you to be a person who matters, Andie.\" She turned to look at him, partially smiling and partially grimacing. \"God, what an awful thing to say, and you - you just can't even understand how shitty the things you say are.\" He shrugged. \"You think I'm heartless.\" Her voice was hard. \"Yes. I do.\" \"That wasn't a question.\" They maintained quiet eye contact for a moment, Andie's face defiant and Steff's stony. He broke the silence first. \"Then show me what having a heart is like. Just one kiss, Andie. I won't push my luck. I won't touch you.\" She leaned in, her pearls swinging slowly forward. She hovered for a moment, savoring the tension in the air...and then she kissed him. Pulling back slightly, Andie met his lidded eyes, felt his chest rising and falling hard. She watched one of his hands rise to her face, and he touched her puffy lips reverently. Andie shifted to the side, away from his hand, and leaned into his neck. She pushed her lips into the soft skin beneath his chin and kissed it, slightly openmouthed. Moving parallel to his jawline, Andie worked her way up slowly to the spot just behind his earlobe. \"Jesus - \". She could hear his breath shuddering, feel his body shivering, flooded with adrenaline and hormones. ","Summary":" She was beautiful, of course. He had an eye for beauty, which made sense.

Also, CHECK OUT MY PROFILE FOR PICTURES OF ALL MY OCs. Including Maggie. I also put regular updates on my profile. Check up on it often. Tell me what you think, and enjoy! \"Margaret Claire Myre, I have had enough !\" My mom screams at me. She always uses my given name when she's upset with me. And her voice gets that strain in it, like she's on the verge of tears but won't let them fall; it breaks my heart to her that in her usually bright voice. \"Mom.\" I try to pacify her. She pushes away my hands, \" Mom .\" \"No, Maggie! You aren't talking your way out of this.\" She says throwing her hands up and down, just to do something with them. \"Mom, I don't even know what I did.\" I sigh. She makes this tragic little sound, \" What then?\" \"Oh you know very well what.\" She says, giving me the look. I get irritated. \" What ?\" \"Do I have to say it?\" \"Yeah, I think you do.\" I spit, giving in to anger from my mom's withering gaze. \"Scott.\" She just says to me. Now I roll my eyes, \"Don't roll your eyes at me, young lady.\" \"What about Scott?\" I demand. \"Your sister told me he stayed the night when I was away last week.\" She dropped the bomb. I purse my lips, trying not to give anything away. But I know I'm caught. \"Nothing happened-\" \"Oh Maggie.\" \"Mom!\" I say, \"Nothing happened .\" My voice is desperate, because it's the truth. How do I tell her I'd never do anything with that scumwad? How do I explain my reasons for being with someone I hate? \"Regardless.\" Mom hasn't picked up on my sincerity, \"I've had enough of your disrespect. It's time you learn to listen.\" And then something comes over her face as she thinks of something. \" Respect ?\" Where did that come from? But she wasn't listening to me, \"Mom?\" \"You're going away this year.\" She says more to herself, still sketching it out apparently. \"You're kicking me out ?\" I cry as she rushes to the phone, but she ignores me again as she punches in a number, \" Mom ?\" I whine. \"Hello? Iona! This is your sister.\" She pauses and smiles, \"So I guess I'll just come out and say it. Will you take Maggie for her senior year?\" \"This isn't happening.\" I say as I pack my suitcases. I turn to look in the mirror. I tug at my short, dark brown hair, which is a bob at it's best, \"This isn't happening.\" I repeat to my reflection. But then my small, pixie face breaks and my eyes, the same shade of brown as my hair, squeeze shut, \"Ohhh. This is happening.\" I really don't know why my mom wanted to send me off to Chicago to live my senior year of high school with my Aunt. Because, honestly, my Aunt Iona is insane; she wasn't going to be a role model for me, and this certainly wouldn't be a punishment. I don't know what my mom was getting at here. Maybe she just ed wanted to get me away from the volatile nature of a small, cliquey town; and Scott. As if I'd miss him; we broke up over the phone as soon as the plans were finalized. Or maybe she knew something I didn't. \"Maggie, get your ass down here before I beat you.\" She yells up to me from the bottom of the stairs. Then again, maybe not. Whatever her reason, I was going to the airport today. I would be in Chicago by nightfall. And Aunt Iona swore I'd be starting my new school tomorrow morning, working shifts at her store whenever not in school. I didn't have time to think about how I felt. I'd just have to adapt. And hope that I liked my new home.[Chapter 2] Wow! This is my second update today. Not for this story, mind you. But still. Impressive, no? Anywhos. Nothing much to say, except to thank X-Designer-Skyline-X for her review! I'm glad you like my story. Tell me what you think, and enjoy! True to her word for once, my Aunt Iona was shipping me off the Meadow Brook High School the morning after I arrived in Chicago. I stood on the sidewalk in front of the school. A bus slid in behind my Aunt's car as she rolled down a window. \"You gonna go in, or just stare at it?\" I heard her say over the chaos reigning around me. \"I'm scared.\" I said, just loud enough for her to hear me, \"I think I'm paralyzed.\" \"Oh don't be so melodramatic. Have fun, sweetie.\" With that being said, my Aunt pushed my back through the open car window. Caught off guard, I stumbled forward as my Aunt pulled out. My converse tripped me up as they hit an uneven part of the pavement, but my books wanted to keep going. I managed to right myself before I fell, but my books tumbled from my grasp all over the sidewalk. I heard laughing around me, but I pretended like I didn't. Hiking up my baggy pants, I kneeled as confidently as I could to retrieve my belongings. Reaching towards a notebook, my fingers retracted just quickly enough not to get crushed as someone else in converse walked by. \"Watch it!\" I said angrily while looking up at whoever was discourteous enough to tread on my stuff and potentially my hand. A girl with short copper red hair glanced back at me as if she hadn't noticed me until now. There was a boy in a hat and little black glasses talking away to her still, as though nothing else was important. The girl looked me over and smiled. \"Did you need some help?\" She asked, already bending to hand me another of my notebooks. Quickly noticing her shoes, I figured her chatty friend had to be the one to stomp over my books. He definitely seemed distracted enough. \"Thanks.\" I said shyly, accepting her help, \"I hope I didn't sound like a bitch. I was just a little affronted when your friend there damn near walked over my fingers.\" The girl turned up to the boy, a glare in her eyes. \"Duckie!\" She cut him off, \"I can't believe you walked on this girl's stuff! You are such an asshole.\" \"What girl?\" The boy named Duckie asked, finally being brought back to earth. I stood up, having recollected all my stray things. \"This girl.\" I said softly, but still looking rather angry, \"But whatever.\" He just looked at me with this dumb look, words failing him for the first time since I'd made his acquaintance. It made me feel a little uncomfortable; I didn't like people looking at me, because it was always due to them not liking the way I looked. Different, you know? People back home didn't like anything or anyone being different. I figured it was how I dressed that weirded him out so much; but he looked like he had gotten dressed in the dark, so maybe not. Was dressing how I did something of a \"style\" here? \"Duckie, apologize.\" The girl scolded him like she was his mother. \"It's cool.\" I said, walking off. I was still feeling a little embarrassed and didn't really want to stick around outside. To my amazement, the girl walked with me. The guy trailed along behind us. \"I'm Andie Walsh.\" She said to me, offering a smile. I returned it as we entered the school, feeling a little more relaxed. I knew someone already! \"Maggie Myre.\" I said to introduce myself, \"I'm-\" \"Who the hell are you?\" The boy said from behind Andie and I, sounding more bemused than rude. I figured he was wondering where I'd come from, not specifically who I was. At least, I hoped that's what he meant; I'd just introduced myself after all. \"Duckie, go to class.\" Andie countered with irritation; maybe it was the venom in her voice that finally got the boy to clear off, because he was gone in a heartbeat. \"I'm sorry about him.\" She said to me, sounding sincere, \"He doesn't usually talk like that.\" \"Not a problem.\" I assured her as we stopped by a line of lockers, \"Is he your boyfriend?\" I asked as Andie started to enter her combination. She laughed in a highly sarcastic way. \"He likes to think he is.\" She replied cryptically, not really answering my question. I nodded anyway, and took it as a no. Not that it mattered, I was trying to get things straight before I said something to screw up what Andie and I had started here. \"His name isn't really 'Duckie', is it?\" I asked, feeling awkward. She laughed for real this time. \"No, it's Phillip Dale. But I can't remember how long it's been since I've called him that.\" Andie told me as she pulled an American history book out of her locker, \"He really is an alright guy. I've known him forever.\" She added, as if she felt she had discredited her friend somehow. I just shrugged. \"I'm not easily offended.\" I explained with a smile. Honestly, I was just glad to have met some people who shared my style. I was just happy to maybe make some friends. \"Andie?\" \"Maggie?\" I was at Trax the night of my first day in Chicago. Also surprisingly, Aunt Iona had been serious about putting me to work. \"Earning my keep\" she was calling it. I didn't mind yet, it was just my first day. However, I had not expected to run into Andie Walsh there. \"What are you doing here?\" She asked me from behind the register. \"Funny, I was wondering the same of you.\" I laughed in a surprised way as I closed the stock room door behind me. Ever one of good timing, my Aunt chose now to enter the sales floor from the front display window. She saw the two of us looking at each other and smiled in that way she had. \"Well look at that.\" She said, getting out attention, \"You've met on your own.\" \"So you work for my Aunt Iona?\" I chuckled, moving to stand closer to Andie as my Aunt went to check something upstairs. I didn't really want to entire store, which was actually rather busy for a little retail outlet in Chinatown, to hear our conversation. \" Iona is your aunt?\" Andie looked shocked, but smiled through it. I nodded. \"I'm staying with her this year; her and my mom have this evil little plot for me to finish school here. And I'm working here when I'm not at school.\" I explained. \"Small town.\" Andie said. I laughed and shook my head. \"No, big town. You should see where I come from.\" I disagreed, but with a light tone, \"Small world is more like.\" Andie agreed. \"So I guess we'll be seeing each other quite a bit.\" She said, \"Well, Duckie too. I'm actually surprised he isn't here yet.\" I rolled my eyes in mock disgust, because I felt we were on the level of friendship where I could joke like that. \"Well, if that's all I have to put up with to be your friend.\" I replied sarcastically. We both laughed together as she said not to take him being around all the time so lightly. I was already having fun. Maybe Chicago wasn't such a scary place after all![Chapter 3] Ok guys! Sorry it took a while to get out. As it was, I had actually shelved this story, but I got it back out after some out-of-the-blue inspiration. For those of you not familiar with my language, shelved means, literally, I put it on my shelf; it also means I'd pretty much put it away. Usually for good, but sometimes not. I'll ride this inspiration for as many chapters as possible. And hopefully I'll have another chapter out soon enough. Thanks for your patience. And thanks even more to ReflectedIRony, iLuvTwiBoyz, Faceskinator, RoseRedGurl, and IceDragonHikari for their reviews! Much love, dears. Tell me what you think, and enjoy! It had been a while since I moved to Chicago, and I was really coming to appreciate my mom's decision. Andie and I had become very close; I don't think she's ever had a girl best friend, with maybe the exception of that Jenna girl, so we bonded fast. Phil and I... well, we got along. He had the capacity to annoy me quite completely, but I actually felt very comfortable around him and found myself coming out of my shell. I told him a lot, we all did everything together, they were the best friends I'd ever had, to be cliché about it. In the few weeks since starting school here, not too much had happened. The second weekend I was given a break from working at Trax (Aunt Iona seemed to like me socializing with Andie, so she gave me time off sometimes), so Andie took me for a night out with some of her other friends to a place called Cats. The music was really great, but a little loud for my tastes, and the company wasn't the best. I liked Jenna well enough I suppose, but \"Stimulating Simon\" was hard to get along with. \"I kinda want to dance.\" I tried to say over the music; I don't think anyone heard me. I'd never been to a real concert before (they just didn't happen back home), so I couldn't really judge how loud to speak… or what to even do for that matter. \"I'm gonna go keep Phil company!\" I yelled as loud as I felt socially acceptable. Andie at least heard me, because she smiled and said okay back to me. \"Hey Phil.\" I said cheerfully, once outside the bar. I went to stand behind him and looped my arms over his chest. \"Oh, hey babe.\" He replied absentmindedly. \"Phil?\" The bouncer most people called Dice Man asked Phil, with a curious look and a crooked smirk. Phil shrugged. \"Maggie refuses to call me by my real name.\" He replied. \"Phil is your real name, you freak.\" I laughed. \"So, is this one your girl ?\" The bouncer asked, making me laugh harder. \"Oh please.\" I muttered. \"Uh- well, she's my newest girl friend. As you know, Dice Man, I've always been just so magnetic to the ladies.\" Phil said, with this (I'll admit) cute little smirk in my direction. \" Magnetic . Lemme tell ya.\" I said, taking his hat and placing it on my own head, \"I just can't keep my hands off this one.\" The Dice Man laughed again as I ruffled Phil's hair and lit a new cigarette. Just then Andie walked out of the bar. \"Huh. Let me guess, Duckie's pure animal magnetism is working its charms on you?\" She said to me. \"Oh good, are we leaving now?\" I asked her instead, immediately removing my arms from around Phil. \"Yeah. Not the best night at Cats I've seen either.\" Andie agreed with my implied criticism by making a face. \"Well I've got a whole school year to be shown a better time. Come on guys, let's roll.\" I said, heading over to Andie's beat-up but reliable car. \"Were you out here long, Duckie?\" I hear her ask as I get to the passenger's side door. \"Nah nah, three- four hours. And besides, our lovely Maggie here made that last bit of it rather enjoyable.\" He lifted his round sunglasses to wink at me. It was hard to tell when Phil was flirting for real or not, so I usually flirted back just as carelessly. \"Just doing my duty, sir.\" I replied, pulling his face down to my height by his bolo tie. \"Come on you two, it's time for bed.\" Andie said sarcastically while unlocking the doors. I was quick to hop in and slam the door shut. \"Yours or mine?\" He asked slyly, \"Ours?\" When he leaned against the door I took the opportunity to roll down the window and punch him lightly in the stomach. \"Shut up, Phil.\" I told him with a sly look of my own. \"Wow, Maggie .\" He gave me a bug-eyed look which would have made me giggle if I wasn't so used to it, \"Can you at least give me a ride home to make up for your guard dog assaulting me?\" He asked Andie as I growled playfully. \"Yeah, get in.\" She sighed, \"Get in back, Fido.\" \"Can I rest my head on your shoulder while you steer?\" He asked her as I climbed into the narrow space that went for the \"back seat\". \"Hmm, can I throw up in your hat if you do that?\" I asked him, peeking around the head rest for him to see I was serious. \"Okay, point taken.\" He said, slipping in to the seat I had just vacated, \"You're the boss, boss.\" Next week I was back to working at Trax. Andie was setting up a new display of sunglasses as I unpacked more records in the back. Hearing her talking to someone up front about some very sarcastic music recommendations, I glanced through the stock room door to see her smiling at someone who looked like that Richie, Blane. \"What an interesting turn of events.\" I whispered to myself as I turned back to the inventory only to see it missing, \"What?\" \"Hey babe.\" I hear from behind me. I stop looking for the box of records and put my hands on my hips. \"Hmm. That sure sounds like Phil's voice.\" I say, effecting a musing tone, but with an edge, \"But it can't be Phil because he knows how angry Andie and I would be to find him back here .\" \"Oh right.\" He said, getting my meaning, \"I'll just go out the back then.\" \"Phil, don't!\" But the alarm sounding told me I was too late, \"Come here so I can beat you!\" \"Duckie?\" I hear Andie yell, fumbling in the desk drawers for the key to turn off the blaring security alarm, \"Maggie, what's he doing back here?\" \"Asking to have his ass handed to him.\" I say, pulling him by his jacket lapels over to sit him down on the desk. \"Let me guess, you were using our bathroom.\" I glare at him after Andie turned off the alarm, \"Watch out for the boxes, Andie.\" I tell her when she almost tripped on the one I had been working on. If any of those records get scuffed from Phil moving them to the floor I'd make his life hell. \"Are you maaad ?\" He asked her, ignoring me. \"Are you duuumb ?\" I taunt him right back. \"Yes I'm mad!\" Andie spoke over me, \"There are public bathrooms all over the place.\" \"I'm not nine, Andie, I know that.\" He started off, sounding slightly irked, but covered it up by adding, \"I-it's just- it's the end of the month and they're out of toilet seat covers!\" \"You're being ridiculous.\" She said, crossing her arms. \"And vulgar.\" I added. \"And irritating!\" She continued, giving me a half-smile. \"And interfering ?\" I ask her quietly. She just pushes my shoulder and bites her lip, \"Go on.\" \"I've gotta get back out front. Babysit him.\" She says the last part loud enough for him to hear before leaving and shutting the door. \"Babysit?\" He says to himself. \"Yes, it's something responsible people do for children like- Phil, you moron, do you want Andie to-\" While my back was turned, he had taken the chance to rush over to the back door to open and close it as fast as could. Before I could pull him away from it the alarm was blaring again. \"Yeah, you better run!\" I call after him as he fled the building. I don't think Andie talked to him for a whole day after that.[Chapter 4] Woo! This one's out fast! Not much to say, except to thank iLuvTwiBoyz and Faceskinator for their lovely reviews. I'll keep you in mind if I ever need help getting a chapter started, dear. Tell me what you think, and enjoy! I was amazed how fast time was flying. Had it really been so many months? Was I really graduating in eight weeks? Was prom really happening within the month? And had I honestly found the perfect date to it? Well, yes to all but that last sentence. I still didn't have a date for prom; but that was alright for now. I was much more interested in Andie's crush on Blane McDonough, one of the most popular richies in the entire school. \"So, has Blane asked you out yet?\" I asked her one day between classes. We were hanging in the \"court yard\" (ha) with the other zoids. \"Hmm. No.\" She said, \"But we talked for a while the other day in the computer lab.\" And she proceeded to tell me all about Blane's \"computer trick\". \"Well that's promising.\" I said to her, \"Oh wait. Don't look now, but I think that's your man.\" I told her, noticing some richie breaching the barrier between the two worlds. He looked exceptionally out of his element. \"Oh God, that is him. What do I say? What do I talk about?\" She asked me, biting her lip in that way she had. With the exception of their chat in the lab the other day, Andie and Blane hadn't really talked much since the start of school. I guess he'd been pressured by his dick \"friends\" to stop conversing with her all together, and he must have caved into their criticism. But maybe this was a sign that he wanted to try harder this time around and disobey his friends' wishes. \"Spring is very conducive for love.\" I teased her quietly as Blane finally located us and started to head our way. \"Oh shut up.\" Andie said, looking down at her sketchpad and failing to hold back an elated little smile. \"How're you girls doing?\" He asked casually, swinging his sunglasses in his hand. \"Quite well, thanks.\" I replied, smiling as kindly as I could. \"Fine.\" Andie said nonchalantly, \"You?\" \"Okay.\" Blane answered her, glancing around at the other zoids, \"And you?\" \"Well- I just said I was fine .\" Andie laughed, messing with her sunglasses and elbowing me as I snorted. \"Oh yeah, sorry.\" Blane said, sounding embarrassed, \"Oh, am I interrupting something?\" He added, noticing me watching on with amusement. \"Not at all!\" I said hastily, \"I was just about to go make Phil go to history. See ya, Andie.\" I added with another teasing tone before standing up and leaving the two of them alone. Finding Phil was actually really easy. He was pestering some richie girls a little ways down the hall. From the way they were glaring I could guess what they were talking about. His pregnancy scandal was known school-wide. \"There you are, you tool.\" I said, pulling him by the arm farther down the hall. \"Hey Maggie.\" He said to me before turning his head back towards the girls, \"Don't forget my offer, ladies!\" He added before we disappeared around a corner. \"You are such a pig.\" I told him as I linked our arms. \"What, for offering a valuable service to the female student body?\" He asked, feigning innocence. \"I don't know any girl who wants a kid while still in high school.\" I explained while rolling my eyes, \"Besides, no one ever takes you up on it.\" I added to tease him. \"That's not true. You haven't declined yet.\" He said suggestively with a wink. \"Yet.\" I reminded him, \"I don't want to hurt your feelings is all.\" \"How would you saying yes hurt my feelings?\" He asked with a toothy grin. I snorted despite feeling my face grow warm. \"Oh please, you wish.\" I scoffed to cover up for myself. I just hoped I wasn't blushing. \"Oh babe do I.\" He agreed, moving his arm to my waist, \"So where are we going? Your place? My place?\" \" Our place.\" I replied slyly as I continued in the direction of our history class. \"Ooh, I like the way you're talkin', Maggie.\" He started, but stopped dead when he noticed where I'd lead him. \"What, are all these kids gonna watch? Cause I don't know if I'm into that, doll.\" He said as we entered the classroom. It was hard to tell when the joking started and stopped with Phil. \"Yes. They are all here to witness you going to history for the first time this week.\" I told him as he reluctantly took the seat behind mine, \"And don't forget, we're revising your essay tonight at Andie's.\" Later that night, the three of us were in Andie's pink bedroom. We were there to help Phil with his history essay; I had finished mine yesterday so I could be here for him tonight. But he simply wasn't in the game. As Andie described what the Warsaw Pact was, I shook my head and watched Phil screw around at her vanity. \"Hey dork.\" I said to get his attention, \"We're here for you . Pay attention.\" \"Jeez, bossy.\" He said, pushing my hat over my face; which in turn made me snap his suspenders, \"Ow, Maggie.\" He whined. \"Are you two listening to me?\" Andie asked over Phil's complaining. \"Yes.\" I answered, shoving him onto Andie's bed and plopping down beside her, \"What's he done wrong so far?\" \" So far ?\" Phil asked, sounding wounded. \"He's bullshitting.\" Andie answered me. I nodded and gave him a disapproving look. \"Well what about the rest of it?\" He asked, ignoring me. Andie continued to critique the paper while I got up to play with Ace. I listened vaguely while Andie told Phil about our idea as to why he was flunking his classes. We had discussed it last week after I had finally got fed up with covering for him skipping the classes we had together and yelled at him for it. Andie had told me she thought he was just doing it to stay in high school, and I had to agree with her. Phil wasn't exactly one to face things. \"You know, I hope I'm not the only one in the world who knows what an incredible person you are.\" I heard Andie say softly. \"Well, at this point, I'm afraid you are.\" Phil replied. I turned to face them and crossed my arms. \"Hey!\" I said indignantly, \"So what am I?\" The look on Phil's face was priceless, and it made it hard for me to actually be mad. I don't think he remembered I was there, or what he'd even said for that matter. \"You- are...\" He stammered, \"Well apparently you do too.\" He finished lamely as Andie stood up and walked to her door. \"You're an asshole.\" I laughed, pushing him as I joined Andie. \"After we get back from the kitchen, we have to work.\" Andie told him sternly, \"What do you want to drink?\" I didn't hear his reply because I was already tromping down the stairs. \"Sorry about him; he's an idiot.\" Andie said as she opened the fridge. \"He's an idiot.\" I agreed with a shrug, \"I'll have whatever you're having.\" While she searched for something good, I heard something. Seeing an air vent above me, I figured that's where the sound was coming from. But it was actually singing; and the voice was Phil's. \"Love is feeling.\" He sang, \"Feeling love!\" I laughed as I leaned against the wall. But it wasn't a typical laugh… \"You just giggled.\" Andie said to me in an accusing, but confused, manner while handing me a can of Pepsi. \"I just giggled.\" I repeated, just as confused. Then Andie noticed Phil's singing too. \"You giggled at Duckie.\" She said in that same tone, pointing a finger at the vent. A look of realization came over her face, \"You like Duckie!\" I was dumbstruck for a moment before dropping my Pepsi. \"Holy shit, I like Phil!\" I yelled.

He watched across the room as Andie Walsh and Blaine McDonnagh sat eating, talking, and laughing. Duckie had let Andie go. He had told Andie to go after Blaine but he had only said that. He would of died to have her for himself. Although he had met that girl Sarah at the prom, who he had had a good time with, it just wasn't the same. He got up, tossing his untouched lunch away. He took one last look at Andie who waved. He smiled back sheepishly and headed outside, making up his mind to skip the rest of the day's classes. Duckie sat outside the gym waiting for the last bell of the day to ring so he could see Andie. When he heard it he quickly stood up and licked his hands to slick his hair in the right direction. He leaned against the building and watched everyone head to their cars. He noticed Andie come out and just as he was getting ready to go talk to her, none other than Blaine followed her out. He watched as they got in his car and drove off. He scowled and rode home on his bike. Holding the phone to his ear, Duckie waited for the voice that had always sent his heart skyrocketing. After three rings Andie answered. \"Hello?\" Before he could answer his voice got caught in his throat and he hung up. He sat on his bed staring at the phone. He had planned on asking Andie to hang out with him this weekend, maybe go to the mall or something. He had never had a problem with calling Andie before but he was afraid to hear her say she was going to be spending time with her… ugh boyfriend. He placed his hand on the phone again, this time planning his attack. His hand sat there for five minutes before he picked it up and redialed Andie's number. Her voice came through once again. \"I swear, if this is a prank call…\" \"Surprise.\" Duckie forced a somewhat nervous laugh. \"Oh, hey Duckie. Haven't talked to you in a while.\" \"Yeah.\" He laughed again. \"Well, see, I was just calling to ask if you wanted to maybe…\" \"Duckie can you hold on one second? I have another call.\" \"Sure.\" Duckie sat there for about 10 minutes fiddling with the phone cord before Andie returned. \"Um, Duckie can we maybe talk tomorrow? Blaine and I are going out tonight. Don't want to be late.\" She gave a short laugh. His heart sunk. \"Sure Andie.\" He hung up and laid back down on his bed, half wishing he had never bothered calling.[Chapter 2] Well, here's chapter 2. Please read and review! This one is kind of long, so please bare with me. I own no rights to the movie Pretty in Pink , nor do I own any rights to it's characters. Chapter 2 The next morning, Duckie decided to get to school early to meet Andie at school. Walking down the seemingly empty halls, he made his way to her locker and waited. Never seen the school so empty. He thought to himself. He stood there humming as the halls slowly filled up with students. Eventually he saw Andie, arms full of books, walking towards him. He turned around and checked his breath and then turned back to lean against the locker coolly. \"Duckie you're in my way.\" She said in a bitter tone. He pulled away from the locker. \"Hey beautiful.\" He said looking over her outfit. She rummaged through her locker ignoring his greeting. \"Well are you going to acknowledge me? I mean you did hang up on me last night. I could have been dying. Maybe even murdered. You wouldn't know!\" His eyes got all big and he dramatically flung his arms in the air. \"Duckie, you weren't in danger.\" She said continuing to look through her locker. \"How can you be so sure? You weren't there!\" \"Duckie!\" \"What?\" She sighed and closed her locker. \"I have to go to class now. Maybe you should too.\" \"Maybe tomorrow. I have things to do today.\" \"Like what?\" \"Well, I was thinking about finally starting on building the world's biggest ball of twine. Or maybe seeing how many kids I can hit with spitballs or something. You know, those are very important skills to learn.\" Andie rolled her eyes. \"I'm gonna go now.\" She turned on her heel and headed to her class. Duckie sighed and turned around running into someone. \"Hey watch it jerk!\" He yelled before realizing he had run into a much larger guy. Upon realizing this he started dusting off the guy's jacket with his hands. \"So sorry, thought you were those kids I beat up this morning!\" He laughed nervously. Before he knew what hit him he was sitting in a trash can. After getting caught wandering the halls, Duckie found himself stuck in class. He sat doodling pictures in his notebook before being snapped at to pay attention. He continually looked at the clock waiting for class get out. When it finally rang he jumped up, grabbed his stuff and practically ran to Andie's locker. He slid to a stop in front of it and tried to catch his breath. Andie and Blaine came in sight... holding hands. Duckie felt his heart ache, longing for that other hand to be his. \"Duckie, right?\" Blaine said when they had reached Andie's locker. \"That's Phil to you.\" Duckie spat at him. \"Duckie, stop.\" Andie scolded, putting her books away. \"I didn't do anything.\" Duckie muttered under his breath. Andie rolled her eyes as she and Blaine strode off. Duckie scoffed. He stood there for a while. He couldn't get the image of Blaine and Andie holding hands out of his mind. Sticking his hands in his pockets, he casually walked down the hall, through the crowd, and out the doors where sat outside under a tree far from the school. He sat with his face in his hands. He finally pulled his head up and leaned it against the tree. He closed his eyes and pictured Andie. Her beauty, her charm, her grace... He heard the bell ring in the distance and thought it best to stay where he was for the rest of the school day. That evening Duckie rode his bike past Andie's house a few times. Finally, Jack, Andie's father came out and yelled at him to either come inside or go home. Duckie thought for a while and decided to come inside. He sat in the living room until Andie came downstairs, caught off guard by the sight of Duckie. She stood there in her pajamas, blushing. Duckie's heart leaped. He jumped up. \"If this is a bad time, I'll just go home. I bet my dog is hungry, yeah I'll just go.\" \"You don't have a dog, Duckie. Why don't you just come upstairs?\" She turned around and headed to her room. Duckie hesitated and then made his way upstairs. He plopped himself on her bed and twiddled his thumbs. Andie sat next to him. \"So what are you doing here so late?\" She asked. \"I was just in the neighborhood so I thought I'm come over and see what's up.\" \"At 11 o'clock at night?\" \"I couldn't sleep.\" Andie sighed and laid down on the bed. Duckie laid down next to her. \"Do you want to hang out with me this weekend?\" He blurted out. He felt his face get warm. \"I mean it's just we haven't hung out much and I figured we should.\" Andie was quiet. \"It's not a date or anything, it's just us as friends, like it used to be.\" He swallowed loudly. He was embarrassed that he made it sound like a date. \"Are you jealous of Blaine?\" She said rolling over to face Duckie. He blushed. \"No, why would I?\" He laughed nervously. \"Well you snapped at him today when he called you Duckie. Also you don't talk to me much anymore and seem to make a point of staying away from me when I'm with Blaine.\" She looked him in the eyes. He blushed harder. \"Yeah, I uh, I am a little bit.\" He felt his face burning as she kept staring at him. She smiled. \"I thought you were.\" She leaned closer to him. He swallowed loudly again. \"Uh so is that a yes or n-\" Andie had her lips pressed against his before he could finish. Duckie was in shock. For a few seconds he sat there lifeless before he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her back. He wanted this moment to never end. He was nervous though and felt stupid as he kissed her as he wasn't used to it. After a good 5 minutes she pulled back and sat up. \"I want to hang out this weekend.\" She said. Duckie sat up. \"Really? You're not just saying that?\" Andie laughed. \"Of course I mean it. We're best friends, aren't we?\" His heart dropped. \"Yeah, friends.\" He stood up. \"I'll just go ahead and schedule those skydiving lessons for this weekend. Kidding of course.\" He added as he slipped out the door. That night he dreamed of Andie's lips against his.[Chapter 3] Well, here's chapter 3. Please read and review! I own no rights to the movie Pretty in Pink , nor do I own any rights to it's characters. Chapter 3 That day at school Duckie had all the eyes on him. Whispers were heard everywhere. Duckie knew what they were talking about of course. But how had anybody even found out? Jesus, word spreads fast. He thought to himself. He looked for Andie all during first hour: looking through classroom windows yelling into the bathrooms but she just wasn't anywhere in sight. Considering he had already missed his first period he figured he would go ahead and ditch the rest of the day. He rode home on his bike. (Andie's Point of View) Andie sat in her math class tapping her pencil on her desk. She couldn't wait to get out of here. She wished she hadn't told Jena about the kiss with Duckie. She should have known someone would overhear and start telling everyone. Now Blaine wouldn't talk to her and everyone thought she was a slut. Tears were forming in the corners of her eyes. She wiped them away. God, I wish I hadn't kissed him I really wish... \"Andie!\" She jumped and found the teacher standing over her. \"Are you going to answer this problem or not?\" He pointed to the board. \"Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.\" (Duckie's Point of View) The weather was just right to be sitting outside away from school but Duckie couldn't enjoy it no matter how hard he tried. He sat in Andie's front yard picking the grass and tearing it up. He felt selfish for enjoying Andie's kiss even though it was probably ruining her life. Well he would just sit here and wait for her to get home and tell her that if she didn't want him as a friend he would be happy to do so. No you wouldn't, you'd die without her. He looked down at his watch. The glass was broken and the strap was ready to fall apart but he kept it with him anyways. Andie would be on her way home by now. So he waited...[Chapter 4] Please read and review! I think I'm getting the hang of writing now and I need all the opinions I can get! I own no rights to the movie Pretty in Pink , nor do I own any rights to its characters. Chapter 4 (Andie's Point of View) While Andie drove home from school she allowed herself to cry. Today has been real fucking dandy. She thought to herself. She started sobbing. She wasn't sure what she was going to do. She had tried to talk to Blaine after school and he claimed he had important homework to do and ran off. She was played to phone call in her head. \"Andie? I don't think this is going to work out anymore. But look on the bright side! You have Duckie.\" Would she have liked having Duckie? He loved her and she knew it but did she love him? Sure, as a best friend, but as more? She didn't know. She parked on the curb outside her house. How she had managed to make it home safe was beyond her. She could barely see through her crying. She grabbed her things and got out of the car. She wiped her eyes and headed up to the front door. She say Duckie out of the corner of her eye. She turned toward him. He was standing there with his hands in his pockets and looking at her. \"Duckie I really don't...\" She sniffed. \"I really don't feel like hanging out today if you don't mind.\" Duckie walked up to her. \"As much as I feel bad about kissing you, I also don't feel bad about it.\" Andie looked at him. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that it's the best thing that's ever happened to me,\" He stood there awkwardly. \"But you probably could have guessed that.\" Andie blushed. \"Yeah I did.\" The phone started ringing inside. \"Oh no,\" Andie said. \"Andie? Yeah, I think we should see other people. But that'll be easy for you!\" \"Better answer that.\" Duckie said. They went inside and Andie answered. It was her dad, calling from somewhere saying he wouldn't be home until late that night. \"My dad won't be home for a while.\" Andie said. \"You want to stay here? We can listen to some music or something.\" \"Sure I mean why not!\" He said nervously. \"Listen to a little music...\" He plopped down on the couch. \"Thirsty?\" Andie asked. \"Yeah I'll take a beer.\" Andie gave him a scolding look. \"Okay okay I'll take some juice.\" He said. Andie laughed and headed to the kitchen. She came back a few moments later with a juice. She handed it to Duckie. \"Here you go.\" \"Thanks.\" He said. He took a drink and set it down. \"Was school bad today?\" He asked quietly. Andie sighed. \"Yeah... Blaine is mad at me, and everyone is talking about us.\" Tears gathered in her eyes. \"Well what it matter what they think?\" Duckie said angrily. \"I do when they say I'm a slut!\" She yelled. Duckie shut up. Andie gently cried. \"I'm sorry I brought this up Andie.\" He said, as he put his arm around her. \"I'm stupid.\" His heart ached for her and he wished he could make her feel better. Andie laughed and wiped her eyes. \"You are.\" The phone rang again. Andie found herself reluctantly pulling herself away from Duckie. She walked across the room and picked up the phone. \"Hello?\" Her voice trembled. \"Oh, hi Blaine.\" Duckie stood up and followed her \"What do you mean?\" Tears filled her eyes again. \"No I understand. Good-bye.\" She hung up. \"He said maybe we should see other people...\" She said mostly to herself. She turned to Duckie and looked at him. He was standing there with his hands in his pockets watching her. He blushed when she gave him a weak smile. The weirdest sensation came over her when he did. Her mind filled with images of their kiss, how lovely it had been, and she realized something that she wished she realized before.[Chapter 5] Please read and review! Last chapter! I do not own any of the rights to the movie Pretty in Pink , nor do I own any rights to it's characters. - Danni Chapter 5 (Andie's Point of View) \"What happened, Andie?\" Duckie asked. \"Can't you tell?\" She replied. She sighed and sat down. Wiping her eyes she looked up at Duckie. \"But it's okay. It really is.\" \"You don't have to pretend Andie.\" Duckie said. \"I'm not.\" She reached over and grabbed Duckie's hand, pulling him next to her on the couch. She leaned her head on his arm. He put his arm around her shoulder. \"Duckie I'm really sorry.\" \"You should be.\" Andie pulled her head up and looked at him. \"What do you mean?\" Duckie reached over and picked up the juice she had given him. \"You know I hate orange juice with the pulp.\" He gave her a crooked smile. She smiled back. \"No that's not why I'm sorry.\" He swallowed loudly as she came closer to his face. \"Then what are you sorry about?\" \"That I never gave you a chance.\" \"Oh that.\" \"Yes that.\" She kissed him quickly then pulled back. He looked at her. \"Andie, I love you. I always have.\" He covered his mouth. \"I know.\" Andie laughed. He probably had no idea that everyone knew. He pulled her to him and kissed her. For once he didn't have anything to say. ","Summary":" Please read and review!

MOVE! She yelled at it within her mind. \"What the hell are you doing you little brat? Clean this mess off the table!\" Harry Wormwood barked at his daughter. \"Yes, daddy.\" Matilda quickly answered swiping her hand across the table and scooping up the scattered pieces of cereal into her palm before making her way over to the trash can. \"I work too damn hard for you to be wasting food like that!\" The large man with the receding hairline said. \"Sorry, daddy.\" Matilda said returning to the table to properly pour herself a bowl of cereal this time. Matilda scooped a spoonful of cheerios in her mouth as she sat deep in thought. Maybe this was all just her imagination, Matilda thought to herself ignoring her older brother, Mikey, who had began throwing his own cereal at her. She had thought for sure she had somehow blown that TV in the living room to bits the other night. All she had done was glare at it while wishing it would break and the next thing everyone knew, it exploded! Maybe it was all just a coincidence. Maybe she had stayed up one too many nights reading past her bedtime. Matilda simply sighed again as she got up and put her empty bowl in the kitchen sink before finishing getting ready for kindergarten. Matilda slipped on her favorite blue dress before carefully brushing her hair and tying it up with her red silk ribbon. After carefully going over her \"special homework\" from Miss Honey (8th grade algebra) she packed up her backpack and waited by the car. Soon Matilda was on her way to her most favorite place of all-school. Matilda smiled widely as she took her seat behind her best friend after saying good morning to Miss Honey. \"Want to hear something crazy?\" Matilda whispered to her friend. \"The other night I think I broke my families TV set; with my mind!\" \"I think you've been reading too much.\" Lavender said giggling. \"Yeah, I think you're right.\" Matilda agreed smiling, but suddenly frowned when she was alerted by a sudden pressure coming from her bladder. Matilda looked at the clock checking to see how much time she had before class started. If the Trunchbull found her out in the hallway even a second after the bell rang! She didn't even want to think about that! \"You okay?\" Lavender asked seeing the sudden serious expression on her friends face. \"I have to go to the bathroom.\" Matilda admitted blushing slightly. Normally she could hold it no problem, but today was show and tell and she didn't want to be distracted at all. Suddenly the bell rang as everyone ran to their seats before the Trunchbull made her morning rounds. Everyone jumped slightly as a large stern looking woman with her hair pulled into a tight bun holding a leather riding crop stormed in un-announced. \"Surprise inspection!\" The Trunchbull yelled snapping the riding crop in her hand. \"Everyone on your feet!\" All the children, including Miss Honey, nervously sprang up at attention. \"Textbooks have been going missing from my office!\" The Trunchbull said walking up and down the row of children glaring at each and everyone of them as they all nervously averted their eyes. \"I think I know just who the thief is!\" The Trunchbull said glaring down onto the small brown haired girl. \"Wormwood! Open your backpack!\" Matilda gulped as she picked up her bag and unzipped it before having it suddenly snatched out of her hand and overturned onto the floor. Textbooks of various grade levels spilled onto the ground with loud thumps as the Trunchbull bent down to pick up the Intermediate Algebra book that under normal circumstances a kindergartener should have no business carrying around. \"I-t's not what it looks like!\" Matilda stuttered as she felt the back of her dress grabbed. \"Oh, I think It's exactly what it looks like!\" The Trunchbull said smiling maliciously while showing off her yellowing teeth. \"You've been stealing books out of my office!\" She spat. \"Ms. Trunchbull, please-\" Miss Honey started to say. \"Shut up, Jen.\" The fat woman said grabbing a fistful of Matilda's hair from the back of her head causing the young girl to wince in pain as her eyes watered. \"I've caught the thief red handed! Don't try and cover for her!\" She snarled pointing the riding crop at the blond woman who looked on with a look of horror on her face. \"I'm taking the brat where she belongs and if you take one step out of this classroom you're fired!\" She threatened while dragging Matilda through the hall and into her office. \"No, please! Not the Chokee!\" Matilda begged as she was drug along. \"That's exactly where you're going you good for nothing thief!\" She yelled opening a separate door that had several large nails and pieces of glass protruding from the inside. Matilda grimaced as the door was opened to reveal the tiny space only a child could fit in without being impaled by the sharp pointy objects. \"Now stay there!\" The Trunchbull said pushing the young girl into the corner and slamming the door closed and bolting it with several dead locks. Matilda whimpered as she stood in place while the door was shut leaving her in total blackness. Tears rushed into the young girls eyes as she stood trembling in the dark from fear. How long would she have to stay in here? An hour went by and then another as the cause of the girls trembling went from fear to her steadily filling bladder. She tried to take her mind off of it by thinking about the latest book she had read by Charles Dickens. Matilda moaned quietly shifting from foot to foot thankful that her small size allowed her that much room to move about. Her teacher, Miss Honey, had been giving her textbooks from more advanced grades to help her prepare for college. The Trunchbull must have noticed they had begun to go missing from the supply cabinet in her office. \"I have to pee.\" Matilda whispered in agony as she grabbed the front of her dress and bunched the material inside her legs to get a better hold. What was it that she had read about the human urinary system? Girls her age could only hold so many mls before their bladders gave up. Matilda moaned again as she used both her hands to press down in order to apply extra pressure. She didn't dare call out for help for fear of her sentence inside the Chokee being doubled, or even tripled, but she was running out of time. If she had an accident who knows how the Trunchbull would punish her. Not just the Trunchbull, but her parents as well! Last time she wet the bed they took away all her books for a week! She was only three at the time to boot; she didn't want to know what would happen if her mom was called to the school to pick her up because she had wet. Matilda grimaced as she felt moisture beginning to enter her panties. She pressed down even harder and slightly bent her knees as much as the small space would allow. Another ten minutes in she had begun to leak for a second. Matilda wondered how long she had been in here. How many hours had it been? She moaned in desperation as a second longer leak escaped and then a third. \"SOMEONE HELP!\" She finally yelled out as the door began clanging as if someone was trying to open and close it without undoing the deadbolts. Finally after several hours Matilda lost control as she felt warm liquid beginning to trickle down her legs; slowly at first but picking up momentum as Matilda finally gave up and removed her hands as she sobbed. The steady stream of urine trickled and pattered onto the ground soaking her panties, socks, shoes and dress. Matilda continued to cry; she was hungry, tired, wet and miserable. Her eyes grew wide with fear as she heard someone approaching and undoing the dead bolt. There wasn't enough time for her accident to have dried; there was no way to hide this. She clenched her eyes shut waiting for the worst as the door was quickly opened. \"Oh, Matilda.\" She heard as she opened her eyes to find a very worried looking Miss. Honey. \"It's okay, sweetie.\" Miss Honey said pulling the girl out and wrapping her into a tight embrace while Matilda couldn't help but cry and beg for forgiveness. \"Honey, it's okay. It's not your fault.\" Her teacher said kneeling down to her height and lightly tracing the girl's tear streaked face with her palm. \"I'm sorry!\" Matilda continued to sob, but stopped when she felt herself suddenly get lifted into the air causing her to wrap her arms around Miss Honey's neck as she buried her head in her shoulder as she was carried down the hall. \"Please don't call my parents.\" She begged as she was set down in the bathroom. \"Why not? I'm sure they'll understand. Accidents happen-\" \"No! They won't!\" Matilda insisted locking her fear filled eyes with Ms. Honey's. \"I wet the bed when I was three and and.\" She said starting to sob again. Ms. Honey bit her lip anxiously thinking of what to do. Clearly something had happened in the past to worry her this much. This was so unlike the normally mature girl. Ms. Honey finally nodded in understanding as she remembered the last run in she had had with Matilda's parents. \"Alright, honey, I won't call your parents.\" The teacher assured her. \"How about you wait here and I'll see if the nurse has anything.\" \"Okay.\" Matilda agreed calming down some and went and hid in a cubicle until her teacher had returned. \"Matilda, I'm back.\" Ms. Honey said entering the girls bathroom carrying a dress as Matilda peaked her head out from the stall. \"How about you go in the big stall.\" She suggested as she began to dampen a washcloth in the sink before following the girl into the teachers only cubicle. \"Go ahead and take off anything that's wet.\" Miss Honey instructed as Matilda was forced to remove, well, everything while Matilda blushed as Miss Honey began cleaning her wet skin. \"I'm sorry, dear, but this is all the nurse had in the way of underwear.\" Miss Honey said apologetically as she held up the babyish teddy bear print diaper. Matilda blushed furiously while Miss Honey helped her put it on still standing and tape it up. \"I'm sorry.\" Matilda apologized again looking away once they were back in the empty classroom. \"This wasn't your fault.\" Miss Honey said kneeling down and wrapping her arms around the girl in a big hug. \"You don't have to keep apologizing. You were in there for four hours; I'm sorry I couldn't get to you sooner. Would you like to come over to my house after school? I can wash your clothes for you.\" She offered referring to the bag Matilda kept hidden under her chair containing her soiled dress. \"I'd like that.\" Matilda nodded with a smile.[Chapter 2] Jennifer Honey sat at her desk with a worried expression plastered all over her face. She shifted anxiously about in her chair as her eyes fell upon the empty desk that should have been seating her star pupil. While she loved each and every student in her kindergarten class; there was something special about Matilda. Her intelligence far surpassed any student in this school yet she was only six. How could she have been so stupid, Miss Honey chastised herself. She thought the Trunchbull wouldn't notice a few books missing here and there, but she was wrong and now Matilda was paying the price. She needed to find a way to get her out of there, but with the Trunchbull sitting in a chair in the corner watching her there was nothing she could do. Miss Honey bit her lip anxiously as she worried about Matilda. She had seen children come out from the chokee completely traumatized and she couldn't blame them. This had to be illegal she thought while she walked around passing out worksheets for her students. Suddenly the lights in the classroom began to flicker on and off as the Trunchbull jumped to her feet. Ms. Honey hid her smile knowing how superstitious the Trunchbull was. Maybe if something else happened she hoped while stealing the occasional glance over her shoulder at the giant olympian that was gawking up at the florescent lights while beating the case with her riding crop. Ms. Honey began instructing the children on how to work through the addition problems but froze mid sentence as suddenly the door to the classroom sprung open and then loudly slammed shut by itself. Ms. Trunchbull cowered away from the door as it continued to open and close by itself. Ms. Honey peeked into the hall as her eyes widened in surprise to see all the doors to all classrooms were opening and banging shut by themselves. The lights continued to flicker on and off as if someone was playing with the lightswitch. Ms. Trunchbull at that moments found what little courage she had left and sprinted out the door as it slammed shut behind her before opening once again. Teachers began peeking into the hallway to see what was going on as the Trunchbull sprinted down the hall, out the building and to her car. Ms. Honey immediately made a beeline for the principal's office after she timed her escape from the self operating doors. After jumping into the hallway she began sprinting until she got to the chokee to see the door rattling and shaking. Quickly Miss Honey unfastened the dead bolt and threw the door open to find the sobbing child standing in a puddle of urine. \"It's okay, sweetie, Ms. Trunchbulls gone now. You can come out.\" Miss Honey said gently coaching the shaking child into her arms. \"It's okay.\" \"I'm sorry!\" Matilda cried as she felt Miss Honey wrap her arms around her and pick her up. \"Shh. It's okay, Matilda.\" Miss Honey whispered rocking the girl in place noticing that the lights had stopped flickering and all was finally still. How strange she thought as she carried the girl into the nearest bathroom and set her down. \"Please don't call my parents.\" Matilda begged with wide pleading eyes filled with fear. Normally it would have been school policy for any and all accidents to be reported, but something in the girls eyes told her she should let this slide. What could she tell her parents anyway? Your daughter wet herself while we locked her in a cage for half the day? \"Alright.\" Miss Honey agreed. \"I'll try and find you something to wear.\" She walked back down the hall towards the nurse's office while ignoring the streams of kids and teachers pooled into the hall for lunch break. \"Ah, Jenny! What can I do for you?\" The school nurse said looking up from her paperwork. \"Hi, Carol. You wouldn't happen to have any clothes that would fit a six year old girl, would you?\" \"You can check the lost and found box.\" Carol said pointing to a drawer. \"Thank you.\" Miss Honey said digging through the box and pulling out a white one piece dress that looked like it would fit the girl. \"What about underwear?\" She asked after going through the box of mostly sweaters. \"No, I don't have any. What happened?\" Carol asked looking up. \"One of my students was put in the chokee for too long.\" Ms. Honey explained with a sigh. \"Poor things really shaken up about it.\" \"You want me to call her parents to come get her?\" Carol asked quickly putting the pieces together. It wasn't the first time a child had wet themselves from being left in there and unless something changed it wouldn't be the last. \"No, I don't think it's a good idea. I've met her parents before; I don't think she get's the love and support she needs at home.\" Miss Honey said. \"I think it would be better if I just helped her get cleaned up and we move on.\" \"You wouldn't be talking about the Wormwoods, would you?\" Carol asked going through some drawers. \"Yep.\" Miss Honey said nodding. \"How'd you know?\" \"I called her mom once when Matilda came in with a fever. She told me to tell Matilda to suck it up, told me not to bother her and hung up.\" Carol explained opening up a package and pulling out a plastic garment. \"She can't go without underwear so she'll have to wear this.\" She said holding up the diaper. \"You don't have anything else? I think this would just upset her more.\" Miss Honey said frowning while examining the folded up garment with cute printed teddy bears. \"It's not even a pull up.\" \"Sorry.\" Carol apologized with a shrug. \"Kids don't leave underwear lying around, thankfully. Here's a washcloth too.\" \"It'll have to do, thank you.\" Miss Honey said before rushing back to the bathroom to find Matilda hiding in a cubicle. \"It's okay, no one else is in here. How about you come out and I'll help you get cleaned up.\" \"What if someone walks in?\" Matilda squeaked while Miss Honey dampened the green washcloth in the sink. \"Then let's go in the big stall. I found some clothes that will fit you.\" Miss Honey said smiling comfortingly once Matilda finally stepped out of the cubicle and followed her teacher into the larger stall. \"Alright, let's see.\" Miss Honey said inspecting the damage. The poor thing was literally soaked. \"Go ahead and take off everything wet.\" Matilda silently nodded turning her head away as she pulled down her soaked blue striped panties and dress leaving her completely naked. She jumped slightly as Miss Honey knelt down and began wiping her legs down with the damp wash cloth. Matilda blushed and closed her eyes. She wasn't used to having anyone care for her and she definitely wasn't used to having accidents. Matilda let out a quiet moan in embarrassment and covered her face with her hands as the washcloth moved higher up her legs until she felt it cleaning her privates and butt. \"I'm really sorry about this next part, but It's the only option.\" Miss Honey explained as she unfolded the plastic garment as Matilda's eyes grew wide in shock as her teacher began taping a diaper on her waist. \"I-it was just a one time thing!\" Matilda whimpered while her teacher adjusted and played with the waist band. \"I'm- I'm not a -a baby!\" \"Of course you're not a baby; you are a very wonderful and mature young girl who just had a run of bad luck is all. We just can't have you going without underwear and this is all I could come up with.\" Miss Honey explained motioning for Matilda to lift her arms so the dress could be slipped on. \"There! All better.\" She said smiling as she unlatched the door while Matilda picked up her wet clothes and followed Miss Honey out. \"Thank you.\" Matilda said still refusing to make eye contact after they returned to the now empty classroom once they found a bag to put the wet clothes in. Miss Honey glanced at the embarrassed young girl who took her seat and stared out the window. Miss Honey wondered what she could to do make Matilda feel better until an idea struck her. \"Would you like to come to my house after school?\" Miss Honey asked. \"I have a large collection of all sorts of books you'd be interested in. I could even wash your clothes for you.\" She smiled seeing the shine in Matilda's eyes return as the girl nodded gleefully. The rest of the day went along smoothly without any paranormal activity. Miss Honey quietly chuckled to herself as she saw Matilda making weird faces as she tried to adjust to the extra padding underneath her. Miss Honey sighed in frustration while she quietly graded papers during nap time. While other students were learning how to read and write basic words and letters, Miss Honey had Matilda writing full essays and book reports. Another grammatically flawless research paper on the human heart she thought as she read over Matilda's work. Matilda didn't belong in kindergarten, or even elementary school for that matter, but the Wormwoods had nearly slammed the door in her face when she suggested she begin preparations for college. The Trunchbull was of course no help either, accusing Miss Honey of being weak minded and that she was attempting to \"pass the little brat off on someone else\". Seeing no other solution, Miss Honey took it upon herself to provide Matilda with the proper level of education she deserved and began trying to assess just how high of a grade level she should be at. So far she had aced every test this school had to offer which put her above the 6th grade. What she really needed was a full time private tutor, but there was no way she could ever convince the Wormwoods to pay for something like that. Once the final bell had rung dismissing the children, Matilda hung back eagerly awaiting getting to spend alone time with her favorite person. \"Ready?\" Miss Honey asked smiling as Matilda enthusiastically nodded her head. \"You need to call home first and make sure it's okay with your family.\" \"Oh.\" Matilda said as she bit her lip. \"Okay.\" She said finally dialing the number into the phone sitting atop the desk. Miss Honey frowned as she overheard the conversation on the other side that sounded a lot like \"Don't bother me with that.\" \"They said it's fine.\" Matilda lied. Close enough Miss Honey thought as she grabbed her stuff and walked out the door. … Just how had she let this happen Miss Honey thought as the two of them huddled together in the small closet in the mansion. She should have never told Matilda the story of her childhood. She thought that by explaining to Matilda that she hadn't grown up in a loving home either Matilda wouldn't feel so alone. The young girl had looked shocked to learn of Miss Honey's father's death and of being forced to live with the Trunchbull as her aunt growing up. What she hadn't expected was Matilda to run into the house when she told her of her lost doll that was left behind. While walking past the mansion that rightfully belonged to Miss Honey, the two had hid behind some bushes as they watched the Trunchbull pull out of the driveway and next thing she knew Matilda had made a mad dash inside to retrieve Miss Honey's doll. Overcome with sudden nostalgia Miss Honey had looked around instead of getting Matilda and making a run for it. Not five minutes later the Trunchbull had returned and the two of them were forced to hide in the nearest closet. That was nearly two hours ago Miss Honey thought as she sat on the closet floor with Matilda in her lap. Miss Honey grimaced as Matilda leaned back putting pressure on Miss Honey's full bladder while she cursed herself for not using the bathroom at school before she left. How was she supposed to know she'd be hiding in a closet from her deranged aunt all night? She wondered if this was how Matilda felt being stuck inside the chokee all day. She grimaced again as Matilda began shifting in her lap increasing her discomfort dramatically. The girls restlessness only seemed to be increasing as the minutes slowly dragged on. \"What's wrong?\" Miss Honey whispered in Matilda's ear when she heard a small quiet whimper escape the young girls mouth. \"I have to go pee.\" Matilda mumbled as she shifted again. \"Yeah me too.\" Miss Honey whispered back. \"As soon as she goes upstairs we'll make a break for it. Just try not to move so much.\" She said as she felt a sudden spasm from her bladder from the pressure of Matilda's constantly shifting weight against her lower stomach. Miss Honey began to worry that if they didn't make it out soon she really would feel like how Matilda felt earlier. At least Matilda was wearing protection she thought giving the girls front a pat to see if she still had it on. Miss Honey shook from the effort of clenching as Matilda squirmed causing a little to leak out. She'd have to get Matilda to sit still or else she was going to have an accident too. There was only one way that was going to happen. \"Sweetie, it's okay if you can't hold it.\" Miss Honey whispered through clenched teeth. \"Just go ahead and pee in your diaper.\" \"No, I can hold it!\" Matilda said pressing her hands into her lower half. \"I'm not a baby.\" \"This doesn't make you a baby.\" Miss Honey whispered wrapping her arms around Matilda to hold her in place. \"It's called being resourceful and making due with what you have available.\" \"But…\" Matilda mumbled trying to think of a counter argument. \"Sweetie, just go. You'll feel better.\" Miss Honey encouraged holding the girl against her while petting Matilda's hair. \"I won't tell anyone.\" \"Promise?\" Matilda asked as her face burned with embarrassment at the thought of wetting a diaper while sitting in her teachers lap. \"Promise.\" \"O-okay.\" Matilda mumbled turning her body and burying her head into Miss Honey's shoulder as the woman tried to comfort her by rubbing her back. Miss Honey bit her knuckle and clenched her thighs together while she heard the loud hissing of Matilda relieving herself into the garment secured to her waist. Miss Honey could feel the diaper slowly expanding atop her legs and growing warm. Matilda lightly trembled as she kept her head buried in her teacher's arms. \"It's okay.\" Miss Honey whispered when she realized the girl had begun to cry. \"Shh we still need to be quiet.\" She said as she lightly patted the girls back. \"I'm going to be in the same boat soon if we can't get out of here.\" She admitted as she sharply inhaled wishing the space she was in was big enough to move around. \"What time do you think it is?\" Matilda asked as she felt her teacher beginning to tremble and fidget. \"Six maybe.\" Miss Honey said through her now labored breathing. \"Matilda, no!\" She gasped as Matilda stood and slowly opened the closet door to peek her head out. \"She's watching a movie.\" Matilda whispered sitting back down in Miss Honey's lap who let out an audible groan. \"Miss Honey,\" Matilda said studying the pained expression on her teachers face in the dimly lit closet from the cracks in the doorway. She smiled sympathetically knowing her teacher wasn't going to last much longer. Miss Honey let out a weak smile as she clenched her fists at her side. \"I guess now I understand what you went through today.\" She groaned feeling a leak escape and then another as she desperately tried to keep holding it in despite her dress already becoming visibly wet. \"It's okay, Miss Honey.\" Matilda said wrapping her teacher in a hug once her little hand had felt the dampness on her teachers dress. \"I won't tell either.\" With misty eyes Miss Honey nodded knowing it was going to happen anyway. She patted Matilda's head as she forced her clenched and trembling body to relax. Almost immediately pee gushed and hissed into Miss Honey's panties as it pooled beneath her soaking her dress and legs. \"I can't believe I just did that.\" Miss Honey said with a depressed sigh. \" I haven't had an accident since I was a little girl.\" After another 20 minutes Matilda stood and peaked her head out the door again to find the Trunchbull snoring loudly in the recliner. \"She's asleep.\" Matilda whispered as Miss Honey stood from her puddle on the ground and peeked her head out. Quickly and silently the two made their way through the house and out the front door. It was nearly 7pm by the time they made it to Miss Honey's and both were in desperate need of cleaning up. After throwing all the clothes in the wash Miss Honey took a quick shower before calling Matilda's parents to ask if she could stay the night. After getting a less than courteous, \"You can keep her for all I care\" Miss Honey hung up the phone and was about to ask Matilda what she wanted for dinner when she heard a sudden \"Woah!\" Come from the living room. Matilda stood looking up at the overflowing bookshelf that took up nearly half the wall. Her brown eyes sparkled as she read over all the different titles. Miss Honey smiled as she quietly watched before taking a seat in her favorite recliner and instructed the girl to pick one. Matilda stood indecisive for a moment before finally choosing one about a dragon. Miss Honey then motioned for Matilda to climb up in her lap as the young brown haired girl eagerly obliged as she pushed up the sleeves to one of the woman's old T-shirts that nearly went down to Matilda's knees. After snuggling up close to her teacher Matilda began to read out loud with ease, never stumbling over any difficult words until she could barely keep her eyes open. Miss Honey finished reading the chapter for her as Matilda closed her eyes and rested her head on Miss Honey's chest as she listened to the woman's voice lulling her to sleep. \"I wish you were my mommy.\" Matilda muttered before losing consciousness. Miss Honey stopped reading in surprise and looked down to find the young girl fast asleep. She smiled and set the book down as she lightly stroked Matilda's back. \"I wish I was your mommy too.\" She replied.[Chapter 3] Jennifer Honey sat at her desk at home going over her finances on the computer after carrying Matilda to bed. There was just no way she could make this happen she thought as drew up a document of her monthly finances and bills. She could barely support herself on her income. How could she support a small child? Not to mention she'd need to get her a private tutor. Miss Honey sighed before switching off her monitor and joining the girl in her bed who appeared dead to the world. She smiled as watched the girls deep even breathing for a few moments before flicking off the light on her nightstand. It was a nice thought, but it could never work on her current income. Who's to say her parents would even just hand her over to her just because she asked? Them supporting her while living here would probably be too much to ask for as well. How would she even start that conversation? Hi, remember me? Since you don't seem to want Matilda, can I have her? There's just no way she thought until she felt a pair of tiny arms wrap around her waist as a small body huddled up resting it's head on her stomach. I'll find a way, Miss Honey thought to herself while running her fingers through the young girls thick brown hair as the pair slept peacefully through the night. Miss Honey was the first to awaken Wednesday morning in the darkened room. She squinted her eyes at the digital alarm clock which read 6:08 AM. Just a few more minutes, she thought taking notice of the sleeping girl cuddled up against her chest. She could be yours, the voice inside Miss Honey's head told her as she lightly rubbed the girls shoulder. Can she really? Miss Honey thought as the girl began to slightly stir. \"Time to wake up, Matilda,\" Miss Honey whispered as the girl slowly opened her brown eyes before searching the room in confusion until finally they met with the woman's kind smile. \"Did you sleep well?\" She asked as Matilda nodded her head in response as Miss Honey began lightly stroking the back of the girls head. Suddenly Matilda's eyes went wide as the color drained from her young face causing Miss Honey to retract her hand. Was she uncomfortable with this much affection? The woman tried to best to read the startled features on the young girls face, but came up with a blank. It was almost as if she looked...afraid? \"Honey, what's wrong?\" She asked growing concerned once Matilda's eyes had quickly begun to fill with tears. Suddenly the girl ducked into the covers before pulling them up over her head as she curled into a ball sobbing. \"Matilda, please come out.\" Miss Honey said worried. Did she do something wrong? Did she somehow hurt her? Why are the lights flickering? The bed is...shaking. An earthquake! \"I-I can't.\" The woman heard coming from underneath the covers. \"Why not?\" Miss Honey asked, but received no reply. \"Would you come out if I made...french toast?\" Nothing. \"Pancakes?\" Still nothing. \"You'll have to come out if you want to go to school.\" Miss Honey said smiling at finally seeing movement underneath the covers as a small tear streaked face popped out. \"What's got you so upset this morning? Are you scared of earthquakes?\" She asked as Matilda shook her head. \"The only time I've seen you this upset was when you...oh.\" Miss Honey said as she pulled back the blankets to confirm her suspicion. \"I-I'm sorry!\" Matilda said as more tears fell down her face. \"Matilda, it's ok.\" Miss Honey said with a soft smile. \"Look at me; it's ok. It was just an accident.\" \"I haven't wet the bed since I was three.\" Matilda mumbled looking back down. \"How about I run a bath for you, and we forget this happened? Just like yesterday,\" Miss Honey said as Matilda nodded her head as her teacher lead her into the bathroom to run the bath. Matilda stood awkwardly in the corner gripping the bottom of the now wet T-shirt as she watched Miss Honey fill up the tub for her. \"Go ahead and get in and I'll bring you your clothes and a towel.\" She said. \"Just go ahead and throw the shirt on the ground, and I'll wash it later with the bedding.\" Matilda nodded again and undressed before tentatively sticking her foot in the water to check the temperature before slowly lowering herself in the tub. I can't believe I peed in Miss Honey's bed, Matilda thought as she breathed a heavy sigh. That's three times in one day! She's never going to let me stay over again. Matilda let herself sink lower into the water as she imagined her teacher telling the entire class what she had done. What if she puts me in the chokey as punishment? Once Matilda was settled in Miss Honey walked to the back of her cottage where she stored her washer and dryer. After collecting the girls now clean clothes from the previous day and a towel Miss Honey stood in front of the open bathroom door studying the girls worried expression as she sat motionless in the tub. Poor thing, she thought before making her presence known. \"You look so down.\" Miss Honey commented as she sat on the closed toilet seat lid. \"I enjoyed getting to read with you last night.\" She said after a moment of silence. \"I enjoyed it too.\" Matilda said while finally meeting the woman's gaze. \"I'm sorry about your bed. You're probably never going to let me come over again.\" She said sadly. \"Matilda, it's normal for kids your age to occasionally have accidents; these things happen. Haven't you ever read that?\" \"I did, but it's not normal for me.\" \"Have you been stressed more lately?\" Miss Honey asked as she began digging through the bottom cupboards underneath the sink and produced a large plastic cup with a nearly completely faded design. \"I guess being put in the chokey was pretty scary.\" Matilda admitted. \"It would scare me too.\" Miss Honey agreed as she dunked the cup into the water and poured it over the girls' head. \"I don't like being in tight spaces. Miss Trunchbull used to lock me in the closet for hours as punishment. Ever since I can't handle feeling trapped.\" \"Were you scared yesterday in the closet?\" Matilda asked as Miss Honey nodded. \"I was, but you were there with me so it wasn't too bad.\" Miss Honey said splashing the girl in the face. \"Hey!\" Matilda said giggling. \"You're always welcome here, Matilda; bed wetter or not.\" Miss Honey said with a smile as the light returned in the girls eyes. \"Really?\" Matilda asked. \"Really.\" Miss Honey answered. \"As long as it's okay with your parents of course. I can't just kidnap you, but whenever you feel like staying over you're more than welcome. \"Now, think you can hand me that shampoo bottle over there? It's the white one in the corner.\" \"Sure.\" Matilda said as she stretched out her hand. Suddenly the white bottle began to shake before it slowly rose in the air by itself and floated gently into the girls outstretched hand. Matilda stared at the bottle in utter shock before slowly meeting the woman's equally stunned gaze as the two sat in silence trying to process what just happened.[Chapter 4] Matilda sat alone in her room amongst the pile of borrowed library books thinking about the past two days. It seemed no matter how hard she tried, her thoughts kept drifting back to her afternoon in the Chokey. The feeling of being trapped inside that tiny little space made her chest tighten in anxiety. She closed her eyes, while taking a few deep breaths as she leaned back on top of her bed. It was bad enough she had had an accident then, but to follow it up by being put in a diaper by Ms. Honey. She shivered at the thought. Then she got them both locked in a closet for several hours where she ended up wetting the diaper, and poor Ms. Honey, she thought. It must feel so much worse for an adult to have an accident. To top the whole day off, she just had to go and wet the bed! \"Ugh\" Matilda moaned softly. Other than that though; it had been so... nice. Never before had she felt so cared for than she had in that 24 hour period. She smiled as she remembered the feeling of Miss Honey's warm arms wrapped around her. When was the last time her own mother ever made her feel like that? Had she ever? No, definitely not. She had never held her or read with her, or even... said she loved her. How many perfect scores on tests had she shown her in hopes of earning some kind of praise only to be told, \"that's nice\" or \"I'm on the phone\". The way Ms. Honey had held her though. It had made her feel like she was actually...wanted. She probably does that with all her students though; It's not like she was anything special. So what if she could read at a higher level or do a few math problems. She probably does that all the time. \"I hope she lets me come over again sometime.\" Matilda mumbled wrapping her arms around her pillow pretending it was her teacher's soft stomach as she remembered the lovely feeling of having her hair played with. Would she ever let her over again, she wondered. It wasn't just the bedwetting that was the problem now after all. Matilda had actually scared her teacher. She grimaced as she remembered the look Ms. Honey had given her after the bath tub incident. It was a look of pure fear. \"She probably thinks I'm some kind of freak now; that's definitely why she wants to meet with my parents alone tonight.\" She had had this inexplicable feeling for days now that something...strange was going on with her and just the other day wasn't she trying to move cereal around? To think that it actually happened though. It wasn't just her imagination; it really happened! She was elated when she had gotten over the initial shock, until she saw the look on her teachers face however. The two had walked to school that morning in complete silence, leaving Matilda to wonder if she had done something wrong. She hadn't meant to make the shampoo bottle move on its own, it just sort of happened. She went to reach for it, but it came to her instead. The feeling of guilt intensified when Ms. Honey forbid her to tell anyone what had happened that morning; even Lavender. She felt kind of bad ignoring her friend all day in favor of daydreaming or looking over at Ms. Honey for some sign that she wasn't in trouble. If only she'd smile gently at me like she usually does, she thought unaware her teacher was lost in her own thoughts. Matilda had been so distracted that day that she hadn't even finished all of her special school work like she usually did and was forced to take it home as homework on top of her usual reading assignments. Pre-Algebra and intro to chemistry just didn't hold her interest like usual. When Matilda heard the doorbell ring, she sprang to her feet and dashed to the end of the hall peeking her head around the corner so as not to be seen. She could hear her parents grumbling about their show being interrupted as an unhappy Harry Wormwood opened the door to find one of his least favorite people standing in the doorway. \"What do you want?\" Harry barked. \"Mr. Wormwood.\" Miss Honey said trying to stand up as straight as she could under the intimidating man's glare. \"I'd like to talk to you about the possibility of adopting your daughter.\"[Chapter 5] The twenty-three year old dirty blond haired woman sighed and bit at the inside of her cheek as she asked herself for what felt like the millionth time how she was going to make this work. It would help if her aunt didn't take most of her paycheck, but the fact of the matter was, she did. Nearly all of it. She told herself, as she had told herself many many times, it was the only way she could get this job. The Trunchbull had gotten her way, as she always had by terrorizing the girl growing up, and had prevented the woman from attending college, even though it was Miss. Honey's dream to become a teacher. She was lucky in the sense that the Trunchbull didn't care if the teachers she hired had proper teaching credentials or not, as the children's well being was not her first priority- or any priority. Cranham Hall had an extremely high turnover rate for teachers, as it was widely known the Trunchbull would simply fire anyone right before hitting tenure, if they could even last that long. Most simply gave up mid year. As far as Miss Honey was concerned, they'd never had a teacher last more than a few years before they'd crack under the terror of the Trunchbull. So whether it was desperation, or the Dictator like Principal simply wished to continue tormenting her niece by keeping tight reigns on her, she offered Miss Honey a teaching job, under a signed contract that 75% of her wages went directly in the Trunchbull's pocket. For \"Back payment of raising her,\" the woman had said. \"It's not like she could teach anywhere else without a degree,\" She had told herself many times and even though she took home less than a part-time minimum wage job, she was happy….sort of. At least she was making progress. It had taken years of saving to move out on her own into her shack of a cottage, but she was finally free! - sort of. Money wasn't everything after all, but now that she was considering expanding her one person family- it was certainly becoming a bigger and bigger problem. A problem so big in fact, she was about to face her biggest fear of all- her aunt. Her legs trembled at the thought as she tried to take deep even breathing to calm herself down. She wouldn't ask for much, perhaps make it a 50/50 deal instead of 25/75. That was reasonable, right? And that was how she had ended up in front of the headmistresses door, her legs were shaking, she felt like she was going to be sick, but it had to be done- for Matilda. \"What do you want?\" Trunchbull yelled from the other side of the closed door ten minutes later once Jennifer Honey had managed to find the courage, somehow, to knock on the door. \"M-Ms. Trunchbull...It's..-It's me.\" The woman choked out, fear evident in her voice- just the way Ms. Trunchbull liked it. \"C-can I come in?\" She asked after receiving no reply. \"Whatever.\" She finally heard before pausing to calm her nerves, and gently pushing open the door with a creak. \"Well, what is it? I don't have all day!\" The Trunchbull barked after seeing no effort on Miss Honey's part to begin speaking first. A trait the Trunchbull had taught her very early in life. Do not speak without being spoken too- ever. That was the number one rule. \"I-i've been thinking of starting a family.\" Miss Honey finally said trying her hardest to keep from buckling under the Trunchbull's menacing glare. \"What? You actually found someone that would fuck you!?\" The Trunchbull laughed in a disbelieving way as Miss Honey cringed at the sudden rise in her voice and coarse language. \"You expect me to believe someone- no ANYONE, wants to see your disgusting body. Don't make me laugh!\" She said taking her infamous riding crop and circling around the young trembling woman while looking her up and down. \"With what breasts will you tempt him with?\" She asked taking the end of her crop and circling around Miss Honey's chest and poking at each meager lump underneath her shirt. \"With what ass will you shake at him?\" She suddenly cracked the whip against Miss Honey's backside causing the woman to yelp in pain. \"Or are you trying to marry for money perhaps?\" The Trunchbull said forcefully taking the younger woman's chin in her hand and forcing the terrified soul to look her in the eye. \"ANSWER ME!\" \"There is no man!\" Miss Honey said anxiety gripping her core. This was a bad idea, this was a very bad idea. \"So then what are you planning, you conniving bitch! Trying to run away from me are you?!\" \"N-No, Miss Trunchbull, I-I was thinking of..of adopting a child!\" She stuttered out as the beast of a woman finally released her face. \"O-one of my students actually.\" \"Oh, and where do you plan to come up with that kind of money? Being a whore? It would suit you.\" The Trunchbull sneered. Jennifer closed her eyes in order the hide the fear in them. \"I-I was hoping we could re-negotiate my contract...a little.\" \"Why would you even want one of those disgusting little things?\" The Trunchbull asked sitting down in her chair as her lip curled in disgust. \"This girl is...special, unlike anything i've ever seen. I just want to raise her in an environment where she would feel wanted and appreciated, most of all, loved.\" Miss Honey said. \"I was hoping maybe, I-I could keep a bit more of my salary so this could be possible.\" \"I'll give you 75%\" The Trunchbull said so suddenly Miss Honey didn't believe her ears. She could only stare at the woman blinking in confusion as the sudden understanding. Was she finally coming around? With 75% she could pull it off! \"IF\" Miss Trunchbull started to say with a wicked smile showing off her rotting teeth. \"You can last the rest of the day in there.\" She said as she pointed her riding crop at the Chokey. Miss Honey's face fell faster than a rock falling to the bottom of a pond. In there? There was no way...not anymore. It was the place that haunted many of her nightmares. The thought of stepping anywhere near that box of death made her lungs feel as though they were no longer doing their job. A cold sweat broke out over the woman's skin as her eyes filled with tears. \"A-anything but that, please!\" She begged backing away from the door as her past childhood trauma at the hands of aunt came crashing down on her. \"Since you obviously don't want her, I take it you'll have no problem with me expelling her, will you?\" The Trunchbull grinned. \"You'll never see that brat again.\" \"No! Please, No!\" Miss Honey begged as tears fell from her face. \"Don't send her away!\" Miss Honey cursed herself. Why did she have to be such a coward? Why couldn't she be brave and stand up to her aunt? Matilda stood in there for hours yesterday because of her; so why couldn't she do the same in return? \"What will it be? Get in the box or say good-bye to Wormwood.\" She taunted grabbing Jennifer by her wrist. \"Now doesn't this bring back memories. Get in the closet or I'll break your wrist...again.\" She whispered pushing the struggling woman towards the chokey. \"I won't fit!\" Jennifer tried to counter attempting to become dead weight, but the menacing giant pulled her along as if she weighed nothing more than one of the children the Trunchbull bullied herself. \"Oh, I'll make you fit, Jen. You're still the little whiny, spineless coward you've always been. I think a little time in the Chokey will do you some good.\" She said pulling open the door with one hand and tossing her in with ease. \"A single peep out of you and you'll never see the little brat again!\" She said and with that, the door was slammed shut in Miss Honey's face as bits of nails punctured her arms. She was indeed too big, but she managed to crouch down and pull herself in a ball in order to avoid any more superficial wounds from the doors \"decorations.\" The only question was how long she'd last. She was beginning to hyperventilate and it had only been a few minutes. The Trunchbull was right; she was nothing more than a coward who couldn't stand up for herself or others. What would Matilda think if she saw her like this? She was crying like a punished child. Pull yourself together! Matilda went through this yesterday and was fine! Shooken up sure, but fine. She would be fine too. Deep breathes and keep your thoughts on something else. Miss Honey distracted herself with thoughts of the heroines in books she had loved as a little girl. Books had always helped her through those long miserable days as the Trunchbulls \"plaything.\" How many hours had she locked herself in her bedroom reading as an escape from her deranged aunt? Jennifer had always dreamed of being brave like them, but in truth, she was as weak, timid and powerless now as she was back then. Her goal was simply to be the kind of adult she wished she had in her life growing up. What she really wanted most of all, was to be that adult in Matilda's life. From what she could tell, she deserved so much more than what her \"family\" had to offer. Matilda needed someone who could recognize just how special she really was- strange telekinetic powers and all. Miss Honey smiled faintly in the darkness remembering the previous night. Matilda had indeed said she wished Miss Honey was her mom, and it had sent the woman's heart a flutter like nothing ever had before. She had greatly enjoyed getting to cuddle up in her favorite chair while holding her and just listening to her read until Matilda had fallen asleep in her arms. It was pure bliss and the ache in her heart longed for more. Miss Honey had a lot of time while locked up to think about her second largest challenge. How would she convince the Wormwood's to give her custody of their daughter? While not the most intelligent beings on the planet; they were certainly proud and marching to their house and accusing them of bad parenting sounded like a terrible idea. Another problem she encountered was how they viewed her. While clear they did not care for their daughter as a person; they might think of her as their \"property.\" As terrible as the thought sounded, it was the only way Miss Honey could imagine winning custody. She would have to play their game. It sounded horrible to the woman and she cringed at the thought, but the more she thought about it, the more she realized it was the only way. \"Oh, Matilda, please forgive me for what I'm going to say tonight.\" She whispered. She was smart; she'd understand it was all an act.[Chapter 6] Matilda sat in her bed gripping her stuffed bear tightly. What was going on? Why was her teacher here at the house? The temptation to peek her head out of her room was quickly building up more and more. Her father had been in a bad mood when he got home from work, something about a raid on a warehouse and profit losses, but he may as well have been speaking an entirely different language. Matilda knew lots of things far above her age range's capabilities, but her father's business practices was an area she purposefully let herself be uneducated in. Some things she knew were best left unknown. They had just sat down in front of the TV when there was a knock on the door. Whoever it was, Matilda had thought at the time, they in for an unpleasant surprise. There were two rules in the Wormwood house: Don't interrupt Harry Wormwood when he was eating, and don't interrupt Harry Wormwood when he's watching Tv. This person had broken both those rules. At first, he pretended he didn't hear it and kept on eating his microwavable meal, but then the knocking began again. He snorted in annoyance with a, \"I'm not getting that!\" Matilda knew better than to answer the door as well. If Harry Wormwood didn't get the door it meant no one was to either. When the knocking became more persistent, Harry Wormwood slammed his silverware down before pushing his tray away with enough force to knock it over. The air had become tense. No one uttered a single word while Harry stormed over to the door muttering curse words under his breath the entire way. The rest of the Wormwood family craned their necks to see who was brave or stupid enough, to come knocking on the door during dinnertime. Harry had sent the last door-to-door salesman running in a panic with a message to the others never to come back. When Matilda saw that it was her teacher, her heart sank. She was the last person she wanted to see treated poorly by her father. \"You again!?\" He had shouted, before turning and glaring daggers into his daughter. It was her teacher; therefore, it must be her fault Harry's logic told him. \"Room. Now!\" And that was how she had ended up here in her room, worried out of her mind for the one person who had ever shown her kindness. Her curious mind couldn't take it anymore. She slid out of her bed and hurried over to her door. She quietly as she could pulled it open and cringed at the loud groaning sound it made. She stood in place terrified as she wondered if anyone else heard that. After a minute or two of no one storming down the hall to punish her for trying to eavesdrop, she let out her held breathe and tried to focus on what was being said. Try as she might though, she couldn't make out a thing. She had to get closer, she thought. She slipped out her open door and as quietly as she could tiptoed down the hall. Matilda stopped at the edge of the hall right before she knew she could be spotted. She held her breath as she strained to listen. … \"Mr. Wormwood, did you know it cost 35,000 pounds a year to raise a child?\" Miss Honey said. She was anxious and sweating. She was about to pull off the biggest bluff she could think off, in other words, she was lying through her teeth. She had no idea what it cost to raise a child, but if she had to guess, it was more around 10,000 a year. It was still 10,000 more pounds a year than she had. She was so relieved when Mr. Wormwood had told Matilda to go to her room so she wouldn't have to say this in front of her. She'd look like an idiot. The first thing she had done was butter him up. She complimented his house, his wife, his business sense, and it had taken all her acting skills to do so, but also his intelligence. She had wanted to gag when she said those things, but it had served its purpose. Suddenly she went from unwanted intruder to guest of honor. She hated everything about what she was doing, but she had no choice. She had to play these people's games. Mr. Wormwood's smug smile faltered as he stared at her with a look of utter horror on his face. She could see the gears moving behind his eyes as he tried to do the math in his head. If she weren't so nervous she would have surely let out a chuckle at how comical he looked. His face reddened like a frustrated child about to throw a tantrum over a simple math problem. \"But I have two!\" He finally blurted out before clenching his jaw. \"Did you know that girls cost almost twice as much as boys?\" She lied again. \"We are materialistic beings: clothing, accessories, make-up, jewelry.\" If he had half a brain he would have noticed Matilda was not that type of girl, but fortunately for Miss Honey all Harry could see were the dollar signs flying out of his pocket. He looked to his wife as she simply shrugged. It was true for her, so why wouldn't it be true for the little runt as well. \"I can't afford two of you!\" He barked. \"Just last week she spent almost 125 pounds on hair products!\" \"Well, sow-rry, but my hair gets all frizzy when I use that cheap stuff.\" Mrs. Wormwood complained twisting her long blonde locks in between her fingers. \"I could lose my business!\" He said. Miss Honey smiled on the inside. This is exactly what she had hoped would happen. Clearly their finances were more important to them than their children. Just one final jab into his pride. \"What would the neighbors think of that?\" Miss Honey said trying to sound as casual as possible. \"It's too bad you decided to have more than one kid. I could see you starting the next Vauxwell Motors.\" She watched his face turn bright red. She wasn't sure if he was about to yell and scream or simply internally combust. Finally he let out a defeated sigh. \"You know, it might still be possible.\" She said. He looked up at her, eyes begging for a solution. \"Your son, he seems like such a good boy, a spitting image of you in fact. You could put him to work and together you could make that dream possible.\" \"Yes, you're right. He is a spitting image of me, and if he's anything like me, you know he'll be great!\" He said. Miss Honey nodded her head as she felt a little bit of her lunch coming back up. \"Just think, Wormwood and Son, 1,000 car lot right off the highway where everyone could see your name.\" His eyes shone brightly as he saw the dollar signs. Maybe he could even afford a commercial! \"But Matilda…\" Miss Honey said with a grimace. \"As her teacher, I can honestly say, she doesn't have what it takes.\" \"That runt is a burden to us all. I hardly believe that's my own flesh and blood. I think there was a mistake at the hospital.\" He scoffed. \"What if I told you I had a plan that would save you 15,000 pounds a year and take away the burden of having someone like her in your family?\" On the outside, Miss Honey remained calm and collected, but on the inside she wanted to scream. How could she say those things about her? Where was this manipulative lying side coming from? If her father could see her he would be ashamed. \"You could sure make quite the investment into your business with an extra 15,000 pounds a year.\" \"Yes, yes I could!\" \"What if, for a measly 850 pounds a month, I raised her for you. I could turn her into a proper Wormwood for you.\" \"And you can't do that at that school I'm sending her to?\" He asked suddenly becoming suspicious. \"Why should I pay you?\" \"She'll be out of my class in less than a year. Then she'll go to some other teacher that doesn't have your best interests at heart. Not to mention, normally, it would cost closer to 3,000 pounds if she stayed here with you.\" Miss Honey said. \"Why should you bother to raise her if she'll be no use to you?\" She dug in her bag for the paperwork. This was it. All they had to do was sign this paper and she'd have a legal document agreeing that they would pay her child support. She wasn't proud by any means of what she'd done, but once she had Matilda it wouldn't matter. \"So if I sign this?\" Harry asked looking over the document. She could see him stumbling over the larger words as he tried to make sense of the situation. \"Then she's out of your hands and you're one step closer to that empty lot by the highway.\" She said. Her hands shook as she bounced her knees in anticipation. She was bouncing her knees so much she was shaking the whole coffee table. Wait…that wasn't from her, the whole house was shaking! The last time this happened…Oh no! Miss Honey looked up and saw Matilda standing in the hallway. Her expression was one of which Miss Honey had never seen on her before. Tears were streaking down her face, not of sadness but of rage. Suddenly Mrs. Wormwood screamed. Photo frames, dinner trays, and sharp silverware was flying around the room. Even their 75 lb television set was hovering off the ground. \"Ghosts!\" Mrs. Wormwood shouted. \"The ghosts are back!\" She stood on the couch screaming and using her arms to cover her head. Did these people really believe in ghosts? \"Not again!\" Harry shouted grabbing a broom as he swatted at the flying silverware. So they didn't know about Matilda's powers. She could use this to her advantage. \"Look!\" Miss Honey shouted amongst the chaos. \"Look at Matilda! She's possessed!\" Matilda's eyes narrowed even more as everyone looked at her. The house shook even more violently and to confirm their fears, she lifted her hand and pointed it towards her father as a Tv dinner tray came from behind and smacked his bottom repeatedly. He swore loudly and as he begged for someone to help him. \"It really is her!\" Mrs. Wormwood shouted. The house was utter chaos. The light bulbs shattered one by one along with the tv screen. Fashion magazines swarmed around Mrs. Wormwood as she screamed and batted them. Michael was cowering underneath the coffee table, large butt sticking out as a prime target. Another tray dinner tray swooped down and smacked him as he shot up howling only to hit his head on the table. \"Sign the paper and it will stop!\" Miss Honey said amidst the chaos. \"I will take her and banish the demons plaguing her!\" \"Sign it, Harry!\" Mrs. Wormwood shouted. \"Where's a pen?\" Mr. Wormwood shouted. A drawer off to the side began shaking violently and burst open as a pen shot out and stabbed into the coffee table just inches from his fingers. \"She's trying to stab me!\" He shouted before tugging the pen out of the table and signing the paper. \"OUT! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!\" Miss Honey grabbed the paper, grabbed Matilda's hand and ran out the door as everything in the air fell to the ground. Now the only problem was calming her down. \"Matilda, I am so sorry you heard that! I didn't mean a word I said! It was all a trick! It was-\" Miss Honey searched the young girls face for the rage and fury it so obviously shown earlier, but to her surprise, all that was there was a mischievous smile. \"I know it was.\" Matilda said calmly. \"You…you mean you're not mad?\" \"You're not the only one who can act. My father is stupid, but he would eventually figure out it was a trick. I needed to improvise to make him afraid. You played well on his pride and love of money, but the one thing that drives him even more is fear.\" Matilda explained. Miss Honey stared at her in amazement. To think a six-year-old girl could process her surrounding that well. What surprised her even more was the suitcase and backpack she carried. Miss Honey hadn't even noticed until just now. \"You're packed?\" She asked. \"How did you pack so fast?\" \"I had everything ready days ago.\" She said with a smile. \"I just knew you'd save me!\" Matilda quickly latched on to the woman's waist as they stopped walking. Miss Honey smiled widely as she bent down and held her new daughter in her arms. \"I love you.\" Miss Honey whispered in the girls' ear and she lifted her up and carried her the rest of the way home. \"I love you too,\" Matilda said with a wide smile as she rested her head on the woman's shoulder and closed her eyes. \"So how do you plan to rid me of my demons?\" She asked with a giggle. \"I guess it's something we'll just have to figure out together.\"[Chapter 7] \"Matilda, please come out.\" Jennifer Honey said, trying to coax the small child out from under the blankets. The lump ever so slowly began to move forward until a small face emerged sporting a look of pure guilt. \"It's not your fault.\" \"I'm so-\" she tried to say, but was cut off by a gentle finger pressing against her lips. \"You don't have to apologize every time this happens. It's okay, I promise. Why don't you hop in the bath and let me take care of this? Leave your wet things in the hallway.\" Matilda nodded her head and unpeeled herself from the covers before she made her way to the bathroom, head hung in defeat. At least the house didn't shake this time, Jennifer thought to herself as she stripped the bed. Maybe she should schedule her a doctor's appointment. In the week that Matilda had come to live with her, this was the third time she had wet the bed. With Matilda swearing up and down this never usually happens, Jennifer was worried. Perhaps Algebra two was a little too advanced for the six year old. Or maybe it was their other training that was too much for her little body to handle. What would she tell the doctor? I think my newly adopted daughter, whose parents I convinced was worth less than a car dealership, is wetting the bed because of the physical strain of having telekinetic powers? Oh yeah, that'll go over real well. They'd think I was nuts. Great job, Jenny, lose custody over her before the paperwork is even finalized . It wasn't like Matilda could use her powers on demand yet; although they had been having fun trying. The first night started with her attempting to levitate a piece of popcorn. Jennifer would throw it in the air and Matilda would try to manipulate it into her mouth. After a handful of failed attempts, they spent most of the evening just throwing popcorn at each other. It was great. They giggled, lost in an all out free for all, the purpose of the exercise completely forgotten. It wasn't until Jennifer had launched a handful at Matilda's face did they remember why they had started this in the first place. Instead of showering the young child in bits of popped kernels, they froze midair, suspended in place by invisible hands. It was then they discovered emotions to be the driving force behind it. The lights had flickered on and off because she was afraid. The popcorn kernels hung in the air because she was happy, and the worst of all, the night Jennifer had taken Matilda from her home. She had been hurt. The way her parents had given her up without a fight, even if that's what she had wanted, hurt her to the point of being able to manipulate a household full of objects. It was as clear as day to Jennifer now. Matilda had lied. She wasn't acting that night, and if she was, it was only to reassure Jennifer she was ok with it. Maybe the reason for her bedwetting now was because she was hiding that hurt deep within herself. The thought tore Jennifer up inside; to the point she was tempted to see if she could move objects as well. She wondered what she could do to help her. What could someone like plain and simple Jennifer Honey have to offer someone extraordinary like Matilda? An education? Jennifer spent more time learning from Matilda than Matilda learned from Jennifer. Money? Even with the money from her parents they would still be scraping to get by. Love? Yes, that was the one thing she could give her. Matilda had already stolen her heart long ago on that very first day. She'd shower her in the love and affection she had so obviously been lacking in. It was all she had to give her. \"Miss Honey! I forgot a towel!\" Matilda's voice rang from the bathroom, snapping her from her thoughts. She went to the cupboard to look for the biggest, and fluffiest one she could find, but all that was there were thin, old ratty things she had picked up from a garage sale more than ten years ago. Hmm, that was something they could do today. It was a beautiful Saturday morning, and the swap meet would be in full swing. \"Here you go.\" Jennifer said handing over the least torn up towel she had to the dripping wet and shivering child. \"You know, it's the weekend. You don't have to call me Miss Honey at home.\" Matilda looked at her puzzled for a moment seemingly lost in thought. \"What should I call you then?\" Deep down she wanted to hear the word, mom, but stopped when it was on the tip of her tongue. Too much too soon . \"Jennifer's fine.\" \"I can't call you by your first name.\" Matilda said. \"You're my teacher!\" \"Not at home I'm not, silly. Hmm, how about, Jenny?\" She said, taking the towel from her and throwing it over her head. Matilda giggled as her head popped out. \"I guess that's okay, but only here. It's impolite to call a lady by her first name.\" \"Whatever you're comfortable with, but you still have to call me Miss Honey at school. Now what would you say to going over to the swap meet after breakfast? It's a nice day out after all.\" Jennifer suggested rubbing the towel over the girl's head. \"That sounds fun!\" After a quick bite to eat of toast and tea, Jennifer pulled a mason jar of change out of the cupboard and examined it. She had maybe about ten pounds at the most saved up. She frowned slightly as she pulled out the highest denominations and put them her pocket. They'd have to be careful and only buy what they absolutely needed. \"Miss Honey, here.\" Matilda said reaching out her fist. Jennifer opened her palm as Matilda deposited a wad of bills in her hand. Where in the world had she gotten this? There had to be at least 100 pounds if not more. \"I saved my allowance.\" Matilda said with a shrug. \"No, sweetie, this is yours.\" Jennifer said trying to give it back, but Matilda just shook her head. \"Hold it for me then.\" Jennifer sighed, but agreed. She should be supporting her, not the other way around! She couldn't spend a little girl's allowance! She'd sell all her books if she had to! They walked out the front door and chatted about the book they had been reading together- an old warn out copy of a Charles Dickens novel Jennifer had picked up years ago at a second hand bookshop for fifty pence. Maybe if they still had the energy- and money- she could take Matilda there. She'd probably find it a lovely place to spend an afternoon browsing. When they got onto the main road ten minutes after 9 am, the little town was in full swing with the nearby farmers market as bustling as ever. After they finished with the swap meet, she figured she should stop by on the way back and pick up a few groceries. She'd have to ask Matilda what she liked to eat. Once they arrived, they got lost looking at all the little odds and ends people were selling in their stalls. Different kinds of music blared from various large boom boxes. A stall to their left sold every type of flower she could think of: lilies, tulips, roses, and daisy's lined the white plastic table in ten gallon buckets. A tent to their right had dresses and blouses swinging from hooks in the gentle breeze. Food vendors were out setting up their sugary snacks on display sending scents of cinnamon wafting into the air. She was curious about what kind of things Matilda was interested in. All she knew of was her love of academics. Even her packed suitcase and bags-which she said she had packed days prior- was nothing but necessities. Not a single toy. Did she even have interests outside of reading? Jennifer kept a close eye on her as they walked through the stalls. The little girl browsed around, but nothing appeared to really keep her interest for long- until she came upon a beat up looking chess set. Her eyes shone as she opened it up and examined the pieces. \"Do you know how to play?\" Jennifer asked. \"I've read about it, but I've never had any one to play with before.\" Matilda admitted. \"I had hoped there would be one in the classroom, but-\" She trailed off looking it over. \"Well, chess is a little advanced for a kindergarten class.\" Jennifer said with a laugh. \"Would you play it with me?\" \"Of course! I'd love to.\" Matilda smiled wide and pulled a five-pound note out of her pocket. Just how much money did this girl have? If she hadn't known her to be such a sweet and honest girl, Jennifer would have assumed she cleaned her parents out before she left. The elderly man smiled and handed her her change, as he looked her up and down. \"She yours?\" He asked as Jennifer proudly nodded. \"Make sure she doesn't eat the pieces.\" He said. Jennifer frowned and looked to Matilda to gauge her reaction. She had almost expected her to be angry at being talked down to, but she just smiled and shook her head. \"I'm not very fond of the taste of wood, sir.\" She replied before turning and searching through the other games he had. Jennifer stood at a distance glad to have found something she was interested in other than just books and schoolwork. Board games did seem like something she would be interested in. She wondered if he had any jigsaw puzzles they could do together in the kitchen, but a look to her left revealed Matilda was already one step ahead of her as usual. \"Margaret!\" The old man shouted into his trailer. \"If I sold all the games here for two pounds each, and subtracted the seven percent the lot gets, what would my profit be?\" \"I don't know! I'm not a calculator!\" A woman's voice shouted back. The man grumbled under his breath and reached for a pen from his pocket along with a dirty napkin. He sat hunched over scribbling number down. \"We'd make fifty nine pounds and 34 pence if we sold everything!\" He shouted back a few minutes later. \"Your math is off.\" Matilda said without looking up from the instructions on the back of the game. \"You need to take your number of board games, multiply it by two, which gives you 72 pounds, and then multiply that by .07. That gives you five pounds and four pence. Now subtract that from your 72 pounds and you end up with a total of 66. 96 pounds.\" The man blinked in surprise for a moment before a wide grin spread across his face. \"Cute.\" He said, before yelling inside for a calculator. A few moments later, the woman named Margaret appeared with calculator in hand and passed it off to him, before she returned to the sanctuary of the trailer. Miss Honey watched him curiously for a moment as he punched in numbers from his napkin. He remained still staring at it, before erasing it and starting over. \"What did she say her answer was?\" He asked after a moment of silence. \"66.96 I believe.\" Jennifer said, a smile spreading across her lips at his shocked expression. She knew that look. It was the exact same look she had worn the first time she had experienced Matilda's calculations. \"Here you go, six pounds for these.\" Matilda said, handing him the money as she held up the puzzles she had picked out. He stared at her blankly for a moment, before thanking her and accepting the money. \"Don't worry, I'll make sure she doesn't eat those pieces either.\" Jennifer said as they continued on.

His heart pounded furiously in his chest. His stomach dropped the moment Max glanced behind him. He's getting closer. Max felt a pang of regret for allowing Vincent in his taxi shortly after Annie left; he hated the way he so easily manipulated him; it disgusted him when Vincent killed innocent people as a way of living. The murderous sociopath would feel no remorse, only satisfaction that his job was successful. And now, Annie, a prosecutor Max met only a few hours ago, was the hitman's final target. He oculd not let her become a victim of Vincent's insanity. She deserved better than that. He could hear Annie struggling to control her breathing. Her stomach was strong as she said before in the cab, but her heart was tainted with fear. When they entered the final compartment, ANnie hid to the side, afraid of what terror awaited her. They jumped when they heard a familiar, enraged voice. \"MAX! THIS IS MY JOB!\" Max shuddered at the thought of death. Vincent would obviously kill him after all Max had done to him in these past few hours: shooting him in the ear, trying to save Annie, throwing away his briefcase, and making several escape attempts. After witnessing the deaths of Vincent's victims, Max would not be surprised that he would murder him as well. He glanced at Annie's frightened face, and knew instantly what needed to be done. Max cocked his gun, moved toward the compartment door and aimed the weapon at Vincent. It's between you and me, Vincent, Max thought. I won't let you harm, Annie. I won't let you kill her like you did to Fanning. Vincent looked like a ghost as he stood behind the train door's window. The grey-haired assassin flushed with anger at the sight of Max. The blood from his ear cascaded down his neck. There was a determined, fierce look in his devilish green eyes that sent chills down Max's spine. \"It's between you and me,\" Max whispered. Vincent aimed his gun, ready for the kill. Max prayed silently for a miracle. Nobody heard the glass shattering or the firings of the gun, for few traveled by train that night, and most were on the other side. Max heard the whizzing of bullets fly centimeters past his head, yet he remained steady. Vincent stayed focus on his target, not flinching when a bullet grazed his neck. Then suddenly, there was a soft click and silence pursued. Vincent's eyebrows twitched. Max sighed with relief. A feelin g of hope rose in his stomach. He ran out of bullets. Thank God. \"Vincent,\" Max said cautiously. \"Lower the gun.\" Max did not like the mischievious grin that slowly formed across his ghostly face. \"You're going to tell me what to do?\" \"Lower the gun,\" he warned. \"Or what Max?\" Vincent said, stepping toward him. \"Are you going to shoot me; put a bullet through me and go back to your pathetic livelihood?\" \"Shut up,\" Max said. \"And don't come any closer or I swear I'll shoot you.\" \"Unlike you, Max,\" he said darkly, the grin suddenly vanishing from his face. \"I don't give in too easily to threats. In a heartbeat, Vincent smacked the gun out of Max's hands with his fists and punched Max in the stomach, causing him to fall on his back to the hard floor. The assassin quickly pulled out an extra clip and placed it inside of his gun. Then he cocked it and aimed it at Max's head. Max gasped for air after having the wind knocked out of his lungs. He stared up into the barrel of Vincen't gun. He shot a bullet through Max's shoulder with one swift pull of the trigger. It was the most excrutiating pain Max had ever felt. He couldn't scream, for his lungs were still recovering from being knocked against the steel floor. \"Max!\" Annie gasped in horror. Max turned to her. He reached and clasped Annie's trembling hands. Her hand felt warm in his grasp; he never wanted to let go. The instant they touched, Annie had stopped shaking. She looked at him for a moment, and then realized Vincent was standing over her, his gun raised. Max could not breath as he looked into the assassin's dark, wrathful eyes and knew what would happen next. He screamed for Annie to run-to move-to do anything but kneel there and be killed. He couldn't understand why she wouldn't budge. He pleaded for Vincent to let her go. Vincent ignored and fired. Annie's face looked remorseful, almost peaceful when the bullet shot through her chest. Max watched in horror as her small, limp body collapsed onto the floor. Vincent took a couple steps closer, aimed, and fired two more bullets: one through the chest, the other through the head. He looked down at her without any trace of sadness on his exhausted face. A moment later, he noticed Max writhing on the floor, trying desperately to get up. \"Max,\" Vincent said flatly, \"I dont think you realize how big of a hole you got me into. This is my job and I am hired to carry it out.\" \"Dont try to justify what you just did!\" Max cried. His heart felt like stone sinking to the pit of his stomach. He could not take his eyes off Annie's lifeless body. \"Annie! Please no, Annie.\" \"She's dead,\" the assassin said, picking up Max's empty gun off the floor. \"It's probably for the best. She almost got you killed. Women. They have these charms taht make men do the most idiotic things like getting in the way of another man's work. You should be thanking me. Not sniveling on the floor like some pathetic infant. \"Bastard!\" Max cried, his voice growing steadily weaker. The pain in his shoulder was unbearable. He winced. \"We're all insignificant. We all live. We all die. Sooner or later death will catch up with us. Annie Farrell was a lawyer; stress would have killed her eventually. I just sped up the process.\" Max could not believe what he was hearing. He wanted to block his ears and shut out Vincent's justifications. He wanted to die, to finally be rid of this crazed sociopath. As the pain in his arm lessened, his vision became darker. Vincent stood over him, watching him with narrowed eyes. Max looked up at him, frowning. \"Good luck, Max,\" Vincent said. \"You'll need it.\" Before Max could reply, Vincent headed toward the subway door as it came to a stop. Max saw the assassin fade into the night before falling into unconsciousness.[Chapter 2] RACHEL TARO ONE YEAR LATER Rachel Taro tried to put aside her overwhelming stress as she walked down the hotel hallway of the 13th floor. Her father had paged her a half hour ago during her preparation for the presentation she needed to give in less than an hour. Adley, the irritable man she was forced to call her boss, would definitely kill her for this. Yet the guilt in her heart from not seeing her father in months outweighed the desire to satisfy her boss. Her father sounded anxious and worried on the phone, making Rachel slightly nervous. Finally she had reached her father's room. She knocked. There was no answer. Rachel huffed and knocked once more. Again, she was greeted with silence. \"Dad,\" Rachel called. \"It's me, Rachel. Are you even-\" The door quickly opened at the mentioning of her name, and a man, no taller than Rachel herself, stood at the entrance with large, restless eyes. His grey hair was thinning on his round head, and his stomach was a rather large lump under his pinstripe suit. He smiled and said, \"I'm so glad you are here, Rae.\" Rachel beamed. She loved his nickname for her. It was a fatherly thing she had adapted to when she moved to L.A. to be closer with him. She stepped inside the hotel room, put her purse on the counter, and sat upright on the expensive leather couch. She tried to ignore the bustling street 13 stories below her. Ever since she was a child, Rachel had a fear of heights. She felt she was suddenly falling back through the window, down many, many feet before the pavement reached her. It was a fear that gripped her heart whenever she was up this high. When her father saw the fearful look on her face, he quickly shut the curtains of the window, and then sat across from his daughter. Rachel's muscles slowly began to relax. \"So what is the problem?\" Rachel asked. \"Problem?\" Taro said, sounding puzzled. There was still an anxious gleam in his eyes that Rachel could not ignore. \"You sounded worried on the phone,\" she said patiently. \"You said you wanted me here as soon as possible. Well, I'm here so just tell me what's wrong.\" Taro pursed his lips. \"I don't know Rachel...\" \"Know what?\" \"If it is the right thing to put such a heavy burden on you,\" he sighed. It was Rachel's turn to be puzzled. \"I don't understand. What are you talking about?\" Taro hesitated. Slowly, he reached inside his pocket and pulled out the most gorgeous locket Rachel had ever seen. She marveled at its exotic beauty: the gold complemented the alexandrite engraved at the center, and it had an elegant oval shape. The color of the gem was a purplish-red, and had obviously been shaped into a rhombus. Rachel couldn't help but awe at it. Taro held it out for her; Rachel accepted it willingly in her hand and observed its magnificence. The locket refused to open as she gently tried to pry it open. \"Is that alexandrite?\" Rachel asked curiously. Her father looked solemn. \"Yes, Rae. The rarest gem in the world. I would like you to have it. Please,\" he held her hand in his. Rachel shuddered at his cold, shaking hands, \"please Rae, take care of this locket and don't let it out of your site. Promise this, my daughter.\" His wide, frightened eyes sent a shiver down her spine. There was something he was not telling her, and Rachel pleaded for him to confess. Her father just shook his head and feigned a happy smile. \"Now is not the time.\" This was the last thing he said to her before Rachel left to go back to work, the mysterious locket tucked securely in her purse. Rachel rummaged through her leather purse, until she pulled out her cell phone which had been ringing endlessly beneath lipstick and dollar bills. She suppressed a moan when she heard Adley at the end of the line. She grimaced at the sound of his irritating, high pitched voice. \"Yeah...okay...I know I'm late, it's just my father...yes, I know you don't like excuses, but I...yes...alright...I'll be there as soon-\" The click at the end of the line told Rachel that Adley had hung up on her. She scowled menacingly at her phone. \"That rude-\" Rachel was once again interrupted by the soothing Beethoven classic of her cell phone. \"What does Adley want now?\" Exasperated, she looked anxiously at the elegant, closed elevator doors. Open already. I'm already five minutes late. She ignored her noisy cell phone for several moments before turning it off completely. Rachel grinned maliciously. \"Now you know what it feels like to be hung up on, Adley you bastard,\" Rachel said triumphantly. Her grin quickly vanished when she glanced at her father's hotel door down the far end of the hall. Instinct told her to stay with him, but she ignored the cold feeling at the pit of her stomach and waited impatiently for the doors to open. A presentation to the top business leaders was extremely important and it would cause a devastating effect on her career if she did not attend. Adley would finally find a reason to fire her. She could not lose her job, not after all the effort she put in to creating a new life for herself. A brief moment passed before the elevator's golden doors opened slowly in front of her. A rather tall, broad shouldered man with spiky grey hair and stubble looked at her behind tinted sunglasses that hid his eyes. He wore a dark suit that seemed to fit him well. Something about this man seemed very familiar. Rachel struggled to see if she could remember his face. Those sunglasses made it more difficult to recognize him. The man held the door open with ease. Rachel could feel his eyes boring into her, as if he recognized her as well. \"Sorry, sir,\" Rachel asked modestly. \"Have we met? I feel like I've seen you before.\" The man grinned at her good-naturedly. \"There are more than eight million people living here in NYC, Miss. I doubt you've ever met me until this moment. Unless...\" \"Unless what?\" she asked. \"Unless you work for the Oil Company by the river,\" he grinned in the corner of his lips. \"I stop by there every once in a while.\" Rachel glared at him. \"No, those selfish, greedy lizards are not worth even thinking about. Not only do they poison our waters, but they are-\" She stopped. She was doing it again-speaking her mind without any sign of stopping which irritated the hell out of everyone who dared listen. Her career in business taught her that. The grin on his handsome face made her blush. \"You look stressed,\" he said. \"I am,\" Rachel admitted. \"Work can be so hectic, sometimes.\" \"I know what you mean.\" Rachel smiled. This man was a total stranger and yet she spoke so freely to him as if she had known him for years. He still held the elevator door open with his hand when he glanced down both sides of the hallway. A couple at the end of the hall walked toward their direction. An old woman sat quietly on a chair nearby, reading a crumpled newspaper dated a couple years ago. The edge of his lips twitched slightly. He looked back at Rachel, and his charming smile returned. \"I better get going,\" he said, taking a quickly glance at his watch. \"Are you on this floor?\" \"Yes, for a short while.\" Rachel stepped into the elevator shaft as the man walked out. She spun around to ask him, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name?\" The doors closed slowly enough for Rachel to see the grey-haired man walking casually in the direction of her father's hotel room.[Chapter 3] MATTHEUS TARO Mattheus Taro felt weak as he sat on the edge of his bed, staring out the window toward the street below. People walked down the sidewalk, not a worry or despair hampering their carefree lives. They were fortunate to live without the same guilt that weighed Taro's heart. He was reluctant to tell Rachel the terrible truth, but she needed to know soon. It's the only way. A soft click of a door opening came from nearby. Taro's heart froze. Someone was there. It could not be Rachel; she had just left only moments ago. Unless, he hoped, she forgot something. Soft footsteps came from the other end of the suite. Someone was searching for him. \"R-Rachel?\" Taro called out. Silence. The footsteps were getting closer now. Taro's hands shook slightly. A sick feeling in his stomach intensified with Taro's horrifying conclusion. They know. His heart fluttered with hope when he remembered his only means of a weapon. He dashed toward his closet and pulled out a gun from his cloak. Very quietly, Taro hid behind his opened door, hoping he would have a chance to shoot the intruder before he could finish his objective. He dared not breathe; any noise could signal Taro was there. The footsteps grew louder until they finally stopped in front of Taro's open door. A man walked into the room, his eyes cautious and determined. The silencer in his hands confirmed Taro's suspicion that they had found out. This man was an assassin, hired to kill Taro for his knowledge and secrecy. I should have known those bastards would have done this. He was glad he had a weapon to defend himself with, though he was not used to its heavy weight. He had never used a gun before, but knew this was his only means of protection. Taro prayed his plan would work. His heart pounded so loudly, he was afraid the grey-haired man would hear it. The assassin did not let his guard down as he looked throughout the grand suite. The silencer had already been cocked and ready to serve its purpose. Gathering all his courage, Taro aimed his gun at the man. His finger slowly pulled the trigger. When he closed the door that led to the hallway, Vincent pulled off his tinted shades. There was no reason to hide his face in here; the only cameras were in the hallway and bottom floors of the hotel. Vincent eyed the rooms of the suite, looking for his victim. He held his silencer in front of him as he moved toward the bedroom. The door was already open when he stepped inside. No one seemed to be there, but something told Vincent that Taro was near.[Chapter 4] Author's Note: Sorry it took me so long to update! Now that it's summer, I can try to post faster updates.

Rally","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12622750","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I saw the Emoji Movie in the internet, and it was funny. I watched the movie over and over again, until I have an idea. I decided to make a fanfic of this movie so it will make more interesting and emotional than the movie. I like Gene, Hi-5 and Jailbreak, and their adventure together. I also like Mel and Mary Meh. I described them as Gene's great parents. This is my first Emoji fanfic. I hope you'll like it. It's been few days after Gene's heroism in Textopolis, but everybody still treated him normally like the other emojis. He was so proud of himself that he finally knew his purpose, having great friends, his parents loved and believed him, and he's known to be one of the most popular emojis. Everytime Alex wanted to send an emoji, it was always been Gene. But there are times that Gene doesn't want to be picked all time. He wanted to give chance to the other emojis, like Hi-5, his parents, and everyone else. During his break or free day, Gene always hang-out with Hi-5 and Jailbreak, even outside Textopolis for more adventures while his father fills in for him since they both have the same condition. Everything's gone smoothly these days in Textopolis, except there's one problem. Since Smiler got kicked out and no longer the supervisor of the Text Center, the company needed someone to replace Smiler as the new supervisor, but nobody volunteered to, so the company set up an election of voting for the new supervisor. One day, Gene walked the streets from his apartment to go off to work. While strolling along happily, some emojis greeted him, especially those emojis who were sad, angry, laughing, disgust, etc, but Gene didn't mind as he knew that everyone has only one emotion. Just then, Hi-5 patted him playfully on the back. \"Hey, Gene!\" \"Oh, hi Hi-5.\" Gene greeted as he hi-fived him by the thumb. \"So have you heard of the news?\" \"What news?\" \"Didn't you know? The Textopolis sets up an election of whoever could be the new supervisor of the Text Center.\" \"Wow, I wonder who could be the lucky emoji.\" \"I bet it was you.\" \"Me? Why me?\" \"You're the hero, Gene, and you have more than one emotion. It's a perfect role for you as the new leader.\" Gene felt uncomfortable. \"Yeah, but I only wanted to work in the cube, not being the leader.\" \"Why are you not seemed so happy about it?\" The hand asked. \"You're going to be the most important emoji of all.\" \"I already am, Hi-5!\" \"But, you will make many decisions for the company.\" When they almost crossed the street, the two friends saw Clock Emoji, which the time was almost 8:30am. \"It's that the time?\" Gene gasped. \"Hey, my eyes are up here.\" Clock Emoji pointed his eyes, and glared at them. Ignoring the clock, Gene jumped to grab the balloon string. \"Quick, hold on.\" He said to his friend as Hi-5 jumped up so Gene can grab one of his fingers. The balloon lifted the two emojis all the way to the Text Center. Gen and Hi-5 landed safely on the ground when Gene let go of the balloon string. When they were about to march towards the door, they were encountered by their princess friends. \"Gene! Hi-5!\" Jailbreak exclaimed. \"Hey Jailbreak.\" Gene hi-fived her. \"So, have you heard the news?\" She asked. \"He hasn't until I told him.\" Hi-5 chuckled. \"Well, that was unexpected for you, huh, Gene?\" \"Yep, it was a surprise.\" Gene said. The door automatically opened as the three friends entered, and many emojis charged at them, which they drew their attention to Gene and asked him about the election if he ever got nominated. Gene, Hi-5, and Jaibreak tried to get out of the crowd, but they were stuck, until two pairs of hands grabbed them, and lured them away from the crowd. The three emojis were taken to the men's comfort room and a wet-floor sign was placed in front of the door. They were dropped on the floor, and rubbed their heads in pain. Gene opened his eyes, seeing the two emojis who helped him and his friends got out from the crowd. \"Mom? Dad?\" \"Are you okay, sweetie?\" Mary Meh asked in worry, still in monotone voice. Gene didn't answer as he immediately stood up and rushed to hug his parents. \"I'm so glad you two are here, and thanks for helping us back there.\" \"Are you here for the nomination, Mr. and Mrs. Meh?\" Hi-5 asked.\" \"Oh, we don't want to miss it if ever Gene will get nominate.\" Mel Meh said. \"I hope there's someone to nominate our son as the new supervisor of Text Center.\" \"I'll nominate him!\" Hi-5 raised himself. \"Hi-5!\" Gene felt embarrassed, then he turned to his parents. \"Mom, Dad, I don't think I'm fit for this.\" \"Don't be silly, son.\" His father took a few steps forward to his son. \"You're a very well-used emoji, and you're the hero. You should be the new supervisor.\" \"With all due respect, Mr. Meh,\" Jailbreak interjected. \"There will be a nomination before Gene gets to be the supervisor. He only worked here for few days, so we're not sure if he could be the winner of the election.\" Mel nodded in agreement. \"Very well, Princess.\" Then, he turned to Gene before he and Mary headed towards the door. \"I'll see you later, son.\" \"Good luck, Gene.\" Mary said as she and her husband exited the room. When his parents left, Gene wasn't really comfortable of becoming the future supervisor and everyone expected him to be like that, especially his parents. He wanted his parents and friends to be happy for him, but he felt that something's not right. \"Gene, are you okay?\" Jailbreak asked in curiosity. \"Why are you not excited for this?\" \"Jailbreak, my only dream was to be in the cube, not all of it to myself.\" Gene said. \"Who said you're going to?' She chuckled. \"Gene, you're going to be a perfect leader if you gave yourself a chance. Besides, everybody likes you now. Nobody called you a freak or weird anymore. Is that what you want?\" \"Yes, but this is too much.\" \"But you will going to be one of the fame emojis!\" Hi-5 exclaimed excitingly. \"You will have your own portrait when you walk in and out of the meeting room.\" \"Yeah, I mean, your dad has one too.\" The princess added. \"He was once worked here. He was the famous meh emoji before he got retired.\" Gene just stood there silent, speechless that Jailbreak mentioned about his dad. \"Well, we better go now, Gene.\" Jaibreak broke the silence. \"We don't wanna be late.\" \"Are you coming?\" Hi-5 asked. \"Just go. I'll catch up.\" Gene smiled as his two friends moved out of the room. When he was now alone, Gene looked at the mirror and made different emotions on his face. His parents and friends are right. He was meant to be the supervisor because of his multiple expressions, but he'd never dream of this and he wanted to stay out of this. Just then, he realized something. He isn't the only one who has this condition as he has an idea. \" You just gave me an idea, Jailbreak.\" He thought as he got out of the men's room and put the wet-floor sign aside[Chapter 2] A long day at work, the emojis did a pretty good job making faces in their cubes, and were scanned when Alex picked them to his text. When Alex didn't use his phone for a while, Jailbreak placed the microphone of her headset near her mouth, and announced. \"Alright, emojis, listen up! We all done a great job today, but now, it's time to nominate who will become the new supervisor of the Text Center!\" The emojis muttered excitingly, agreeing to have a new supervisor since Smiler got kicked out. Gene, on the other hand, was also excited yet uncomfortable for this. He knew that everybody will vote him if he got nominate. Not only he never dreamt of this, but he felt embarrassed of himself. He has to make it quick. \"The nomination for supervisor is now open!\" Jailbreak announced more. \"So, who wants someone to be nominated?\" An angel emoji raised her hand. \"I nominate Steven!\" She pointed the devil emoji , who was blushing in embarrassment. \"Alright, Steven…\" the princess wrote the devil emoji's name on the paper of a clipboard. \"Who else?\" Then, an ice cream emoji raised his hand. \"I nominate Poop!\" \"Then, Poop it is!\" Jaibreak wrote Poop's name on the list. \"Alright Dad!\" Poop's son cheered for his father. \"Are there more?\" Hi-5 raised himself or raised his fingers upward. \"I nominate Gene!\" The emojis gasped in delight, even his parents. Gene glared at Hi-5 for nominating him as the hand emoji grinned sheepishly. Gene wanted to deny for being nominated, but he still had to finish one last thing for the nomination. \"Okay, Gene is nominated!\" Jailbreak said, writing Gene's name in the list. \"Alright, who else wants a turn?\" \"I close the nomination! Ha, ha!\" The Face with Tears of Joy emoji laughed, which means 'said' When he heard that call, Gene quickly raised his hand and exclaimed. \"Wait!\" The emojis were surprised as they stared at Gene, wondering what he would have to say. \"Uh…, yes, Gene?\" Jailbreak didn't expect Gene raising his hand like that because he was nominated. Gene cleared his throat, and stepped a little forward on the edge of his cube. \"I want to say just one thing… I nominate…\" He took a deep breath, then exhaled, and pointed the emoji in the cube next to him. \"My dad!\" Everyone gasped in horror, even Mel and Mary. They didn't know what Gene was thinking. He nominated his dad? Even he was nominated? Everyone whispered about the same topic. Gene ignored the whispers as he accepted his final decision. \"Gene, what are you doing?\" Mel asked. \"I know what I'm doing, dad.\" Gene replied as he faced forward proudly. Even Jailbreak didn't believe it, but she has to respect that as she wrote Mel's name on the list. \"Uh…, Mel Meh, it is.\" \"I close the nomination!\" Gene quickly said before anybody nominated someone. \"I second the motion.\" Mary raised her arm, supporting her son. \"The nomination is now officially closed!\" Jailbreak announced. \"Okay everyone, the election is within few days, and remember, vote wisely. The emoji who has most number of votes should be the winner as the new supervisor of Text Center! We'll see you all tomorrow for work again.\" After giving the emojis her announcement, she saw Gene walked out of his cube happily. Then, she turned to his parents in their cubes, who were also confused why Gene nominated his dad for being the new supervisor. Jailbreak has the same thought with Gene's parents about his decision. When Gene got out of the Text Center, he noticed that some emojis gossiped about him being nominated but also nominated his dad. He also realized that there are no more crowds anymore since they were all confuse about Gene's decision. When he almost arrived at his apartment, Gene was approached by his two best friends. \"Gene! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!\" Hi-5 exclaimed. \"I nominated you so you would become a supervisor, but you wanted to give up this opportunity?!\" \"Gene, I don't get it.\" Jailbreak added. \"Why?\" \"I…\" Before Gene could answer, he sensed his parents came behind him. \"Gene, why did you do that?\" Mel approached his son. \"Why did you nominate me?\" \"Dad, I don't want to be a supervisor.\" Gene said. \"It's not what I've wanted in my life. Why would everyone want me to be the new leader?\" \"Because you're the hero, Gene.\" His father said. \"You saved us before the phone erased.\" \"But you were a hero too, Dad. Remember, when you surrendered that you have the same condition as I have? When you tried to look after me? When you believed in me?\" \"That's a fatherly hero to you, son, but to everyone, I don't think I'm a hero to them.\" \"Dad, didn't you know? You're the reason I became a hero.\" \"What?\" Mel and Mary didn't get what their son just said. \"What?\" Even Hi-5 didn't understand. \"Gene, what did you mean?\" Jailbreak asked. \"Come on, guys, you didn't know?\" Gene chuckled, then turned to his father. \"Dad, you're my father, and you have other expressions too. I got those things from you. I have multiple expressions all because of you, because you… have all of them all along. And if it wasn't for you, I won't have this kind of life, Dad. You once worked there, right? So I want you to take Smiler's place. You deserved it.\" Mel suddenly blushed at his son's speech as his cheeks turned red, and smiled with little tears popped from his eyes. Mary placed her hand on her husband's back as Mel removed the tears from his face. This also showed to Hi-5 and jailbreak that Gene is right about his dad. \"But sweetie, even if you and your dad have the same purpose, you are still voted by everyone.\" Mary said. \"You're the real hero, Gene. Everyone will vote you, even though you wanted your dad to take Smiler's place.\" Jailbreak added. \"Whoever got the highest votes, he will become the new leader.\" \"No, there are some emojis will vote dad.\" Gene protested. \"His friends will…, a-and his work friends will…, a-a-and mom!\" Then, he turned to his mother. \"You'll vote dad, right?\" \"Oh, Gene, I don't know if I could become either a supportive wife… or a supportive mother.\" Mary replied, didn't know of which of her husband and son should she vote for the election. \"Son, I've retired when you were born.\" Mel explained. \"I didn't come back to work when you were still a baby.\" \"But you're still in the hall of fames, dad.\" Gene said. \"Everyone knew you before I was born.\" \"But what if you won?\" Hi-5 asked. This question stopped Gene from explaining. He knew that he could get lots of votes for the upcoming election. There was no way out of it as he said. \"If that happens, I will accept it.\" \"Are you sure?\" Mary was concerned. \"If that's what everybody wants, me being the new leader, I respect that.\" He said as he stepped inside apartment, and closed the door, leaving his parents and friends looked concern. Gene entered his bedroom with a tired face. He yawned as he sat on his bed. While he was alone in his room and the street lights lighten his dark room, he stared at the posters of the most popular emojis. One of them was Smiler, but he no longer idolized her anymore. He imagined that he could be one of these posters sooner enough, but he felt guilty that his dad wasn't that popular to other emojis, but, to Gene, he was his idol. Slowly, he tucked himself with the blanket, laid his head, and went to sleep. Mel can't sleep as the memory of his son nominating him and his speech were stuck in his head. He slowly got off from his bed, carefully not to wake Mary up. He went out to the kitchen to get a glass of water. When he's done, he had a chance to stop by his son's bedroom, seeing his son fell asleep. He quietly entered Gene's room, and slowly sat at the edge of the bed. Thanks to the street light that lighten his son's room, Mel looked around the room, seeing the pictures and posters of his working friends, including Poop and Smiler. He realized how his son idolized them and wanted to work with them, like any other emoji wants. Suddenly, Mel noticed another poster of an emoji, and it was the largest of all posters. Not Smiler, not Poop, not even Steven, but it was him . 'Mel the Meh emoji' with his picture of him like from the hall of fames. Mel's poster was one of the posters that Gene collected, but his is larger and the center of attention from other emoji posters. Mel was surprised, and realized that his own son looked up to him of his life. His emotion of meh changed to a proudly smile as he turned to look at his son. He never knew that Gene looked to him, until he was surprised when he nominated him as the new supervisor. He looked at his son proudly one more time before heading out of his room, and silently closed the door. Mel headed back to his room, but before he went to sleep, he held and stared at the picture of Gene's birth after Mel quit his job for him, which baby Gene cried after birth, while Mel and Mary are still in 'meh' expression. Then, he held another picture and stared at it that showed Gene's 1st birthday. In here, Gene was very happy and enjoyed his cake, while his parents, still in 'meh' expression, busy feeding little Gene his chocolate birthday cake. Lastly, a last chapter showed that Gene feared of crashing towards two trash cans while riding on a bike for the first time. Mel chuckled before placing the last picture back on top of the drawer, and, unexpectedly, a tear popped from his eye. He removed the tear from his cheek, and headed back to sleep on the bed next to Mary. Okay, let me give you my reason for this. I would rather like this story to become emotional when it comes to both family and friends, especially to a parent and a child. I hope you like this chapter so much![Chapter 3] The Election Day has finally arrived. Many emojis went to the Text Center to vote. Everybody has the right to vote, including emojis in the loser lounge (except Smiler), and many places in Textopolis are empty, like it was a desert place. The working emojis were voting in their cubes, while the rest have their own chairs to vote in private, even Jailbreak and the techs voted in the scanner. It's not easy to vote as everybody tried their best for it, Like Hi-5. He used is whole hand to write. It's quite hard. When the whole Text Center was so quiet, they were alerted when Alex opened the text app, ready to send a message. \"We're out of Alex's pocket, emojis!\" Jailbreak announced as she put her voting card down. \"This is not a butt dial!\" The emojis in their cubes dropped their pens and voting card as they were alerted that Alex was ready to choose an emoji. They all fixed themselves, and ready to get picked. For several minutes, the only emojis who get picked were Gene and Mel. The emojis observed how the father and son are important for Alex's messages. The two were so tired of changing their emotions; they can't compete with each other of which of them has the highest pick and soon to be leader of the Text Center. When the voting day is over, many emojis threw their voting card in a box, and excitingly ran outside the Text Center to go home, and ready for the final result. The last emojis who got out are the Meh family, Hi-5, and Jailbreak. \"I would wonder who got the highest votes.\" Hi-5 cut off the silence. \"One way to find out tomorrow.\" Jailbreak said. \"We'll check the results tomorrow, and the winner should take his position as the Text Center supervisor starting tomorrow.\" \"Well Gene, I guess this means good luck.\" Mel placed his arm on his son's back. \"May the best emoji win, dad.\" Gene smiled at his father. In his bedroom of his apartment, Gene can't sleep. He can't stop thinking about the results tomorrow, but that's not the only thing that he thought about. Unbeknownst to everyone, Gene hadn't thrown his voting card in the box; he had kept it with him. He wanted to make sure that his dad has a lot of votes that his, in order for him to win. Gene hid his voting card under his pillow, and tried to go to sleep. The next day, everyone in Textopolis went back to Text Center to check the results. The announcement of the results was held outside Text Center, where Jailbreak and the techs were holding few boxes of voting cards. Jailbreak took out a microphone, tapped its head, and said. \"Alright, emojis, we have the results as we'll show you the percentage of the votes on this screen!\" Behind her was a large screen. It revealed the final percentage of each nominee. Steven has 3% of the votes, Poop has 10%, and, unfortunately, both Gene and Mel have 99%. \"Gene Meh and Mel Meh are tied!\" When Jailbreak exclaimed at this result, everyone murmured in horror. The Meh father and son are tied up? How could this be? When Gene learned that he and his dad were tied, he whispered to Hi5 about his secret as he showed his voting card to him that it was there with him all along. Hi-5 quickly grabbed Gene's voting card, and ran in front to show Jailbreak the card. \"Wait!\" Hi-5 shouted as Jailbreak turned to him. \"We have one more right here.\" Jailbreak quickly took the voting card, but she didn't see it yet as she called the crowd. \"Okay emojis. We just found out there's one more voting card here that haven't recorded yet, so if this card voted one of the two tied emojis, he would be the new leader.\" She slowly opened the card. \"And the winner is…\" When she read the voting card, Jailbreak's smile vanished. She didn't expected this. She slowly pulled the microphone closer to her mother, and announced the winner. \"Mel Meh!\" Many emojis gasped and muttered in horror once again. They can't believe any of it, especially Mel. He looked at his son in concern. Gene knew that look of his father gave to him. To stop this embarrassment, Gene marched through the crowd, climbed up on the stage, and took the microphone from Jailbreak, who moved backward after he took the microphone from her. \"Hey, excuse me, everyone!\" When Gene called for all the emojis to get their attention, everybody stopped muttering, and turned to Gene to listen. \"Um… hi, everybody. You already know me, so…\" When it went silence, Gene started to get a little nervous, but he still has the strength to explain. \"Listen, I know that almost all of you want me to become the new supervisor of Text Center because of my heroism. I saved you all before the phone almost completely erased, and it's true, but I'm not worth for this position, not because I never want to be, because I know there was someone else who can take this position better than me… And it was my dad. I nominate my dad because not just… well, he's my dad, but I can see in him that he made me accept for who I am. He was the real reason I became like this. He was the reason I was a malfunction. He has multiple expressions before I was born. Of course, you all didn't know that because he kept his condition as a secret. He was one of the most famous emojis in the Text Center, and he quitted his job just for me when I was born. My dad did everything for me to fit in with the other emojis when I have other feelings than meh. He and my mom are the only emojis who understand me when I was a kid until now. I've always looked up to my parents, but mostly to my dad.\" With this speech, some of the emojis almost starting to sob as they were touched by Gene's speech, making them realized how much a father can be very loving to their children. Poop and Poop Jr. reacted the same thing as they leaned to each other with a hug. Hi-5 almost cried as he wiped his tear with his thumb, and Jailbreak also too, wiping her small tears with her arm. She also missed her dad, wherever he is right now. Mary elbowed Mel for them having a supportive son like Gene, which made Mel's cheeks turned red and a tear appeared near his left eye. \"That's why I wanted my dad to take this position.\" Gene continued his speech. \"If it weren't for him, I won't be a malfunction. I couldn't save everyone from getting erased if I'm not a malfunction like him. I know I'm the hero, but my dad was always been my hero. And I'm not the only one who has multiple expressions. I think you already know where I got this condition. It's always been from my dad all along.\" \"That was the most touching speech ever!\" A crying laughing emoji clapped his hands as the rest of the town cheered for both Gene explaining his speech and Mel winning as the new supervisor of Text Center. When Mel and Mary tried to get through the crowd to reach the stage, the emojis in front moved aside to give way for the two mehs. They climbed the stage to approach their son. Mel's face turned to smile as he rushed to his son, and hugged him appreciatively. Gene returned the hug tightly. When they broke their hug, Mel made a 'throwing a kiss' expression as Gene playfully made the same face too, and Mary embraced her husband and son with open arms, despite still having the same Meh face. She's very proud for her family. Just then, Jailbreak approached Mel with a medal that was a golden key to the Text Center, representing as the medal of the Text Center's supervisor. \"Congratulations, Mel Meh. You are now the new supervisor of the Text Center, replacing Smiler's position.\" Instead of her, Gene decided to wear the medal to his father, thanking him for giving the talent he possessed. \"Congratulations, dad.\" \"Thank you, son.\" Mel smiled at his son as the two shared one more hug, and the whole Textropolis cheered for the father-and-son mehs. Sorry, it took a while. I was busy at school and it's hard for me to think for this new chapter, but I did it. I like this fanfic to be emotional for parents and children, and how much parents and children loved each other, despite of their fights and arguments. I hope you're related to this story, and reflected your life compare to this story.[Chapter 4] The next morning, Gene woke up very well as he fell asleep last night after he, his family, and friends went out to celebrate after Mel won the election. Gene groomed himself first, and went downstairs to eat breakfast with his parents. When he went to the kitchen, he only saw his mother, preparing breakfast for him, but he didn't see his father around. \"Hey, where's dad?\" He asked. \"He went to work early, Gene.\" Mary replied, placing a plate of pancakes on the table. \"It's his first day of work as the new system supervisor.\" \"Oh, right. I almost forgot.\" Gene chuckled as he sliced the pancake with his fork. \"I just hope he would be okay on his first day. Now, I'm acting like you two when you were worried about me during my first day of work.\" \"Oh, Gene, your daddy worked in the Text Center for so long. He'll be fine.\" \"I know, Mom.\" \"It's very thoughtful of you for letting your father win.\" \"He deserves it, Mom. If it weren't for him, I won't be multi-expressive.\" \"I wish you both a good luck on your work, Gene.\" \"We're okay everyday, Mom, and you too. Alex needed a meh.\" With this emotional conversation between a mother and a child, Mary approached Gene, and hugged him lovingly. Even though she can't have multi-expressions like her husband and son to show her feelings, she always loved them both. Gene kissed his mother on the cheek as he took his lunch bag that Mary prepared for him. \"Don't forget your father's breakfast. He hasn't eaten his breakfast yet.\" She called as Gene rushed back for his dad's breakfast that was kept on a brown paper bag, and rushed towards the door. \"I gotta go, Mom. Are you sure you'll catch up?\" \"Don't worry, Gene. I won't be late.\" Mary said as she was about to wash the dishes. Gene smiled before leaving his apartment to catch up the balloon. He quickly grabbed the string with his spare hand, and the balloon sent him to the Text Center. He let go of the string, and landed safely on his legs in front of the Center. When he was about to go in, many emojis treated him differently but normally. Like giving him a pat on the back, and waved 'hi' at him. \"Hey, Gene.\" \"Looking good as always, Gene.\" \"Hey, Gene, that was the most emotional speech you gave yesterday!\" Cryer cried. \"Thanks.\" Gene thanked. \"Hi, Gene. You've done great.\" The angel emoji punched his shoulder. \"Thank you.\" He blushed with her cheeks turned red. \"Hi, Gene!\" The princesses, who all wore pink dresses and tiaras, greeted with admiration. \"Hey, ladies.\" He clicked his tongue and winked at them as the girls fainted. The glass door automatically opened as gene entered with more emojis greeted him. But the only thing that caught his attention was his dad as he saw him talking to the chips about the scanner. The chips nodded as they left to check on the scanner. Mel turned his attention to Gene when he approached him. \"Son.\" \"Hey, Dad.\" Gene greeted as he and his father hugged. \"How's your work?\" \"Being the system supervisor is not what I have been planned for, but it wasn't so bad after all.\" Mel replied. \"I'm glad you haven't overstressed yourself this morning.\" \"I almost got excited and nervous I forgot to eat my breakfast. What was your mother cooked anyway?\" Gene inserted his arm in the paper bag, and showed his father a plastic container of pancake slices. \"Mom knew you were in a hurry, so she made pancakes, but you left early, so I brought this for you.\" \"Well, I better eat it before Alex open the app. I don't want to eat this while I'm at work.\" Mel chuckled. \"Is your mother coming?\" \"Yeah, she's on her way.\" His son replied. \"Well, good luck, Gene.\" \"You too, Dad.\" When the two were going on their separate ways, Gene was startled when somebody punched him on the shoulder. \"Hey, Gene!\" \"Oh, hey, Jailbreak. How are you doing?\" \"I'm quite great.\" The princess replied. \"Thanks for inviting me last night.\" \"Well, my mom and dad wanted me to invite you since you held the ceremony and you're my good friend.\" Gene explained. \"So, are you still ready to work?\" Jailbreak asked. \"Yes, I am.\" He said. \"Why did you ask me like that?\" \"Sorry, Gene. It's just… it was really nice of you.\" \"For what?\" \"For voting your dad to win the election. I never thought a meh can do that, but you're a special meh.\" \"Thanks, Jailbreak.\" Gene blushed. \"I would've thought that it would best that my dad has to be the leader, and I should do my part.\" \"Hey, are you available tonight?\" She asked. \"Yeah, I have time, why?\" \"My mom invited your dad and the members of the board for a dinner in my place. You and your mom should go too. My family wanted to know you better. Oh, and my dad just returned home from WeChat app. He wanted to meet you too.\" Jailbreak explained. Gene was a little nervous at first. He was invited by the royal emoji family, and he didn't know how to act like proper gentleman or royalty, but he can't reject an invitation. \"Well, that could be okay.\" He said. \"Great!\" Jailbreak hugged him, making Gene blushed. She broke the hug first, and punched him on shoulder. \"I'll see you later.\" \"Sure, bye!\" When Jailbreak caught up with chips in the scanner, Gene was quite afraid that he might be an embarrassment to her and his parents, and doing something crazy in front of Jailbreak's family . He needed some practice. Later at evening, after work, the Meh family walked back to their apartment to get themselves prepare for having dinner with Jailbreak's family. In his room, Gene faced in front of the mirror with a bow around his 'neck', and practiced of being a proper gentleman before going to Jailbreak's place. \"Good evening, your majesties, it's really nice to meet you.\" He practiced how to speak with gesture, but he groaned. \"No, that's not it.\" Then, he cleared his throat as he practiced again. \"A beautiful evening to you, it's a pleasure to meet you.\" But he realized it stinks a bit as face-palmed. Just then, someone knocked on his door. \"Come in!\" He said. Mary opened the door, and entered. Since she was also invited, she wore a big fancy purple hat with a large feather on top of it. \"Are you ready, sweetie?\" \"I don't know, mom.\" Gene sighed. \"What if I made something disastrous during my first impression?\" \"You'll be fine.\" His mother helped him fix his bow tie and his hair. \"Besides, sweetie, Princess Linda…\" \"Her name is Jailbreak, mom.\" He corrected his mother. \"Jailbreak really likes you for who you are, just like your father and I loved you for who you are.\" When they're done chatting, Gene escorted his mom downstairs where Mel was waiting for them. He wore a black tie around his neck. \"Are we ready to go?\" He asked. Mary noticed Mel's tie loosened so she helped him tighten it up. \"Now, we're ready.\" She said. Gene opened the door for his parents as they got out of the house and Gene locked the door for them. Mel extended his arm to call a taxi. A taxi cab stopped in front of them as the Meh family got in the cab. When I was making this, I didn't plan of putting Jailbreak's father in the story since he was mentioned in chapter 3, but I decided to put him in the story in the next chapter to make story delightful and fun to read. Now in this chapter and later chapters, these will involve Gene and Jailbreak's relationship. A/N: I will have a little time thinking for the next chapter about Jailbreak and her family. I discovered that Jailbreak is not the only one that has a royal family since there are so many princess emojis. I need help that what would be her home, her parents are king and queen, and having siblings. Please I need help if you want me to update sooner.[Chapter 5] I am very very very very very very sorry that I haven't updating Emoji movie 2 for a long long while. I was busy in school, busy on other works, and I have a hard time thinking what would be the next chapter, but thanks to my friends out there, they helped giving their ideas for the next chapter. It's not exactly like their ideas, but I was just inspired by their ideas. I hope you like this chapter. Pls review, okay? Later at night, Gene and his parents were in their apartment. When they receive their invitation, they had to look nice, elegant, and fancy. Gene was in his room, thinking of what should he wear. Jailbreak's family is royal and rich. He didn't to look embarrass, so he picked a bow tie and a stripe black tie. This is a complicated part; he can't choose between the two. \"Oh, which one? Which one?!\" Gene started to panic, wearing the same ties all over again while looking at the mirror. \"I have to look fancy for Jailbreak's family.\" Suddenly, Mary opened the door to check on her son. She didn't wear a fancy dress or jewelries at all, but she wore a purple hat with a large white feather on top. \"Gene, are you okay?\" Gene sighed as he turned to his mother. \"No, Mom. Jailbreak invited us, and I want to look fancy, but I don't know what to wear.\" But for Mary, she had an idea. She took the bow tie from Gene's hand, and stick it on his 'neck'. Then, she took a small jar of hair gel from the table, and rubbed it on Gene's hair. \"Oh, Mom, you don't have to do that.\" Gene felt guilty. \"I have to, Gene. Mother knows best.\" Mary said as she added one more gel on her son's hair. When it's done, they waited for the hair to dry. Just then, Mel appeared as he wore a giant black hat and a bow tie. He knocked on the open door, interrupting his wife and son. \"How's it going?\" \"Oh, I just finish Gene's hair.\" Mary replied, still in a monotone voice. Mel walked in, and asked. \"Are you nervous, son?\" \"Not really, Dad.\" Gene said, feeling a little nervous. \"I just wanted to make a good impression.\" Mel and Mary glanced at each other, then Mel placed his hand on his son's shoulder. \"You'll be fine, Gene. I think the royals already like you because you're the hero, and you saved us, remember?\" Gene blushed. \"Yeah, I do.\" \"Now, let's go. We're gonna be late.\" Mel said as he walked out of the room. Mary swept the dirt off of Gene's hair with her hands, and Gene escorted his mother out of the room. When the Meh family were outside, it was quite dark and cold, but streetlights shined the dark surroundings. Mel raised his hand to call the taxi. A taxi cab stopped in front of the three Mehs. Mel opened the door and Gene helped Mary to get in the cab. Gene got in the cab, followed by his father as Mel closed the door, and the taxi cab drove away. It is revealed that Jailbreak and her family lived in a mansion since there are no castle are seen in Textopolis. Outside the mansion, Hi-5 was wearing a black suit as he stared at his clock, waiting for someone. Then, a taxi cab parked in front of him. The door opened, Mel got out of the cab first, followed by Gene as they helped Mary step out of the cab. Mel paid the emoji taxi driver, and he drove off. \"Gene, finally, you're here!\" High-5 jumped happily. \"High-5! What are you doing here?\" Gene asked. \"Jailbreak invited me too! We're her friends after all.\" The hand replied. \"It's awfully nice of you to come, High-5\" Mary greeted. \"Why don't you enter inside with us?\" Mel insisted. High-5 gasped in surprise. \"You mean it?\" \"Yeah, you need a buddy to be with when you want to go inside that mention where the royals are there.\" Gene winked at his best friend. \"Thanks, Gene.\" The Meh family and High-5 climbed up the large stairs to enter the mansion together. The large door opened for them to enter. Inside was already a throne room, even though it's not really castle. The throne room has a long red carpet on the floor. Ahead is where the thrones are. There was a long stair case, and above there were two big thrones and eight small thrones. Gene stared all over that the place was big and beautiful. Even though it was just a mansion, the inside was a like a big castle. \"Hmm, I thought there are more than just us emojis came for dinner.\" Mary said. \"Do you think we're late? The dinner is over?\" Hi-5 panicked. \"Hi-5, calm down. We're not late.\" Gene said. \"It's still early.\" Just then, a door from the left opened, and Jailbreak came out, wearing a pink dress, like the rest of the princesses of Textopolis. Gene had his jaws dropped when he saw Jailbreak on a dress for the first time, as well as Hi-t, who also had his mouth opened in shock. She turned around and was surprised that her friends are finally here. \"Gene! Hi-5!\" She exclaimed as she ran towards her friends. \"Hey, Jailbreak.\" Gene gave her a hi-5, as well as Hi-5. \"Are we late?\" Hi-5 asked. \"No, not at all! You're just in time.\" Jailbreak said with excitement as she lead them to the dining room. \"Come with me.\" Gene, Hi-5, Mel, and Mary followed her as Jailbreak opened the door to the dining room. The room has red wallpaper, a very long dining table with three candlelights, and large chairs, which were sat by other emojis who Jailbreak invited; Poop, Steven, Hammer, Lightbulb, and other members of the board, and Jailbreak's family; her mother, three brothers and four sisters. Her sisters' squealed quietly when they saw Gene entering the room. They have adored him since he became a hero. Hi-5 thought they squealed for him, but it was Gene, and this made Jailbreak feel embarrass and jealous. The Meh family and Hi-5 sat down on their chairs. Of course, Gene has to sat beside his parents, but the other side of his seat were the three princesses, which Jailbreak was three seats away from him. Hi-5 sat besides Jailbreak, which this upsets her because Hi-5 is very annoying. Suddenly, the clings in front were heard that were sounded by the queen as she stood up and announced. \"Alright everyone, settle down. Good. So, we gathered here tonight to have a fancy dinner with the new supervisor of Text center, family, and friends. But before we enjoy our dinner, let us wait for the king to arrive.\" \"The king hasn't arrived yet?\" Gene asked. \"Oh no, but he'll arrive soon.\" One of the princess said as she was about to grab Gene's arm, but he moved away. Just then, the trumpets sounded as they all stood up to honor the king's return. The butlers stood up near the door, and opened the door, making the king entered the room. Everyone bowed their heads down to honor him. \"Welcome home, Father.\" The princes and princesses greeted. \"Well, is it this a nice surprise?\" The king chuckled as he approached his queen, sat besides her, and kissed her. \"Glad you're back, and you're just in time.\" The queen said, then clapped her hands. \"Bring out the food!\" The butlers brought the food out of the kitchen, and served them on the table. Hi-5 almost jumped of excitement as he can't wait to eat fancy food, but Jailbreak shushed him to stop him from jumping. When the food are placed, the queen announced loudly. \"Dinner is served!\" When the others are ready to get their food, Hi-5 rushed in to get his and gobbled them up, which it embarrassed Jailbreak when her family, the board members, Gene, and his parents stared at the hand emoji. \"Hi-5, Hi-5!\" She elbowed Hi-5 as he stopped eating, and stared at everybody, who stare at him too. The hand realized he was rude of eating with the royals as he stopped continued eating slowly, and everybody proceeded eating. The room was silent, except for clanging utensils, for 5 minutes, until Steven spoke out. \"So, where have you been all this time, Your Majesty?\" The devil emoji asked. \"I've been working in WeChat.\" The king explained. \"It's not tough work, but it worth of fortune.\" \"Great choosing the work, Pops.\" One of the princes said. \"So, uh, is there any good news here in Textopolis while I'm gone?\" The king asked. \"Oh, Daddy, a miracle thing happened in Textopolis while you're gone.\" One of Jailbrek's sisters with blonde hair replied. \"I hope you know Gene.\" She extended her arm to point Gene, who grinned nervously. \"Oh yes, I know him. Isn't he the meh who Smiler called him 'Malfunction'?\" The king tried to recall as his sons snickered. \"Dad! He's not just a malfunction!\" Jailbreak scolded. \"Dearie, Gene Meh here is a hero.\" The queen explained. \"He saved us all before we've get completely wiped.\" \"Is that so?\" The king raised an eyebrow as Gene still grinned sheepishly. \"And his father was the new supervisor of Text Center.\" The queen added. \"He was… uh, 'malfunction', like his son.\" \"Mom! They're not malfunction!\" Jailbreak shouted, making everybody silent and stared at her. Jailbreak didn't want her father to be embarrass by her non-princess act. He didn't also know she was the missing princess who got out of the phone. She cleared her throat, and exhaled to calm herself down, like a normal princess. \"They're called Multi-expressive emojis, Mom. It's insulting when you called them Malfunction.\" \"No, Jailbreak, it's okay.\" Gene said. \"We'll just get over it.\" \"What, Jailbreak?\" The king turned to Gene, and glared at him for calling one of his daughters by nickname. \"I beg your pardon. My daughter's name is not Jailbreak. Her name is Princess Linda.\" \"Dad, please, he didn't mean to call me that.\" Jailbreak cut him off. \"Ooh, ooh, Daddy.\" Another princess with black hair and dark brown skin raised her hand. \"Did you know that Linda tried to get out of the phone?\" Everybody in the room gasped, except the princes and princesses, who were smirking. That had had it of Linda/Jailbreak for being their parents' favorite child. Now, this is their payback. \"Is this true?\" The king glared at Jailbreak. \"Dad, it's not true.\" She lied. \"We saw her, Daddy.\" A princess with light-brown hair said. \"We saw her when Alex almost deleted the phone. She wore a black hat with blue wig.\" \"I never wear that.\" \"Oh, really?\" Another prince with black hair smirked as he and his brothers took out something from under the table. \"What about this?\" They showed a black hat with blue wig. \"THAT IS MINE!\" Jailbreak quickly snatched her hat away from her brothers and hid it. Then, she slowly turned to the front, where her parents were not very happy about this. \"Linda, I should've known you're the princess that got off the phone that everybody was talking about.\" The king said disappointedly. \"Dad, I can explain.\" Jailbreak tried to explain. \"I never thought you were that princess, but it's all true!\" \"But, Dad, I don't plan that anymore. I work in the Text Center now.\" \"Well then, you're not going to work in Text Center again starting tomorrow! You'll do your duty as a real royal princess.\" With this, Jailbreak started to cry. She would never work in the Text Center anymore, which this also means she'll not work with Gene anymore. \"YOU NEVER UNDERSTAND ME!\" She cried as she left the table, and ran out of the dining room. \"Jailbreak, wait!\" Gene called as he left the table and followed her. Jailbreak sobbed with her hands on her face as ran to the garden at the back of her mansion, and sat on the bench, continuing to cry. Gene finally found Jailbreak in the garden, seeing her crying. He slowly approached her and spoke. \"Uh, Jailbreak, I-I'm sorry about what happened at the dinner and called you 'Jailbreak' in front of your dad. I didn't know your dad didn't know that you…\" \"No, Gene, it's not your fault.\" Jailbreak sniffed. \"It's okay. I'll just live with.\" \"But I can't just leave you like this.\" Gene sat besides her. \"Are you sure you gonna be okay?\" \"Don't worry.\" She wiped her tears. \"I'll be fine. Sorry, this wasn't a perfect dinner.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I didn't invite you just to have a dinner with my family, I invited you because I want to spend the night with you. But this is a disaster!\" \"No, Jailbreak, it's not. It was just a coincidence. Maybe we'll have our dinner our way next time.\" \"Oh, Gene.\" Jailbreak playfully punched Gene's shoulder as they both laughed. Then, Gene looked at Jailbreak to observe her how beautiful she was on that dress. Of course she didn't to be stereotype, he'll just keep his mouth shut. Jailbreak noticed Gene was staring at her. The way she looked at him, it's like she appreciated him for being a good friend who always there to defend and support. Like what she said in Candy Crush, he was her 'knight in shining armor'. They stared and smiled at each other for 2 minutes, until Jailbreak snapped out of it and cleared her throat. \"Well, I… think you should go.\" She said. \"What?\" Gene asked. \"I mean, it's getting late. You and your parents have work to do tomorrow.\" \"Oh, right! But are you gonna be alright that you'll not going to work in Text Center anymore?\" The princess let out a sad sigh. \"Yeah. I guess I'll accept it. I don't want to disobey my father.\" To comfort her, Gene held both of Jailbreak's hand, and whispered. \"Don't worry. Weither you work in the Text Center or not, we'll still stay in touch and still be friends.\" This made Jailbreak happy as she hugged Gene tightly. Then, she released him. \"Guess I'll see ya soon?\" \"Yeah. See ya, Jailbreak.\" Gene waved at her before going inside.[Chapter 6] The next day, Gene went to his job at the Text Center, but now and then, Jailbreak wouldn't work here anymore after what happened at dinner last night. Many emojis knew what happened at the home of the royal family last night as they kept spreading the gossip. Gene didn't have the mood anymore and remained sad since this morning. He hasn't eat his breakfast as he left home first before his parents did, making them so worried for their son. Gene's thoughts snapped out when Hi-5 punched his shoulder. \"Morning, Gene!\" \"Hi, Hi-5.\" Gene greeted back sadly. \"Whoa, you're look like a meh. Well, of course you're a meh, but not just any meh, you're sadder than a meh. Is everything alright?\" When the hand emoji asked, Gene smirked and raised an eyebrow, signaling to Hi-5 that he have to stop being sarcastic. \"Okay, okay. I was there, but we can't argue with the king. He's going to chop our heads off if we do.\" \"Technically, Hi-5, you're a hand. You don't have a head. You have a face.\" Gene corrected him. \"Okay, but he's gonna chop my fingers off… You know what I mean?\" \"I know what you mean.\" Just then, a microphone squealing sound was heard from the speaker. \"Places everyone.\" One of the techs announced. \"Go now to your cubes.\" \"I guess we have work to do.\" Hi-5 said as he went to his cube. Gene went to his own cube, still thinking about Jailbreak. For him, the Text Center wasn't the same without her. \"Attention everyone.\" Another moderator added. \"It seems the princess won't be working with us anymore, so we still have to stay focus on the text.\" When Alex started to text, he chose Gene as the scanner pointed at him. Because he didn't stay focus on his job and kept thinking about Jailbreak, Gene didn't notice the scanner was pointing at him. \"Uh, Gene, you're on.\" One of the moderators called, but Gene still didn't changed his face. \"Son, you've been chosen.\" Mel whispered, but Gene is still not in a mood. \"Gene.\" Mary called. \"Gene!\" Hi-5 also called him. \"GENE!\" Everyone shouted. Gene finally snapped out of his thoughts when he heard his name from everyone as he changed his emotions randomly before the scanner scanned him. That was so close! He also made another mistake, but he didn't mess up this time. After a long hard working day and emojis went back to their homes, Mel and Mary accompanied their son to their home, but Gene hadn't said a word to them the whole day. Parents know best. Mel and Mary knew why Gene was upset all this time. And that's the time Mel thought of a plan. The next day, just like yesterday, Gene is still not in a mood because of Jailbreak's absence. Suddenly, someone poked him on the back. Gene turned around to see who poked him. He was expecting Hi-5 since he always greet him, but it was an unexpected surprise. It was Jailbreak wearing the same pink dress like at the dinner! \"Jailbreak!\" Gene shouted happily as he hugged Jailbreak tightly. \"Hi Gene!\" Jailbreak returned the hug, but not as tight as Gene. She just hugged him gently. \"It's good to see you again.\" \"You too, Jailbreak.\" Gene, then, examined her clothes. \"You're wearing your dress again. And I thought your dad won't let you work here anymore.\" \"Oh, he wanted to, but your dad came to my place last night and talked to my dad about it, then they made a deal. I can work here again, but I have to be a real princess and wear this dress the whole time.\" Jailbreak explained as she straightened up her tiara. \"That's okay, Jailbreak. I think you're still cool just the way you are.\" Gene said, repeating what Jailbreak told him during their journey together, which made the princess blushed. Just then, Mel stood in front of them, which the two noticed him. \"Uh, I better go to the scanner now.\" Jailbreak excused herself, leaving the two 'mehs' alone. When Jailbreak left, Gene approached his father with a surprising smile on his face. \"Dad, you talked to the king? You did this for me?\" \"I observed you yesterday, Gene. You haven't stayed focus on anything ever since that dinner. I know why you're upset, so I talked to the king to let the princess work here.\" Mel explained. Gene happily rushed to his father and hugged him with appreciation. Throughout the day, Gene regained his focus when Jailbreak is back, and still took control of the scanner with the techs. When the day ended and the emojis walked out of the Text Center, Gene managed to catch up to Jailbreak before leaving. \"Hey, Jailbreak!\" He called. \"Hey, Gene.\" Jailbreak greeted back, but not in enthusiastic tone anymore. \"Since it's still an early night, why don't we hang-out for dinner? Just the two of us?\" Gene asked. \"I love to, but sorry, Gene. I can't.\" The princess shook her head sadly. \"I have a curfew, and my parents wanted me home at 7:30pm.\" \"Don't worry, no one will notice that.\" \"Actually, there are.\" After Jailbreak whispered, she tilted her head, pointing behind her. Gene looked behind Jailbreak, and saw her brothers, staring at them from afar. Now he understood why her curfew was serious. \"Alright. But when are we going to hang-out? Just for a day?\" He asked. \"Well, I'm available at weekends, but what about our work?\" She reminded. \"Don't worry. Dad will do the job for me if I'm absent, and the techs will do the scanning.\" Gene said. \"That makes sense. Okay.\" Jailbreak nodded.[Chapter 7] The weekend is finally here. His parents gave him a day off as Gene, like ever occasion, has a hard time choosing which tie should he wear. Suddenly, Mary entered his room without knocking as she noticed her son deciding which tie he should choose. \"Oh Gene. You don't have to wear something to impress the princess when you take her on a date.\" She advised as she snatched the bow and tie away from her son's. \"Your daddy did the same thing once when he took me out, and you know what I said?\" \"What?\" Gene asked. \"Just be yourself.\" \"I appreciate you, mom, but Jailbreak acted as a real princess now, and I have to look good.\" Suddenly, Mel knocked to interrupt the conversation. \"Well, you're not royal, and you don't belong to a royal family. You're Meh. You're a multi-expressive emoji, and you have to be what you are.\" Gene smiled as he hugged his parents with open arms. \"Thanks, you guys. I appreciate your support.\" \"Now, go along without your ties. We'll take care of everything in the Text Center.\" Mel gently pushed his son out of his room as Gene continued to walk towards the door. When he got out, he didn't kneed a cab to take Jailbreak out, so he just walked, and, when he realized he was almost late to pick her up, he used the balloon to fly all the way to the Royals' mansion. When he finally made it, Gene took a deep breathe, and was about to take a step on the stairs, but he was stop when he heard a 'psst' sound. \"Psst.\" Gene looked around to look who called him. \"Psst.\" He noticed that the sound was coming from the bush behind the staircase. Then, there was a yellow hand, waving at him to come with it. Gene was curious about it, but he obeyed the arm as he walked slowly towards the bush. The arm grabbed him by the wrist and pulled him in the bush. Gene coughed the leaves out of his mouth, and gasped. \"Jailbreak, you're here!\" \"Sshhh!\" Jailbreak covered his mouth. \"My mom, dad, and siblings didn't know where I am. I was hiding from them.\" \"Your family didn't know we're going out?\" Gene asked. \"No. I only said 'I'm going out shopping.', but I don't.\" \"What if your brothers followed us?\" \"That's why we'll sneak out.\" Gene smirked. \"I missed that kind of you, Jailbreak.\" Jailbreak blushed as she combed her hair behind her ear. \"Well, I may be a princess now, I'm still a code breaker.\" \"So, how can we sneak away from your brothers?\" He asked. \"Just follow me lead.\" She said. \"Lead the way, Your Majesty.\" Gene and Jailbreak used the bushes to quietly sneak away behind the princes as they looked around them, but not behind. \"Are you sure Linda already left?\" Prince #1 asked. \"Probably. She's not here.\" Prince #2 replied. \"Oh well, let's go horseback riding.\" Prince #3 suggested as they all went back inside the mansion and the two bushes snuck away from the mansion. When they are now far away, Gene and Jailbreak removed the bushed off of them. \"Oh man, we snuck away too good, huh?\" Gene laughed. \"Yeah. I know!\" Jailbreak also laughed. \"Oh, would you stay here for a minute? I better go over there.\" \"Uh, where are you going?\" \"Just in this corner, and don't look, okay?\" When Gene turned around as he obeyed to not to look, Jailbreak hid in the corner, and after few second, she came out unseen. \"Okay, Gene, you can look now!\" Jailbreak said. Gene turned around, and saw Jailbreak as she was no longer in her princess dress and wore her tiara anymore. Instead, she was wearing her black shirt and black hat with a blue wig. \"Wow, Jailbreak, you're wearing you're disguise again!\" Gene exclaimed. \"Well, this is how you know me when we first met.\" Jailbreak chuckled. \"So, where are you taking me now?\" \"Oh, it's a surprise. But first…\" Gene took out a red handkerchief as he blind-folded Jailbreak on her eyes. \"Gene, what are you doing?\" She asked. \"You will know. Just let me guide you.\" He instructed. Gene secretly led Jailbreak out of Textopolis to the wallpaper. It took minutes to reach their destination as Jailbreak began to wonder where they are. \"Uh, are we there yet?\" She asked. \"Not yet.\" Gene replied. \"We've been walking for so long.\" \"We're almost there.\" Finally, they reached the Instagram app as they entered through and Gene swiped Alex's pictures until he found the picture where Alex and his family had their vacation in France. Gene gently push Jailbreak with him through the picture, and around them was like they were in Paris for real, except that all living and non-living your frozen like statues. \"Alright, you can look now.\" He removed the blindfold from Jailbreak's eyes as she finally open her eyes. Jailbreak looked at her surroundings as she gasped in surprise. \"Wow! It's so beautiful! Where are we?\" \"We're in Instagram, Jailbreak, in Alex's 'Trip to France' album. My parents dated here once, but they didn't come here anymore longer. Now, come with me.\" Jailbreak followed Gene to a restaurant, where there was an empty table set for them. Gene pulled a chair for Jailbreak to sit. When she did, he rushed inside, and came out for 2 seconds with a dish with a lid on his hand. \"What's that?\" Jailbreak asked. Gene placed the dish on the table, and opened the lid, revealing spaghetti with meatballs. \"Ta-da!\" \"Did you…?\" \"I did! Actually, my mom helped me.\" \"Well, I think you prepared this for me.\" Later, the two emojis ate their lunch, told each other's stories, laughed at their jokes, etc. After eating their food, Gene decided to take Jailbreak to another app for the rest of their date as they left Instagram and moved to Spotify. \"Wow, we're in Spotify?\" Jailbreak chuckled. \"Yeah, and I was thinking this is where we gonna spend the rest of our date.\" Gene scratched the back of his head nervously. \"So, maybe, since I made you a nice lunch, you should pick the song you like this time.\" Jailbreak stared at Gene as she smirked. She picked the fast and fun stream with the song 'Ride by ZZ Ward' as they ride on a boat. Jailbreak seemed to have a fun time, but Gene bounced up and down on the boat because of the waves of the stream as he almost fell off the boat. \"Can you, at least, pick a calmer stream?!\" Gene yelled as he tried to keep himself from falling off the boat. \"Alright, I know just a stream.\" Seconds later, Jailbreak managed to moved the boat to the calmer stream besides the fast and crazy one as they let the wave washed them off and landed to the smoother one. \"Ah. That's much better.\" Gene exhaled. \"Hey, I remembered this stream. Is this…?\" \"The same stream where we saw the whale song.\" Jailbreak reminded, then her eyes widened. \"I think it's coming.\" Suddenly, a blue whale appeared, jumping over the two emojis as the streams' pixels slowly fell over them. Jailbreak stood up and played the pixels, and some of them fell on their heads like water. The two chuckled when the water-like pixels tickled their head. When the whale song is over, Jailbreak sat back on the boat. \"I really miss that moment.\" She sighed. \"Me too.\" Gene added. \"Hey, let me ask, do you still love your family and all?\" \"Of course. I love my family, but I just didn't want them to make me what they want for me. Just like what I said before, I always wanted to live in the Cloud, but I decided to work in the scanner… to be with you everyday.\" With Jailbreak explanation, Gene started to blush. \"For me, I always wanted to be in a cube, but I didn't expect to be hero.\" \"Ha! Hero or not, you're still cool to me just the way you are.\" At this moment, Gene and Jailbreak stared at each other's eyes as they smiled at each other. Gene placed on Jailbreak's. They slowly leaned at each other's face and closed their eyes, almost leaned in to a kiss. But suddenly, the princess emoji stopped on her track as she quickly pulled away. \"Uh… I think I should go home.\" \"What? Why?\" Gene asked. \"My parents and siblings were looking for me when I was out of their sight for so long. If they find out about this, I'll be grounded for good. \"Oh… that's okay.\" The multi-expressive emoji said as the boat finally reached the end of the stream. When Gene hopped out of the boat first, he extended his hand to help Jailbreak. She nearly tripped as Gene caught her in his arms. Jailbreak quickly got up on her feet again as she tried to hide her blush. \"Uh, l-l-let's just go.\" She stammered as she rushed out first. Gene just stared at her in guilt as he followed her. Well, this is my stop for a while. Merry Christmas everyone! Cordy Mills, thank you for your support. Please make your own account so we could chat or PM with each other.[Chapter 8] Sorry, it took so long. I was back to school, and my mind is filled with lessons. I wanted to post this at New Year, but it was delayed. So, belated Happy New Year! *listen to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams* The next day, Gene woke up happily as he danced out of his room, down the stairs, and into the kitchen, where his parents were waiting for him. Without a single word, he was just happy as he ate the pancakes on his plate without even stopping and sitting down. He kissed his mother on the cheek, and hugged his father, who was sitting on a chair and read a newspaper. Gene picked up a paper bag with his lunched from the table that Mary prepared for him, and winked at his parents before heading towards the door. Mel and Mary glanced at each other as they were curious why their son acted this way, but they suddenly realized why. When he got out from his apartment, Gene gleefully danced at the sidewalk where he joined the other emojis' activities, like dancing with Flamenco, playing Frisbee with younger emojis, helping emoji animals to cross the street, and joining a morning exercise with the hand emojis (except Hi-5, since he didn't socialize with other hand emojis more often). Along the sidewalk, Gene approached Hi-5, and span him round and round, making this hand emoji dizzy. \"Whoa whoa, Gene! Stop! I think I'm gonna be sick!\" Hi-5 tried to hold his barf. \"Oh, sorry, Hi-5.\" Gene stopped spinning Hi-5 \"I was in a good mood this morning.\" \"Ooh, why is my best friend in a good mood?\" Hi-5 asked. \"Well, uh...\" Gene scratched the back of his head, and thought if it is a good idea to tell him what happened yesterday. \"I took Jailbreak on a date yesterday.\" Every emoji heard him as they stopped of what they were doing and gasped loudly. \"Ugh, go back to you activities! This is best friend business!\" Hi-5 yelled as every emoji continued their everyday task. Then, he turned to Gene. \"Really?!\" The hand squealed. \"You dated a princess! Well, you're a lucky emoji, Gene. There is no emoji can't date a princess... unless the king agrees with this.\" \"Relax, buddy. If the king finds out, I'll explain everything.\" Gene said. \"You better be, because he disagrees, he'll feed you to the lions or worst.\" \"How worst?\" \"Remember when you made an accident and Smiler called you a 'malfunction', she sent bots to delete you!\" \"I think the lions are worst.\" \"Eh, I think you're right.\" Gene and Hi-5 made it to Text Center. When they entered, Jailbreak was there first than them, still in her princess dress, smiling at them. Gene's cheeks turned red, and Hi-5 wanted his two friends to have an alone time. \"'Hey, Hi-5!'\" Hi-5 gritted through his teeth, pretending someone has been calling him. \"I think someone's calling me. I have to go.\" When Hi-5 left, Jailbreak approached Gene, and greeted him. \"Morning, Gene. I just wanted to say thank you for that date yesterday.\" \"Don't mention it.\" Gene blushed. \"Hey, wanna see a movie tonight? Movies are good today.\" \"Gene, I loved to, but it's Sunday.\" The princess shook her head down. \"My family and I were having a family bonding time every Sunday, and no matter where we're going, a relative or two should come along.\" \"Wait, you mean...\" Gene was about to guess, until Jailbreak's siblings showed. \"Hi, Gene.\" One of the princesses with blonde hair greeted. \"Hello, Gene.\" Another princess with black hair and dark brown skin added. \"Nice to see you, Gene.\" A princess wit light brown hair patted his hair. \"You're still handsome though.\" Another princess, who looked just like Jailbreak, winked at him \"Hey, Meeeh\" One of the princes snickered, playing Gene's emoji type as the other princes laughed. Jailbreak's sibling came beside her, showing that they have to be with her for whole day. \"We'll be with our sister, Linda, for the whole Sunday.\" The blonde princess squealed. \"That means we'll going to watch her wherever she was... with you.\" The prince with blonde hair smirked. Then, Gene stared at Jailbreak, waiting for her to explain. \"Sorry, Gene. This happens every Sunday.\" Jailbreak apologized. \"Attention, everyone.\" Mel announced through the microphone. \"Emojis, to your cubes!\" \"Well, we have a job to do.\" Gene said. \"Yeah, I'll see you at the scanner.\" Jailbreak nodded as she headed to the scanner, while Gene headed to his cube \"And we'll stay here below!\" The light brunette princess squealed excitingly. \"Ooh, I can't wait to see the emojis get scanned.\" \"And our sister in-charge of the scanner. I mean, really, a princess took control of a scanner?\" The dark brown princess chuckled as the rest of the royal siblings laughed. Jailbreak heard them laughing as she felt so insulted and miserable when her siblings teased her that way. Just like everyday, emojis getting scanned, Jailbreak and the techs taking control of the scanner, but this time, the royal sibling were watching. The four princess loved to watch Gene getting scanned, but the princes whispered to each other of an unknown topic, which it got to be Gene. Most of all, the sibling silently laughed at their sister's job in the Text Center, which Jailbreak tried to ignore it. After that day, when Gene got off of his cube, he wanted to tag along with Jailbreak, but he saw her with her siblings, probably they forced her to leave early. Gene finally realized why Jailbreak wanted to leave the phone in the first place. Not only she wanted to live in the Cloud to be whoever she wanted to be, but to get away from her family who forced her to be like a proper royal princess. When Gene walked outside sadly, Mel caught up with him, and put his arm on his son's back to comfort him. He thought his son was tired. \"Son, are you alright?\" He asked. \"I'm fine, Dad.\" Gene answered. \"That emotion didn't describe you as 'fine'. Tell me, what's wrong.\" Gene exhaled. \"I feel terrible for Jai—Princess Linda. I know why she ran away. She didn't get along with her family that much, and I want the two of us to be alone and do whatever we want.\" Mel knew how Gene felt. This is like the same feeling he was when he discovered he was different from the other emojis. \"Son, I wanted to help you, but I can't ask the king anymore. It's too much.\" \"I know, dad. I just want everything to be normal.\" \"It'll pass son. We need to be patient.\" Unbeknownst to Mel and Gene, the keys of the supervisor office in Text Center were dropped as they were picked by an unknown emoji, and headed straight towards the Text Center. Meanwhile, Jailbreak and her siblings made it back to their mansion, where their parents were waiting. \"Glad you're home, children.\" The king greeted. \"There's something that your mother and I want to tell all of you.., including you, Linda.\" This announcement chocked Jailbreak as she and her siblings sat on their respective thrones. \"Linda, we have to discuss about your behaviour when you were with that malfunction Meh.\" The queen stated. \"Mom, for the last time, Gene is not a malfunction!\" Jailbreak yelled. \"I don't care, darling. The point why we have to discuss is...\" \"Before the queen finished her sentence, the king continued her sentence. \"You have to stay away from that Meh!\" \"WHAT?!\" The princess exclaimed. \"Why?!\" \"That Meh is a bad influence for you.\" The king said. \"He didn't do anything wrong, dad!\" \"Oh really.\" The king took a file from the butler who gave it to him, and showed the pictures of her and Gene hanging out. \"You went outside Textopolis with this meh that a young princess, like you, shouldn't go to.\" \"We're just hanging out, Dad! There's nothing wrong of hanging out with friends.\" \"But in the Wallpaper?! Linda, you are a princess, and you should be dating a prince, not a meh!\" You may see him, but you're not allowed to be with him all the time! He will ruin your status as a princess.\" \"But dad, he's my friend!\" \"No, buts, it is done! Now, go to your room!\" Jailbreak let out few tears from her eyes, and ran up the stairs to her room as she cried. When Princess Linda was gone, The king came closer to his other children, and said. \"I'm proud of you! You surely watched over your sister the whole time.\" \"We just wanted to make you happy, father.\" The black-haired princess emoji smiled.[Chapter 9] As usual, like any other day, working time for all emojis. For Jailbreak, well still working at the scanner, but she's not in a mood greeting everybody right now, including Gene, who was waving at her 'hi'. Instead of waving him back, she shook her head down in sadness and ignored him. When Gene saw her ignoring him, he got the feeling that something's didn't feel right. The Jailbreak he knew never ignored him like that. It has got to do with her family, and he wanted to find out. After a busy day, many emojis were excited to go back home, but Jailbreak walked slowly and sadly towards the exit with the other emojis. Then, she heard that sweet familiar voice that she wanted to hear all day. \"Jailbreak!\" She pretended to ignore that so she kept walking away. \"Jailbreak, wait up!\" She still tried to ignore him, until he ran up beside her. \"Jailbreak, what's the matter?\" Gene asked. \"You never ignored me like that before. Is there's something wrong? If there was, I can help you.\" \"No, Gene, nothing's wrong.\" Jailbreak replied. \"Really? If nothing's wrong, just give me a smile.\" Gene showed his big smile to make Jailbreak smile, but when she looked at him, she didn't smile. \"Come on, Jailbreak. Tell me what the problem is.\" Jailbreak sighed. She can't keep a secret from Gene anymore as she confessed. \"Gene, I like you. I always like you. But it's not you was the problem, it's my family. See? This is the reason why I want to get out of here to be free from these princess rules. My dad didn't want me to be with you for a while. I can still work, but he didn't want us to hang out long. He said being with you ruined my status as a princess, and he didn't want that.\" Gene's happy emotion suddenly turned to frown. \"So does this mean we won't seeing each other anymore?\" \"Gene, if you want us to be friends, we'll just stay away from each other for a little while. It won't be long.\" \"But I want us to be more than just friends.\" \"What do you mean?\" Gene gently held her hand. \"Jailbreak, I didn't just like you. I like like you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. If you want to.\" Jailbreak honestly wanted to spend time with Gene for the rest of her life. She wanted to say 'yes', but she still has to stay with her family. She retreated her hand from his. \"Gene, I wanted to, but I also loved my family. I can't just leave them. I'm sorry, okay?\" Jailbreak ran off with tears in her eyes. Gene wanted to catch up with her, but he understood her situation as a princess, and since the king was here, they both have to obey every command he had given. Later, Hi-5 invited Gene to a tennis play. At the tennis court, Hi-5 felt enthusiastic while throwing balls with a racket to Gene, but the multi-expressive emoji hasn't caught a single ball as he was not in a mood for playing. Hi-5 noticed his best friend as he asked. \"Uh, Gene, are you okay?\" \"Ugh, I can't play, Hi-5.\" Gene sighed. \"It's cool that Jailbreak won't listen to her parents, but if she doesn't stay away from me, she gonna get hurt and depressed by her own family.\" \"Well, you could at least avoid her for a day.\" Hi-5 advised. \"Then, she's gonna think I didn't like her anymore.\" Gene sighed. \"I can't take this anymore, Hi-5. Not because Jailbreak started to do her duties as a princess and obeying her family, but because she was under pressure of being a princess. I hate seeing her so depressing.\" \"So, what are you gonna do?\" The hand emoji asked. \"I have to keep Jailbreak away from being depressed if this keeps happening for the rest of her life, even if it means I never get to see her again.\" Gene threw the tennis racket away, and he marched out of the tennis court, leaving Hi-5 concerned about him. \"Ooooohhhhhh, he's gonna die.\" He said. Gene made it in front of Jailbreak's mansion, but he kept himself hidden behind the bushes. \"Okay, Gene. This is the hardest, riskiest, most terrifying thing you've ever done, but Jailbreak's life depends on what you do next.\" He said to himself. Gene sneaked on the side of the mansion, where he saw Jailbreak writing something on her notebook in her room. He's glad that he found her quickly. He picked up a small stone, and threw it on Jailbreak's window. Jailbreak heard a loud tap outside her window. She walked towards, and opened it. She thought it was another bird, but there's nothing. \"Psst.\" She heard a 'psst' as she looked down, and saw Gene, hiding in a bush. \"Jailbreak, come down here.\" He whispered a little louder. \"Why?\" Jailbreak asked quietly. \"I have something to tell you.\" \"Could you, at least, tell me tomorrow?\" \"No, no time. Just come down. I need to talk to you very important. \"Okay.\" Jailbreak used the blankets and curtains and tied them together to make a rope, then threw the end outside the window, and slid down, landing in front of Gene. \"Hmm, no wonder princesses should have fancy rooms.\" Gene quickly held Jailbreak's hand. \"Jailbreak, come with me here, and we need to be quick before somebody sees us.\" \"Gene, what's going on?\" She asked. \"I'll explain later, just follow me.\" Gene and Jailbreak ran to the garden, where the place was empty and no one can see them there. \"Okay, Gene, what do you want to talk about?\" Gene scratched the back of his head as he was nervous to tell her. \"Jailbreak, like I said before, you're the coolest emoji I've ever met, and I wanted to be with you always.\" Jailbreak was touched. \"Oh, Gene, that was incredible...\" \"But I think that's not gonna happen.\" The princess emoji's smile turned to frown in confused. \"What? What do you mean?\" Gene sighed. He knew this would happened. \"Jailbreak, we can't be like this forever.\" \"Why? You don't like me anymore?\" \"No, it's not you. It's just, your family. They... they just want us to be who we are.\" \"Don't mind my family, Gene! They don't understand what we have been through those times.\" \"I know, but they're your family. They're just doing what was best for you, and I don't want you to go against them. That makes you feel worst.\" \"But, Gene, I don't want to live with my family anymore. That's why I ran away to live in the Cloud, so I can do whatever I want and be what I want to be, and get out of these royalty rules.\" \"But why won't live in the Cloud by then?\" Why else that I decided to stay and work in the Text Center? Why else I came back?\" The princess smiled warmly. \"Because I love you.\" Gene's eyes widened with a red blush appeared on his cheeks. \"You do?\" \"Yes, and I don't want to break up with you.\" Jailbreak admitted. \"I have to obey my father so you wouldn't get hurt.\" \"Not only me, you'll get hurt too.\" \"But I can't obey him anymore. Gene, I wanted to be with you too. Let's just run away from here. Let's go to the Cloud together, where we can do what we want, like what you said to me before!\" Jailbreak admitted before that she can't the princess that what she was here in Textopolis and wanted to be alone in the Cloud, but her mind suddenly changed when she has feelings for Gene, and wanted to be with him now. Gene made a smile face, then frown, making Jailbreak worried. \"Jailbreak, I loved to. I really loved to be with you, but we can't just run away from our problems. We should face it.\" \"But Gene...\" \"And that's why I'm here!\" Gene can catch a glimpse on the king and the queen, who was walking down the stair outside the mansion, probably looking for Jailbreak. He was afraid of doing this, but it's a right thing to do. \"This is for your own good!\" The multi-expressive emoji made a risky thing ever. Gene leaned on Jailbreak's face, which she moved her head a little backward, but his caught hers as he kissed her passionately. The king and queen saw the 'meh' kissing their daughter as they realized their own daughter disobeyed their rules. They gasped in horror as their heads turned red and shouted loudly and angrily, \"LLLIIIIIINNDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\" Their voices were heard all over Textopolis. All emojis, including Hi-5, Mel, and Mary, are startled by that loud scream. Back at the mansion, the king kicked Gene out on the street, and the queen grabbed Jailbreak's wrist tightly. \"You're in lockdown until you can behave like a real princess!\" The queen scolded as she dragged her daughter back inside the mansion, and the king locked all doors and windows all over the mansion with steel bars and alarm lasers. Jailbreak was now in her room as she showed herself to Gene through her window sadly. Gene sighed sadly as his face turned to sadness with a tear appeared from his left eye. He loved Jailbreak so much, but he might never saw her again, \"It had to be done.\" When he walked away from the mansion, and was about to go home, Gene was alone on the street when everyone was asleep. Suddenly, a large dark shadow approached him as he felt someone was following him. Gene turned around, and gasped in horror as he was about to run away, but a claw caught him, and knocked him out unconscious.[Chapter 10] I am truly sorry for taking this so long. I've been busy at school since it's the beginning summer in the Philippines, I'm also busy with other stories, and I've been spending time with my family. So, this is the new chapter. This is also my Easter present for you guys. Belated Happy Easter everyone! In the middle of the night, Mel and Mary realized Gene hasn't come home yet, and they're very worried. They went outside to find him. They, later, found Hi-5, who was still playing tennis all by himself in the tennis court. \"Hi-5 noticed Gene's parents coming as he dropped the racket, and waved at them with his body. \"Oh, hi Mr. and Mrs. Meh.\" \"Hello, Hi-5, have you seen Gene anywhere?\" Mary asked. \"We've been looking all over for him, and we're very worried.\" \"Sorry, Mrs. Meh. Gene left hours ago, and I thought he went home.\" \"He hasn't been home for hours.\" Mel said. \"Oh, now I'm worried for my best friend. Where could he be?\" When the Mehs and Hi-5 tried to think where Gene could be, three giant shadows came behind. The emojis turned around, and tried to retreat, but Hi-5 got captured, and Mel tried to protect Mary, but they both ended up captured. At the mansion, a door bell was rang, and the king and queen opened the door to answer it, but they were immediately captured by the same giant mysterious shadows. The princes and princesses, except Jailbreak, heard their parents screaming as they left their bedroom to check on them. But it was part of a trap as they all been captured themselves. Jailbreak woke up when she heard her family screaming for help. She hopped out of bed, and wore her wrist code watch, just in case. When she opened the door, she noticed that familiar structure as she was about to fight it off, until its claw caught her as well. All emojis all over Textopolis were captured an army of mysterious figures. They even captured young one when the parents tried to protect them, but they were captured as well. The emojis were carried and taken to the Text Center. Meanwhile, inside the Text Center, the whole room was dark, probably because it was close and it's still nighttime. The techs were tied up and mouths covered while they were sitting in the scanner. Gene woke up from his unconsciousness as he slowly opened his eyes and noticed that same smiling , who wants to get rid of him days ago. \"Wake up, Sleeping Beauty!\" \"Ahh!\" Gene screamed briefly as he snapped awake. \"Glad you're awake!\" Smiler greeted with a big smile. \"Smiler, what are you doing?! What's going on?!\" Gene panted heavily as he tried to move, but he was trapped by a robotic claw. \"I made a party, Gene.\" \"A party about what?\" \"A party for your deletion!\" The smiley emoji made a very big creepy smile. \"Wait! You can't delete me!\" Gene exclaimed. \"I saved your life, and everyone else! Because of all of my expressions!\" \"Yes, but you ruined my reputation! Because of you, I was sent to the loser lounge and I was replaced by your daddy as the new supervisor of Text Center! You also ruined every emoji's reputation that Emojis should only be one thing!\" \"It shouldn't be, Smiler! Of course, all emojis have their titles and their only emotion, but it doesn't they should follow it. We can be who want to be.\" \"And that's why you and your daddy are malfunctions! So, I invented him in the party tonight.\" Gene's eyes widened in horror. \"You mean, you sent him here?\" \"Not just him.\" Smiler smiled evilly as many robots entered the place with all of the emojis in Textopolis, including Gene's parents, on their claws, struggling to break free. \"I brought everyone!\" The multi-expressive emoji gasped. \"Now, this is what I call 'party'!\" Smiler chuckled. \"And what is a party without more than one guest? So, that's why I invented everyone to join the deletion party... including your family.\" A robot threw Mel to the ground in front of Smiler and Gene. Gene was released from his robot's claw, and ran to his father's aid. \"Dad, are you okay?\" \"I'm okay, Gene.\" Mel replied. \"Smiler, I think you've gone way too far this time.\" Poop spoke. \"Oh really? How about you're next?\" Smiler grinned as the robot that Poop was trapped on pointed its other claw on him, ready to delete him. Poop just shut his mouth to keep himself quiet. \"I'm sorry, son. This is all my fault.\" Mel saddened \"What? No, Dad, it's not.\" Gene said. \"I was the real reason you've became like this. I am the starter. I was responsible for all of this.\" \"Oh, what a touching daddy son reunion moment.\" Smiler interrupted. \"It reminds me of the time I deleted you both. Oh wait, that's this time! Delete the two malfunctions!\" She commanded as one of the robots opened its claws and ready to shoot Gene and Mel to delete them. Mary freed herself from her trap, and she and Mel ran towards each other to block the gap between their son and the robot. \"No!\" Suddenly, Hi-5 and Jailbreak break through the glass window to rescue Gene and the other emojis. \"How's that for an entr... oof\" Hi-5 crashed landed on a robot and groaned painfully. Jailbreak landed safely on the back of the robot. \"Wait! How did you get away from my bots?!\" Smiler asked in rage. *Flashback* Jailbreak fought back the robot by punching, kicking, and some of her karate skills that she taught from Karate School Lucky thing she still has her code watch around her wrist, and tapped on the code to unlock the bot's power button. She climbed up behind the bot's head, and pushed the button, shutting the robot off. Jailbreak landed on the floor with her torn dress. \"Ugh, can't fight with this dress.\" At the streets, Hi-5 struggled to break free from the bot's claws, but suddenly, it shut down by itself, dropping Hi-5 to the ground, and Jailbreak revealed herself with her black clothes and hat and was the one who shut the r robot down. \"Jailbreak! Boy, am I glad to see you!\" Hi-5 exclaimed happily. \"Shhh!\" Jailbreak shushed him, and dragged him in the alley. \"Listen fingers, I think Smiler's responsible for this.\" \"How did you know?\" \"Duh. She owns those bots, and I think she kidnapped Gene first before she attempted to kidnap us.\" \"We have to find Gene, and rescue him and the everyone. Then, we could be heroes!\" \"And I know where.\" *End of flashback* \"Long story, I can't tell!\" Jailbreak smiled sheepishly as she tapped on her code watch, and the power button appeared. The bot felt that, and moved randomly while reaching for Jailbreak at the back and Hi-5 on the top, which he jumped to avoid the claws. \"I can't reach!\" Jailbreak tried to reach for the button, but the robot is still moving randomly. In her last attempt to reach for the button, Jailbreak fell down in front of her family, who were still held captive by bots. The large bot turned to Jailbreak and her family, and aimed its claw at them. Gene saw this and panicked as he leaped between the bot and Jailbreak and her family to protect the royal family. Then, suddenly, the robot put its claw down and shut down. \"Oh no!\" Smiler yelled in horror, then turned to Jailbreak. \"What did you do to my beautiful—\" Then, the large bot fell onto Smiler, which her teeth and braces broke down ... again. \"Ow, my tooth!\" Then, Hi-5 showed himself, revealing that he pressed the button to shut the robot down. \"Hand, button!\" The other robots had their power button revealed as some emojis reached for them to shut the bots off, while some helped the helpless once. When the royal family were freed from their trap, Gene got up and wiped the dust off of him. \"You tried to save us, after what we've done to you. Why?\" One of the princes asked. Gene turned to the royal family, and cleared his throat. \"Because... I made a mistake once, and... I don't think you deserve any punishment at all.\" \"You know...\" The King immediately spoke. \"There isn't a man on this phone we'd ever think would be good enough for our daughter, but, um...\" \"You come pretty close.\" The Queen finished. Gene smiled back at them, then looked at Smiler, who was still under the robot. \"What would we should do about Smiler? Surely, she's going to get me again.\" \"Don't worry, boy, I think I know what I should do to her.\" The King smirked. Later, Smiler was thrown into the dungeon as a punishment for her crimes. She had her braces fix, and her jailmates are criminal emojis like Bomb, Knife, and Gun, who are ready to play Go Fish with her. \"Oh great.\" Smiler sighed, still smiling.[Chapter 11] At night, the King and Queen announced the whole Textropolis about a party that was been held at their mansion to celebrate to honor three emojis heroism and finally brought Smiler to justice… for real this time. Everyone is invite, except for Smiler, of course, as she kept cleaning her teeth mouthwash in jail. Everyone's been enjoying the party lately. Gene, his parents, and Hi-5 were sitting at the table with the royals. Hi-5 can eat anything he wanted… in his own way as the King and Queen tried to get use to that since the hand was a friend of one of their daughters. In the middle of the dinner, the King his glass with a spoon. \"Quiet, everyone! Attention! I have something to say.\" Every emoji stopped eating to listen to the King's speech. Gene tapped Hi-5 to stop him eating. Now, there are food smudge all over the hand emoji. Hi-5 quickly grabbed a napkin with his thumb, and wiped it all over his body. The King stood up, walked towards the center, and cleared his throat. \"First of all, I would like to thank everyone for attending this wonderful celebration. But this isn't just an ordinary celebration, we're here to celebrate and honor our heroes.\" He gestured Gene, Hi-5, and Jailbreak to join him at the center. The three emojis left their seats, and walked towards the king. The butler, suddenly, came over with a pillow of three medals on his hands. The King took one medal, announced \"As the king, I hereby declare you…, Jailbreak, the brave and bold Princess emoji.\" He put the medal around his daughter's neck, then whispered. \"I'm so proud of you.\" Jailbreak was surprised the her father called her by her fake name, and was so proud of her. She just smiled at him. Her siblings finally felt happy for her. They'll just get use to their sister's personality. The king winked at his princess. Then, he took another medal. \"I hereby declare you, Hi-5, the loyal Hand emoji.\" Before the king gave the medal to Hi-5, the hand emoji excitingly snatched the medal from him, and cheered loudly and happily. Gene slightly elbowed him as Hi-5 and bowed. \"Thank you. Your kind gesture is my appreciation.\" He wore the medal immediately. \"And lastly…\" The king took the last medal, and moved the Gene. \"I hereby declare you, Gene, the determining and confident multi-expressive emoji.\" He put the medal over and around Gene. \"In additional, I apologized for my behavior, Gene. As a father to my princes and princesses, it was my responsibility to protect my children, especially Linda. I thought you were a bad influence for my daughters, but, I guess I was wrong.\" \"It's okay, Your Majesty, I understand.\" Gene bowed. \"And if you don't mind now, may I…?\" His eyes pointed Jailbreak. \"Oh, of course.\" The king stepped aside beside Hi-5 to let Gene walked towards Jailbreak. \"Uh, Gene, what are you doing?\" Jailbreak blushed in embarrassment. \"Don't worry. I've been practicing this and I already told your dad about this.\" Gene smiled. When he knelt down, gasps were heard from the crowd, Mel and Mary knew about this as they held each other's hand, ready to let their son go, and Hi-5 bit his lower lip to hold his squeal; he was so excited. Jailbreak wanted to step back, but she can't with Gene holding her hand. \"Jailbreak, you're the coolest, most interesting emoji I've ever met.\" Gene started, mixing his other emotions word by word, based on other emojis. \"And after all the adventures that we had, I'm just not sure I want all that to go away, because my feelings right now are, like, huge. I know I said this before, but when I started hanging out with you, my feeling are huger than before. I know I'm not your prince charming, and you're not just a princess. I know this is not what you have been planned, but if you just give yourself another plan to make you happy, then you should be now and the rest of your life, if you want to.\" He took out a small black box, and opened it, revealing a golden band with a silver diamond. An engagement ring. \"Jailbreak, I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and this time, not like in a fairytale. At least, just like everybody, you could be free in any other way than the one you planned of living in the Cloud. And if you want to be free from what you are or from these stereotypes, I'm always here to help you. So, princess, Linda, urgh… Jailbreak, would you grant me the honor of becoming my wife? Will you marry me?\" The princess emoji didn't know how or what to say. She looked at her parents as they nodded if she agrees. Jailbreak remembered Gene said this before, but she rejected him and left heartbroken. She felt bad about it and regret what she had done. Jailbreak helped Gene to get up, and confessed. \"Gene, you have said this to me before, but I stick to my plan. I regretted what I said before. I thought I never got a chance correct it, but… there is a chance. So, my answer is yes. Yes! I will marry you, Gene!\" As the crowd cheered loudly, Gene was never been more happier. The king and queen smiled warmly, ready to let their daughter made her own decision. The princesses cried in tears, never had a chance with Gene anymore. Suddenly, Hi-5 grinned at them, but the princess were disgust as they moved away from him. Mary can't smile, but Mel knew she was so proud, as so was he. When the crowd clapped and congratulated the two emojis, Jailbreak can't hide this in public anymore as she crashed her lips against Gene's, and he kissed her back while wrapping his arms around her. \"I'll be the best man, everybody! I'll be the best man!\" Hi-5 yelled with pride. Months later, Gene and Jailbreak had their wedding at the royal family's garden, and Hi-5 became the best man. The day after their wedding, the two held their honeymoon in 'Just Dance' app, which Alex restore it back. They took the Twitter bird to ride there, which was summoned secretly by Jailbreak's whistle. Gene knew Jailbreak loved to dance now, and that's the time where they have fun together during their adventure. Hi-5, Mel, Mary, the royal family, and the some other emojis were invited and enjoyed dancing. A week later, the king agreed to let Jailbreak back to work in Text Center, and made sure Smiler is locked up. Gene and Jailbreak stayed at his parents' apartment for a while before finding a new home for the two of them to start a family. Well, this is the last chapter. Sorry I didn't make a wedding scene, but don't worry. If I have enough time and ideas, I'll make a wedding scene sooner. If you have suggestions and ideas, let me know. Make it funny, romantic and fun. Thank you all for your support and patience.

Bye :-) ","Summary":" I saw the Emoji Movie in the internet, and it was funny. I watched the movie over and over again, u"},{"Movie":"Pretty in Pink","Title":"And Deep Down, You Know She's Right","Author":"carolinelaughs","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727693","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: In the movie, Pretty in Pink , we really are not told all that much about Steff, we know he's from a rich family, he wants to get back at his parents for something (\"This one may just kill the old son of a bitch, Blane.\"), and of course, he does not take too kindly to rejection. We don't even know what his last name is. It could be Grey. We're not told, so for the purposes of this story, it is. (I know there was a novelization of Pretty in Pink , but this story is based on the movie and only the movie.) If you're a fan of James Spader (and really, who isn't?) you will quickly take note that many details of Steff (or Stefan, as he is called here) and his later life are derived from various other movies/TV shows he was in, chiefly, Secretary , but many others as well. Elizabeth, the protagonist, is an analog (or 'counterpart') of Maggie Gyllenhaal/Lee, in case you couldn't tell from reading the story (many of Elizabeth's character details are derived from movies Maggie Gyllenhaal was in as well), and Elizabeth and Stefan's relationship here is structured around their character's relationship in that film, with many differences, Elizabeth's hangup is not that she cuts herself, but that she cannot allow herself to get over her college boyfriend, Toby. I hope everyone will enjoy reading this story, especially those who love Steff, and want to see a better resolution for him than the one he got in the actual film. Elizabeth had been driving her father to work and various places every day after his license had been suspended due to a DUI, one of several. Her father, Stephen, was a lawyer, dealing mostly with slip-and-fall type cases, work-related injuries, and the like. Stephen was a highly intelligent man, and had been a brilliant defense attorney years back, however, his troubles with alcohol had gotten him fired from the firm he worked at, and since then he worked in private practice. However, after two years of AA meetings, Stephen had managed to stay sober for some time now. Elizabeth was glad to have her father back, even though driving him to work could sometimes pose an inconvenience. \"So how was work today?\" Stephen asked Elizabeth in the car one morning. \"Work was good.\" Elizabeth said. \"Still seeing Toby?\" Stephen said, a disapproving note in his voice. \" 'Seeing'?\" Elizabeth said. \"Dad, I've been in a relationship with him for seven years. You know that.\" \"A relationship?\" Stephen said. \"Elizabeth, you told me that Toby didn't want a committed relationship. I thought you weren't even together with him anymore.\" \"We're still close. Toby doesn't like labels and commitments. Til death do you part type stuff. It reminds him that he's going to die one day.\" Stephen snorted and shook his head. \"Dad…\" Elizabeth said. \"Are you still sleeping with him?\" \"Dad!\" Elizabeth said. \"That's none of your business.\" \"Let me guess. He still wants to sleep with you, but 'not label it a relationship'.\" \"For your information, Toby and I haven't slept together for two years.\" said Elizabeth. \"But we've stayed close.\" \"Have you seen anyone else these past two years?\" Stephen said. \"No, Dad.\" said Elizabeth. \"And why not?\" \"Because,\" Elizabeth said. \"Toby and I are still together, even when we're not a romantic couple.\" \"And does Toby know this?\" said Stephen. Elizabeth blinked in irritation, before answering. \"Of course he does, Dad. Toby knows how I feel about him. And he understands. He just doesn't want what I want out of life. You make it sound like I was dangerously obsessed with him.\" \"Princess, of course I didn't.\" Stephen said. \"It's him I find in the wrong is all.\" \"Dad, I don't know why you don't like Toby, anyway. He's a great guy.\" \"Elizabeth, he may very well be a great guy, in some respects, but I don't approve of the way he treats you. He's obviously just using you.\" \"Using me for what?\" Elizabeth said. \"And anyway, Toby's been great. He's been very understanding of our….situation. He says not to worry about what time I go to, or leave work, when I take you places.\" Elizabeth worked at a coffee and pastry shop, which Toby owned. Stephen looked down at his lap briefly. \"Well, he should be understanding. You don't need to be working at that coffee shop for him. You have an English degree, for goodness sakes. You should be doing something else, something more meaningful.\" \"Dad, please.\" Elizabeth said. \"Please, just cool it, okay? Working at the coffee shop for Toby is what makes me happy. It is meaningful. Okay?\" Stephen sighed, shaking his head. Elizabeth had met Toby in when she was in junior high school, where he was two years ahead of her, at an after school club that met to discuss the works of Stephen King, who was Elizabeth's favorite writer. Toby was a slender, handsome guy with dark hair, and dark eyes, who wore mostly black, and hung out with the nerds, despite being better looking than your average nerd. He had an easygoing, jokey personality. Toby was very into books and literature, as was Elizabeth, but she had never had the courage to tell him how she felt in high school, despite their friendship. After she graduated, Elizabeth had based her choice of the college that she was attending on the one where Toby was also attending, where she had finally made her move, telling Toby how she felt. They had dated throughout college, after which Toby had decided to open up his own coffee shop and bakery, and had invited her to come work for him, where she had been working for the past three years. \"I had another argument with my father about you yesterday.\" Elizabeth said in the kitchen of the bakery the next day. \"Oh, really?\" said Toby. \"What was it about?\" \"Oh, he thinks I shouldn't work for you. He doesn't approve of our relationship.\" \"Well, it just so happens, I agree with your dad.\" Said Toby. \"I mean, you need to stop feeling the way you do about me. I told you that. I'm just not into relationships.\" \"That doesn't mean I can't like you, does it?\" said Elizabeth. \"Should my feelings about you go away, just because you don't want a relationship?\" \"What's so special about me, anyway?\" said Toby. \"Come on.\" \"How can you say that?\" Elizabeth said. \"I mean, you're great looking, and a great guy, and easy to be around, and funny, and smart, and you like Stephen King as much as I do, and…\" \" Nobody likes Stephen King as much you do, Liz.\" Said Toby. \"Well, that may be true, Toby, but anyway. I've never met anyone I like as much as I like you. I've told you that.\" She bit her lip. \"But it doesn't matter, anyway. If you want me, I mean.\" \"Want you?\" Toby said. \"Oh, come on. Don't be so overly dramatic. That's silly…it's not that I don't 'want' you….I don't want anyone that way…as a lifetime relationship. I like being by myself. Not all the time, but when it counts. I like living alone.\" \"I'm not asking to live with you, am I?\" Elizabeth said. \"I know, I know.\" Toby said. \"But you want more than I can give you. You want those things, I know. I can tell. So I can't really…I can't keep….we just can't see each other. For anything non-platonic. Not…well, not in good conscience.\" \"Okay.\" Elizabeth said. \"Toby, it's enough for me…I know it sounds…maudlin, but it's enough for me to work here for you, and to be around you every day. That's…that's what I wanted to achieve, in my life, ever since I've met you. Is that creepy?\" \"No, not creepy.\" said Toby. \"You can like to work here all you want, but you should…stop…you know. Having romantic feelings about me. Not for me, for yourself.\" \"But Toby.\" Said Elizabeth. \"That's the thing. I don't want to not feel this way about you. Caring about you…makes me happy. Like when my dad was in the hospital because of his drinking. I'd think about you to feel better. And when my parents were fighting all the time, because of his drinking. Not just wanting you, but also…wanting you to be happy, no matter what. That's what made me feel better, and like…have more goodwill towards my dad. Not resent him for his problems. That's the way it's been, ever since we were in school together. Losing my feelings for you…would hurt more than you not wanting to be with me. I live to like you, Toby.\" Toby swallowed. \"I see.\" He looked down at his hands. \"It's kind of…hard to know what to say to that.\" \"You don't have to say anything to it, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"That's just the way it is. But you don't have to worry about me. I'm not tortured or anything. I'm not trying to get you to do anything you don't want to, am I? I'm happy, doing what I'm doing.\" \"I'm not sure you are.\" Toby said. \"That's the thing.\" \"I am.\" Elizabeth said. \"I mean, I love having you here, but…I just don't think these strong feelings for me are right. I worry about you, you shouldn't have your whole life dedicated to me or anything.\" \"Toby, don't flatter yourself. I think about plenty of other things. I think about books, and writing, and philosophy, and…running this place, and helping my dad, and…\" \"Running this place.\" Toby said. \"See, that's something that has to do with me. You should do what you want in life, not run around trying to please others. The same goes for your dad. You shouldn't be driving him to work every day, either.\" \"Again, Toby, helping you run this place is what I want.\" Elizabeth said. \"And my dad needs me.\" Toby sighed. \"Okay.\" he said. \"If this is really what you want in life.\" \"It is, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"It is.\" \"I have a meeting with this lawyer, who's looking for a partner.\" Her father said one morning a few weeks later. \"Can you come and pick me up around three?\" \"Sure.\" Elizabeth said. Stephen looked at her. \"How's Toby?\" he said. \"He's great.\" Elizabeth replied archly. Stephen sighed, and shook his head, looking out the window. \"Well, this other lawyer I told you about, Mr. Grey, seems confident in my abilities. We have another meeting today at one.\" \"Mr. Grey?\" said Elizabeth. \"Like the evil alien from Dreamcatcher ?\" Stephen laughed. \"Could be. He seems relatively harmless, though. Very reserved, almost…humorless.\" \"Sounds like a blast.\" Elizabeth said. \"Yeah, but he seems like a pretty smart man. While I was waiting for my appointment the other day, his secretary, Tricia, said that he almost never loses his cases.\" \"Well, that's great, Dad. Neither do you though.\" \"Yeah, before the booze got the better of me.\" Said Stephen. Elizabeth sighed, and patted his hand. \"Well, it hasn't now.\" She said. \"Well,\" Elizabeth said later that day, in the parking lot of the lawyer's office. \"I'll wait for you out here.\" \"Okay.\" Stephen put his hand on the door handle, then turned to look at her. \"You know, Liz,\" he said. \"Our meeting might go awhile. Maybe you should wait for me inside, instead of in the car.\" \"I'm fine out here, Dad. Don't worry.\" said Elizabeth. \"I don't know, Liz.\" said Stephen. \"I've heard that this is a dangerous area. Maybe you should wait inside. You don't want to get carjacked, do you?\" \"I haven't heard that this is a particularly dangerous area.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Well, there's not really any such thing as a safe area anymore, Elizabeth. You don't want to take chances.\" \"Dad, I'll be okay. Really.\" Elizabeth said. \"Elizabeth, I'd really feel better about things if you'd wait for me inside. Please, just do it for me.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Fine. If it'll make you happy, I'll wait inside, okay?\" Stephen smiled at her. \"Thanks, honey.\" He said. Elizabeth got out of the car, rolling her eyes. Inside, there was a small waiting area, where Elizabeth, her father waited. There seemed to be a lot of Asian themed décor around the office After about twenty minutes, a blond woman approached the two of them. \"Mr. Dawes, Mr. Grey will see you now.\" the blond woman said. \"All right. Thank you.\" Stephen said. He got up, and disappeared down the corridor. The blond woman took a seat at a desk, and began inserting a piece of paper into a typewriter. \"Typewriters.\" Elizabeth said. \"Haven't seen one of those for a while.\" The blond woman smiled a tight-lipped smile at her. \"Mr. Grey prefers we use typewriters here.\" \"I see.\" Elizabeth said. \"Is he aware that it's like…2002?\" \"Probably not.\" The blond said. \"Oh.\" Said Elizabeth. The blond woman resumed typing. \"Why does he prefer them?\" Elizabeth asked, after a few moments. \"Oh, he thinks computers with spell-check facilitate laziness. He prefers that secretaries earn their keep. Keeps them smarter and more skilled.\" \"I see.\" Elizabeth said, rolling her eyes. \"He sounds like a peach to work for.\" The blond pursed her lips, and kept typing. Elizabeth sighed, and looked at her watch. After about thirty minutes, Stephen emerged from the corridor with a man with dark blond hair. \"Well, Mr. Grey, I assure you that you won't regret this decision.\" Stephen was saying to the blond man. \"No, I'm sure I won't, Mr. Dawes.\" Mr. Grey said. \"Stephen, please. As I said.\" Stephen said. \"And as I said, Mr. Grey, I'm very glad that we're going to be working together.\" \"I'm glad as well…uh, Stephen.\" Said Mr. Grey, though it appeared to Elizabeth that his tone of voice never conveyed any emotion, much less being glad of anything. \"Indeed.\" Stephen said. \"Well, I should probably be going, but I suppose we'll be seeing each other again very soon.\" \"Right.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Well, I suppose I'll see you then.\" \"Yes.\" Stephen said. He turned to go. \"Oh, Mr. Grey.\" He said. \"I forgot. I wanted you to meet my daughter, Elizabeth. She was concerned about waiting in the car.\" Mr. Grey looked startled. \"Uh. Well- Elizabeth stood up, and walked over to him. \"Hello there, Mr. Grey.\" She said. \"My father tells me you're uh…an excellent attorney.\" She held out her hand. Mr. Grey sneezed suddenly. Elizabeth bit her lip. \"Allergies.\" He said. \"Oh.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Okay.\" \"Often happens when I'm around perfume.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"That's why I have a policy against it for my employees.\" Elizabeth restrained the urge to say something sarcastic, not wanting to sabotage her father's livelihood. \"Well,\" she said. \"I'm sure that you and my father will work well together. He tells me that you're an excellent attorney. As is he, of course.\" \"Yes.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I won't usually be…in here like this. Dad never…got his license. He always saw those videos of people injured in car accidents they show in drivers ed in high school, and was just too chicken.\" She smiled at him. \"Really.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"That is odd, because he told me you take him to work every day because of a suspended license, right Stephen?\" Stephen smiled. \"Right. I'm touched, sweetheart, at your protectiveness, but I already told Mr. Grey I'm a recovering alcoholic. It's not something I go to great lengths to hide.\" \"Oh.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Problems with alcoholism aren't unheard of with attorneys, and anyway, as your father indicated, he's had two years sober. I believe that people deserve second chances, don't you, Ms. Dawes?\" \"Uh…well, of course. Of course I do.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But your penchant for creative lying indicates that you would make an excellent attorney.\" Said Mr. Grey. Stephen laughed. \"I'm afraid Elizabeth here was never very interested in the law. She's all about books, and literature, and writing. She has an English degree, right Liz?\" \"Uh..yeah, Dad.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Ah.\" Said Mr. Grey. There was an awkward silence. \"Well, it was lovely to meet you, Mr. Grey, but I think we should be going. I have to get back to work. My boss is a real stickler for- \"Actually, your father indicated to me that your boss was a good friend of yours, and your hours are flexible. You know, I always say that the two lowest forms of human beings are liars, and lawyers. Perhaps you should look into the latter, at least that one would pay more.\" Elizabeth opened her mouth, but closed it again. \"Well,\" she said finally. \"You certainly did tell a lot, didn't you, Dad?\" \"Not a lot, no.\" He looked at Mr. Grey. \"I'm sure that Mr. Grey is just joking.\" \"Well, lying outside a professional capacity is certainly not indicative of good character, Ms. Dawes.\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Yeah, okay. Thank you for that lovely piece of advice, Mr. Grey. I'll take it into consideration. However, I must get back to work now, because while the hours might be flexible, running the bakery is important to me, and I like to do a professional job of it. I'm sure that you can appreciate that.\" \"Of course.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Well, that was wonderfully…awkward.\" Elizabeth said to her father in the car a few moments later. Stephen cleared his throat. \"Well, Mr. Grey certainly seems a bit…awkward at first, but he's a very intelligent man, Elizabeth.\" \"That's great, Dad. But intelligent doesn't mean he's not an asshole, does it?\" \"Oh, I don't think he's quite that, Elizabeth…just a bit of a stickler.\" \"He certainly seems as though he has a stick somewhere.\" Elizabeth muttered. Her father was quiet. \"Well, that may be, Elizabeth, but you know, not everyone would hire me, with my record.\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Okay, Dad.\" She said. She looked at him. \"I want you to know, I'm proud of you.\" \"Thank you, sweetie.\" Said Stephen. There was a silence. \"Don't think I don't know what you were doing, though.\" Elizabeth said. \"What was I doing?\" Stephen said. \"I see you're an accomplished liar. Second lowest form of human being…or is it the first?\" \"Both, actually.\" Her father said. \"But I just thought you'd like to meet Mr. Grey. I was telling him what a help you are to me, and how hard you work, helping me out with my sobriety, and he seemed to be very impressed with my description of you.\" Elizabeth looked at him, horrified. \"Wait he asked to meet me?\" \"Don't be absurd.\" Stephen said. \"Did he seem like the sort that would ask to meet you…or ask to meet anyone, for that matter? It's pretty clear he's an extremely reserved man.\" \"Except when he was calling me a liar. He seemed to get really into doing that.\" \"Yes, well.\" said Stephen. \"He does seem pretty officious.\" Elizabeth snorted. \"What on earth ever made you think that I'd want to meet him?\" \"Oh, I don't know.\" said Stephen. \"He's not so bad, once you've talked with him for awhile, and anyway, he's successful, intelligent…and he doesn't wear a ring.\" Elizabeth looked at her father. \"Dad, you can't be serious.\" Stephen shrugged. \"I'm just saying. It wouldn't kill you to think of other men besides what's-his-name.\" \"Dad…\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Dad, I knew exactly what you were doing, the moment you introduced me to that…droning creep, but to hear you say it out like that…\" \"Oh, come off it.\" Stephen said. \"I'm only saying. Since it's obvious that Toby doesn't want a relationship, you should at least consider other candidates. To be interested in, at the very least.\" \"Well, it won't be that one.\" Elizabeth said.[Chapter 2] \"You'll never believe what my father did to me today.\" Elizabeth said to Toby later that afternoon. \"Uh oh. What did he do?\" Toby said. \"You know those old stories, where parents would marry their children off to rich older men, just to save their family's name?\" \"Yeah.\" Toby said. \"Well, I think that's what my father's trying to do. He tried to introduce me to that lawyer, the one I mentioned wanted to hire him. He got the job, by the way.\" \"Oh, that's great.\" Toby said. \"Yeah, it is great. I'm really happy for him.\" Elizabeth said. \"Too bad he's going to be working with such a creep.\" \"The lawyer?\" \"Yeah, Mr. Grey.\" \"Like in Dreamcatcher ?\" \"Exactly like in Dreamcatcher . Down to the slime.\" \"He hit on you?\" Toby said. \"No, you'd have to have a pulse to do that. He called me a liar.\" \"A liar?\" Toby said. \"Why?\" \"Oh, I told him that my boss hates me to be late, and I guess my father had told him how I work for someone who doesn't care when I leave to take him places.\" \"Why'd you say that I hate for you to be late?\" \"Because I wanted to leave, and get away from there. He'd already said several other things that annoyed me.\" \"Like what?\" \"Oh, he insinuated that my perfume made him sneeze, and…well, he caught me in another lie.\" Toby laughed. \" Another one?\" \"Yeah, I just figured it looked a little bad, for my dad, to have to be dropped places by me, and I didn't know that my dad had told him about his alcoholism. So he caught me. But it's my dad's fault, I wouldn't have had to say anything to him at all , if he hadn't been trying to introduce me to him to play matchmaker.\" Toby was silent. \"Well,\" he said. \"That was different. You were just lying to protect your father. I wouldn't worry about it.\" \"I just feel irritated.\" said Elizabeth. \"With Dad, but…much more so with the slimy alien lawyer. And he sounds like he could be an alien. He's got a voice like someone who smoked a thousand cigarettes, and is drowsy from the lung cancer medication.\" Toby laughed. \"He was really old?\" \"At least forty.\" \"Well, that's not so old.\" Toby said. \"Toby!\" \"Well, it's not.\" \"It's old compared to me.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I'm still in my twenties, for goodness sakes. I don't know what's wrong with my father, thinking I should meet someone like him.\" \"Sounds like you're having a bit of an overreaction. He probably just wants you to meet more people. I'm sure he feels bad that you have to drive him everywhere.\" Elizabeth sighed, shaking her head. \"I'm really not looking forward to driving him to work, and chancing running into Mr. Grey again.\" \"Yeah.\" Toby said. \"Where's Duddits when you need him.\" A month or so passed, and Elizabeth dropped her father off at work every day, taking care to stop the car as far away from the place as possible when she did. \"You know, I'm nearly fifty-six years old.\" Stephen said one day when she came to pick him up. \"So?\" \"So when we come here, you always park the car about a block down the street. I'm in no condition to hoof it that far to and from work every day.\" \"Exercise is good.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Besides, it's not really all that far. You're exaggerating.\" \"I'm sure I know why you're doing it.\" Said Stephen. \"Why's that? To avoid your charming partner?\" \"He's really a very personable guy once you get to know him, Elizabeth. You really shouldn't be so hasty to judge him by a first impression.\" Elizabeth laughed incredulously, shaking her head. \"All right, fine, think what you want about him, but park the car a little closer to the building next time, please. You don't want to kill you poor father, do you?\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"All right, Dad.\" She said. The next time, Elizabeth drove the car into the parking lot of the building of their practice, and was dismayed to see Mr. Grey standing near the door. \"Darn it, Dad. You know, some fifty-year old guys jog for miles every day.\" Stephen patted her hand. \"Now, now. Stefan is a very nice man.\" Elizabeth looked at him. \" Stefan ?\" \"Well, he says he doesn't like his name, so he prefers that everybody around the office call him Mr. Grey.\" \"Well, that makes two of us, Dad…but does he call you Mr. Dawes? It's only fair, you're his partner, you should be treated equally, not like some…subordinate.\" \"No one's treating me like a subordinate, Elizabeth. Everyone calls him that. Lawyers, clients, delivery people…everyone.\" \"Well, goody goody.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Oh lord. He's looking at me.\" \"Well, maybe you should sue him.\" Said Stephen. He waved at Mr. Grey. Mr. Grey smiled and waved back. Elizabeth did not wave. \"Very funny. Get out before he comes over here.\" \"I never thought I'd raise a child with such bad manners.\" Stephen said. \"I'd wave, if I were you, or he's going to think you like him.\" \"What?\" Elizabeth said incredulously. \"I know about these things, Liz. Hostility is often a sign of attraction between opposite sexes.\" Elizabeth stared at him for a split second. \"Out of my car. I can't believe I've been raised by a father who'd say such a disgusting thing. Out. Now.\" Stephen shook his head, smiling, and got out of the car. That afternoon, Elizabeth drove into the parking lot again, to pick up her father. Ten minutes passed, and he still didn't arrive. Elizabeth looked at the clock on the car dashboard and sighed. She was in the middle of doing this, when there was a rap on the window. She looked at the window, and was dismayed to see Mr. Grey standing there. She sighed, and rolled downed the window. \"Yes?\" she said. \"Elizabeth.\" said Mr. Grey. \"How are you today?\" \"Just great.\" said Elizabeth. Then she remembered her father's words. \"Uh, I mean…I'm doing very well. Yourself?\" \"I'm just fine.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Your father said to tell you he'd be staying a bit late, doing some research. Would you uh…like to come in and wait for him?\" \"Oh,\" said Elizabeth in an overly sweet tone. \"That's very kind of you, Mr. Grey, but no thanks. I think I'll be just fine out here in the car.\" \"Ah. I see.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Well. How's the bakery?\" \"We're doing very well, Mr. Grey.\" Said Elizabeth, a sickly smile plastered on her face. \"Your father tells me that you write. Do any writing lately?\" \"When I can.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Well, that's good.\" said Mr. Grey. \"It's…good to be creative.\" \"Yes.\" Said Elizabeth. She stole a glance at the clock. \"Always good to keep yourself aware of the time, isn't it?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Uh huh.\" Said Elizabeth irritably, then caught herself. \"Oh, I was just…worried about my father.\" \"I'm sure he's fine. Probably working, the same as I said…oh…forty seconds ago.\" \"Yes,\" said Elizabeth. \"Well. Lawyers should keep busy. I'm sure you must have a lot of work as well. I wouldn't want to keep you.\" Mr. Grey laughed. \"No, I'm done for the day.\" \"Are you?\" said Elizabeth. \"Yes.\" Said Mr. Grey. He looked at her, smiling, but Elizabeth had a feeling that there was a lot of calculation behind that smile. \"Mr. Grey,\" said Elizabeth. \"Yes, Elizabeth?\" \"You know, I think I'll go take a drive up the street, while I'm waiting for my father to finish working. I've…always wanted to see what was there.\" \"Really.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Still the second lowest form of life on earth, I see.\" \"Yes, well.\" Said Elizabeth. \"That still makes you the first, then, doesn't it, Mr. Grey?\" \"Indeed.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"But you know, Elizabeth, I've found that there's a difference between lying or bending the truth, on occasion when it's necessary to help someone, in the course of business, and lying in one's personal dealings, and the latter, I never engage in.\" \"Never?\" said Elizabeth. \"Never.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I doubt that.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Everybody lies sometimes.\" \"I don't.\" \"Well, you know, Mr. Grey.\" Said Elizabeth. \"There's also a difference between lying, and making a statement that both parties know is false. In this case, what I said was not really a lie, since it should be obvious to you that I really had no curiosity what was down the block, and simply wanted to leave.\" \"Really.\" said Mr. Grey. \"Is that how you rationalize it?\" \"Yes.\" Said Elizabeth. \"It is.\" \"Well, you have it all worked out, then, don't you?\" \"I do.\" She looked at the clock again. \"You know,\" she said. \"I just remembered that my father and I have a thing called cell phones, a modern invention, much like computers are a modern invention, and he can call me when he's ready to go. I think I'll be going now.\" \"Going up the block?\" \"Anywhere but here.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Is that truthful enough for you?\" \"You know, I can't possibly see what I did to make you dislike me so much, Elizabeth.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Can you?\" \"Well, you called me a liar, for one.\" \"Well, you told a lie. Didn't you?\" \"So, maybe you just should have kept your mouth shut about it. That's what people do.\" \"Is it? Well, it's not what I do. I'm trying to help you, Elizabeth.\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Will you please get off of my car?\" \"You know, I find women saying that to me often. What is it about me?\" \"I can't imagine.\" Said Elizabeth. Mr. Grey laughed. Elizabeth shook her head. \"What do you want, Mr. Grey?\" said Elizabeth. \"Nothing at all, Elizabeth. Just to talk to you.\" \"Well, that's touching. But what do you think my father would say about it?\" \" Your father?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Why, I think he'd be delighted. He seems to think you're too hung up on your college boyfriend, the one you work for.\" \"Wow.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You two talk around the water cooler, or something.\" \"Something like that. I maintain an excellent relationship with everyone around the office. I always tell them, they should feel free to confide in me.\" \"That's swell, but…not only do have so little tact as to betray the fact that my father confided this in you, but you're just admitting you're out here, hitting on me?\" \" 'Hitting on?'\" said Mr. Grey. \"I'd hardly call it hitting on you, Elizabeth. And your father hardly wants to keep it a secret that he doesn't approve of your little arrangement with this guy, what's his name, Tommy or something?\" \"Uh… Toby , and our 'arrangement', not that it's remotely any of your business, is simply that I work for him.\" \"Really.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Really.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But I do appreciate your uh… concern , Mr. Grey. On behalf of your partner's daughter. Magnanimous of you. You're just a real saint. I'm sure that's exactly what's going on, and there's nothing untoward about it, whatsoever.\" \"I wouldn't say that. I don't know about 'untoward', but I like you a lot. I'll admit that.\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Mr. Grey- \"You're a lovely young woman. Naturally, I find you to be very attractive. Is there something wrong with that?\" \"Mr. Grey…\" Elizabeth bit her lip. \"I'm sorry, but I can't…return that.\" \"Why not? Or at least think about it?\" \"Because…I have feelings for someone else.\" \"Someone else besides Toby?\" Elizabeth snorted incredulously. \"You are really outrageous, you know that?\" \"Oh, I don't think I'm being outrageous, Elizabeth. I'm simply telling you the truth.\" \"Well, you don't know enough about me, or my life to know the truth about it, so no, you're not, but even I didn't still have feelings for Toby, that doesn't mean I should date someone just because my father wants me to.\" \"Elizabeth, Elizabeth. Is that what all this is about? Dating this Toby because your father doesn't want you to? You're smarter than that, I know.\" \"That's not what it's about at all, Stefan . And you don't know me, so you have no way of knowing the measure of my intellect.\" For the first time during their conversation, Mr. Grey looked rattled. \"Don't call me that.\" \"Why not? It's your name, isn't it?\" \"You don't know me, either, so you have no permission to call me that.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"And no one ever calls me Stefan, anyway.\" \"Oh? So if I dated you, I'd have to just call you Mr. Grey all the time?\" \"Are you saying that you want to date me?\" \"No! For Pete's sake.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I think you are. \"I think I'm not.\" \"Because if you go out on just one date with me, I might let you call me Stefan.\" \"As romantic an offer, as that is, that I'd get to actually call you by your first name, I'm going to have to pass on that one.\" \"It is a good offer. No one ever calls me that. Anymore.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"It's not really on my top ten list of things to do.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But thanks.\" \"I think you want to.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"No, Mr. Grey.\" Said Elizabeth. \"No bounce, no play.\" \"Lovely poem.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Lovely.\" \"Thank you.\" Said Elizabeth. \"It's a line from a Stephen King book. Dreamcatcher .\" \"Very interesting.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"You ever read Stephen King?\" said Elizabeth. \"Not very much, no.\" said Mr. Grey. \"I don't get a lot of reading done, what with work and all.\" \"There you go. See, we have nothing in common.\" Mr. Grey laughed. \"You can tell that just from that one thing, huh?\" \"Are you working right now?\" said Elizabeth. \"Right at this present moment?\" \"Do I appear to be?\" \"Well, there you go.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You're wasting your time, standing here talking to me, when you could be reading.\" Mr. Grey laughed. \"Well, Elizabeth, what if I said I'd rather be standing here talking to you?\" \"Mr. Grey,\" Elizabeth said. \"Go away.\" \"Another poem. Stephen King again?\" \"Could be.\" \"Well, what is it with you and him?\" \"I don't know. I just like his books a lot. And he has the same name as my father, and he's also a recovering alcoholic, like my dad, and he was born the same year, so there could be some kind of transference thing. I mean, it's just a coincidence, but I've always thought that it was weird. But mostly, it's just because I think that his books are really great.\" \"Interesting.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Yep.\" \"But as long as you like things that remind you of your father, I'm also a lawyer, and my first name is similar to your dad's, and uh, Mr. King's.\" \"Wow, you're really reaching now, aren't you.\" Said Elizabeth. \"And you also could actually be my father, so there's that.\" \"Oh, I could not.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"You could.\" \"I'm only seventeen years older than you. That's hardly old enough to be a father.\" \"It's very much old enough to be a father.\" \"Not a very mature father.\" Elizabeth burst out laughing. \"Mr. Grey…\" \"You know, Elizabeth, I think you may be warming up to me.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Hardly.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I'm positive that you are.\" \"It'll never be in the way that you want me to.\" \"What I want is to know you.\" \"I bet.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You know, you have an odd thing you do with your tongue. You're always…flailing it about in your mouth, and sticking it out the side when you're…amused.\" He gave her a sidelong glance. \"Getting weird now.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Please don't use the word 'tongue' in my presence.\" \"Why, does it make you uncomfortable?\" Elizabeth started laughing. \" Yes .\" She said. \"I see.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I think that's indicative of something, don't you? If it makes you so uncomfortable.\" Elizabeth snorted. \"Yeah, disgust.\" \"Hardly.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Mr. Grey, I think you may be delusional. I mean, I know that you probably think every woman wants you, but- \"I do?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Yeah, I think you do.\" \"Why, do you see something about me to indicate that women must want me?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Obviously you must.\" \"It's just a feeling I have.\" Said Elizabeth. \"A feeling you have.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Yeah. Not a feeling for you, though. Just an instinct. That's that's what you think. But even if it was true, this one does not. And wont.\" \"It simply isn't normal, Elizabeth.\" \"Not to want you?\" \"To be so hung up on one person for so long. It just isn't.\" \"That's not the only reason, and you're way out of line saying that, anyway. I simply…don't feel that way about you. You may not be as hideous a person as I thought at first, but that's all there is to it.\" \"You thought I was a hideous person?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Why? Because I wouldn't let you lie, and pretend that I believe it?\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Look, it's not your fault, okay? My father…spends an extraordinary amount of time interfering in my personal life, and I guess I might have resented you for it.\" \"I see.\" Said Mr. Grey. Just then, Stephen approached the car. \"Mr. Grey.\" He said. \"You two have a nice talk?\" \"Why, yes, we did, Stephen. I think we accomplished a lot.\" \"Oh, really?\" said Stephen. \"What did you accomplish?\" \"Well, I think I've managed to get out of her that she's very fearful of allowing herself to feel any kind of feelings for any other man besides, what's his name, uh…\" \"Toby.\" Said Stephen. \"Right, Toby. In fact, I'm amazed that she'll even speak to another man.\" \"I could have told you that.\" Stephen said. \"Yes. And today, she did.\" Mr. Grey said. \"So that's what we've accomplished.\" \"Listen, Stefan, I only talked to you because you actively forced me to by putting your hands inside the windows of my car, and I thought if I rolled them up and cut your fingers off, it might be overkill.\" \"Oh, you are a little psycho, aren't you?\" said Mr. Grey. \"I can clearly see you want very much to call me Stefan, however.\" \"It is your fucking name, isn't it?\" \"All right.\" Stephen said. \"That's enough. I've been working a long day, and I'm very tired. Mr. Grey, I think we'll both be going now.\" He got in the car. \"All right, Stephen.\" Mr. Grey said, looking at her with amusement. Elizabeth shook her head in outrage. \"Mr. Grey has a way of…getting under people's skin, doesn't he?\" said Stephen as they were pulling away from the parking lot. \"Opposing counsel always looks quite dazed they deal with him.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Dad, I don't know what's wrong with you.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You told personal things about me to… that person. Why would you ever do that?\" \"I didn't tell him anything that personal, Elizabeth. Only that I wish you'd think of other people besides Toby. You think it's so unusual for people to talk about their children at work?\" \"Their grown children without their authorization, to a person who has obvious…creepy intentions towards them?\" \"Oh, I doubt it's really all that 'creepy', Elizabeth. As I said, Mr. Grey isn't a bad man. Frquently, he expresses concern for your welfare.\" \"Oh, so he's been asking about me?\" Elizabeth said. \"He wants to know how your life is going. He also thinks you're too smart to work in a bakery.\" \"You know, I probably wouldn't leave my own father out on the street, but don't push it.\" \"Now, see, that seems like an unreasonably hostile attitude towards us both. Have you ever considered that he might be right about your attitude towards other men besides Toby?\" \"Oh, yeah. Of course. He wants me to get over Toby because he's 'expressing concern over my welfare', is that how you put it? It's not like he wouldn't have a stake in it. How could you be so naïve, Dad?\" Stephen shrugged. \"So he's interested in you. So what? He's not married. You're not married.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Dad…\" \"Look, Elizabeth.\" Said Stephen. \"We all know…all of us, around the office, that Mr. Grey likes to intimidate and get inside the heads of people that oppose him. He's a lawyer. And he happens to be exceptionally good at it. So I wouldn't take it personally.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"He's not inside my head.\" She said. Stephen looked at her. \"You sure?\" \"Yeah, Dad, I'm sure.\" She shook her head. \"He's just a middle-aged man hitting on a twenty-five year old using some stupid head games he uses a cheap trick in court. It's pathetic, really.\" \"I don't know.\" Stephen said. \"Sounds like a hostile statement to me.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Quiet, Dad.\"[Chapter 3] \"So remember when you asked if the creepy lawyer was hitting on me, and I told you no?\" Elizabeth asked Toby at the bakery the following Monday. \"Yeah.\" Toby said. \"Well, now the status quo has changed, and in fact, yes, he is hitting on me. There is no room for doubt about that.\" \"Well, do you like him?\" \"Toby!\" \"Why not?\" Toby said. \"Just a question. I'd hope there's not…someone else getting in the way of your having an attraction to anyone else.\" \"Yeah, you.\" Elizabeth said. \"What about it?\" \"Elizabeth, we've talked about this.\" Said Toby. \"I can't give you what you want. I'd be very happy if you were interested in someone else besides me. We talked about it, and you said you would try to be. There is nothing special about me.\" \"There is to me.\" \"Elizabeth- \"And it doesn't matter if you were the least exceptional person in the universe. Sometimes, when you have an attraction to someone, it's just..chemical. Who a person is attracted to doesn't come down to the details about them.\" Toby shook his head. \"No.\" he said. \"Why not?\" \"Because, Elizabeth. I don't feel that way about you.\" \"But you would. If your parents marriage hadn't ended, and if you weren't so worried about death, and…if there was someone you felt that way about, it would be me, right?\" \"Elizabeth….\" Toby shook his head. \"I can't answer that.\" \"Why not? It's true. If there were such a thing as someone you were crazy in love with, and felt that way about, and wanted to be with for the rest of your life, it would be me, right. But you don't, so…\" \"Well, maybe it wouldn't, Elizabeth.\" Said Toby. \"Have you ever thought of that?\" \"Why?\" Elizabeth said. \"Why not, Toby?\" \"Because I'm just not in love with you.\" Toby said. \"Not…not that way. I mean, in college, I was attracted to you. You're a great girl, and you were so…devoted to me. For some reason. No one had ever been devoted to me in that way before. And we had a great thing.\" \"Had?\" Elizabeth said. \"Yeah. But it passed. We outgrew each other…or I thought we did. I thought we could be great friends afterwards. I thought all the…poison had gone out of our relationship.\" \"The poison?\" Elizabeth said. \"Yeah,\" Toby said. \"You know. All the bitterness, and the hostility, and the…fear, and neuroses that come when two people are intimate with each other. I thought we'd gotten to a place where we could be real with each other.\" \"That's what you think a relationship is?\" Elizabeth said. \"Full of poison?\" \"When you're really attracted to each other it is.\" Toby said. \"My parents were crazy in love, at one point. And then they spent their whole life fighting, after the passion wore off. Actually, they spent most of their passionate days miserable, too. So. That's what a relationship is all about. Poison, and then…malaise, after you lose your attraction to each other. And then death.\" Elizabeth sniffled, and shook her head. \"You are really screwed up, Toby.\" She said, sniffling. \"Yeah, well. Maybe. Maybe not, too. Maybe that's really the way it is.\" \"Yeah, well, anyway. I knew all of that already.\" Said Elizabeth. \"How you feel about relationships.\" \"Well, what I'm trying say is…\" He sighed. \"Elizabeth, the fact is, that…maybe I'll find someone to be…in the poisonous stage with…but that person is not you.\" \"Why not?\" said Elizabeth. \"Because…it's like you said a minute ago. It's just a chemical thing. Sometimes, you're just not in love with a person, and I…I…\" He looked away. \"I never was in love with you.\" Elizabeth sniffled. \"Well, I was. With you.\" She said. \"Like no one else.\" \"Yeah. I know, Liz, but…\" He sighed. \"Maybe you can work on…not being. Maybe you can work on…there actually being someone else.\" \"I don't know, Toby.\" \"Come on,\" Toby said. \"We've talked about this. And you said that you would try.\" Elizabeth sniffled. \"I guess, I could try. For you.\" \"For you.\" Toby said firmly. \"Right. That, too.\" Elizabeth said, sniffling. \"Do you like this guy?\" Toby said. Elizabeth looked at him like he was crazy. \"What? The lawyer? Mr. Grey?\" \"Yeah.\" Toby said. \"Stefan?\" Elizabeth said. \"Yeah, yeah. The lawyer. Mr. Grey. Stefan.\" Toby said, rolling his eyes. \"Clearly, I see that you must.\" \"I don't see how you see that at all.\" Elizabeth said. \"And no, of course, I don't. That's disgusting.\" \"Well, what's so disgusting about him?\" Elizabeth shrugged. \"I can't stand him.\" \"Well, is he good looking?\" \"Not to me.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But he might be to someone? In your opinion?\" \"I didn't say that.\" \"You implied, it though.\" \"Toby, I did not!\" said Elizabeth indignantly. \"And besides, he's a loathsome creep.\" \"Why? What did he do?\" \"He just is. Half the time, he sounds like a comatose, walking dead, socially awkward, droning zombie.\" Elizabeth said. \"And then the other half of the time, he's a smug, insinuating, self-righteous, sarcastic comatose, droning zombie.\" Elizabeth said. \"Wow. That was certainly a lot of adjectives.\" Toby said. \"Wasn't it?\" \"For someone you say that you have no interest in at all.\" \"Shut up, Toby.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Now you sound like my father.\" \"Well, maybe he's right.\" \"Right about what? That I should be interested in someone who claims he's concerned about my welfare when it's obvious he's just interested in one thing.\" \"How do you know it's not more?\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"I don't care if it is. I don't want him near me.\" \"Why? What are you afraid he's going to do?\" \"I think he wants to get inside my head.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Well, maybe he already is.\" said Toby. \"Besides, isn't that what attraction is all about? Getting inside someone's head?\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"You should think about it.\" Toby said. Several days passed, and Elizabeth picked her father, and dropped him off at work without incident. However, one day, Amy, who worked as a baker at the shop, approached her as she walked behind the counter. \"Hey, Liz, some guy came in here looking for you Saturday. I told him you weren't here most weekends.\" \"Some guy?\" Elizabeth said. \"Damn it.\" \"You know him?\" \"I have a feeling I might. What did he look like? Amy shrugged. \"Hard to say.\" \"Blonde hair?\" Elizabeth said. \"Yeah, I believe so.\" \"Kind of dark blond?\" said Elizabeth. \"Fortyish?\" \"Yeah. Maybe around forty.\" \"Droning voice?\" said Elizabeth. \"Kind of awkward? Sneezes?\" \"Sneezes, yeah. Definitely.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Friend of yours?\" \"Not really.\" Said Elizabeth. Later that afternoon, Elizabeth was at the cash register, and was filled with dismay, though not surprise to see Mr. Grey standing in front of the counter. \"You want me to get a restraining order?\" said Elizabeth. \"Uh…that would be a bit extreme, wouldn't it?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Not really.\" said Elizabeth. She was about to say something more, when Mr. Grey sneezed loudly, startling her. She rolled her eyes, but then smiled. \"Je Reviens.\" She said. \"What?\" said Mr. Grey. \"My perfume.\" Elizabeth said in a louder voice, leaning close to him to emphasize. \"Like it?\" Mr. Grey sneezed again. \"Not really, no.\" He said. \"Too bad.\" Elizabeth said, smiling. \"But I'll adapt.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"No, no you won't.\" said Elizabeth. \"Not if I have anything to say about it.\" \"We'll see.\" \"No, we won't see.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Now please get out of here. We'd rather not have people sneezing on the baked goods. The board of health might come down on us.\" \"Really.\" \"Really.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Out. Didn't you see the sign that said 'No sneezers'?\" \"That's discrimination.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I could sue. And I'd win, too.\" \"How nice for you.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You're always flirting with me, aren't you, Elizabeth?\" said Mr. Grey. \"You're truly insane, Mr. Grey.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I'm always trying to get away from you.\" \"Because you're attracted to me. Admit it.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"No, I'm not.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You are. And there's nothing wrong with it.\" \"This is some stalker shit right here, Stefan.\" Elizabeth said. \"Hardly.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"But if you want to call me Stefan, you have to have dinner with me. Tonight. What do you say?\" \"Mr. Grey. You're making a fool of yourself. It's beneath your dignity. And if you're anything, I'd say that you're a dignified man.\" \"Really?\" Mr. Grey said, narrowing his eyes at her. \"And what about what's beneath your dignity, Elizabeth? Hmmm? What about that?\" \"I don't know what the hell you're talking about.\" \"I think you do.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I don't, now leave if you're not going to buy anything.\" \"Elizabeth.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Stop being so hostile, and have dinner with me.\" \"Mr. Grey.\" Elizabeth said. \"No.\" \"Elizabeth- \"Now buy or go.\" Elizabeth said, pointing at the door, her face devoid of humor. Mr. Grey looked at her, shaking his head. \"Aberrant behavior.\" He said. \"Aberrant.\" \" Go .\" Elizabeth said angrily. Mr. Grey walked out, not looking in the least happy. Elizabeth took a deep breath, shaking her head angrily. \"Hey, Liz.\" Toby said to her later that evening, after the bakery was closed. \"Yeah.\" Said Elizabeth, sounding distracted. \"Uh, about…you know.\" \"No, I don't know. What?\" \"Your, uh…Mr. Grey.\" Elizabeth looked at him irritably. \" What about Mr. Grey, Toby?\" \"It's just that…that whole thing today…I was sort of…standing right near you, and- \"And what, Toby?\" \"I sort of…heard the whole thing.\" He looked at her. \"And?\" \"Well, I just think that…he might be right.\" \"About what, Toby?\" said Elizabeth angrily. \"I mean…is there really any reason you have to be so hostile to him? He doesn't tolerate liars. So what?\" \"You saw him. Does he seem like someone who's tolerable to be around?\" \"Uh…\" Toby said. \"He doesn't seem that bad to me. I mean, maybe he's a little…blunt, but…\" \"A little blunt?\" said Elizabeth making a noise of incredulity. \"He's an asshole.\" \"Well…maybe, but he's one who obviously likes you a whole lot, Elizabeth.\" Said Toby. \"There's no reason to be rude to him.\" \"I told him no. He won't take it for an answer.\" Elizabeth said. \"That's a good reason to be rude to him, Toby.\" \"Well, maybe you should tell him yes.\" Toby said. \"Did you think of that?\" Elizabeth laughed incredulously. \"Toby, I can't believe you.\" She narrowed her eyes at him. \"Who's side are you on, anyway?\" \"Yours.\" Said Toby. \"That's why I think you should maybe give him a chance. No one said you had to be betrothed to him or anything. Maybe he'd be good for you. You agreed, you'd give others a chance.\" \"Not him.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I highly doubt there's anything all that wrong with him that you can't go to dinner with him once.\" \"Toby-\" Elizabeth said. She shook her head. \"What the hell's wrong with you, anyway?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Why don't you want me anymore?\" \"Oh, Elizabeth.\" Toby said. \"No.\" \"You know, I remember one time we did it in that little alcove in the back of the bakery. You remember that?\" Toby shook his head. \"You don't?\" \"I do, but I- She put her hand on his. \"What if I said I wanted to go back there, and do right now, Toby? Would you? Would you still want me?\" \"I would.\" Toby said. \"I would want to, but in the end, that would be all it would be. And I won't, because…I'm not going to…to take advantage of you, Elizabeth. So no.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Toby- \"And you know what else, Elizabeth?\" Toby said. \"You don't want me anymore, either.\" \"Yes, I do.\" Elizabeth said. \"I do, Toby.\" \"No. No, you don't. You just won't admit it.\" Said Toby. \"You don't want to do it in the alcove, and you don't want anything else with me anymore. But you're afraid to admit it.\" Elizabeth looked at him disconsolately. \"Really.\" Toby said. \"You need to let go. Not live to like me anymore.\" \"And then…and then the poison will go out?\" Elizabeth said, looking at him, her tongue on one side of her mouth. \"Of our friendship?\" \"Exactly.\" Toby said. \"And then what should I do, Toby? \"Well…\" Toby said. \"That's up to you. But maybe you should at least consider…what's his name.\" \"You don't like him, either.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I don't know him.\" Said Toby. \"But I see that he certainly has the ability to make your hackles go up.\" \"So I should just…embrace my…supposed feelings for…that…thing you saw?\" said Elizabeth. \"Now he didn't seem all that bad to me, Liz.\" Said Toby. \"You can't blame him for getting a little bent out of shape after you rejected him in a public place.\" \"Who sounds like he has throat cancer?\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, I…didn't particularly notice that, but again…the fact that you did certainly indicates you must be paying pretty close attention to him, Liz.\" Elizabeth shook her head, chuckling. \"Don't you agree?\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Maybe.\" She said. \"Ah, progress.\" Said Toby. \"See, that's the first step.\" \"I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing, it though.\" Said Elizabeth. \"That's the thing.\" \"I can see that.\" Said Toby. \"But you might want to swallow your pride. We all have to do that one time or another.\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" Said Elizabeth.[Chapter 4] \"So.\" Elizabeth said to her father in the car the next morning. \"How's that…person you work with?\" \"Mr. Grey?\" Stephen said. \"Well, actually…\" He cleared his throat. \"What?\" Elizabeth said, turning to look at him. \"After we were closing up the building yesterday, he turned to me and said 'You know Stephen, I like you, but your daughter's a real pill.'\" Stephen cleared his throat. \"And- Elizabeth shook her head angrily. \"And what did you say?\" \"Well, I said I agreed. You can be.\" \"Dad…\" She glared at him. \"And what did he say?\" \"He laughed. And that was it.\" \"What else did he say?\" \"That's all.\" Stephen said. \"Why, what did you do?\" \"Nothing. He's insane.\" Said Elizabeth. She sighed. \"I may have…been a little harsh in the bakery yesterday.\" \"He was at the bakery?\" \"Uh… yeah .\" Elizabeth said, glaring at him. \"I can't imagine who would have told him the address.\" \"That was awhile ago. I simply mentioned it in passing to him.\" \"Uh huh. Just innocently recommending it, huh?\" said Elizabeth. \"Just thought he'd be curious to see it.\" \"Of course. Well, he was. In fact, he's been there twice, it seems.\" She shook her head. \"He's a determined guy.\" \"No kidding.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Dad, doesn't this bother you at all?\" Stephen sighed. \"It would only bother me if I really thought it truly bothered you.\" He looked at her. \"And from what I've witnessed, it seems…you two have a bit of a- \"Love-hate relationship?\" \"I was going to say rapport.\" Said Stephen. \"But that, too.\" \"Yeah, but Dad.\" She said. \"What concerns me is that if he and I have a relationship, and it doesn't work out, then that will damage your professional relationship with him.\" \"I wouldn't worry about that.\" Said Stephen. \"I'm a very good attorney. He knows that.\" \"You sure?\" said Elizabeth. \"You are a good attorney, but my faith in him as a person is not exemplary. We don't know him. He could be batshit crazy, for all you know.\" \"Oh, he's not that, Liz.\" Said Stephen. \"I'm sure of that. He's a professional.\" \"Hmmm.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Besides, Elizabeth. As I've said, Mr. Grey isn't really a bad sort. Not at all, in fact. He's a fair type of person.\" \"Huh.\" Said Elizabeth. \" I'm not so sure of it.\" Several days went by, and Elizabeth didn't see Mr. Grey when she drove her father to and from work. Finally, at the end of the week, she got of the car and walked into the building. She approached the secretary at the desk, Tricia. \"Is he in?\" she asked her. Tricia covered up the receiver of the phone she had been talking on. \"Your father?\" \"No, Mr. Grey.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Is he in?\" \"Oh.\" Said Tricia. \"Yes. He is.\" \"Is his office that way?\" She pointed. \"Uh…yes, but- \"Thanks.\" Elizabeth said. \"You know, I think you should wait until-\" But Elizabeth had already started down the corridor. She opened the door of his office, and found him there at his desk. \"Mr. Grey.\" She said. Mr. Grey looked up at her, startled. \"Elizabeth.\" He said, sounding non-plussed. \"What on earth are you doing?\" \"I came to talk to you.\" She said. \"Well, you can't.\" said Mr. Grey. \"Why not?\" said Elizabeth. \"Because I have to work.\" She looked at the clock. \"It's six pm.\" \"So?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Surely you don't think I just automatically stop working at six on the dot, do you? We work long hours in this profession.\" He shoved some papers irritably into a drawer. \"Well, that didn't seem to bother you when you were out there talking to me a couple of weeks ago, did it? What time was it then?\" \"I don't have time for this, Elizabeth.\" Mr. Grey said. \"I really don't.\" \"I think you do.\" Elizabeth said. \"I think you just don't want to.\" \"Well, you're wrong.\" Mr. Grey said. \"Look, I'm not going to come here and beg you, or anything.\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, who asked you to?\" said Mr. Grey. \"I think that's what you want.\" \"Well, it's not. Not what I want at all.\" \"What do you want?\" said Elizabeth. \"What do I want?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Nothing, Elizabeth. Nothing at all. From you.\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Well, what if I said I…wanted something from you?\" \"What would that be?\" \"I…\" she bit her lip. \"I want to apologize.\" \"Uh huh.\" \"I do.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I…I'm sorry, okay.\" Mr. Grey sighed, not looking up at her. \"For what, Elizabeth?\" \"For…being such a rude little creep.\" She rolled her eyes. \"Okay?\" Mr. Grey shrugged, and raised an eyebrow. \"Mr. Grey,\" She walked over to his desk. \" Stefan ?\" \"Don't call me that.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Look, I don't know about everybody else, but I'm not going to call you Mr. Grey. It's demeaning. Not to mention stupid, and insane.\" Mr. Grey gave a short bark of laughter. \"You've got some nerve.\" \"Don't I?\" said Elizabeth. \"I have to keep my foot on your back at all times. I have this feeling.\" \"Maybe you need to quit having these feelings you have.\" \"Do you really want me to call you Mr. Grey?\" said Elizabeth, rolling her eyes. \"Because I will, if that's really what makes you comfortable.\" \"No, I want you to call me nothing whatsoever.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"What I'd like is for you to leave my office, and not come back. Perhaps I'll catch a glimpse of you as you're picking your father up from the office. And I'll look away. And go back in the building.\" \"Why?\" said Elizabeth. \"Because.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I don't care to converse with someone who's unbalanced. And spiteful. And headstrong. And full of ill will. And- \"Are you going to be done any time soon?\" said Elizabeth. \"No. Also dishonest. And ungrateful.\" \"I don't know about all of that,\" said Elizabeth. \"But I do have a lot of anger. And…\" She sat down in the chair. \"I may have…unreasonably taken it out on you.\" Mr. Grey laughed incredulously. \"Well, that certainly is a recommendation. You barely even know me, yet you saw fit to victimize me.\" \"I'd hardly say that .\" Said Elizabeth. \"I mean, you are annoying. The way you saw fit to correct me after knowing me for sixty seconds, and- \"That's enough. You can leave now.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"No.\" said Elizabeth. Mr. Grey looked at her. \"Elizabeth- \"Listen, Mr. Grey.\" Elizabeth said. \"About Toby.\" \"I don't want to hear about Toby.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"This is important. For years, I loved a man who didn't even come close to feeling the same way about me as I did about him.\" She sighed. \"I don't know why I did. I mean, Toby's a great guy, but- \"I don't want to hear- \"Well, he has many things to recommend him. But even after we broke up, I was…obsessed. In a certain way. My feelings for him…I just refused to let go of them because I entertained the notion, somewhere in the back of my mind, that he would change.\" Mr. Grey sighed, and shook his head. \"But Toby's not…capable of loving anyone back that way. He's…he's too screwed up about relationships, and about his parents, and I knew that, but I was just…stubborn. I deluded myself. For years, I deluded myself. Even…even when I said I wasn't deluding myself, that I'd accepted the way he is, and could just…be there in his life, without romantic involvement- \"When he clearly didn't want you in his life.\" \"Right. He doesn't want me to devote my whole life to him. But I deluded myself…that that would be a good thing to do.\" \"Why, is the question?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Because…I don't know…because I thought…loving someone unconditionally would…make me…more…whole. And..\" \"Loving someone unconditionally.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Who didn't even remotely love you back. Who for years let you go on thinking that it was okay to…to just…be like a nun, and- \"He never thought it was okay.\" Elizabeth said. \"He never once said that. He was very vocal about wanting me to find someone else.\" \"Oh, I don't know.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I really don't think that he's quite so innocent as you think. But I'll have it your way. Let's examine how you were culpable in all this.\" \"Culpable?\" said Elizabeth. \"Yes. Culpable.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"For years, you knowingly vowed to…forsake all involvement with anyone else, practically, because…why?\" \"Because I thought it was right.\" \"Thought it was right. May I ask, what the hell kind of life you thought you were going to have, continuing on that way?\" Elizabeth looked down at the floor. \"I don't know.\" She said. \"What goes through your mind, Elizabeth?\" said Mr. Grey. \"What goes on in that head of yours?\" Elizabeth looked at him indignantly. \"Mr. Grey.-\" She took a deep breath. \"Why do you care?\" Mr. Grey looked down at the desk. \"Because…\" he said. \"Because why?\" \"Elizabeth- \"Why?\" \"I-\" He looked at her. \"Because…I…care about you.\" Elizabeth bit her lip. \"I care about you, too.\" \"Ha.\" Mr. Grey said. \"No, you don't.\" \"I do.\" \"Another lie. You don't care about me. You just…\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"Just what?\" \"You don't. Don't try to tell me you do. People don't change overnight.\" \"I want to.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I want to change. And I do care about you.\" \"What about…you know…\" His mouth turned down sourly. \"Toby?\" \"Toby and I haven't been together for a long time, Mr. Grey.\" \"I know that, Elizabeth, but..\" He made a small gesture. \"What about how you feel about him? Do you still…yearn after him?\" \"Yearn after?\" said Elizabeth. \"No.\" \"Are you still in love with him?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Are you thinking about him right now?\" \"No, Mr. Grey.\" Elizabeth said, rolling her eyes. Mr. Grey stood up, and put his hands on her shoulders. \"Elizabeth,\" he said. \"I want you to listen to me.\" \"Okay.\" Elizabeth said. \"Are you listening to me?\" said Mr. Grey. \"I need to know that you are.\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"I'm sure you do need to. But I am.\" \"All right. Good.\" Mr. Grey said. \"Elizabeth, you are not going to think about Toby…ever again.\" \"Not even when he's giving me orders to fill at work?\" \"This is serious business.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"You know perfectly well what I mean. In a romantic way. In a sexual way. As anything but your supervisor.\" \"And friend?\" \"Not too friendly a friend.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Yeah.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Mr. Grey, all this nonsense really isn't- \"It's not nonsense.\" Mr. Grey said sharply. Elizabeth rolled her eyes, shaking her head. \"It's not nonsense.\" Mr. Grey repeated in a gentler tone. \"It's an important promise you must keep, if you want to…if you want to be…\" \"Okay.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Okay.\" \"Are we going to be serious?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Because Elizabeth, I feel like I'm not reaching you right now…and what I want most is to reach you.\" Elizabeth was quiet. \"Yeah.\" She said. \"Okay, Mr. Grey.\" \"Good.\" Said Mr. Grey. He took a deep breath. \"Now. I want you to promise me that all that nonsense…all that misplaced devotion to Toby…that's over now. That's no longer a part of who you are.\" \"I…I promise.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You're over that now.\" Mr. Grey said firmly. \"I'm over it.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I'm over it, now.\" \"Good.\" Mr. Grey said. \"You're going to start behaving like a grown up now.\" \"Okay, now you're pushing it.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You can't talk to me that- \"Elizabeth.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"You're going to start behaving like a grown-up now. Say it.\" \"I didn't know I wasn't, Mr. Grey. I think I'm very- \"In most respects, but not about this. Not about Toby. Now say it.\" \"I'm going to start behaving like a…grown up now.\" Said Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Elizabeth.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"You're not exactly behaving like a grown up at this very moment. In fact, I'd say you're behaving like a sullen teenager.\" \"Uh, Mr. Grey.\" Elizabeth pursed her lips. \"I'm afraid you've got another think coming if you think I'm going to be letting you order me around.\" Mr. Grey sighed and shook his head. \"Well, I'm not.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But…I…\" She sighed. \"I understand where you're coming from. I wasn't behaving like a grown-up, about Toby, and he and my feelings for him are no longer a part of who I am. That is over now.\" She said firmly. \"Okay?\" \"Yes. Good.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Very good.\" \"I have the strangest feeling,\" Elizabeth said. \"That you resent the idea that I'm not someone you can order around. Is that right?\" \"Is that what you think about me, Elizabeth.?\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Well..yeah. Kind of.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But I like you anyway.\" \"Well, it's not true.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I simply want to…make a connection with you, Elizabeth. Not order you around.\" \"I understand.\" Said Elizabeth. \"What a pipe dream to think that you'd ever be all that pliant, anyway.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"I can be…pliant.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I just don't want to be your doormat.\" \"I don't want a doormat.\" Said Mr. Grey firmly. \"But…you've got to compromise sometimes, Elizabeth. You've got to give.\" \"I know.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I think you'd find that I will..when it counts.\" \"Good.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"But…\" she said. \"Mr. Grey, it…isn't a pipe dream to think that…I'd…like you.\" Mr. Grey looked at her. \"Well, that's good, Elizabeth.\" He said. He looked a little sad. \"Yeah.\" Elizabeth bit her lip. She put her hands on his, which were still on her shoulders. Mr. Grey looked at her, and kissed her on the forehead suddenly. She closed her eyes, then stood up. \"Elizabeth?\" said Mr. Grey. \"I think you missed it by a little.\" Elizabeth said, and kissed him gently on the lips, then more forcefully. She looked at him. He looked back at her. There was a long silence. \"I think,\" he said after a minute. \"That you can call me Stefan now.\" \"Oh.\" Elizabeth said. \"Are you sure I'm worthy of the honor?\" \"I'm sure, Elizabeth.\" Said Mr. Grey. \"Good. I'm glad, Stefan.\" Said Elizabeth, shaking her head. \"Will you stop lolling your tongue like that?\" said Mr. Grey. \"It's driving me crazy.\" \"I bet it is, Stefan.\" Said Elizabeth.[Chapter 5] \"So Stefan,\" Elizabeth said later that evening when they were eating dinner together. \"Can I ask you a personal question?\" \"If I can ask you one, Elizabeth.\" \"What do you want to ask?\" Elizabeth said. \"I don't want to ask anything.\" Mr. Grey said. \"I just want you to tell me something personal about yourself. Anything at all.\" \"Okay. Um…can I ask first?\" Elizabeth said. \"Of course.\" \"How come…you don't like to be called Stefan?\" \"Well,\" Mr. Grey said. \"It happens…that…I don't like the person I was when I…when I was younger.\" \"Why not?\" said Elizabeth. \"Oh, I was…I was a liar. And…spiteful.\" He looked at her. \"And I did a lot of partying, and had a lot of…indiscriminate sex, and…never stayed faithful to the same woman.\" \"Oh.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But I was…determined to change. And I did. Over time. And I found that life was..much more fulfilling after I did. I was a desperately unhappy person, you see.\" \"Wow.\" Said Elizabeth. \"When was all this? All this indiscriminate sex, and partying?\" \"Oh, college. High school. I was…in trouble most of my childhood, and in high school, and college, as well.\" \"Why do you think that was?\" Elizabeth said. \"Oh, I don't know.\" Said Stefan. \"I was screwed up. My…father never approved of me.\" \"Why not?\" \"Well, he wasn't my real father, for one thing. He was my stepfather. I never knew my real father..he left shortly after I was born.\" \"Is that a reason, though?\" said Elizabeth. \"Is what a reason?\" \"For him not to approve of you? Him not being your real father? Is that a good reason?\" \"Well, no.\" said Stefan. \"It isn't.\" \"Why didn't he?\" \"Well, I don't know why he didn't approve of me, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan, looking down at the table. \"He just didn't. You'd have to ask him, wouldn't you?\" \"Okay, Stefan.\" Elizabeth said, putting her hand on his. \"Okay.\" She bit her lip. \"I guess…him disapproving of me, for no reason, after awhile, made me want to give him reasons to do so. And I did. Many reasons.\" \"What did he do? For a living?\" Stefan looked at her. \"Guess.\" He said. \"He was a lawyer.\" Elizabeth said. \"Indeed.\" Stefan said. He looked at her. \"Now you must tell me.\" He said. \"Something personal.\" \"What do you want to know?\" \"No, no, no.\" Stefan said. \"Remember, I said that you should decide.\" \"Okay. Um…\" She traced a pattern on the table with her hand. \"Um…\" Stefan placed his hand on hers. \"Elizabeth. Are you shy?\" Elizabeth laughed. \"Do I seem shy?\" \"Well, you're…always saying sarcastic things, but..\" He looked at her. \"I think you secretly are.\" He moved his chair closer. \"I think you're secretly a shy, sensitive, young woman who yearns for appreciation.\" He looked at her. \"Don't you?\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Maybe.\" She said. \"Could be.\" \"I'm shy, you know.\" Stefan said. \"You?\" Elizabeth said. \"I am. Very. You haven't noticed I'm a bit…uh…\" He gestured with his hand. \"Stiff?\" Elizabeth suggested. \"Awkward?\" \"Well, it seems like you readily agree then.\" \"No, I- \"But yes.\" Stefan said. \"Yeah.\" Elizabeth said. \"I noticed.\" \"I overcome my shyness,\" said Stefan. \"In order to get things done. But I was always…very shy. Of course, I covered it up when I was younger with a lot of…of…arrogance, and…haughtiness.\" \"Much like now.\" Elizabeth said, but felt a sharp pang of remorse when she saw a flash of hurt in his eyes. \"Stefan…\" She squeezed his hand. \"No.\" Stefan said softly. \"Not like now. Not at all.\" \"You're just a bit…I just meant you're a bit…bossy. With me, certainly.\" \"Huh.\" Said Stefan. \"Well, you may not realize I was just trying to help you, Elizabeth.\" \"Sometimes.\" She said. \"Always.\" Said Stefan. \"Nooo, I don't think always. I think sometimes you're just…an officious guy.\" \"Well there's no one that's perfect, is there?\" Stefan said. \"But what I mean is that I always want to help you, Elizabeth. I think that you're…you've had a very unhappy life.\" Elizabeth shrugged. \"It could have been a lot worse. But yeah.\" \"What's your something personal, Elizabeth?\" said Stefan. \"I…in high school, people called me 'Eliza Do Little'. Because I…wouldn't. With anyone. I mean, not even dating. Or…kissing. Or holding hands. Much less the other.\" \"And why was that, Elizabeth?\" Stefan said. \"Though I could probably guess.\" \"Because of Toby, yeah. I sort of wanted to…save myself for him.\" She shrugged. \"I don't…I don't have any big, deep dark secrets. I'm sorry.\" \"What was it that made you do this, Elizabeth? That made you want him so much? That you would not even consider going on a date with anyone else?\" Elizabeth shrugged. \"I don't…I don't even know anymore.\" She said. \"I mean, I know he was a really good looking guy, and smart, and funny, but…I.. can't even really…\" She shook her head. \"Elizabeth…Stefan started to say, but trailed off. \"Did he appreciate you? At all? Elizabeth looked down at the table sadly. \"I don't…I don't know. Toby…has his problems. But he's a nice guy.\" \"I don't care if he's a nice guy. I'm not a nice guy, but- \"Yes, you are, Stefan.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You may not be a particularly…tactful person, but you're a great guy. Really.\" \"Well, the point is, that 'nice' guys are rarely truly nice. I had a friend who was like that. He was tactful. Always appearing to want to please other people. But he was…truly a…hateful coward.\" He looked at her. \"And I think that Toby is a sociopath.\" \"No, he isn't.\" said Elizabeth. \"That's ridiculous.\" \"I don't think it is.\" Stefan said. \"He was perfectly happy to use you, and then throw you away when he was done with you, wasn't he?\" \"No!\" Elizabeth said. \"That's not it at all. We were together for three years, and then we broke up, and became friends. It's not unheard of to be friends with your ex, Stefan.\" \"Oh?\" Stefan said. \"Tell me, Elizabeth. Did Toby remain celibate as well after you broke up?\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Of course not. No.\" she said. \"But I never asked him to.\" \"So he's had girlfriends.\" Elizabeth looked down at the table. \"Uh…yeah.\" She said. \"A lot, actually.\" \"And how did that make you feel, when he would wave these girlfriends in front of your face?\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Not great. But- \"Sleeps with a lot of women, does he?\" \"I didn't say that.\" \"You don't have to.\" Said Stefan. \"What about when you were together? Was he faithful?\" \"Stefan- \"Was he?\" \"Most of the time. He…he's always sort of...had an eye for other women.\" \"What is wrong with you, Elizabeth?\" Stefan said angrily. \"All right, that's quite enough, Stefan.\" Elizabeth said. \"What business is it of yours, anyway?\" \"It just is. You should know better.\" He shook his head. \"You should have known better. You're a smart girl.\" \"Well, things were…complicated.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But you're right. I shouldn't have waited so long…for him to change. But he never said he wanted me to.\" \"It doesn't matter. He let you work for him, and be around him, knowing how you felt about him. I tell you, Elizabeth, I would not be too jazzed to be around anyone who would treat me that way.\" \"I wouldn't get so worked up about it, Stefan.\" \"I don't care what you would do.\" Said Stefan. \"And I'm not getting worked up. I'm simply pointing out the truth.\" \"You know what, never mind about Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"I want to hear about your friend. Who you said was a hateful coward, and tried to please everyone.\" \"Well, it certainly is a relief that you don't want to talk about Toby.\" \" What was his name?\" Elizabeth said. \"Your friend?\" \"Blane.\" Said Stefan. \"Blane.\" Elizabeth repeated. \"Was he a lawyer?\" \"He could be for all I know.\" Stefan said. \"I lost touch with him. But I knew him before I became a lawyer. We grew up together.\" \"Oh.\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, what did he do? That was so hateful, and cowardly?\" Stefan shrugged. \"Listened to me.\" He said. \"About what?\" \"A lot of things.\" \"Like…?\" \"Well, for one thing, there was this girl he dated. Wanted to date.\" Said Stefan. \"I…didn't approve of her.\" \"I see that even back then you were telling everybody what to do.\" Said Elizabeth. \"No, this was…different.\" Said Stefan. \"But he liked her. And I told him he shouldn't date her, or we'd no longer be friends.\" \"Why did you think that he shouldn't date her?\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, she was…we grew up in affluent familes, Blane and I.\" \"Yeah, you talk like it.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I suppose so.\" \"I suppose, too.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Did he drone? Blane?\" \"What?\" Stefan said. \"I just thought..that's what people from affluent families must do.\" Said Elizabeth innocently. \"Did you now?\" said Stefan. \"Yep.\" Elizabeth smiled, putting her tongue towards one side of her mouth, looking at him. He looked back at her. \"Elizabeth- \"So this Blane.\" Elizabeth said. \"This affluent friend of yours. You told him he shouldn't date her because…\" \"Because she was not from an affluent family.\" \"Bit of a snob, there, aren't we, Stefan?\" said Elizabeth. \"I was. I told him I thought she was trash.\" Said Stefan. \"And he listened to me. He broke up with her shortly after. So that's why he was a coward.\" \"I see. You're mad at him for listening to you.\" Elizabeth said. \"I am.\" \"So by that logic I shouldn't listen to you?\" \"No, you should.\" Said Stefan. \"As I said, I was a different person back then.\" \"And that's why you don't speak to him? Blane? You insulted his girlfriend by calling her trash, trying to tell him who to date, and when he caved in and went along with you, you call him a coward? And hateful?\" \"What do you know about it?\" Stefan said. \"That was years ago. You had nothing to do with it.\" \"Since I was an infant then, I guess I didn't.\" Elizabeth said. \"See how much you can get away with, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"Okay, okay.\" Elizabeth said. \"Maybe I shouldn't be so quick to point that out. Even though it's true.\" \"Not to mention your other cracks.\" Said Stefan. \"You think I'm unaware?\" \"Of what?\" Elizabeth said. \"About 'people from affluent families'.\" Elizabeth shrugged. \"So why did you care so much about people only dating people from affluent families?\" \"Because my values were not what they should have been back then, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"But that has nothing to do with now.\" \"But you really cared so much…whether your friend dated a girl who wasn't rich like you two?\" Elizabeth said. \"Seems like a smart guy like you would have better things to do than that. Why did you care?\" \"I told you. I was very…hung up on class back then, Elizabeth.\" \"Why are you angry at Blane for listening to you, so much that you won't speak to him anymore? There must be more to it than that.\" \"I didn't say I don't speak to him. I said we've lost touch. He moved away, the last I'd heard. But that's not the part I'm angry about, anyway.\" \"Well, what is?\" \"Well,\" Stefan said. \"They got back together, and- \"Wait. They got back together?\" said Elizabeth. \"Yes. But- \"And that makes you angry? Still?\" \"I didn't say- \"Wait.\" Said Elizabeth. \"This girl you told him was trash. You liked her, didn't you?\" \"I didn't…I…\" He sighed. \"Maybe.\" \"You did.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Okay, I did.\" Said Stefan. \"What about it?\" \"What was her name?\" \"Andrea Walsh. Andie.\" Said Stefan. \"Andie, huh?\" said Elizabeth. \"Was she good-looking?\" \"I suppose.\" \"Was she better looking than me?\" \"No.\" said Stefan. \"She really wasn't, Elizabeth. Not as.\" Elizabeth smiled softly. \"So,\" she said \"I'm guessing you went to great lengths to convince Blane that his girlfriend was trash, so he'd dump her, and she'd date you instead, huh?\" \"No, actually.\" Said Stefan. \"I liked Andie, but…well, she did not return my affection. Maybe she was right not to. I was not…the type to sustain a good relationship with a woman at that time.\" \"Did you tell her how you felt?\" \"Well, I wasn't terribly good at telling people 'how I felt' back then, Elizabeth, but I frequently asked her on dates. And…she refused.\" \"And how did you feel about that?\" \"Angry. Spited. A little hurt.\" \"Because you had feelings for her that ran deeper than the norm for you, huh?\" Elizabeth said. \"Yes.\" Said Stefan. \"I did. And then she turns around and dates Blane. That was a hard pill to swallow, especially when he went parading her around everywhere in front of my face. So I reacted in a very spiteful manner towards her. I pretended I didn't even know who she was a lot of the time...and I did everything in my power to convince Blane we all looked down on him for dating her.\" \"Because you wanted to get back at her because she wanted Blane and not you.\" \"Well, of course I was jealous because of that.\" Said Stefan. \"But this girl…Andie…she was not entirely innocent herself in all this. Not in my opinion.\" \"Why?\" Elizabeth said. \"What did she do?\" \"Well, before Blane started dating her, I had done absolutely nothing to her. And she continually was rude to me from the get-go. I would ask her out, and she would act like…well, like a bitch, I'd say.\" \"What did she say to you? When you'd ask her out?\" \"Well, one time I asked her what she thought made her any different from all the other girls I'd been out with, and- \" 'All' the other girls?\" said Elizabeth. \"I told you, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"I was not what you'd call a chaste person back then. And I did have a reputation for…being somewhat of a…playboy.\" \"I see.\" Elizabeth said. \"And this reputation you had was true, then?\" \"Well…yes, Elizabeth, but that's really beside the point. I had not cheated on or two-timed her, we'd never dated. And I had been nothing but charming to her.\" \"Hmmm.\" \"Well, I hadn't. She felt that just because I was known as a scoundrel, that she should take it upon herself to treat me as such. I asked her why she refused to date me, and she said 'I have some taste.'\" \"She sounds like a girl after my own heart.\" \"Very funny, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"And what did you say? When she said that?\" \"I told her she was a bitch.\" Said Stefan. \"And then I said 'You should see a doctor, because that condition of yours could get a whole lot worse.'\" \"Being a bitch?\" said Elizabeth. \"Yes.\" said Stefan. \"And I see you're proud of that little gem, aren't you?\" Elizabeth said. \"Well..\" Stefan said. \"Of course, I was eighteen then, and now I would do things a lot differently. As I'm sure you realize.\" \"Yeah, I realize.\" \"And no, I was not exactly the greatest person to be around then, as I said, acting out to displease my stepfather was my main goal back then. I had a lot of flaws.\" \"Yeah.\" Elizabeth said. \"But the fact remains that you did not meet this girl, Elizabeth. She was, in fact, a very hostile person. She walked around with this haughty, angry look on her face all the time, and I could tell…I could just tell, that she had a chip on her shoulder.\" \"About what?\" \"Well, most of us at the school I attended did come from well-to-do families, and, as noted, Andie was not one of them. So I'm sure that that might have had quite a bit to do with it.\" Stefan said. \"But that certainly wasn't my fault. She had no reason to be hostile to me, Elizabeth. You don't believe me?\" \"Of course I do.\" Elizabeth said. \"No, she…did sound kind of like a bitch. I bet she was a bitch.\" \"She was an angry young woman, I think.\" Stefan said. \"Like me?\" \"No, not at all like you. You're much…sweeter a person than she was.\" He looked at her. \"But something about you does remind me of her.\" \"Do I look like her?\" Elizabeth said. \"No, you look nothing alike, but…\" He took her hand. \"Could be something inside. A…sadness, maybe.\" Elizabeth bit her lip. \"So…you did…study her some, then. You made observations about her…thought she was sad?\" \"I suppose so, though I never really articulated it in my mind that way, back then. Those observations are in retrospect, really.\" Said Stefan. \"But I was sad, myself, back then. Screwed up. And angry, and bitter, and…filled with insecurities.\" Elizabeth bit her lip. \"Do you regret the way you acted with her now? And Blane?\" \"Yes, of course. I regret a great many things I did in my youth.\" Said Stefan. \"And are you angry with Blane…because you wish he'd stood up to you?\" \"No, I'm angry with him because…he showed great disloyalty to me as a friend.\" \"How so? Just by dating Andie?\" \"No, he ended our friendship. Just like that. And it was he who never spoke to me again.\" \"Oh.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Well, you did tell him his girlfriend was trash, and try to bully him into breaking up with her. I guess maybe he did have some cause to be angry.\" \"My behavior would certainly justify anger,\" Stefan said. \"but he knew me for years, so he should have known not to take anything I said seriously. But he did.\" \"You're mad at him for taking what you said seriously, you get mad at me for not taking what you say seriously enough. You seem a bit confused, Stefan.\" \"I'm not angry at him for taking what I said seriously. I'm angry at him for taking it seriously because it was obvious he never placed great value on our friendship in the first place, and ended it the first chance he got.\" Elizabeth was silent for a minute. \"Well,\" she said. \"I guess maybe you're right. Never speaking to you again over something in high school does sound pretty extreme.\" \"It certainly is.\" Said Stefan. \"That thing I told you…about how they called me 'Eliza Do Little' in high school?\" said Elizabeth, after they'd been dating for several weeks. They were sitting on a couch in his office. \"Yes?\" \"That was really stupid.\" \"Well, boys can be pretty stupid at that age, Elizabeth. I was one of them…in fact, I probably would have been just the type to come up with something like that…though I'd imagine I'd have been a bit more clever than that.\" \"Well, I'm sure you would, Stefan, but that's not what I meant. I meant…I should have come up with something better than that to tell you about myself.\" \"Oh, I don't know.\" Said Stefan. \"I think it speaks volumes to me about you. Speaks to your unhealthy devotion to Toby, who cared nothing for you.\" \"I wouldn't say that.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But in any case, I…I had something I wanted to tell you…something else. Personal.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You can tell me anything, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"You know that.\" Elizabeth looked down at the ground. \"I…one time, when I was sixteen…saw my dad hit my mom after…he'd been drinking. He…pushed her into a lamp, and there was broken glass all over the floor…\" She shook her head. \"I see.\" Said Stefan. \"I was never more…disappointed. Or disillusioned. Because…my father's such a good person, such a great guy, when he's sober. But I never thought…he'd hit my mom…not even when he was drinking.\" She shook her head. \"And…I shouldn't tell you about this, because…he's your partner, and…I don't want to- Stefan shook his head. \"Elizabeth…\" he said. \"You need to stop worrying so much about your father.\" Elizabeth looked at her hands sadly. \"I don't want to make you think- \"I already think what I'm going to think anyway, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"And alcohol…is a terrible thing. It makes people do things they would ordinarily never do. That's why I quit drinking, back in college.\" \"Were you a mean drunk?\" Elizabeth said. \"I bet you were. I bet you were a real jerk when you drank.\" \"Elizabeth, that's entirely uncalled for.\" said Stefan. \"I'm just saying…\" \"But yes. It certainly didn't improve my disposition.\" \"I bet.\" \"Elizabeth,\" said Stefan. \"Your father's alcoholism has taken its toll on your life, hasn't it?\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Yeah. It's been hard, worrying about him. That's the main thing.\" she said. \"And all those years my parents spent at each other's throats because of it…it wouldn't have looked like they were to other people, they were always happy, and smiling around other people…but then my father would drink, and when they got home…you would never know they were the same people.\" \"What happened to your mother?\" \"Oh, she lives with her sister in Indiana now. I guess eventually…it all got to be too much for her.\" \"But not for you.\" Stefan said. \"You stayed.\" \"Well, yeah, I mean, he's my dad. He and I have always been very close, and I'm all he's got. They never had any other children.\" \"I see.\" Said Stefan. \"But you know, Elizabeth, Stephen doesn't want you to spend your whole life taking care of him. He wants you to live your own life.\" \"Has he said something like that to you?\" \"Not in so many words. But he's your father, and he loves you very much. He talks about you all the time, and how much he's concerned about your life.\" \"I know.\" Elizabeth said. \"I know he is.\" \"You know, Elizabeth,\" Stefan said. \"When I first met your father, he told me about his alcohol trouble, and how you drive him every day to work. And…since then…\" He looked down at his lap. \"What?\" Elizabeth said, looking at him with concern. \"Ever since then, I've…\" He wouldn't meet her eyes. \"I've….\" \"You've what?\" \"I've…wondered about you. I've wondered what's inside you that makes you let yourself…suffer so much on behalf of others. Such as your father. Not to mention…Toby.\" \"I'm not suffering all that much, Stefan.\" said Elizabeth. \"I'm not suffering at all, really. And my devotion to Toby was hardly selfless.\" \"Still, it takes something…above and beyond what most people have…to allow yourself to put up with so much from one person.\" Stefan said. \"I'm referring to Toby, of course. And that doesn't mean it wasn't a childish…willful demeaning of yourself.\" \"Please.\" Said Elizabeth. \"We just…weren't right for each other, and I wouldn't let myself see it. There's no need to be quite so melodramatic about it, now is there?\" \"Elizabeth…\" said Stefan. \"I think…for years, you've…never truly been appreciated. This man you loved for years…treated you like garbage. Admit it.\" \"Toby didn't treat me like garbage, Stefan. He doesn't treat anyone like garbage. He's not that sort.\" \"He's the sort that will laugh with you, and make you feel at ease, and joke about everything, and in the meantime, not have a shred of regard for you. And he didn't. Because that type usually doesn't.\" \"Okay.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I see. I see what's going on here. I shouldn't trust someone who's pleasant to be around, and treats me well. That person's not going to have any regard for me. Because in order to be trustworthy, you must be a droning, unpleasant, overbearing, insulting stiff. Right?\" \"Yes, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"That's right.\" \"Huh.\" Elizabeth said. \"If anyone's going to have regard for you, it will be the droning, unpleasant stiff.\" Said Stefan. \"If anyone has…tremendous regard for you, it's the droning, unpleasant stiff. As you put it.\" Elizabeth swallowed, but shook her head.\"' Regard'?\" she said. \"Now, see, that sounds like a word a stiff would use.\" \"Uh huh.\" Said Stefan. \"Does it.\" \"Then that's it?\" Elizabeth said. \"Just.. 'regard'? That's all you have to say?\" \"You called me a droning, unpleasant, stiff. You should be happy I have regard for you.\" \"Don't forget overbearing and insulting.\" \"That, too. It's the 'unpleasant' part that bothers me the most. I'm very pleasant.\" \"So you admit you're insulting and bossy?\" \"I admit it's not entirely inaccurate.\" Said Stefan. \"But the bossing is for your own good.\" Elizabeth smiled, and shook her head. \"Elizabeth,\" Stefan said. He cupped her face in his hands. \"I'm very…fond of you.\" \" 'Fond of'?\" \"Elizabeth!\" Stefan said angrily. \"It's…it's very hard for me to…express myself, at times.\" \"Oh, come on. You can express yourself quite well, Stefan.\" Elizabeth said. \"You're a lawyer.\" \"I'm not a lawyer when I'm with you.\" Stefan said. \"I'm…I'm…\" \"Shy?\" Elizabeth suggested. \"No, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said abruptly. \"I'm not shy. I'm just a droning, unpleasant stiff, is what it is.\" \"Okay, okay.\" Elizabeth said. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I don't know what made me say that.\" \"Insanity, probably.\" \"Thanks a lot.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Elizabeth…\" Stefan said. \"I…well, I appreciate you. Of course, you're an intelligent, beautiful young woman. But I see something in you…in the way that you…in the way that you've stood by your father…and even in the way that you were so devoted to Toby, as unhealthy as it was…it shows a kind of determination. You won't back down, though you've been hurt so many times, by so many people. You've gone years…with so little happiness in your life.\" \"I've been happy. Helping my father does make me happy.\" \"Well, maybe. But what has anyone ever done for you, Elizabeth? Have you asked yourself that question?\" \"I don't know.\" Elizabeth said. \"But Stefan…who appreciates you? Has anyone ever?\" \"I…I don't know, Elizabeth. I'm certainly well-respected as an attorney.\" \"I'm not talking about as an attorney. I'm talking about as a person. Is there someone who truly appreciates you? Has there ever been?\" \"I don't know, Elizabeth, but- \"At least I have loving parents.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I mean, my father thinks that I'm a total loony-wack job because of the Toby thing, but of course he appreciates me as a person. But your parents weren't loving. You told me your stepfather never approved of you. And…has there been anyone…a woman, who appreciates you for anything meaningful? What about friends? Blane? He didn't appreciate you, from what you've told me. Has there been anyone who does?\" \"I…I don't know, Elizabeth, but…\" \"You don't know, because you think there's nothing to appreciate. You don't like yourself.\" Said Elizabeth. She took his hand. \"But…I appreciate you, Stefan. I don't mean half the things I say…and I know…you're caring, and kind, and witty, and intelligent, and good-natured…well, most of the time. I truly appreciate you, and what you're doing for me. How much you care about me.\" Stefan looked at her, sadness etched on his face. \"Elizabeth…\" he said. \"I want you to know…I…I've cared for you…ever since I've known you…and I..\" He sniffed. \"Allergies?\" Elizabeth said. \"And,\" he continued, ignoring her. \"I love the way your…dark hair contrasts with your…ethereal blue eyes, and your tiny little upturned nose, and- \"Tiny?\" \"And your laugh. And the way you smile. And the way you're always so…insolent. I bet you're thinking of something insolent to say right now. Aren't you?\" Elizabeth smiled and shrugged. \"And I love…the way your tongue darts around in your mouth. Especially after you've said something insolent.\" Elizabeth laughed. \"I guess…\" said Stefan. \"I don't express myself very well about these things.\" \"What?\" Elizabeth said. \"Are you kidding? It was great. That was…really beautiful, Stefan.\" \"But what I'm trying to say is, Elizabeth…that didn't…I can't come up with anything…that truly conveys how…deeply I'm…in love with you.\" he said, putting his hands on her shoulders. Elizabeth nodded. \"I see.\" she said. She bit her lip. \"Well- \"I mean, I am a droning…what was that you said? Unpleasant stiff, after all.\" \"All right, you ruined it now.\" Elizabeth said. \"You can't let anything go, can you.\" \"Oh, so there was something of value to ruin according to you, then?\" \"Of course there was something of value to ruin.\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, what was it, Elizabeth?\" said Stefan. \"What was what?\" said Elizabeth. \"Do you feel…the same way?\" Stefan said. \"As I do about you?\" He squeezed her shoulder, and looked at her, waiting for answer. \"I…yes.\" Elizabeth said, looking flustered. \"Like I said, I appreciate you. I appreciate what a great person you are. I'm sorry I went to such great lengths to avoid you before.\" \"Thank you for that.\" Stefan said. \"And…I…you're, um….you're…\" She looked down at her lap. \"I…it's…\" \"What?\" \"You're…you're a really beautiful man.\" She said, rolling her eyes. \"In fact sometimes I think…you're so handsome I could cry.\" She looked at him. \"You do?\" Stefan said. \"Yeah.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Elizabeth,\" said Stefan. \"this is a whole new side of you.\" He reached over, and pulled her close to him, studying her. \"I shouldn't have said that.\" Elizabeth said. \"It will open up a long era of you running over me.\" \"Only in your twisted mind.\" \"I take it back.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You can never take it back.\" said Stefan, a bemused tone in his voice. \"Oh, yes I can.\" Elizabeth said. \"No.\" Stefan said, kissing her lips gently. \"No. Stefan. No.\" Elizabeth said as he pressed his lips to her throat. \"Stefan? Stefan. Please. I have some taste, Stefan.\" Stefan looked up at her. \"Indeed. You do. You have a very lovely taste, in fact.\" He kissed her lips. As he was kissing her, she let out a small groan of false dismay. \"But I had some taste.\" she said dejectedly, before returning his kiss.[Chapter 6] \"So\" Toby said, several months later, in the bakery. \"How's…uh, how are things going?\" \"Things are going great.\" Elizabeth replied. \"How are things going for you?\" \"Great, great.\" He tapped his fingers on the counter. \"So…you….still seeing Mr. Grey?\" \"Yes, I'm still seeing him.\" she said. \"It's Stefan, by the way.\" \"I'm good with Mr. Grey, if you don't mind.\" Toby said. \"Why?\" Elizabeth said. \"You don't like him?\" \"I don't know him.\" said Toby. He studied her. \"You're…in love with him, then?\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Don't make me answer that, Toby.\" \"Why?\" \"Because…the answer might make me throw up. I'd rather not think about the…feelings he makes me feel.\" She looked at him. \"Why? You're not jealous, are you?\" \"No,\" said Toby. \"Don't be ridiculous. But…\" \"What?\" Elizabeth said. She looked at him. \"Toby, you practically begged me to date him. What are you saying?\" \"I did, and I'm glad I did. Make no mistake. I'm glad you're…you've found someone else to occupy your time. But…I don't know, Liz…do you think you should keep your options open?\" \"With who? You?\" \"Of course not. But…how long have you two been dating?\" \"A little under a year.\" \"Well, are you thinking seriously of settling down with him?\" \"Toby, I don't know.\" Elizabeth said. \"I'd like to see where it goes. But…maybe.\" \"So you love him?\" She sighed. \"Yes. I love Stefan. Okay? Loathe as I am to admit it.\" \"I don't know, Elizabeth.\" Toby said. \"Are you sure about this?\" \"Toby, why wouldn't I be sure?\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, for one thing, he's…forty-three. There's that.\" Toby said. Elizabeth shook her head. \"Toby, I can't believe you.\" \"Well, I'm just saying. He's not exactly a spring chicken, is he?\" \"Toby- \"Look, I just…\" He shook his head. \"It's a little…weird, isn't it? For you?\" \"No.\" said Elizabeth. \"Why, just because he's a little older?\" \"Well…I don't know. I mean, are you sure…you shouldn't at least look at others? And no, I don't mean me.\" \"Toby…\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Why are you saying this?\" \"I don't know…isn't he…a little weird? Mr. Grey?\" \"He's a lawyer. He's very respectable. No.\" She frowned at him. \"Toby, a year ago you were saying he might be really good for me. And guess what? You were right. He is. And I'm happy.\" \"So he's good for you.\" Toby said. \"You've improved. Grown. Maybe you don't need him now.\" \"Toby!\" She looked at him incredulously. \"What, just because he's older?\" \"Well, are you sure a guy in his forties can give you what you want out of life?\" said Toby. \"Is that how you want to spend the rest of your life, with someone nearly twenty years older? Maybe you should have some fun. See who else is out there.\" \"No, Toby. I couldn't do that. And won't. I care for Stefan.\" \"Okay.\" Toby said. \"but in twenty years, when you're at your peak, he'll be…well, not in very good condition is all I'm saying. I mean, forty-three is okay now, but…are you going to be happy with him in fifteen or twenty years, when he's old? Fat? No longer desirable? No longer able to- \"Uh…we all will be a little older in twenty years, including yourself, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. She shook her head. \"Besides, Stefan's not…he'll never be fat, I'm sure. He's not the type.\" \"You don't know for sure if he is or not.\" Toby said. \"Anyone might.\" \"Not Stefan.\" Elizabeth said. \"Oh, I don't know, Elizabeth.\" Toby said. \"You might be singing another tune in a few years. You never know. As a matter of fact, Stefan looks to me like he has that tendency.\" Elizabeth snorted. \"He does not. He's very slender, Toby.\" \"But he just has a certain look about him. Like someone who has it in him to be fat.\" \"That's ridiculous, Toby.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You've only seen him…once or twice, when he's come in here. And…have you even spoken to him? No.\" Elizabeth said, shaking her head. \"I don't need to have spoken to him to observe that, Liz.\" Said Toby. \"It's…something about the way he carries himself. I can just tell.\" Elizabeth snorted. \"You're full of it, Toby.\" \"No, really.\" \"You can tell just by observing him that he might get fat in a few years?\" \"Yeah.\" Toby said. \"Just an…air he has about him. You can tell these things about people, Elizabeth. It's genetics. And psychology.\" \"Yeah, right.\" Elizabeth said. \"You'll go to any lengths to turn me against Stefan, won't you, Toby?\" \"No, that's not it, Elizabeth.\" Toby said. \"But in about fifteen years, see if I'm not right. Are you sure you'll still want him then?\" \"Yes.\" Elizabeth said. \"Of course, that's utter twaddle anyway. You can't tell that from looking at him. But even if you could, I'd still desire him. Stefan is…eminently desirable.\" Toby made a scoffing noise. \"You don't want to end up like Jessie in Gerald's Game , do you Liz? The book about the overweight lawyer who liked to handcuff his wife to beds? Died of a heart attack while she was shackled? You want to be handcuffed to some bed, alone out in some remote cabin? It could be on the docket in a few years. He has that look…just…a kind of insecurity, almost. Gerald was insecure. In the book. I remember that.\" Elizabeth bit her lip, and glanced down at the floor. She shook her head. \"Well, you know Toby, I always thought that Gerald in the book was kind of…hot.\" \"Really.\" Said Toby. \"Well, that comes as a complete surprise to me, Elizabeth. I didn't know you liked that type.\" \"In fact,\" Elizabeth looked at Toby, lolling her tongue. \"If Stefan ever got fat, I'd…I'd want to have…chubby sex with him, Toby.\" \"Uh huh.\" said Toby. \"Uh…okay, Elizabeth.\" He shook his head. \"I still think you should reconsider your relationship.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"No.\" she said. \"Besides, how can you be sure you want to spend the rest of your life with just one person?\" said Toby. \"I mean, I might not be the best person to listen to about this, with my viewpoint, and all, but I don't know. I think settling with anyone, especially this guy, could be a mistake.\" \"Toby,\" said Elizabeth. \"You know what I think? I think…you don't want me in your life as a girlfriend, but you don't want me to be happy with anyone else, either.\" \"What?\" said Toby. \"How can you say that?\" \"Maybe,\" said Elizabeth. \"You even wanted to get me together with Stefan, because you thought hey, I'll just get her together with this stodgy, boring, older lawyer who gets on her nerves, and when she realizes what a pain he is to be around, she'll come right back to me. And so it goes. Round and round for the rest of our lives.\" \"Okay,\" said Toby. \"Where in the world does that come from?\" He looked at her pointedly. \"I could probably venture a guess, though.\" \"Oh, you think this comes from Stefan, do you?\" She bit her lip. \"Well, he does think you didn't treat me right.\" \"So he doesn't like me.\" Toby said. \"I knew it.\" \"You didn't know it at all. Like you said, you don't even know him.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But the list of things and people that Stefan doesn't approve of could fill several volumes, so I wouldn't concern myself with it.\" \"I think Mr. Grey is in your head now, Elizabeth.\" Said Toby. \"You told me he likes to get inside people's heads, and screw around with them. He's in yours now, I see that. Like the alien was in Jonesy's head in Dreamcatcher .\" \"Ha.\" Elizabeth said. \"I think he is. He's brainwashed you against me now.\" \"He has not. I could care less what he says about something if I don't agree with it.\" Elizabeth said. \"Besides, if I were really taken over with Mr. Grey, it would sound like this.\" She dropped her voice to a monotone, and spoke through closed teeth. \" 'Toby, could your meddling in the life of your ex girlfriend be a result of some jealousy, and rampant insecurity?'\" \"No, I don't think it could, Elizabeth.\" Said Toby. \"I think Mr. Grey is…not a person you want to be stuck with for the rest of your life. And I think that you should…not get so hung up on one person. Again.\" \"I'm not hung up on Stefan, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"Stefan irritates me way too much for me to ever be hung up on him.\" A month earlier, Stephen had gotten his driving privileges back, and now drove himself to work every day. Elizabeth was glad, though they didn't see each other as frequently now. \"Dad,\" Elizabeth said one evening, as the two of them were eating dinner together at home. \"What do you think about…a younger woman dating an older man?\" \"Well, if they're happy, then…\" Stephen shrugged. \"Why?\" \"I just…sometimes…it seems weird.\" She looked at him. \"I'm referring to your partner, of course. Do you think we look…odd together?\" \"Oh.\" Stephen said. \"Well, to tell you the truth, I've rarely thought about it. You two make such a good couple, that…you don't seem so far apart.\" \"You mean you've never thought about…him being older?\" \"Well, of course I've thought about it once or twice, but…\" He shrugged. \"Who cares, really? He's still thirteen years younger than me.\" \"And that's a lot.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Well, yeah.\" Stephen said. \"So?\" \"So obviously, if thirteen years is, then seventeen years is…even more vast.\" \"And this bothers you?\" said Stephen. \"Well..\" Elizabeth said. \"I'm just worried people are going to think…that it screams 'daddy issues'. Not that I have them, of course.\" She said pointedly. \"Elizabeth.\" Stephen said. \"Are you happy with Mr….with Stefan?\" \"Well, yeah. Even though I don't really like to admit it.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because…he's…I…\" She took a sip of water. \"He makes me feel…feelings that are…intense. Feelings that…I'm afraid of. It..it wasn't like that with Toby.\" \"Toby again.\" said Stephen. \"No, Dad, I…I look at Toby now, and I feel nothing for him. Romantically speaking, that is.\" She sighed. \"And I…it's like he was always talking about. Toby. The poison is there. The fear.\" She looked at him. \"Is that…is that something that you've ever experienced? Feeling so attracted to someone that you were afraid of it?\" Stephen sighed. \"Well…no, Elizabeth.\" He said. \"I met your mother, and I was very attracted to her, and she to me…and…well, I never felt….afraid, or poisoned. And we had a very strong attraction. That is, until I ruined it all with…well you know. Crackling Rosie.\" He sighed. \"Maybe we screwed you up really badly about this. Relationships.\" \"No, Dad.\" Elizabeth said firmly. \"This has nothing to do with you, or Mom, at all.\" \"I think maybe it does, and you just don't realize it.\" He shook his head. \"No…because…I just…\" She looked down at her hands. \"I feel like…I wish…it could be easy…like it was with Toby. We could laugh together, and…I never felt so…afraid of how I felt for him. And I used to be…or think I was, anyway, really, really in love with him.\" She sighed. \"Maybe I am really screwed up. Not because of anything at all circumstantial…but that's just…the way I am.\" Stephen put his hand on hers. \"I don't think so, Elizabeth.\" He said. \"I think that…all it goes to prove is that your feelings for Toby weren't coming from a mature place, and this is. And doing the mature thing is always a little scary.\" \"I guess.\" She shook her head. \"Maybe I'm terrible for Stefan. He doesn't need such an immature woman in his life.\" \"You're not immature, sweetheart.\" Said Stephen. \"All of us wrestle with maturity from time to time. What do you think I was, all those years I was an alcoholic?\" \"Immature?\" Elizabeth said. \"In part, yes.\" Stephen said. She sighed. \"But speaking of maturity…do you think people are going to look at us, and think we're…together for money? Or that I have daddy issues, or…do you think we're going to be met with scorn?\" \"No.\" Stephen said. \"I think it's all in your mind. But even if they did, you know that they're wrong, so…what does it matter, if you're happy?\" Elizabeth sipped her water, and shrugged. \"I guess you're right.\" She said. \"Hey.\" Toby said after the shop was closed the following week. \"Look, I want you to know…I'm not trying to jeopardize your happiness, or anything, okay?\" \"I know, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"If anything, I meant that these things would be…subconscious. You'd be unaware of them.\" \"What I'm aware about,\" Toby said. \"Is that I…just don't want to see you…make the same mistake twice. Get hung up on some guy, and get hurt all over again.\" \"I'm not.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I just think…maybe you should…look into…seeing other people occasionally. Just so you don't make the same mistake twice.\" \"No, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"You know, Amy's fiance's brother is a lawyer.\" Toby said. \"And he's single.\" \"Toby! I thought you were sorry.\" \"I'm sorry I upset you.\" Toby said. \"But…I just…I think you really choose the wrong people, Elizabeth. To be…focused on. Myself included.\" \"You know, just because you say 'myself included', that doesn't give you a free pass on what you're doing.\" Elizabeth said. \"What am I doing, Elizabeth?\" \"Trying to break Stefan and myself up.\" \"I'm trying to get you to…find someone normal. I think Stefan was a mistake.\" Said Toby. \"Yeah, sure. I bet this guy, this other lawyer…he'll be a 'mistake', too, if I got really serious with him.\" \"Elizabeth, that isn't true at all. I think you should talk to him. Just have a few drinks. He'll be at their wedding next month. Amy, what's his name?\" he asked Amy, who was putting away the unsold cookies at the counter. \"Don't get me involved, Toby.\" Amy said. \"Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"Truly, I don't think it would work out. I have…strong feelings for Stefan. What does…Amy's fiancé's brother have to recommend for him, besides being a lawyer. I've already got one of those.\" \"Well, he isn't forty.\" Said Toby. \"And he doesn't talk like a member of the walking dead. Your words, Elizabeth.\" \"Yeah, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"My words. So you can't use them. Only I can say that about Stefan.\" \"Oh, please.\" Toby said. \"I think you'll find that your words are going to really haunt you when the bloom is off the rose, and you have to listen to nothing but monotony for the rest of your life.\" \"I think you should mind your own business, and also, maybe the 'bloom being off the rose' is not such a horrible thing, Toby. It happens…and then you just…live your lives together. And have someone to share things with. That's what it's all about. Of course, not that you think so.\" \"Maybe you should just give it a try, though.\" Said Toby. \"See if that's really what you want, to share the rest of your life with just one person. You could talk to him about it. Mr. Grey. Tell him you want to see other people for awhile.\" Elizabeth snorted. \"Toby, in the first place, I don't want to. And in the second place, Stefan would have a conniption. He sure as hell wouldn't go for that, me wanting to see other men.\" \"Yeah, well.\" Toby said. \"If I had to make an educated guess, I'd say that Stefan seems like the type that would be pretty darn controlling. I really don't want to see you with a guy like that, Liz.\" \"Well, I'm not going to let him be controlling, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"Believe me when I say, I know how to handle Stefan.\" \"You think you do.\" said Toby. \"But when you've been with him awhile, a controlling person will really …\" He shook his head. \"I swear, Liz, you were better off…\" \"I was better off what , Toby?\" Elizabeth said, looking at him challengingly. \"You were better off…when you were hiding outside my house. I know you used to do it.\" \"You were cheating on me!\" \"Well, it seems you always go for the wrong guy, doesn't it?\" \"Not always. Just continue to say whatever you want, Toby, as long as you put yourself down, too. I think Stefan was right about you. You'll pretend to be so nice, and sweet, and tell me what I want to hear, but you don't care a thing about me.\" \"Oh, Stefan was right about me, huh?\" Toby said. \"Stefan is probably right about everything to you. He's taken over. Taken my place, but he's much more dangerous.\" \"That's ridiculous.\" Elizabeth said. \"I've found someone I can be happy with. Who you initially wanted me with, by the way. Why won't you let me enjoy it, and be happy?\" \"He makes you happy?\" Toby said. \"That…that monotonous, imperious, middle-aged creep?\" \"Yeah.\" Said Elizabeth. \"You hit the nail on the head, Toby. He is. He's a monotonous, imperious…autocrat.\" \"Yeah?\" Toby said. \"Well- \"He's a monotonous, imperious, autocrat…with a huge - \"Okay, that's enough.\" Toby said irritably. Amy snorted laughter, from her position on the counter. Toby glanced at her, rolling his eyes. \"Well, he sure does not look like he does, Elizabeth.\" Toby said. \"Well, he does, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"Uh huh. Well- \"And you don't know what a relationship is. So stop trying to break the two of us up.\" Elizabeth said. \"Not with Amy's fiancé's brother, or anyone.\" She looked at him. \"I'm really disappointed with you.\" Toby just shrugged, and shook his head, looking nonplussed. \"Whatever you want.\" he said. \"It's your life. I'm just trying to help.\" \"Stefan says that, too.\" Elizabeth said. \"Does he?\" said Toby. \"Yeah. Yeah, he does.\" said Elizabeth. She picked up her purse from a nearby table, turning to look at him. \"The only difference is, he means it.\"[Chapter 7] \"You've been distant lately, Elizabeth.\" said Stefan one evening a few weeks later, as they were watching television. He put his hand on her shoulder. \"Have I?\" Elizabeth said. \"I don't think I have.\" \"I think you have.\" said Stefan. \"Is there something on your mind?\" \"No.\" Elizabeth said. She looked at the TV. \"Do you mind? I'm trying to watch Misery .\" \"I think we watch too much TV.\" said Stefan. \"We're not communicating enough.\" \"I thought you liked watching TV.\" Elizabeth said. \"Who makes you?\" She shook her head in irritation. \"Well, I don't want to now.\" said Stefan. He took the remote, and switched the TV off. \"Hey!\" Elizabeth said, annoyed. She rolled her eyes. \"Here we go.\" \"Oh, is my company that disagreeable to you?\" said Stefan. \"Yes.\" Elizabeth said. \"Sure it is.\" said Stefan. \"Is this how it's going to be?\" said Elizabeth. \"All the time? You just switching off the TV abruptly, whenever you want to have a conversation?\" \"Maybe.\" said Stefan. \"What's wrong with conversation?\" \"Nothing's wrong with conversation.\" Elizabeth said. \"The thing that's wrong is you bossing me.\" \"You've got a real thing about that, don't you?\" Stefan said. \"Only with you.\" said Elizabeth. \"I find that hard to believe.\" said Stefan. \"But in any case, it's completely unfounded. I don't want to boss you. Unless it's to make you do the right thing. I think you need…guidance.\" Elizabeth snorted. \" Guidance ?\" She looked at him, glowering. \"Just a joke, Elizabeth.\" \"Oh, I don't think it was.\" said Elizabeth. \"I think that you're perfectly happy to try to control me.\" \"Not at all, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"But in any case, you're not going to let me, are you?\" He put his hand on her chest. She looked at him. \"What's that hand doing there?\" said Elizabeth, taking his hand off pointedly. \"You know, Elizabeth,\" Stefan said, putting his hand back on. \"Did I ever tell you that your breasts are very…pear shaped?\" He leaned closer to her. \"Not lately.\" Elizabeth said, rolling her eyes. \"And not the hard green ones either.\" he said. \"The juicy kind, the kind you get in the box from Harry & David.\" Elizabeth swallowed, fidgeting. \"I…\" \"Your cheeks get all flushed, Elizabeth.\" said Stefan, tracing her cheeks with his finger. \"Did you know that?\" Elizabeth shook her head in indignation, thinking of how he'd said she needed guidance. \"Please.\" She said. \"Is this how it's going to be, every time, I try to question anything you do? You're going to try to sex me up, and then I'm going to forget everything about you that annoys me? Like how your controllingness will- \"You know, you're trembling, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"With anger, Stefan.\" \"I think not.\" Said Stefan. \"Do I make you have that reaction?\" He cupped her face in his hands. \"But in any case, if I was doing what you described, I'd have to be a liar, wouldn't I?\" \"I…guess.\" Elizabeth said flatly. \"It just so happens that…sexing you up, as you put it, was…what I was already planning to do anyway. The timing was coincidental, I assure you.\" He placed his hand on her chest, looking at her. \"I think you're already pretty sexed up, or you wouldn't have this reaction. That's probably why you're so worried about me bossing you. I have such a powerful effect on you, that you're afraid you might do anything I say, and you're afraid to let yourself. You are a very willful young woman, after all.\" He traced her throat. \"We'll have to do something about that, won't we?\" \"Oh, for Pete's sake.\" She said, moving away. \"What do you think we should do about it, Elizabeth?\" Stefan moved closer, and put his hand on her thigh. \"I've never met someone more…afraid of herself.\" Elizabeth made a noise of indignation. \"Please. Hands off me, throat cancer.\" She swatted his hand off of her leg. Stefan looked at her incredulously. She bit her lip. \" Throat cancer ?\" he said, in a tone of disbelief. He shook his head, and looked back at her in bewilderment. Elizabeth laughed nervously. \"Well, you see, I-I was just…\" \"I…\" He frowned at her questioningly, squinting at her. \"Throat cancer?\" \"I just meant you have a rather…er…low-register- \"Throat cancer.\" Stefan repeated. He looked at her. \"I was just…I just don't like to be bossed, and I thought you were trying to…control me, and I just want to let you know, I'm not a woman to be controlled, and…\" She trailed off, noticing Stefan staring fixedly at her as she was talking. \"I…\" \"Elizabeth,\" Stefan said, moving closer to her. He placed his hand on her cheekbone. \"I don't think you have to worry about me trying to change you….I think that nothing I could say or do could change the fact that you are and always will be a… cheeky woman.\" He bit his lip, looking at her. \"I…darn right.\" Elizabeth said. \"I just think…\" He stroked her other cheek. \"that I have a powerful…sexual hold over you, that you're…afraid to let yourself embrace.\" \"Oh lord. Here we go.\" Said Elizabeth. \"And,\" Stefan continued. \"I can see this, since every time I…say anything…sexual to you, you… squeak .\" \"I do?\" Elizabeth said. \"Yes.\" Said Stefan. \"You always make a little…squeaking noise…in your throat.\" He gave her a sidelong glance. Elizabeth sighed, shaking her head. \"Uh huh.\" \"It's very, sexy, but…\" Stefan trailed off, biting his lip. \"I think you're afraid. Of your own sexual desires.\" \"Please.\" Elizabeth said. \"You are. And…I think.\" He looked at her, smiling. \"I think, in fact, you may even be a little nuts.\" \"Takes one to know one, Stefan.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Yes, well.\" said Stefan. He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \"I simply think, Elizabeth, that…you…squeak whenever you feel turned on, because you're a bit…nuts, and so you cover up how aroused you are by me by being…cheeky.\" He raised an eyebrow at her. Elizabeth looked at him, realization dawning in her eyes. \"You son of a- \"Throat cancer.\" Stefan repeated with conviction, sitting back against the couch cushions. \"Oh, so you're calling me a squirrel, huh?\" Elizabeth said. \"Oh, so you're referring to me as 'throat cancer', huh?\" said Stefan. He looked at her.\"More of a chipmunk, really.\" \"Very mature of you, Stefan.\" Elizabeth said. \"The height of wit. Insulting someone's appearance. I hope you're pleased with yourself.\" \"Oh, I am. But truly, I've always found chipmunks to be rather endearing, Elizabeth.\" \"You've got some nerve, you know that?\" Elizabeth said. \"Calling me a chipmunk.\" \"A beautiful chipmunk.\" Stefan looked at her. Elizabeth started to laugh, in spite of her indignation, but shook her head. \"And you're a very sexy throat cancer patient, Stefan.\" \"Well, thank you, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"I'm glad to hear such kind words. Keep in mind though, I'm allergic to nuts, so you might want to store them some place where I'm not around.\" \"Okay then. I will. In fact, I'll store them some place entirely far away from you. I'm leaving.\" She started to get up. \"Are you really, Elizabeth?\" Stefan said. Elizabeth bit her lip. \"No.\" she said. \"I thought not.\" Said Stefan. \"But you better not call me a chipmunk again.\" Elizabeth said. \"If you never say I sound like I have throat cancer again. I feel it was said with malicious intent, too…much more malicious than my comment was. You are, after all, a very angry young lady, and I'm not even sure if you know who, or what, you're angry at.\" \"Sounds like a lot of b.s. to cover up the fact that you called me a chipmunk.\" Elizabeth. \"Not at all, Elizabeth.\" said Stefan. \"I mean what I say.\" He looked at her. \"Just like I mean what I say when I say that, you don't resemble a chipmunk, but if you did, you'd be the most beautiful, and sexiest…blue-eyed chipmunk I'd ever seen.\" He stroked her cheek. Elizabeth rolled her eyes, but was unable to stop herself from swallowing, hoping it didn't make a squeaking sound when she did. \"Stefan?\" Elizabeth said in bed, later that evening. \"Hmmm?\" Stefan said. \"Have you ever been married?\" \"No.\" Stefan said, turning to face her. \"I was engaged once. To an artist. Cynthia.\" \"Cynthia.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Was she beautiful?\" \"She was…if you like unibrows.\" Said Stefan. Elizabeth laughed. \"And gapped teeth.\" \"At least she wasn't a chipmunk , huh?\" Elizabeth said angrily. \"I adore chipmunks.\" Stefan said. \"You know that, don't you Elizabeth.\" \"What happened?\" Elizabeth said. \"Did you make fun of her looks, too? Buy her a pair of tweezers or something?\" \"I never had the occasion to.\" said Stefan. \"She never mocked me the way you do.\" \"Oh, unfavorable comparisons, huh?\" \"Not at all. She was….spirited like you…but she was rather…whorish, I'd say.\" \"How did you meet her?\" Elizabeth said. \"Through a lawyer friend of mine. John. He introduced me to her at a party at our firm.\" \"Oh.\" said Elizabeth. \"Did you love her?\" \"I did. I thought we had something.\" Said Stefan. \"A rapport. Kind of like you and I…but not nearly as strong.\" \"But…\" \"But,\" said Stefan. \"It turned out she and John were seeing each other every day behind my back. One time, they even did it in my apartment.\" \"How did you find out?\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, we were over at John's house for dinner one evening, and I went to use the bathroom. And I found…one of her earrings there. A pearl earring, one of a set she always wore.\" \"Wow.\" Elizabeth said. \"I never spoke to either of them again after I confronted them with it.\" Said Stefan. \"Needless to say. He was a liar, John. One of the worst kind.\" \"Sounds like it.\" Elizabeth said. \"Hurt a lot, I bet. What they did.\" \"Of course.\" Said Stefan. \"Any other serious relationships?\" \"Not serious, but…\" He trailed off. \"In high school, I had this girlfriend. Bennie. Bennie Hansen.\" \"And what was she like?\" \"Oh, she was like the kind of girl I always dated back then. Blonde. Flashy. Spoiled, and a bit catty.\" \"So…if she was like all the others…what made her special? That you mentioned her to me, out of a…vast selection?\" \"Oh, nothing, back then, really. She and I only did one thing really well, and the rest of the time we had nothing to talk about. We went to our prom together, and spent most of it…trashed, and upstairs in the hotel where the prom was being held.\" He shook his head. \"But that was then. Later, when I was a few years out of law school, I ran into her.\" \"Had she changed?\" \"Yes, actually. Quite a bit. As had I.\" He took her hand, and placed it against his chest. Elizabeth looked up at him questioningly. \"What happened?\" \"Well, Bennie said that she was in town, visiting relatives. So we had lunch, and we…talked about our lives, she said she was a teacher now, science, and I said I wasn't surprised, she was always very smart. I remember she was taking advanced calculus classes when we were in school together.\" Said Stefan. \"And I was surprised that I remembered that, because I spent most of my high school career completely wasted. Not to mention self-absorbed. That led me to mention how I had changed, and was considerably less self-absorbed now. She said she could tell. We talked about how we both had made a lot of decisions that we regretted in the past, though Bennie a great deal less so than myself.\" \"So…did you two…start dating again?\" \"I very much wanted to date her, yes.\" Said Stefan. \"She was…she seemed very charming. Thoughtful. Quiet. Introspective. And she was very, very beautiful. We were in our late twenties by then, and in high school, she had been an attractive girl, but…nothing like she was when I saw her. She looked a bit like Kim Basinger.\" \"Oh, Kim Basinger, huh?\" said Elizabeth. \"I don't see how a chipmunk can compete with Kim Basinger.\" \"Quiet.\" Said Stefan. \"Even Kim Basinger's features could likely be picked apart, if you analyzed them enough. And you are,\" he said, turning his face towards her. \"a beautiful woman. You know that.\" \"I guess.\" Said Elizabeth. \"So the Kim Basinger look-alike. What happened with her?\" \"Well, we had lunch, and then dinner later that evening. And…we had an enjoyable time together. We laughed a lot, and talked for several hours.\" \"Did you have sex?\" \"We wound up spending the night together, yes.\" said Stefan. \"We wound up spending several nights together that weekend in fact. And we did more than just have sex. We…talked. I thought that we had a very strong connection.\" \"Did she…break up with you later?\" \"Well, I never saw her again in person, after that weekend.\" Stefan said. \"Why?\" said Elizabeth. \"She just leave, and never call you again?\" \"Well, yes, as a matter of fact, but worse than that…\" He looked at her. \"When it was time for her to go home, we exchanged phone numbers, and parted ways. I thought things had gone very well, and in fact felt truly positive about things for the first time in…well, a very long time. If ever. So I called her a couple of weeks later.\" \"What did she say to you?\" \"She didn't say anything to me.\" Stefan said. He looked up at the ceiling. \"She didn't say anything to me, because the number she had given me was the number of a local restaurant in San Francisco, where she had moved.\" \"Oh.\" Elizabeth said. \"Wow. Well- \"But that's not even the punch line.\" Stefan said, turning to look at her. \"What happened?\" He shook his head. \"Stefan?\" Elizabeth said. \"What happened?\" \"Well…\" Stefan said. He sighed. \"I was naturally very upset about this, but I figured that since we'd had such a positive reunion, and she'd seemed so gracious, and receptive to me, that perhaps…she'd given me the number by mistake. So I called her mother. I told her it was Stefan Grey, Bennie's old friend from high school, and I was just checking to see how she was. And Mrs. Hansen was quite friendly. Chatty, even. I learned that Bennie was, in fact, married to a man she'd met in college. A teacher. They taught at the same high school, she said. So. That was why she'd given me the number of the restaurant. And it was a seafood restaurant, too. I remember that, because I'm allergic to shellfish, and I couldn't help but wonder if it wasn't some…cruel joke on her part.\" \"Oh, Stefan.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"What a royal bitch. Well- \"That's the thing, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said abruptly. \"Bennie used to be a bitch. In high school.\" \"And still was, from the sound of it.\" Elizabeth said. \"No.\" Stefan shook his head. \"No, when I saw her again, she was the sweetest woman you'd ever want to know. Shy, even. So, I got Bennie's actual number from her mother, and…called it. I wanted an explanation.\" \"What did she have to say for herself?\" \"Well, when I called, she sounded panicked. She told me…that she would ordinarily never commit adultery, but…she just lost track of what she was doing that week. One thing led to another, she said. It was a mistake, she said.\" He made a noise of incredulity. \"I asked why she did it. She said her husband was sick that weekend, and couldn't make it, and that she'd had a big fight with him. She said that though she regretted it, in the moment, it was…kind of thrilling. Deceiving him. Deceiving everyone, her parents, brother, relatives she was seeing that weekend. I asked why she'd lied to me, and made me a party to her adultery. She laughed, and said 'Steff. Does it really matter to you? Back in school, cheating was nothing to you. Why do you care so much now?'\" \"She's a sociopath.\" Said Elizabeth. \"She then begged me not to tell her husband. She said that he was a very good man, who was good to her, and that if ever found out what we did, it would destroy him. I said I wouldn't. Partly because…\" He shook his head. \"Because why?\" \"Because…her mother had been so friendly to me on the phone, and…she hadn't liked me when I was dating her daughter in high school. In fact, a lot of mothers didn't like me.\" He shook his head. \"I knew that Bennie would tell everyone that I had known that she was married, and had seduced her, coerced her into it, if I told. It would be her word against mine. And everyone who had known me back in high school would have no trouble believing that I would sleep with a married woman, and wreck her home. Including Bennie's mother. So I said nothing.\" \"Oh, Stefan.\" Elizabeth said. \"That isn't…you shouldn't have….\" \"So, I said goodbye to her. We never spoke to each other again. Needless to say.\" He said. He shook his head. \"I think…that hurt even more than what Cynthia did. In some way.\" \"Why?\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, Cynthia's cheating with John was…commonplace. A commonplace deception.\" Said Stefan. \"But Bennie knowingly…used me to get back at her husband, who she was temporarily angrily at…and I think…she thought that if she cheated with me, it would be….more acceptable. After all, what's one more black mark on my record, right? I was nothing to her but a way to make herself feel…wicked, I suppose. Excited. To feel like she was…escaping from her 'nice' little life as a teacher, and a wife, by doing something forbidden, with some ex she used to get drunk and have cheap sex with. I don't think she expected me to call her again, either.\" \"So…she was using you.\" Elizabeth said. \"And being used like that made you feel…cheap? Devalued? Skanky?\" She looked at him. \"That's…a way of putting it.\" Stefan said. Elizabeth shook her head. \"I really don't like her. Bennie. I've never even met her, and I want to ring her doorbell, and punch her in the face.\" \"Really.\" Said Stefan. He looked at her. \"I see you're eager to get back at these people who've wronged me.\" He bit his lip. \"It certainly makes me feel a lot better about things.\" He hugged her. \"I want it to, Stefan.\" said Elizabeth. \"You're a great guy, and yet you've been treated like crap by all these women. People. Your stepfather. Blane. John. I… I would never treat you like that.\" She looked at him. \"You know that, don't you?\" \"I do.\" Said Stefan. \"And…I've opened…myself to you in a way that I…wouldn't have before. I don't know why. Well, actually, I do. I think you and I have a…connection, that I've never had with anyone before. Not Cynthia. Not Bennie.\" He looked at her. \"I guess that's why you tremble whenever I become…intimate with you.\" He swallowed. \"I think you don't know…the thing is that…whenever you tremble, and…squeak…\" \"It makes you sound like you're having an even worse bout of throat cancer?\" Elizabeth said, still thinking about the 'chipmunk' remarks. \"Such a sweet woman. What did I do to deserve you?\" \"But it does.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Maybe it does.\" Said Stefan. \"But it does because…I can't believe that…a woman…well, not just any woman, you, in particular, would have such a reaction. To me. And every time you do, and every time you tell me how…how you think I'm someone you like, and admire, and who's company you enjoy…who's…worthy…I just…you can't know how it makes me feel. You just can't.\" \"Does it make you afraid?\" Elizabeth said. \"How you feel?\" \"Not at all.\" said Stefan. \"I welcome it.\" Elizabeth swallowed again. \"Well, I…do, too.\" She said. She took a deep breath, swallowing again. \"Stefan, I- \"There it is right now.\" said Stefan. He kissed her lips gently, then looked at her. There was tenderness in his eyes, but the thought invaded Elizabeth's mind that, as usual, his mouth was puckered like he'd swallowed some very bitter medicine. That had made him very drowsy. She bit her lip, shaking that thought off. He kissed her throat gently, and she swallowed, fidgeting even more when she realized that her reactions were exciting him. \"Stefan…\" She said while he was distracted. \"Stefan, I…my father wants to get a new car, now that he can drive again. He wants me to go with him to Joliet this Sunday to help him pick one out. There's a car lot he's heard about there…he thinks he can get a better deal.\" She looked at him. \"Stefan?\" \"Uh huh.\" he said. \"He wants me to go with him this Sunday.\" said Elizabeth, looking at him. \"You already said that, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"Did I?\" said Elizabeth. \"Anyway, just thought you should know.\" Stefan ran his hand down her arm. \"You're trembling, Elizabeth.\" He noted. \"Am I?\" Elizabeth said. \"More so than usual.\" He studied her. \"Are you going to squeak?\" \"Are you going to sound like an anti-smoking PSA? More so than usual, I mean?\" \"Probably.\" Stefan said. \"That depends on how good you are, now, doesn't it?\" Elizabeth had told him that she was going to drive out of town to buy a car with her father the following Sunday, when, in reality, she was attending Amy, her friend and coworker's, wedding. It was a backyard wedding, and there were not that many people there. Elizabeth was on her way to the bathroom, inside the house, which belonged to Amy's parents, when she ran into Amy. \"Hey.\" Elizabeth said. \"Congratulations.\" \"Thanks.\" Amy said. \"Yeah, we're going to live here for awhile, Neal and I. In the pool house. Did you see it?\" \"No.\" said Elizabeth. \"Well, my parents fixed it up pretty nice. Just until we can get our own apartment, of course.\" \"Of course.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Yeah.\" She looked down, \"Are you okay?\" Amy asked her. Elizabeth shrugged. \"I guess. I don't know.\" \"You came alone?\" Amy said. \"Yeah.\" Elizabeth said. \"Where's your…you know? The lawyer?\" \"Stefan is…I didn't ask him to come.\" \"Why not?\" \"I don't know. I…he doesn't do too well, with…social interaction.\" \"Oh come on.\" Said Amy. \"That's ridiculous. He's a lawyer.\" \"Yeah, well.\" Said Elizabeth. \"He's a lawyer who doesn't do too well with social interaction. Or like to be around people all that much. Except…\" \"Except you?\" Amy said. Elizabeth sighed. She shook her head, looking gloomy. \"That's why you didn't invite him?\" said Amy. \"Because he doesn't like social interaction? Because neither does Neal, you know.\" She lowered her voice to a whisper. \"I practically had to beg him not to make our wedding a Vegas wedding. You have to make them do these things.\" \"Yes, well…it's not just that. I feel like…he's…more than I can handle. I just…can't deal with the intensity of him, you know?\" She shook her head, swallowing. \"I don't know.\" \"Intensity can be pretty cool.\" Said Amy. \"Don't you think?\" \"Yeah, but…I'm going to hurt him.\" Elizabeth said. \"Maybe I want to get out, before I can hurt him. He's been hurt enough already.\" \"So you're going to solve the problem of not hurting him by breaking up with him?\" Amy said. \"I don't know, Elizabeth…that sounds like a pretty flimsy excuse to me.\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"To do what, Amy?\" \"I don't know…to run from your problems? I mean, you said the only reason you want to break up with him is because he's too intense.\" \"Yeah…\" \"So you didn't bring him with you because you were planning to like…never see him again?\" \"I don't know about never. But I'm feeling…overwhelmed. I don't know if I can handle all he…wants from me.\" Said Elizabeth. \"And…I don't know…do you think people can tell he's older than me?\" \"Elizabeth. Nobody cares about stuff like that.\" Amy said. \"Don't tell me that's why you didn't bring him.\" \"I don't know.\" Elizabeth said, pressing her fingers to her temples. \"I really don't know what's wrong with me.\" \"Well,\" Amy said, shrugging her shoulders. \"You'll figure it out. Want to see the pool house?\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Sure.\" she said. Awhile later, Elizabeth was sitting at a table, looking off into the distance, when Toby sat down next to her. \"Hey.\" he said. \"Where's the funeral?\" Elizabeth cut a glance at him, and sniffed, shaking her head. She moved a fork on the table around disconsolately. \"Speaking of funerals,\" Toby said. \"I happened to notice that there aren't any…embalmed people around. What happened?\" \"He's not dead, Toby.\" Elizabeth said. \"Just…heavily sedated.\" \"Well, why isn't he here, being heavily sedated, then?\" \"I don't know.\" Elizabeth said. \"Because…I'm not very bright.\" \"Oh, come on.\" said Toby. \"You are.\" \"I…I just don't even…know who I am any more.\" Elizabeth said. \"I'm not sure who I ever was.\" \"I guess…\" said Toby. \"that you most definitely don't want to meet Amy's brother-in-law, then?\" \"I met him.\" Elizabeth said. \"And…?\" \"He's a nice guy. He's okay.\" Elizabeth said. \"But he's not Stefan.\" \"Yeah.\" Toby said. \"I'm pretty sure he's still alive.\" \"Well, I always thought the world would be a better place if there were more dead lawyers.\" Elizabeth said. \"But Stefan proves that dead lawyers can still be walking around, practicing law.\" Elizabeth said, and burst into tears. Toby cleared his throat. \"Elizabeth…\" He looked at her. \"Are you okay?\" He sighed. \"Maybe it's my fault. Look, I don't really care if you and Stefan want to have some weird, May-December, uh…arrangement. I just…hate to see you with some…unworthy candidate, that's all. I didn't want to push you into- \"Toby,\" Elizabeth said, blinking at him in irritation. \"I don't need your blessing.\" \"Okay.\" Toby said. \"And that was the most…backhanded apology I've ever heard.\" \"Okay. I'm…sorry, okay?\" Toby said. \"I'm just…sorry, then.\" \"I think you have some serious issues to work out.\" She said. \"Maybe you're right.\" said Toby. \"But then…who among us doesn't?\" said Elizabeth. She looked at him. \"Myself included.\"[Chapter 8] Later that evening, Elizabeth let herself into Stefan's apartment with a key that she had. She stepped inside, noticing that all the lights were off. She flicked one of the light switches. It wouldn't come on. \"Huh.\" She said. She walked into the living room. \"Stefan?\" she said. She walked into the kitchen, and spotted him, sitting at the kitchen table. \"Stefan.\" She said. \"What's going on? Why are you here in the dark?\" \"The power went off in the building, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"Downed power line.\" \"Oh.\" Elizabeth said. She held out a takeout box to him. \"I brought you a…dinner. It…it doesn't have any…nuts, or shellfish, or tomato products.\" She looked around the room worriedly. \"How…long have you been in here?\" \"Why don't you put that box over there on the counter, Elizabeth?\" said Stefan. \"I'm just not very hungry, right now.\" \"Oh. Okay.\" Elizabeth said. She walked over to the counter, setting it down. \"So. How was the wedding?\" Stefan said. Even in the dark, she could feel his eyes on her, in a penetrating gaze. \"Damn it.\" Elizabeth said. She shook her head. \"I might have known.\" She said. She walked over to him, hands on hips. \"How did you find out?\" \"Oh, I called your father, of course. I told him that the film version of Dreamcatcher came on TV tonight, and that you might want to see it with me, since I know how much it tickles you to compare me to the malevolent alien character. Or at least that was what we could have done, if the power wasn't out. He told me that he does, in fact, plan to buy a car, but will be going next week, and truly, has no need of your support making deals at car lots, he is, after all, an attorney, but also of course, he feels that he should be doing more things on his own at this point, as grateful as he is for all your help.\" said Stefan. \"I of course asked him, if you weren't with him, where exactly he believed you were, and he said not to worry, you were at your coworker's wedding.\" Elizabeth sighed. \"I might have known something like this would happen. In fact, I should have been counting on it, with you.\" \"So. I was alone here. In the dark, of course. I'm afraid of the dark. I don't suppose I ever told you that. I get…night terrors, sometimes. And you weren't here. Oh well.\" Elizabeth swallowed, but then shook her head. \"You know, maybe you should see a doctor, because that condition of yours could get a whole lot worse.\" \"Night terrors?\" \"That, and being a intrusive, browbeating prick.\" She sat down in the chair across from him. \" 'Intrusive'? You lied to me, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"You picked the wrong person to screw over, I'll tell you that.\" \"Screw over. Please.\" Elizabeth said. \"So. Since you lied to me, I'm only going to assume that you were at the aforementioned wedding with someone else. Toby?\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"No. Not Toby. I'm not interested in him anymore.\" She shook her head. \"In fact, I'm not even sure I like him at all now, as anything.\" \"Someone else then.\" Stefan said. \"No.\" Elizabeth said. \"There's no one else.\" \"Please.\" Stefan said scornfully. \"There isn't anyone else.\" Elizabeth said. \"Sometimes I…I wish there was someone else. But there isn't. Only you.\" \"You wish there was someone else.\" Stefan repeated flatly. \"Why?\" Elizabeth sighed. \"Because…I…I tremble, and turn red, and…squeak, when you're around. And that scares me.\" She swallowed hard. \"Because…because I'm more like Toby than I care to admit. Afraid to feel. Or maybe I'm afraid to feel anything for anyone other than Toby, I don't know. But I do.\" \"What kind of nonsense is this, Elizabeth?\" Stefan said. \"Do you really think I'd fall for this…garbage? What on earth are you talking about?\" \"I'm afraid.\" Said Elizabeth. \"Of me.\" \"Of how…you make me feel, Stefan.\" Said Elizabeth. \"I've never…felt about anyone the way I do about you. I mean, I…I was rolling my eyes at you since before I met you, that's how much you annoy me. You think you've got a world of knowledge I don't have, you're always correcting me, you sound like Jeff Goldblum on quaaludes, and- \"It so happens, I have a very attractive voice, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"For a coma patient with lung cancer.\" Elizabeth said. \"All right, that's enough .\" Stefan said, affronted. \"You know, I now realize your 'condition' is ten times worse than Andie's ever was. At least she never said anything like that to me.\" \"Oh, it's a joke.\" said Elizabeth. \"You should know I don't mean it. Well, maybe not the lung cancer part. I think we can keep the coma patient part.\" \"I'm touched.\" Stefan said sarcastically. \"I thought you'd be.\" Elizabeth said. Stefan shook his head. \"Well, no.\" he said. \"As it happens, I'm not, especially because…well, because I do have an attractive voice. Cynthia thought so. And Bennie. As did many women I've dated. As do you. You think so as well. But you are just so …neurotic- \"This from the guy who hates himself so much, he can't even stand to be called by his own first name?\" \"You are just so neurotic,\" Stefan repeated. \"That you can't even stand to admit that my voice turns you on. Or anything about me turns you on, most of the time.\" He glanced at her, and then shook his head. \"That's why, when I touch you, you fling my hand away, and tell me I sound like I have throat cancer.\" Elizabeth sniffed. \"Stefan- \"But it doesn't matter anyway. I'm not the one you really want. I never was. That was always Toby, wasn't it? I'm your second choice.\" \"No, you're not.\" Elizabeth said, placing his hand on hers. Stefan drew his hand away. \"I am. You had to be dragged into having anything to do with me. You had to be dragged by me. By your father.\" He gave a short bark of laughter. \"You even had to be dragged by Toby.\" Elizabeth bit her lip. \"I was a different person back then, Stefan. I had to be dragged, but I came to my senses.\" She moved her chair closer. \"I came to you of my own volition, after I came to my senses, and I…want you now. I care about you. I have feelings for you…like I've never had for anyone else in my whole…life. Even Toby. I- \"Even Toby?\" Stefan said. He frowned deeply, swallowing hard, and in the dim light that the streetlamp in the kitchen window provided, she could see him staring in her eyes, looking angry. \"You…have stronger feelings for me than you ever did for Toby? That's what you're purporting to tell me?\" \"No, that's what I am telling you.\" Elizabeth said. \"Not 'purporting'. I never wanted anybody…like I want you. The feelings that I once had for Toby don't even come close to the ones I have for you, Stefan.\" \"You're trying to tell me that…you…you have more feeling for me than you do than the man that you…waited for for years, that you tolerated…cheating, and lying, and wouldn't stop loving, even when he told you in no uncertain terms that he didn't want to be with you?\" \"That wasn't love.\" Elizabeth said. \"That was childish stubbornness. That was refusal to accept the truth. But yes. I have more feeling for you than I ever did for him.\" She gazed at him, refusing to look away. \"Don't tell me that, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said, swallowing. He looked at her, his mouth turned down, shaking his head sadly. \"Why not?\" Elizabeth said. \"Because it isn't true. It- \"It is true.\" Elizabeth said. \"It is.\" \"No, it's a lie.\" Stefan said. \"You lied to me once already.\" \"It's not a- \"Let me tell you something, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said quietly. \"I…was here, tonight, in the dark…and when I found out…that you had lied to me, I assumed that you were with someone else, though your father said he doubted it, when I spoke with him. And maybe you weren't. It doesn't really matter, though. You lied to me, and you clearly…your neglecting to tell me about this wedding, or want me with you….indicates that…you don't want me in your life. You should have said so. Instead of lying.\" \"I do want- \"But that doesn't matter.\" said Stefan. \"The moment I found out that you lied to me, I had already come to the conclusion that…that you simply aren't the person I thought you were. And the person I thought you were was very flawed. But…\" He shook his head. \"I've already…I already have…come to the rightful conclusion about you. You're a liar.\" \"I am not. There's no such thing as a person who never- \"And,\" said Stefan, looking at her pointedly. \"It would…it would be best if you didn't say to me that you…want me more than you ever did Toby.\" \"Why not, Stefan?\" said Elizabeth quietly, looking at him. \"Because it's a lie. Because you don't mean it.\" Stefan said. He squeezed his eyes shut, shaking his head. \"And I'll believe you. I would believe you. I would…I want in the worst way to believe, that, Elizabeth, but…\" He shook his head. \"If you tell me that, and it's a lie, I just…couldn't take it. It would kill me, if it wasn't true.\" His voice dropped so that she could barely understand him. Her eyes filled with tears. \"Oh, Stefan.\" She said. She put his hand against her heart. \"I do mean it.\" She said. \"I really do.\" He drew it away. \"No.\" he said. She moved her chair closer. \"Stefan, I'm sorry.\" She said. She took his hand, and this time, he did not move it away. \"You know, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"I…every time you…look at me in the way you do, or tremble when I touch you…it's… You once told me that you thought I was so handsome, you could cry. And I…it obviously took a lot of…courage for you to say that. For you to. As dead set as you were against having anything to do with anyone but Toby. So I knew…that you must have meant it. And I was never so…I was…\" He shook his head. Elizabeth gazed at him. \"You were never so what, Stefan?\" \"Grateful.\" Stefan said. \"I was never so grateful. And I'm…I'm always grateful when I'm around you. When you act jealous when I tell you about Andie, or Bennie, or Cynthia, or anyone else. For just a touch from you...and I'm not talking about the overtly sexual ones. I'm talking about...about the ones like the one you made just a second ago. Or right now.\" He squeezed her hand. \"My mother was never a terribly affectionate woman in my childhood, or any other time, and as a result of that, I've longed for...It'd sicken you to know how much I appreciate any affection from you whatsoever, in fact.\" Elizabeth caressed his hand. \"Oh, Stefan.\" she said softly. Stefan looked at her. seriously \"And I didn't...think, Elizabeth that...whenever you're with me, part of me thinks that...you don't truly, in your heart of hearts, want to be there. But you are. And I'm always afraid, Elizabeth, that when you leave, you're...\" He shook his head. \"That you're not ever going to come back. That...that Toby will somehow convince you he wants you back, and you'll go back to him.\" He swallowed. \"Of course, it'd be a lie, because he's a consummate liar, with no capacity for caring about you or anyone, and he'd find some excuse to turn you loose again. But for the moment you'd be convinced.\" Elizabeth made a small noise of dismay, squeezing her eyes shut, because though it was in no way true that she'd ever wanted to go back to Toby at any time while she was with Stefan, she had in fact, been almost convinced, in part due to things Toby had said, that maybe their relationship couldn't work. She kept silent, however, and continued to sit there with her hands over his. \"But then...\" said Stefan softly. \"it doesn't happen. You always keep coming back. And I'm always...so grateful for that, too.\" Elizabeth bit her lip. \"Well- \"And you're right.\" Stefan said. \"I've never…I've never been comfortable with myself. Part of me thinks that I…that no matter how…\" He shook his head, his eyes filling with despair. \"Stefan?\" Elizabeth said. She moved her chair next to his and put her arm around him. \"What is it?\" \"When I was…in high school.\" Stefan said in such a low voice, that Elizabeth had to listen closely to hear. \"I was at our senior prom. And Blane…had been broken up with his girlfriend, as a result of my…input. And I came up to him, and laughed about it, because…well, I was a self-centered, spiteful creep- \"But you're not now.\" Elizabeth interrupted. \"And,\" Stefan continued. \"He told me that the reason Andie never liked me was because she thought I was shit. And he said that, deep down, I knew that she was right. And I did. And I think that pretty well sums up how I've always felt about myself. I'm a lawyer now, a first-rate one. And one who has a good relationship with the people I work with. And tries to have a good relationship with every person I encounter, in fact. And to not be…to not be a liar. To be a truthful person. But even though I know I'm not the same person I was when I was young, part of me will always feel…as though I have no value as a person. Even though I know I do.\" \"I see.\" said Elizabeth. \"But you tell me that I have tremendous value as a person, and that people don't appreciate me enough, and that I have so much…inside, to offer you.\" said Stefan. \"And no one…in my life…has made me feel good about myself in the way that you do, Elizabeth. Ever.\" \"Good.\" Elizabeth said. \"Good?\" Stefan said. \"No, Elizabeth. It's not good. Because…you call me a…a corpse, and a stiff, and dull, and all of that, and it's all a big joke, but the opposite is true. Inside, I'm...I figured that tonight, I'd come to the conclusion that you don't care for me, are willing to lie to me, and would rather I not be a part of your life. And I just…you don't know how devastated I would be, if that were true. Of course, the lights would come back on, most likely, and I would go to bed, and get up, and go to work, same as ever. But…I wouldn't be the same inside. You would just be one more woman I loved that disappointed me, but you would also be more.\" \"Why?\" Elizabeth said. \"Because…\" He sighed, and shook his head. \"Blane said to me that- \"Oh, Stefan.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Listen. I think you take yourself way too seriously. Like the thing about Bennie and the seafood place. I don't think she deliberately gave you the number of a seafood place, just to screw with you. That had nothing to do with anything. She gave you the wrong number because she was an adulterous, sociopathic whore.\" \"Well, that may be.\" Said Stefan. \"But the other I said about her was true. She thought nothing of using me to get back at her husband, because she thinks I'm…morally bankrupt, anyway.\" \"You know what, Stefan?\" Elizabeth said. \"I think…you really give off signals to others that you feel this way about yourself, that you're just not…worthy, when of course the opposite is true, and they pick up on them.\" She hesitated. \"I think you might…carry yourself a certain way, I mean…besides being…introverted. That suggests that you don't like yourself. That…you're uncomfortable, maybe because of your stepfather treating you the way he did, or…\" She shrugged helplessly. \"You can tell these things about…about people. Sometimes.\" she said quietly. \"It's psychological.\" \"Yes, well.\" Stefan said. \"You interrupted me. I was going to say about Blane- \"Blane again?\" \"Yes.\" Said Stefan. \"What Blane said to me at our prom. It hurt me very deeply.\" \"No kidding.\" Elizabeth said. \"You're right. He was a hateful coward.\" \"Even though there was some truth in it.\" said Stefan. \"But what hurt the most was that I realized he was just…waiting for an excuse to say something like that to me for years. And to trash our friendship. I could tell. He was insecure about his relationship with a girl who he thought our group wouldn't approve of…and he listened to what one of the most insecure people around had to say. And he had known me since elementary school. He knew the problems I had…and he didn't care about me enough to tell me to just shut up. Nobody ever did.\" He looked at her. \"Except for you, Elizabeth.\" \"That's a very enjoyable activity.\" said Elizabeth. \"Of course, it goes without saying that I've been a much more mature, experienced individual the whole time I've known you, and the times you've scoffed at what I've said…were without provocation, since you could do with some advice. You've been very confused. Willfully so, to some degree. About Toby.\" Elizabeth looked down at her lap. \"Yeah.\" She said. \"When I first met you,\" Stefan said. \"You started off right away by lying to me, Elizabeth.\" \"And you started off by calling me a liar.\" \"Because you lied.\" Said Stefan. \"And you lied to me again. I can't abide liars. Nothing could hurt me more than you lying to me, Elizabeth. And for what reason?\" He looked at her. \"If you're really not cheating on me, then what possible reason would you have to lie to me? To not want me with you at this friend's wedding?\" \"I…\" She shook her head. \"I'm…I…was…\" She looked at him. \"I was embarrassed.\" \"By me?\" said Stefan. \"What possible reason would you have to be embarrassed by me, Elizabeth?\" \"I'm not embarrassed by you.\" Elizabeth said. \"I'm…embarrassed by myself.\" \"Really.\" Stefan said. \"Were you, yourself, present at this wedding?\" \"Yes, but- \"Then I don't see how you were embarrassed by yourself. You brought yourself there, and were able to stand it, weren't you?\" \"I was still…\" She shook her head. \"You're going to hate me.\" \"I won't hate you, Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"I might dislike you. But I don't hate.\" \"Comforting.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But here goes. I…everyone, Amy, Toby, everyone I work with...probably everyone I work with and their relatives…knows that for years, I was fixated on this one guy. They know I waited until I got to college to have a boyfriend just because of him, and that I put up with his…philandering, and that I was…familiar with his day-to-day…I used to…follow him. Not all the time. Just when I thought he was with other women. Which he was.\" \"Uh huh.\" said Stefan. \"And they know that nobody, even he, understood why I still kept chasing him, and still wanted to…was dedicated to helping him run the bakery, and…everyone just thought I was a deranged, pathetic, obsessed nutcase. Because I guess I'd…sort of let myself become one.\" Stefan shook his head, looking at her sympathetically. \"Elizabeth- \"And I…I know that's what everyone thinks.\" She sniffed, and tears filled her eyes. \"Even…even my dad. Even- \"Even who, Elizabeth?\" Stefan bit his lip, looking at her. He took her hand. She hung her head. \"And…and I- \"Not me.\" Stefan said quietly. \"I would never- \"And,\" Elizabeth continued. \"Knowing that they all knew this…at the wedding…I…\" She trailed off, looking at him, tears pooling her eyes. \"I…\" She sniffed. \"I thought that they would see me with a…\" She shook her head. \"With a what, Elizabeth?\" She sighed. \"With someone who's...so much older, and they'd all think I make the most bizarre choices, and I knew that…they'd all think I was transferring my…obsession to an older…odd…\" \"Odd?\" Stefan said, looking at her incredulously. \"Yes, I mean…\" She shook her head. \"I knew you'd be very, stiff, and formal, and…maybe….sneezing, it was an outdoor wedding, and…\" She swallowed, looking at him. \"You can be a bit socially awkward. And I thought that they'd be judging me. Because of that. That I'm crazy, and have found someone…who's a bit of a…social misfit to be with.\" She looked at him apprehensively. \"I even maybe thought they'd think since you're older, and I was so….blindly, girlishy devoted to Toby at one time, that they'd think I'd…I'd found someone to…control me. They'd all be worried about me. Think I was in your thrall.\" \" 'Thrall'?\" Stefan repeated, shaking his head. \"Well, you'd likely be ordering me around in front of them. Of course I'd put you in your place, and swiftly…but…\" She shook her head. \"I thought they might think…it was very different when we're alone. That you control me.\" \"Elizabeth.\" Said Stefan. \"I always say that lie is the worst thing someone can do…but now I'm not so sure.\" \"Stefan,\" Elizabeth said. \"I don't think you're a social misfit. But I…I let myself get these…ideas.\" \"You're embarrassed by me.\" Stefan said. \"And that hurts, Elizabeth. No matter how idiotic and convoluted your reasoning may be.\" He glared at her. \"No, I'm embarrassed by me.\" Elizabeth said. \"The problem is me. I know I'm a crazy, screwed up, selfish person.\" \"Which is another way of saying you're embarrassed by me.\" Stefan said. \"And you looked at me Friday, and told me a lie, and then made love to me. And you did it deliberately, too.\" \"Made love to you deliberately?\" \"Yes.\" said Stefan. \"You…you made love to me to distract me. And did so with full intent. Even your lovemaking is a lie, it seems.\" He shook his head. \"My lovemaking isn't a lie.\" Elizabeth said. \"That's stupid. And…it seemed to be pretty good.\" She looked at him, her tongue to one side. \"Your throat condition sounded positively…terminal during.\" \"I wouldn't say anything like that to me right now if I were you, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"Ooh, so threatening. I'm so scared.\" Elizabeth said. \"What do you plan to do? Set me on fire?\" \"Well, that just makes it all the worse, doesn't it, Elizabeth?\" Stefan said angrily. \"That we made that strong of a connection, and it was all a lie.\" \"It wasn't a lie. I…it was…I was thinking about it ever since. About you. And me. And how close I…felt to you the last time I saw you.\" She shook her head. \"And I'm afraid of hurting you, when you've been hurt so much in your life. So I was overwhelmed.\" \"You were afraid of hurting me, but then saw fit to do exactly that?\" \"I just…I felt overwhelmed by how…deep my feelings for you are.\" Stefan put his head in his hands, and shook his head. \"Elizabeth- \"I know it's stupid.\" Elizabeth said. \"I…screwed up, okay? What do you want from me? I can be very…idiotic sometimes. And I really am afraid of hurting you.\" She shook her head. \"Of course, it doesn't help that you have an infinite persecution complex.\" \"Can you just be contrite for more than half a minute, Elizabeth?\" said Stefan. \"Or is that too much to ask?\" \"Well, you do.\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, no I don't, but even assuming I did, your behavior tonight would still be unacceptable.\" said Stefan. \"You lied to me. Because I embarrass you, apparently.\" \"I said I was sorry.\" Elizabeth said. \"For lying. And for being…for thinking about what people would think, rather than…what's real.\" She took his hand. \"But it is very real, Stefan. What we have.\" Stefan shook his head. \"You should find someone who doesn't embarrass you. Who you don't have to worry about being in ah…thrall to, Elizabeth.\" \"Stefan- \"Maybe you should just find someone your own age, Elizabeth, if that's a concern.\" said Stefan. \"Having to admit I have more…life experience than you've had.\" \"I had a guy my own age.\" Elizabeth said. \"And he was…well, I wouldn't say he's a sociopath exactly, but he's not the best person, that's for sure. And no, he doesn't really care about me at all, when it comes right down to it. And he certainly never loved me.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"I don't want a guy my own age.\" she said. \"I want you.\" \"That's lovely, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"Of course, I'm sure you'll see your way to mentioning the fact that I'm older than you, every ten minutes.\" \"Only if it's relevant.\" Elizabeth said. \"Uh huh.\" Stefan said crossly. \"Could you at least try to cut it down to once a day?\" \"Once an hour?\" Elizabeth said. \"I guess that'll do.\" Stefan said, shaking his head. Elizabeth laughed. \"Are we sure you're not settling?\" Stefan said. \"I mean, you didn't spend years waiting for me, like you did- \"I don't want to hear about Toby.\" Said Elizabeth. \"And is that something that really bothers you? Do I really have to have waited years for you for it to mean to you that I love you?\" \"No.\" Stefan said quietly. \"Just not…leave me behind when you go to weddings. Alone. In the dark.\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Boy, you really know how to make a person feel guilty, don't you?\" she said. \"Wouldn't you know it, the lights would be off, too. Just to make me feel worse.\" \"Just to make you feel worse?\" Stefan said. \"How do you think it made me feel? I was all alone, in the dark, and you weren't here, Elizabeth.\" He shook his head. \"I know.\" Elizabeth said quietly. She squeezed his hand. \"I wouldn't use that word you used, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"Lightly.\" \"What word?\" Elizabeth said. She looked at him. \"You mean…love?\" \"Like everyone these days, you're so casual about it.\" Stefan said. \"I bet you tell…customers at the bakery that. And use it to sign…greeting cards. And use it to describe your affinity for Stephen King novels. Takes a little of the meaning out, don't you think?\" He looked at her. \"Or even a lot of the meaning, I'd say.\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"Sorry, I lost track at 'everyone these days'. By that, I'm assuming you meant everyone my age .\" She looked at him pointedly. \"No, people of all ages, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"Uh huh.\" \"But gracious of you to remind me that we're different ages. I know you wouldn't want me to forget that.\" \"No, I wouldn't.\" Elizabeth said. She shook her head. \"I think that sounds like a lot of sanctimonious b.s. to cover up the fact that you just don't want to say it.\" \"Again, you assume me to be as much of a liar as everyone else is.\" \"No, but you are a lawyer .\" Elizabeth said. \"You must think I just fell off the turnip truck if you expect me to believe you don't know how to sling a little b.s. from time to time.\" \"We've been over this, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"As I've said many times, I leave that part of the job completely behind when I leave the office.\" \"Well, okay then.\" Elizabeth said. \"If that's the case, you must be able to admit that you don't want to say it. It's okay. You certainly wouldn't be alone in that. Most guys don't.\" \"I am far superior to most males, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"Most people, in fact.\" \"Okay, Stefan dear.\" Elizabeth said. \"I certainly am glad to see you're feeling better about yourself. After Blane and the rest worked you over, I was worried that maybe you suffered from some kind of low self-esteem problem, but I'm glad to see that's been remedied.\" She rolled her eyes. \"I mean what I say, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"About being superior to everyone?\" said Elizabeth. \"I'm sure of it.\" \"About everything, Elizabeth. I never lie.\" \"Well, isn't that just ducky.\" Elizabeth said. \"That makes you truly pleasant to live with, by the way. Never, ever lying. Not even to not insult someone, even your girlfriend.\" She shook her head. \"It's a good thing that I…\" She bit her lip, trailing off. \"A good thing you what, Elizabeth?\" said Stefan. \"Oh, never mind. I wouldn't want to toss it out casually or anything, contributing to deep societal ills.\" She shook her head. \"I'm really glad you're such an upstanding crusader for meaning. Especially since I really would be made to feel uncomfortable by the reality of hearing anything…demonstrative or romantic coming out of your dreary- \"I love you, Elizabeth.\" Stefan interrupted. \"And it is a good thing I do as well, because you've achieved quite an impressive number of insulting remarks directed towards me in the course of our relationship.\" \"Well, you said I have the courage to stand up to you, unlike our old pal Blane, and you like that. I aim to please.\" \"I know I said that.\" said Stefan. \"One more thing I've said in life that I regret.\" \"Don't be too hard on yourself, Steff.\" Elizabeth said. \"Let me do that for you.\" \"I'll thank you not to call me 'Steff', Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"It reminds me of my former self. And I assure you, I'm a much more together person than 'Steff' ever was.\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"And I'll still love you whether you're Steff, or Stefan.\" she said, looking up at the ceiling. \"Because…you'll…still be a…\" She bit her lip, and shook her head, looking off into the distance. \"You're lolling your tongue around again, Elizabeth.\" Stefan said. \"You'll always be a droning unpleasant stiff. To me.\" Elizabeth said. \"Uh huh.\" said Stefan. He shook his head. Elizabeth sighed, and looked up at the celing.\"You'll always be a really kind, generous, upright uh…truthful…irritatingly so…person. Most of the time.\" She bit her lip. \"Who's been very good to me. And who's my first choice to be with.\" she said firmly, looking him directly. \"And who I admire, Stefan.\" She hesitated for a minute. \"And deep down, you know…you know that I'm right.\" She gazed at him. \"I…\" Stefan looked at her for a minute, and then reached over and embraced her wordlessly. They stayed that way, together, for several moments, in the dark. Elizabeth stroked his back, and looked out the window at the light from the streetlamp. Stefan pulled away after a minute, and sniffed. \"Allergies.\" He said. \"Of course.\" said Elizabeth. \"It is. You're wearing perfume again.\" He shook his head crossly. \"I washed it off.\" Elizabeth said. She looked at him, lolling her tongue. \"But it could be some minute traces. Goodness knows, I hope so. I mean the last thing I want to see in the world is a guy such as yourself- \"All right, Elizabeth. Have your little joke, as usual.\" Said Stefan. \"But just know,\" he said, taking her hand, and patting it. \"that there's not a snide remark in the world that could ruin…what you said.\" He took her other hand, and held it, smiling at her. Elizabeth smiled and shook her head. \"You know,\" said Stefan after a minute. \"A minute ago, you used the phrase, 'isn't it just ducky?' I went to school with a guy called that.\" \"What, ducky?\" Elizabeth said. \"That was his name?\" \"That was his nickname, Duckie. Phil. I believe was his real name.\" \"Were the two of you friends? You and…Phil?\" \"No, I didn't know him that well.\" Stefan said. He shook his head. \"He did feel that he knew me well enough to tackle me in the hallway one time, though, and start a fight.\" \"What had you done to him, to provoke this reaction, Stefan?\" Elizabeth said. \"Elizabeth!\" Stefan said, shaking his head in amazement at her. \"That's some loyalty, to someone you claim to love. Whose side are you on, anyway?\" \"I'm on uh…Duckie's side, Stefan. I mean, anyone nicknamed Duckie would probably have received his fair share of bullying from a guy such as yourself, Stefan.\" \"I'm very hurt you'd say such a thing.\" Stefan shook his head in irritation. \"As a matter of fact, I'm haven't the foggiest idea what I did to Phil to set him off.\" He sighed. \"But it was probably something.\" \"Indeed.\" \"That doesn't mean you should say it.\" Stefan shook his head. \"Now that I think about it, though.\" he said reflectively, after a moment. \"It was probably over Andie. She and…Blane had had a big fight in the hallway that day. Everyone saw them.\" \"And this made Phil angry because…\" Elizabeth shook her head. \"Don't tell me.\" \"I seem to remember they were friends.\" said Stefan. \"In fact, they showed up at our prom together…but she left with Blane later. Of course.\" \"And Phil was none too happy about that, I bet.\" Elizabeth said. \"I'm guessing he felt compelled to defend her honor from old throat cancer?\" Elizabeth said, lolling her tongue. Stefan bit his lip, looking at her. He shook his head slowly. \"What did this chick have?\" Elizabeth said. \"Sounds like everyone and their brother was fighting over her.\" \"Well, Elizabeth, she had a great many things going for her.\" said Stefan. \"One of them being, as I recall, that she never referred to me as 'old throat cancer'.\" He shook his head. \"As I said earlier, I thought she was a complete pugilistic bitch, but you at times make her seem positively angelic.\" \"Uh huh.\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, maybe you should go be with her then. See if you can look her up.\" \"I would, Elizabeth, but- He shook his head. \"You ask what she had that made men fight over her, and…drive friends apart.\" He shook his head. \"She always wore pink. And she looked very good in it. It went well with her…red hair, I suppose.\" Elizabeth made a derisive noise. \"Well, why don't you and the redhead- \"And at the prom, Elizabeth, she wore…a pink dress. And she looked…radiant in it. Enough so that all the guys there were looking at her, even though…it certainly wasn't the most…expensive, nor, truly the most…flattering design I'd seen on a woman, but…\" He shook his head. \"It didn't matter, because there was a certain something about her. She was…a figment. The girl in the pink dress.\" \"I see.\" Elizabeth said. \"A figment.\" \"I never met the girl in the pink dress, Elizabeth.\" said Stefan. \"But for years, I longed to.\" \"Oh.\" Elizabeth said. \"Well, do feel free to continue your search, then.\" \"Well, Elizabeth as mixed a fortune as it might be, I've found something better than the girl in the pink dress.\" He patted her hand. \"What's that?\" \"You, of course.\" said Stefan. \"Oh.\" said Elizabeth. She cleared her throat.\"Oh.\" She looked down at the floor. He rolled his eyes, shaking his head. \"Oh, and I'm…sorry about the 'old throat cancer' thing.\" Elizabeth said. \"Not to mention my defense of Phil. Of course I wasn't seriously taking his side anyway, as I'm sure you know. I was doing it just to needle you.\" \"I was aware of that, Elizabeth.\" said Stefan. \"And in all seriousness,\" Elizabeth said. \"I'm sure Phil was a real jerk, anyway.\" \"Oh, I think he was an okay guy, Elizabeth.\" said Stefan. \"Well, maybe he was.\" Said Elizabeth. \"But from where I stand, I've never even met him, and I know, he's just couldn't be as swell a person as you are, Stefan. Not by a long shot.\" She studied him for a moment. \"You know, maybe I didn't scrub that perfume off as well as I thought I did.\" Stefan shook his head. \"Maybe you did, Elizabeth.\" He said. He put his arm around her. \"Ah.\" Elizabeth said. \"Okay. Could be I did.\" She leaned against his shoulder, and they sat together in the kitchen, in silence, waiting for the lights to come back on.

Constructive criticism is always welcome.nThanks. Weird ChapternOne Vincent stepped out ofnthe airport into the chilled winter air of New York City, suppressingnthe shiver that rose up the back of his spine. He didn't like NewnYork. It wasn't as bad as L.A., but he still didn't care for it.nIn all actuality, he didn't like big cities in general. Peoplendidn't trust each other in cities. Everyone was suspicious. Vincentnlooked as he always did. He wore an expensive gray suit that wasntailored perfectly for his body. His prematurely grey hair wasnsleeked back and his beard was slightly scruffy. He looked like anbusinessman who had just gotten back from a long trip. He headedntoward the row of taxis in front of the airport, hesitating only forna second before climbing into one. He asked the driver to take him tonthe nearest convenience store. It had just started to snow as the cabnpulled to the curb near the badly lit run down building. Vincentnhopped out of the car and hurried inside in search of warmth. He wandered about thenstore gathering the assorted items that he needed. A pack of Dnbatteries, a very large bottle of water, a newspaper, and a pack ofngum. The cashier, a very old Arabian with horrible English, rang upneverything. \"That will ben$13.52.\" he mumbled. Vincent pulled a largenwad of hundreds from his inner jacket pocket and offered one to thenold man. But the old bat shook his head fiercely. \"No one hundreds.nMust be smaller.\" He said. \"But I don't havenanything smaller.\" Vincent said. \"No one hundreds.\"nThe old man said. \"Look, I just wantnmy things. Why can't you just take the money?\" Vincent asked. \"No one hundreds.\"nHe repeated. \"But…\" \"No…\" \"I know! No onenhundreds.\" Vincent snapped. He turned to walk outnthe door but felt someone touch his elbow. He turned around to seenwho it was and came face to face with a petite young girl smilingnbrightly at him. She had strawberry red hair that was hanging justnbelow her shoulders and pretty blue eyes. She was clad in dark tightnfitting blue jeans and a blue jean jacket that was a shade lighternand a dark green scarf wrapped around her neck. She tugged him backnover to the counter and looked at the cashier. \"Throw in a pack anMarlboro Lights.\" She said. The cashier obeyed andnthen said, \"$19.35\" The pretty red headnhanded him a twenty and he gave her a bag and her change. She dug herncigarettes out of the bag and handed it to Vincent. \"MerrynChristmas.\" She said. \"Uh, I can'tnreally pay you back.\" Vincent said. \"Don't worrynabout,\" she said, \"Just uh, help me get a cab without gettingnmugged, raped, or murdered and we'll call it square.\" \"That I can do.\"nHe said. \"I'm Claire.\"nShe said, offering her hand. Vincent shook her handnand then placed it on his arm, \"Vincent.\" \"Well, Vincent,\"nClaire said, her light blue eyes dancing, \"You're not from NewnYork.\" \"No. No, I'm not.\"nVincent said with his charming smile. \"First visit?\" shenasked. \"No.\" Vincentnsaid, \"But, I…\" \"Not a big fan, eh.\" \"It's not mynfavorite place on Earth, no.\" \"Here I thoughtneverybody loved New York.\" \"Most New Yorkers donthink that. I really just don't like big cities.\" They reached thenstreet corner and Vincent held up his hand to hail a taxi. Clairenlaughed, \"Awe, but look at you. You can hail a cab with the best ofn'em.\" \"I don't much carenfor cabs, either.\" Vincent said. \"Why not?\" Clairenasked. \"I just had a reallynbad experience in one.\" Vincent replied, absently fingering hisnchest where he knew a scar to be hidden beneath his shirt. \"Well, I'm gonnanbe late for work.\" She said as she slipped into the backseat of anyellow cab, \"Nice to meet you. Merry Christmas, Vincent.\" \"Happy New Year,nClaire.\" Vincent flashed her another heart stopping smile and shutnher into the car, watching its taillights until they disappearednaround the street corner. Pretty girl. Sweet, too. Claire kept her eyesnlocked on Vincent until he vanished as the cab turned the corner. Henwas such a stunning man. He had gray hair, but his face looked sonyoung. She would be willing to bet that he was in his late thirties,nearly forties tops. He had a gorgeous, slightly crooked smile andnbrilliant blue eyes that would stay with her for a long time to come.nShe figured he was some kind of businessman. He had on a nice suit,nexpensive looking, but he didn't seem too flashy. She had met a lotnof different people in her line of work and she decided he wasn'tnin advertising, he was too subtle. He wasn't an accountant or anlawyer, his beard was too scruffy for that. She would've taken himnfor a stockbroker if he had been a local. He was probably some kindnof closer that corporate thugs send in to bully other companies intonselling out. He had a air of intimidation about him, like he was usednto being in controlling. Totally comfortable with the idea of havingnpeople fear him. Claire took a deep breath and paid the cabby as henstopped outside the club where she worked. Vincent. Oh, she had likednhim. Five minutes with the guy and he had left quite a mark. She blinked herselfnback into the present and rushed to back of the club to get dressednfor work. If she was late, Antonio, her boss, would kill her. Vincent flipped on hisnlaptop and gave the cabby the first address of the night. He wouldnpay the driver and be done with him. He had since given up the ideanof keeping the same cab all through the night. Ever since Max, hencouldn't risk another night like that. That night had done itsndamage. He had changed. He paid the cabby withna hundred and when he had his change handed to him, he couldn'tnhelp but think about how easy that had been. Then the image of Clairenand her pretty smile flashed into his mind, unbidden. He should have offerednto buy her a drink. 'Wait!' Vincentnthought, 'Where the hell did that thought come from?' He was losing it.nPlain and simple. He was losing his mind. He needed to focus on thentarget. Get in, get out, get it over with. He popped his neck,nstraightened his jacket and ran a hand down his tie to smooth it. Henhated ties. Then, he entered the building in a confident stride. Nonone even looked up.[Chapter 2] Author's Note: I'mnnot sure how I feel about this chapter. I am trying to maintain thenflow and feel from chapter one, so please let me know how I am doing.nThanks for the criticism, it is very appreciated and has been takenninto account as I hope you can tell from this next bit. Lastly, cannsomeone explain to me the concept of a Mary Sue? I'm not quite surenI know what it is, but I would like to avoid it since nobody seems tonlike them. Thank you. Don't forget to tell me what you think. ChapternTwo Vincent slipped backnout onto the street. On the twenty third floor of the building behindnhim, through the door of the fourth office on the right, DistrictnAttorney Frank Martin was lying in a heap behind his desk. One in thenhead, two in the chest, no questions. Poor old Frank hadn't evennseemed surprised. Vincent saw a taxi heading his and quickly put twonfingers to his lips and whistled. The car slowed, then stopped andnVincent got in. Three more marks and he was on his way home. Claire stepped outnonto the stage, thankful that the spotlight was blindingly bright andnshe couldn't see the old perverts who were ogling her from thenseats. She moved in rhythm to the music, peeling off her blouse asnshe made her way downstage. She winced as her eyes began to adjust tonthe light and the audience started to come into focus. It wasn't the mostndignified of jobs, hell, she didn't even like doing it. It wasndegrading and it put her on display for the entire world to see andnher mother had raised her to have modesty. But it was good money andnat this particular stage of her life, that was the important thing.nShe slinked around the stage, fighting off the overwhelming feelingsnof disgust every time some man tucked a bill into her garter. Thisnwas not how she imagined her life, but then, how many little girlsnlie in bed at night dreaming of becoming an exotic dancer? It wasnwhat she had for the time being, and she would make the best of it. She recognized StanlynPreswick as soon as he set foot in the club. He was a large round mannwith thinning brown hair and an Armani suit who stank of too muchncologne. He was sweaty and pervy, but he tipped well. And he likednClaire. He was one of her regulars. He stalked up to the stage wavingna twenty between his fingers. Claire gave him access to her garternand saw the smile cross his shiny face. \"Daisy,\" he callednher by her stage name, \"I'll be expecting a dance later.\" Claire put on hernbrightest, not to mention fakest smile and replied, \"Anything fornyou, honey.\" She didn't mention the fact that she got off in lessnthan twenty minutes. Stanly toddled off tonthe VIP room where he would spend the evening getting drunk andnhaving private dances and he wouldn't think of her again. Vincent paid hisndriver and straightened his jacket. His eyes wondered the entrance ofnthe club before him. This guy Preswick was a real pig. Vincent almostnfelt he would be doing the human race a favor by ridding the world ofnhim. He rolled his shoulders back to relieve the tension, then strodenthrough the doors. The interior of thenclub was hazy and the music assaulted his ears. Preswick would benback in the VIP room. He wouldn't be a challenge. But instead ofnheading straight back for his target, his gaze made its way to thenstage. Or more accurately, to the dancer onstage. Claire. He made his way to thenside of the stage. Claire spun on hernheel and ducked her head. When she looked up, she was looking intonthose startling blue eyes from earlier, the ones that had brandednthemselves into her memory. It was Vincent. She was caughtnslightly off-guard, but he merely cocked a sideways smirk at her andnoffered her his hand. She hesitated for anmoment, before sliding her small hand into his larger one. He heldnher fingers to his lips and gently kissed them, before turning andnwalking away from the stage at a fast pace. Claire smiled for anmoment, then looked down at her hand, where he had handed her a onenhundred dollar bill. Unnoticed by the bothnof them was the set of beady little eyes watching the entirenexchange. It took Claire anmoment to fall back into her rhythm. A gorgeous man whom she had metnfor maybe five minutes had just handed her a hundred dollars andnwalked away without a word. Why would someone do that? Why had thatnsmall kiss to her hand affected her so much? Vincent lost his smilenas he made his way back toward the VIP room. What was she doing inna place like this? He couldn't help but think. She just didn'tnbelong. He pushed the thoughtnof her out of his mind as he entered what was the VIP room. A smokeynlittle back room with blue carpet, plush blue furniture, white wallsnand blue tinted lighting. Sitting on one of the chairs with a scotchnin his hand and a blond on his lap, was his mark, Stanly Preswick. \"How ya doin',nStanly?\" Vincent asked, casually taking a seat across from thenlarge man and dainty stripper. \"Who the hell arenyou?\" Stanly hissed. He was unhappy at the interruption. \"Name's Vincent. Inthought you and I might talk a little business.\" Vincent said,nreaching into his inner jacket pocket and withdrawing a large wad ofnbills which he then threw onto the small coffee table which satnbetween them. \"Get rid of the girl.\" Stanly eyed the moneynfor a moment, then smacked the blond on her bottom and said,n\"Cassidy, sweetheart, take a hike. Send Daisy in in half an hour,nokay love.\" \"Sure thing,nStanly.\" Cassidy said as she vacated the room. Stanly took a sip ofnhis scotch. \"So, what is it that you wanted to talk to me about?\" \"I'm just thenmessenger.\" Vincent said, throwing a glance over his shoulder atnthe stage. Claire had disappeared. A tall leggy blond had taken hernplace onstage. \"From who?\" Stanlynasked. Vincent turned hisnsteely blue gaze back to Stanly and said quite simply, \"FromnCurtis.\" Stanly's fingers hadnjust released the glass of alcohol when Vincent fired his trademarknthree shots. The silencer muffled all sound and Vincent had thirtynminutes to get out of there before the next girl came in. Henholstered his gun, tucked his cash back into his pocket, and walkednout of the room, buttoning his jacket back up. Maybe he could getnClaire out for a drink after all. He stepped over to the bar and gotnthe attention of the bartender, a cute little brunette with a largenchest and a tight tee shirt. \"Miss, the woman whonwas just onstage, the red head? Is she still here somewhere?\" henasked. The girl shook hernhead, \"Sorry, doll, she left about five minutes ago. Tony draggednher offstage early. But if you're wantin' a dance, I can arrangenany number of nice girls for you.\" Tony ? Vincentnthought, Who's Tony? \"No, that's all right.\" He saidnto the bartender, \"Thanks anyway.\" \"No problem, baby.\"nShe said and walked away to help a customer.[Chapter 3] Author's Note: Here's chapter three. Many thanks to SpadesJade for the MarynSue definition. I definitely don't see Claire as a Mary Sue. Inthink that Vincent would get annoyed with someone like that reallynquickly, so have no fear. ChapternThree Claire was draggedninto the apartment she shared with Antonio, her boss…oh yeah, andnboyfriend. He had seen her little exchange with Vincent and was nonentoo happy about it. He was convinced that if this guy had just handednher a one hundred dollar bill without even so much as a request for anlap dance, then she must have given him something worth that amountnof money. They had barely stepped through the doorway when Antonionhad grabbed her by the back of the neck and slammed her into thenwall. \"Who the hell wasnthat?\" he screamed. \"Who?\" Clairenreplied. Wrong answer. Antonio slapped hernacross the face, knocking her into a nearby bookshelf. \"Who?\" Antonionrepeated, \"The guy who gave you a wad, that's who! Who is he? Arenyou fucking him?\" \"What?\" Clairenexclaimed. \"Shut the fuck up!nYou know exactly what I'm talking about!\" He raged, grabbing hernby the hair and slinging her across the room. Claire fell to thenfloor, praying that he was satisfied and that he would just leave hernbe. No such luck. He walked over to her and jerked her to her feet. \"So, are you gonnantell me what the fuck that was all about?\" Antonio howled. \"Tony,\" Clairentried to be rational with him, \"you're with me practically allnthe time. What the hell makes you think that I have time to runnaround on you?\" \"Don't lie to me,nbitch!\" he said with a quick backhand across her cheek. \"I'm not lying!\"nClaire exclaimed, stumbling back into the sofa, her hand to her face.n\"I didn't do anything!\" They had been togethernfor three months the first time he had hit her. It'd been about anyear no and he had gotten pretty good about avoiding her face unlessnhe was really pissed. The fact that he didn't seem to be holdingnback at all terrified her. He followed the backhand with a openhandednslap right on her cheekbone and temple, throwing off her equilibriumnand causing her to actually fall over the couch. When she hit thenfloor, she began to crawl desperately away from him and toward thenfar corner of the room. Hadn't he had enough? Couldn't he justnleave her alone, now? \"No guy just givesnthat much money away unless he's expecting something in return.\"nAntonio said, taking a step toward her. Vincent walked intonthe east village apartment building and made his way to the elevator.nIt was late. No one was in the lobby so there was no one for him tonworry about. He took the elevator to the fourth floor. As soon as he steppednoff the elevator, he heard the shouting. A man and a woman. And itnwas coming from his target's apartment. Great , henthought. He was about to walk into a messy situation and make it evennmessier. When he reached the door, he pulled a handkerchief from hisnpocket and turned the doorknob with it. The idiot had left his doornunlocked. However, what metnVincent's gaze when he opened that door was something that he wasngrossly unprepared for. The sight was not annuncommon one. Turn on any episode of Cops and the odds ofnseeing the exact same image was highly likely. A man, in this casenAntonio Bardez, standing over a young woman on the floor nursing anbleeding nose or lip from the blow she had just received. In thisncase, the young woman was none other than Claire and she was nursingnboth a busted lip and nose. Her right eye was also red and puffy andnit didn't take a genius to know that she would have a hell of anshiner in the morning. Antonio stared atnVincent for a moment, recognized him from the club and turned back tonClaire with a scowl and said, \"You gave the bastard our address?\" Claire sat therenlooking terrified and confused. \"No.\" she rasped, and it was thentruth. She hadn't given Vincent their address and she couldn'tnfigure out for the life of her what he was doing there. Vincent gave a lownwhistle as he took in the apartment. \"Nice place, you got here,nAntonio.\" His eyes wandered over the debris of the battle that hadnjust occurred and he commented, \"Needs a little straightening up,nbut other than that…\" \"Then what the fucknis he doing here?\" Antonio screamed at Claire, \"And how does henknow my name? What have you been saying about me?\" The question wasnfollowed by another hard slap across the face. Vincent's jawntightened as he watched this creep hit Claire. \"Didn't yournmother ever teach you never to hit a lady?\" he asked. Antonio didn't get anchance to respond. Vincent had drawn his weapon and taken care of thenmatter. The first shot was fired and Claire began to scream. Onnreflex, the gun was next pointed at her head. Claire stared down thenbarrel of the silenced semi-automatic pistol that Vincent held in hisnhand. Her heart stopped. Her breath caught in her throat choking hernscream into silence. He should kill her. Henknew he should kill her. She had just seen him shoot her boyfriend.nShe had seen him at the club. She seemed like a smart girl, once shenheard about the murder at the club it wouldn't take her long to putntwo and two together. All he needed to do was put a bullet in hernpretty little head and rid himself of the problem. But he couldn't. \"Okay,\" Vincentnsaid, holstering his handgun. \"let's go.\" \"W-w-what?\" Clairenquestioned. He stepped towards her and she recoiled violently intonthe wall. \"Don't kill me!\" she pleaded. \"I'm not gonnankill you, Claire.\" Vincent said as he took her by the upper armsnand pulled her to her feet. She didn't struggle. Shock, Vincent thought, it'll wear off. \"I'm not going to killnyou,\" he repeated, \"but I can't leave you here.\" He supported her withnone arm and with the other he gathered his briefcase, her coat andnbag as they walked through the door. The elevator was taking to longnso he led down the stairwell. Everything began tonsink into Claire's head. Vincent, the handsome man from the streetnand club had just walked into her apartment and shot Antonio threentimes. Now he was dragging her down some back alleyway toward thenstreet. She was surprised she hadn't…no, wait….here it came.nShe doubled over and vomited. Vincent never evennbroke stride. Throwing up was a natural human reaction to what Clairenhad just witnessed. He simply gave more support to her weight andnkept moving, practically carrying her along. He hailed a cab oncenthey reached the street and quickly shoved the young woman in, andncrawled in after her. He told to driver to take them to a hotel andnthen turned to Claire, who had pressed herself completely against thenother side of the car. She was trembling. He knew it was more fromnfear than from the cold, but her draped her coat over her shouldersnanyway. \"Here.\" He said,noffering her his handkerchief. She just stared at it. \"You can usenit to wipe your mouth off.\" He said. Claire hesitantly tooknthe handkerchief from him and cleaned her face off. It was an action.nSomething she could focus on. Something to stop her mind fromnreeling. What was he going to do with her? It took Vincent all ofnfive seconds to check into the hotel. It wasn't a rat hole but itnsure as hell wasn't the Waldorf. He gave the clerk a fake i.d. andncredit card with the matching name and thanked him when he handed himnthe card key to the room. He followed the thanks with a look ofnwarning when he saw the way the young man was eyeing Claire, who wasnstanding tight lipped at his side. The boy snapped his gaze down tonthe counter top as Vincent led Claire away. After taking thenelevator up to the seventh floor of the hotel, Vincent opened thenroom for them. As soon as they were in, Vincent went to work. Henclosed the curtains over the windows, checked the bathroom fornanything that could be used against him, and removed the phone cordsnand tucked them into his pocket. When all this was done, he turned tonClaire, who was staring at her shoes. \"All right, listennup,\" he said, \"I still have some work to do. YOU will stay here,nyou will not leave this room. You will not let anyone else into thisnroom. You will not draw any attention of any kind to yourself. Isnthat understood?\" Claire just stared atnhim. What was she supposed to say? Yes, sir? \"What do you want withnme?\" she breathed. Vincent went on asnthough he didn't hear the question. \"I won't be gone for verynlong and when I get back, you will be here.\" She didn't appear tonbe paying attention, so he took her by the upper arms and forced hernto look him in the eyes, \"Listen to me, Claire. This is verynimportant. If you are not here when I get back, I will find you. Indon't care where you go or who you think can protect you. If younleave this room, I will know and I will find you. Do you believe me?\" Claire nodded. Shenbelieved every word he said and she knew that for now, it wasndefinitely in her best interest not to piss him off. With that, he left.nOnce he was gone, Claire just sat there for a while. She wasndumbfounded. Perhaps, in a state of shock. But it soon wore off andnshe broke down into harsh choking sobs that she was powerless tonstop. Vincent stepped out ofnthe elevator and into the lobby of the hotel. What am I doing? Whyndid I bring her here? Have I lost it? The thoughts just keptncoming, one after another, bombarding him until he couldn't seenstraight. He needed to get away. He needed to go and do his job andnclear his head. He cast the young clerk another look of warning justnin case he had something stupid in mind while he was gone, and thennmade his way outside.[Chapter 4] Author's Note: Well, there was only one review for the last chapter, and thanksnfor that by the way, but here's the next installment anyway. Pleasenreview, I really want to know how this story is being perceived.nWell, thanks and I hope you enjoy! Chapter Four It was the only timenin his life Vincent could remember thinking that a hit had been takenncare of too quickly. It was his last one of the night. Some crackednout loan shark with an attention span problem named Bartleby (yes,nBartleby) Sanchez. A rat that the world was better off without. Thenonly problem was that now that the job was done, he had nothing to donbut go back to the hotel where he had left Claire. He just wasn'tnsure he was ready to go back yet. He still wasn't sure why the hellnhe had put her there in the first place. He had been standingnon the street corner outside of Sanchez's building for about fivenminutes. That was longer than he had stood anywhere since he was innSpecial Forces. He hadn't been able to bring himself to hail a taxinyet. After another long moment, he took a deep breath and held hisnhand out. Just keepnbreathing, he told himself as the bright yellow car came to anstop in front of him. Breathing, after all, was very important. Claire sat in thencorner of the hotel room, her knees tucked under her chin, armsnwrapped around her legs. She had been sitting there since Vincent hadnleft her. She had cried until she felt dehydrated and couldn't crynanymore. She wanted to know why she had been brought to this room.nShe wanted to know why she wasn't dead. She felt as though therenwere an out of control train rampaging through her head. She wantedndesperately to run away, but she hadn't moved. She had barelynfluttered an eyelid for fear of the repercussions if she did. The doorknob turnednand she stopped breathing. Vincent opened thenhotel room door and found Claire huddled in the corner of the roomnlike a beaten dog. He set down the full ice bucket that he had gottennfrom downstairs on the bedside table near where she sat. \"Here.\" He said,n\"For your eye.\" Claire looked back andnforth between Vincent and the ice bucket and then withdrew fromnreality once again. Vincent frowned. \"Ifnyou don't ice it, the swelling is going to be ten times worse.\" This earned him anglare from the pretty red head as she silently reached up andnsnatched a single ice cube which she then proceeded to forcefullynpress against her temple. The sudden sting of cold made her wince. \"Can I get you anrag?\" Vincent asked. Claire said nothing.nVincent shed his jacket after removing the phone cords from hisnpocket and reattaching them to the phone. Claire watched as he dialedna number and booked a first class ticket for the morning to somenplace that she couldn't pronounce in Brazil. At first, she felt anstrong relief that he would be gone the next day, then the idea thatnhe might want to do away with her before he left set in and she thenrelief turned right back into tension. Every muscle in her bodyntightened up and she pulled her legs even closer to her chest. Shendidn't ever notice how hard she had begun pressing the ice cube tonher cheek. Vincent hung up thenphone and looked over to where Claire had still not moved. He fetchedna washcloth from the bathroom and filled it with ice. He then shovednthe rag into Claire's free hand without so much as a word. Claire wasn't surenof what it was that suddenly made her so bold, but she went with itnand spoke. \"Why am I here?\" Vincent paused andnglanced over his shoulder at her. Claire wasn't certain, but shenthought she saw the hint of a smile. \"Because I couldn't leavenyou behind to call the cops.\" He answered. \"Why didn't younjust kill me?\" Claire asked. Good question, Vincent thought. \"Does it matter? Shouldn't you just say thanknyou?\" Despite what she hadnthought earlier about being dehydrated, she felt tears welling up innher eyes. \"I just…I just don't understand what's happening.nYou…you seemed so nice when I met you and then, and then, and thennyou just…show up and…and kill Tony.\" Vincent looked at her.n\"Are you really crying because I killed some no good loser that wasnsmacking you around?\" \"I'm not cryingnbecause of Tony!\" Claire exclaimed, \"Although the image of hisnbrains flying all over my living room wall is certainly gonna sticknwith me for a while.\" Is she having anbreakdown? Vincent thought, What am I supposed to say, now? \"No. I'm cryingnbecause…I'm scared.\" She finished. \"I'm scared of you. I'mnscared of what you're gonna do to me.\" For some reason,nVincent felt the need to put her mind at rest. More than likely henjust wanted to shut her the hell up. \"Look,\" he said,nsitting down in a chair on the opposite side of the room, \"don'tnbe scared. I couldn't leave you behind because I didn't want younto call the police and tip them off. I didn't want to kill younbecause you didn't pose an immediate threat.\" That was a lie. Shenwas, is, and probably always would be a threat. \"Calm down.\"nVincent went on, \"I promise, nothing is going to hurt you tonight.\" Claire stared at himnwith red puffy eyes, but she had stopped crying. \"What aboutntomorrow?\" she rasped. \"Tomorrow,\"nVincent replied, \"I disappear and you never see me again. Now trynand get some sleep.\" He vanished into thenbathroom. Claire stared at the closed door for the longest time,ndetermined not to fall asleep. But, of course, her eyelids keptndropping involuntarily and it wasn't long before her head hadndropped back against the wall and her breathing slowed. Back at Claire'snapartment building, Raphael Bardez stumbled down the hallway to hisnbrother's door. He still fuzzy from shooting up earlier, but knewnhe was about to come down. He needed Antonio to hook him up with somenmore. Antonio would take care of him. He always did. Raphael got to thendoor and pounded on it. \"Eh, Tony! It's Raph, open up!\" There was no answer,nno shuffling inside, nothing. \"Tony!\" Raphaelncalled again, \"Tony, open the damn door!\" Still no answer.nRaphael knew that he was home; he had already been to the club andnthe place was crawling with cops. Antonio would never stick aroundnwith the cops there. It wasn't a Wednesday, so he wasn't at thatnfat bastard Preswick's place. That left his apartment. Somethingnwasn't right. Even through his drug induced haze, Raphael couldnsense that things were off. He knocked twice more, then shoulderednhis way through the door. When he got into thenapartment, he found the entire place in disarray. Looked like Antonionand that girl of his had had another fight. That was when he saw hisnbrother lying in a heap in the middle of the floor. \"Tony?\" he said,nthen he noticed the pool of blood surrounding him. \"Oh, shit!nTony!\" Raphael tore through the apartment, \"Claire! You bitch!nYou kill my brother?\" He searched throughnthe apartment until he was satisfied that Claire wasn't hiding innone of the closets somewhere. \"Don't you worry,nbitch.\" He growled, \"I'll find you.\" Itnwas 6 a.m. when Vincent's beeper went off, waking Claire up.nVincent hadn't been asleep. Fear kept Claire kept perfectly stillnand quiet as Vincent began dialing a number on the phone. Vincent grew morenimpatient with every ring until, finally his last employer answered. \"Yeah?\" Vincentnsaid. \"I hear you had somendifficulty with the job.\" The voice on the other end of the phonensaid. \"You heard wrong.\" \"Tell me about thengirl.\" \"What girl?\" \"The girl that younleft Bardez's apartment with.\" \"I don't likenbeing spied on.\" \"Consider itninvestment insurance. After that L.A. fiasco…\" \"There werenextenuating circumstances in L.A.\" \"Be that as it may,nwho is the girl?\" \"She's no one.\" \"Well, I'm worriednthat no one knows too much.\" \"My job is done.\" \"I've already gotnan extra thirty grand ready to transfer to your account.\" \"That's not evennhalf my going rate, and you know it.\" \"I figure somethingnlike this should be a discount.\" \"If anything itnshould be extra.\" \"Just do it. We'llndiscuss terms later.\" \"No. I won't donit.\" \"I'll just sendnsomeone else to do it.\" \"What?\" \"Do the job or I'llnsend Beaufort.\" \"Fine!\" Vincentngrowled and slammed down the phone. Claire had only beennable to hear one side of the conversation, but she was pretty surenthat the girl being talked about was her and she didn'tnthink they were complimenting her hair color. She was just about tonstart panicking, when she heard Vincent pick up the phone again. Henbooked another ticket to Brazil. What? , Clairenthought to herself, Does he plan on taking me with him? Before she had thentime to really start to process the situation, Vincent had her by thenarms and had jerked her to her feet. \"Comenon, wake up, it's time to go.\" He said. \"Gonwhere?\" Claire asked, acting as though she had just woken. \"Justnget up.\" Vincent said.[Chapter 5] Author's Note: Sorry it's takennso long for the update. I've been busy preparing for school and allnthat to start back up. Anyways, here's the next chapter. Please letnme know how I'm doing! Chapter Five Claire struggled to keepnup with Vincent as he dragged her down the hall and practicallynshoved her into the elevator. The doors closed and Vincent gingerlynset down his briefcase and glanced at his wristwatch. \"All right,\" he said, \"wenhave a flight in three hours. That gives gives us two hours to getnyour id and passport in order.\" \"What?\" Claire gasped, \"We?nPassport? I don't want to leave the country!\" \"I'm afraid you don't have anchoice, Claire.\" Vincent replied. \"What happened to vanishing andnme never seeing you again?\" Claire asked. \"Plans changed.\" \"Why?\" \"They just have.\" The elevator doors opened and Vincentnpicked up his briefcase and, with his free hand, once again took holdnof Claire's elbow. She was getting rather tired of being draggednaround be men and tried to twist out of his grasp, but Vincent heldntight and all her efforts were in vain. \"Will...will you at least tell menwhere we're going?\"she asked. \"No.\" Vincent said cooly,n\"You'll find out when we get there.\" \"Are we going to Brazil?\" Claire would have sworn that Vincentnpause, but he never faltered a step. \"I just said that you'llnfind out when we get there.\" he said. \"Actually, I'll find out when youngive me the plane ticket!\" Claire spat, again trying to pull hernarm away from him. She wasn't sure where that boldness had come fromnand seeing that she was in the company of a killer, she regretted thenwords pretty much as soon as they had left her mouth. Why did Insay that? she thought, Am I insane? Possibly. She felt Vincent's already vice-likengrip tighten painfully against her flesh. He then turned abruptly andndragged her into a darkened side alley and she just knew that he wasnabout to kill her. She all of the sudden found herself thrust roughlynagainst the brick wall of a building with Vincent pressed against thenentire length of her. She could feel every muscle in his toned body.nHis flat stomach, lean solid thighs, and powerful chest. His fierceneyes were burning into hers. She was ashamed to admit it, but she wasnstrangely turned on. \"All right, listen to me,nClaire,\" he said, his voice dangerously low, \"I am notntelling you where we are going, because I don't know who isnnearby and listening to us. My last employer has made some demands ofnme that I am not prepared to carry out at this moment and he has hisnmen around here somewhere. Understand?\" Claire said nothing. \"Claire, do you understand whatnI'm saying?\" he snapped. \"What demands?\" Clairenasked. Vincent looked at her for a longnmoment. \"We should really keep moving.\" he finally said,ntaking her by the wrist and leading her out of the alley. An hour and one terrifying back alleynstore later, the word store meaning a 5 x 10 room with no windowsntucked underenath a fire escape, Claire had had her name changed,nbeen photographed, and recieved a passport in record time. Clay, the quote/unquote storekeeper,nwas a pale, skinny computer hacker with long greasy brown hair thatnhung over his horn rimmed glasses. He wore a black Weezer teenshirt and kept openly staring at Claire's breasts. \"Clay,\" Vincent said,n\"focus.\" \"Yeah!\" Clay said, hisnattention snapping back to where Claire's new id was coming out ofnthe printer. He made a few more modifications to the glossy piece ofnplastic before handing it to Claire, being sure to brush his fingersnagaist hers. \"Congradulations, dear. You arennow Mrs. Clarissa Debunk.\" \"Thanks.\" Claire said,nresisting the urge to wipe her hand on her jeans. Vincent threw a wad of hundreds ontonthe keyboard of Clay's computer before taking Claire by the arm andnforcing her out the door ahead of him. \"Not a word.\" hensaid to Clay threateningly as he followed her through the door. Clayngreatly resembled a mouse who had just been cornered by a hungry catnas he nodded to Vincent, then shut the door. Claire stifled a laughnwhen she heard the sound of about five different locks latching. \"Interesting character, thatnone.\" Claire said, allowing herself a light moment. Who knewnwhen she would get the chance to have another one? \"That's one way of putting it.\"nVincent said. \"So,\" she hesitated, \"cannI ask you something?\" \"You can ask, but I don'tngarantee an answer.\" \"When do I find out what's goingnon?\" she asked. Vincent actually stopped walking andnturned to look at her. He wanted to tell her. He wanted to assure hernthat everything would be fine and that he would take care of her,nthough he didn't know where the desire to take care of her had comenfrom. He opened his mouth to speak. He had no idea what he was aboutnto say, and he didn't get the chance to find out. \"Claire!\" a voice down thenstreet rang out, \"You bitch!\" Both Vincent and Claire looked back tonsee a bulky man glaring at them. Claire recognized him immediately.nIt was Antonio's brother, Raphael. \"What the...\" shenstarted, squinting to get a better look, but before she had time tonfocus, Vincent had pulled her out of the street. They had justnentered a tiny little shoe shop when the sound of a gun shot rangnthrough the street. \"Punelli works fast.\"nVincent said to himself, but Claire heard him and she made a mentalnnote of the name. \"New guy, though. At least it's not Beaufort.\"nBoth of them. Normally, Vincent would pull out hisngun and handle the situation, but there wasn't much lately that hadnbeen going normally. His main concern at present was getting Clairenout of there and not being fingered by any witnesses so that theyncould make it through the airport without any problems. Keeping antight grip on Claire's hand, he dragged her through the store andnthrough a back door that lead to a storage room. He shoved Clairentoward the back of that room and knocked over a stack of largencardboard boxes to block the entrance. \"Did he just shoot at us?\"nClaire asked, \"On a crowded street?\" Through the door at the back of thenstorage room, they found themself in an extremely narrow hallway, innwhich Vincent sped his pace to a run with Claire stumbling after him.nThe gunman was more than likely in the store by that point, whichnmeant they had to move fast. He reached behind him and grabbed Clairenby the hand once more. She had to keep up. He spotted the large metalndoor at the end of the hall and kicked his speed up yet anothernnotch. Once they reached it, he kicked it open and dragged Claire outninto yet another side alleyway. Her thighs were beginning to burn andncramp and her breathing was becoming more and more difficult, andnVincent was still running as though he could go for another milenwithout even breaking a sweat. But thankfully, before Claire knewnwhat had happened, they had made a sharp turn and were emerging fromnthe dark path out into the sunlit street. It seemed like one fluidnmotion that Vincent had hailed a taxi and thrown Claire inside of it. \"JFK.\" Vincent told thendriver and they were off. He looked out the back window just in timento see the stocky gunman come huffing out of the alley, but he wasntoo late. They were already lost in a sea of yellow cabs. Vincent letnout a breath and then relaxed...or, relaxed as much as he evernrelaxed. Claire studied him for a long minutenbefore deciding to speak. \"Who's Punelli?\" Vincent looked at her quickly, and thencoldness that was suddenly in his eyes made her blood want to freezenin her veins. \"What?\" \"I...I heard you say the name.\"nshe added carefully. Vincent looked to the cabby, whonseemed about as likely to speak English as a Vietnamese three yearnold, then returned his gaze to Claire. \"Mr. Punelli was my lastnemployer and that back there, I assume, was one of his men.\" \"No it wasn't.\" Clairenalmost laughed. Vincent looked at her questioningly.nHe did not like not knowing what was going on. \"That was Raphael.\" Claireninformed, \"Tony's idiot brother.\" \"Bardez's brother?\" \"Yeah. The big reject probablynthinks that I'm the one who...\" she paused and cast a glance atnthe driver, then looked back to Vincent, who nodded to indicate thatnhe understood. \"So...Punelli hired you to...\" Vincent's gaze was boring into hersnand she bagen to feel very small. \"I think that you've probablynfigured that out already.\" \"So...you're a...you...youndo...what I think you do?\" \"Yes.\" \"And Beaufort?\" Vincent smiled. She certainly did knownhow to pay attention, didn't she. \"He's like me.\" \"And Punelli is going to send himnafter you because?\" \"Not me, Claire.\" he said,n\"You.\" That word had the same impact as anknife would in her stomach. She wanted to cry and throw up all atnonce. \"Me?\" she asked and it all became so painfully clear.n\"The demand?\" Vincent nodded. Interestingly, Clairenhad the uncontrollable urge to laugh. The irony of the situation wasnalmost to beautiful to handle. The only man who wasn't trying to killnher...was the hit man. They pulled into the airport. Clairenwas still reeling from the discovery of her impending doom as Vincentnpaid the driver and pulled her out of the car. \"Um, Vincent?\"nClaire said and he paused mid-step to look at her. \"Don't takenthis the wrong way or anything, but I really need a cigarette.\"nShe used all of her might and dragged him into the lounge bar. Vincent's brow furrowed. \"Do younknow how bad smoking is for you?\" \"Probably not as bad as bulletsnflying at my head.\" Claire snapped, pulling her pack of Marlboronlights out of her bag and lighting one up. \"So...\" shenbegan over a puff of smoke and rubbed at her eyes with one hand,n\"please, tell me what's going on.\" Vincent thought about doing just that,nwhen the waiter came over to their table, so instead he responded tonhim. \"I'll have a scotch neat.\" Yes! Claire's mind screamed, Hard alcohol! Just what the doctor ordered! \"I'll havenmine of the rocks.\" she told the waiter, who nodded before henwandered away. \"Okay,\" she started again as soon as thenwaiter was out of earshot, \"I've known you for about twenty-fournhours and my life has turned completely inside out, so I wouldnappreciate a little perspective on the situation at hand.\" \"I don't know.\" Vincentnsaid, and it was almost true...and he really hated that fact. \"Yeah, right.\" Clairenresponded. \"Okay, listen,\" Vincentnstarted as the waiter sat down their drinks and left, \"you'venfigured out what I do, so let me tell you how it works. I don't getnon to personal term with my employers and they don't get on personalnterms with me. They contact me through email and if I take thenjob, I give them a pager number that they can reach me at. I don'tnknow why they pick the targets they pick and I don't care.\"nClaire looked like she was near tears. Her chin quivered for anmoment, but he could tell that she was working hard at fighting offnthe sobs. She grabbed her drink and downed it. \"However...I havenbeen doing this for a long time and after a while, you can start tonfigure these things out.\" He had Claire's interest. \"Oh?\"nshe said. \"Yeah,\" Vincent added, notnreally sure why he was telling all this, \"This job...yournboyfriend...it had the particular stink of a drug deal gone bad.\" Claire reached over, grabbed Vincent'sndrink and took a sip. \"Can't say that I'm really suprised.\"nThen, her eyes locked with his, \"So, why you helpin' me?\" Vincent gave one loud humorlessnchuckle and snatched his drink back from her and turned it up. \"Thatnone, I really don't know the answer to.\" Author's Note: Thanks to all ofnyou that have reviewed so far, keep em coming! But, now I have kindnof a poll I would like to take. I think I'm getting pretty good atnthis whole multi-tasking thing, and I'm going to start two morenfanfics shortly. You see, I have recently developed an infatuationnwith the brilliant actor Cillian Murphy, and really want to do anstory about him. I've got one in the works about his character from Cold Mountain and will probably do one on Red Eye if Incan ever get to the theater to see it. But I want to do one where Inhave more to go than a two minute scene, so I was hoping for somenopinions. Which of these movies do you think would be best? A) 28 Days Later B) The Way We Live Now (Don'tnknow how many people have seen that one) C) Batman Begins Let me know what you think! Thanksnagain, C-ya![Chapter 6] Chapter Six They changed planes in Florida and the sun had already set by the time they landed in Florianopolis on the coast of Brazil. Claire climbed off the plane into the heat and humidity. The heavy, muggy air pressed down on her and she struggled to breathe, her mind still reeling from watching Vincent go through airport security. She didn't think it would have been possible, but he managed to make himself invisible. He blended one hundred percent into the crowd, one hand casually engulfing her own and his free hand still holding on dearly to his briefcase. He had disappeared momentarily into the bathroom, leaving her alone for a short while. Oddly enough, the idea of escape never even occurred to her. She knew that she would be safer with him than she would be out there with Raphael's big stupid ass chasing after her. He returned, and she noticed the briefcase had disappeared. He grabbed her hand and led her on toward security. She didn't ask…she didn't want to know. From that point on, things had been smooth sailing. They made it through every security checkpoint with absolutely no problems whatsoever and all of the sudden…BAM…Claire was in Brazil. They stepped out of the airport and Claire froze in her tracks. Her eyes scanned the world that Vincent had brought her to. The word beautiful could barely scratch the surface of the description of her surroundings. She had always wanted to travel, but could never afford it and then Antonio just wouldn't allow it. Now, here she was…even though it wasn't the way she would have chosen to be her first experience abroad. \"Whoa.\" She said, without even realizing that she had spoken out loud. \"What is it?\" Vincent asked, looking up from his wrist watch. \"This place…it's amazing.\" She said. Vincent looked around as though the thought had never crossed his mind before she mentioned it and nodded, \"Yeah, I guess it is.\" \"You guess it is?\" Claire said, fighting off the urge to roll her eyes, \"How can you look around here and not have your breath just…taken away?\" \"I guess I'm just not a sentimental type of guy.\" He said. But as he looked at her, the way her face was as she stared at the landscape around her, he felt a sort of awe. Not for Florianopolis, he'd been there a million times, he was used to it…but for how childlike she seemed at that moment. She was by no means innocent or pure or even naïve. Quite the contrary, she was cynical and jaded and had seen more than a woman her age should…but at that moment, in the middle of that beautiful city, none of it mattered. She had regressed back to childhood to a time when she could find the brilliance in anything. He liked the way she looked when all of her problems disappeared. He found himself just staring at her…and smiling. He snapped himself out of it and grabbed her hand. \"Time to go.\" He said, leading her to the nearby garage. \"You just don't appreciate the finer things in life.\" Claire said her voice light and airy. Something about this place had put her in a better mood than she had been in for a long, long time. She actually felt like skipping…and she didn't skip…even when she was a kid, she didn't skip. \"Not true.\" Vincent said, pulling a set of keys from his pants pocket, \"Nothin' better than a glass of scotch and some jazz playing in the background. You can't beat that.\" \"Oh. And what's so great about jazz?\" Claire asked. Vincent drew to a halt and looked at her. His mouth angled up at one corner and a look of deep reverence floated across his handsome face. \"The fact that it's spontaneous. Unplanned. Improvised.\" Claire couldn't keep herself from smiling. Why was it that jazz fans always seemed so fanatical about their music? She couldn't think of ever having met one that wasn't. It was funny. In that moment when he was talking about jazz, he almost seemed…normal. He shook himself out of his little self-induced trance and pushed the unlock button on his key ring. Claire's eyes widened when she saw that it was a silver Mercedes SUV that chirped at them in response to the button. She looked back at Vincent, who was now fully grinning at her. \"Do Mercedes count as a finer thing of life…because I do admit to a weakness for them.\" \"Really? I saw you as more of a Jaguar type.\" Claire quipped as she hopped up into the passenger seat. \"Nobody needs that kind of speed unless they're in Germany.\" \"So, let me get this straight…you live here?\" Claire asked. \"Well,\" Vincent paused, \"I have a house here. I also have houses in three other countries and I try not to stay at any one of them for too long.\" Claire felt a knot of disgust churn in her stomach. \"Is business that good?\" Vincent gave a short laugh as he maneuvered the SUV out onto the highway. \"How would you like me to answer that?\" \"Don't.\" Claire said simply. They drove for a while in silence, except for the Chet Baker CD that Vincent was playing. Claire was just staring out the open window, admiring the vast array of greenery along the side of the road. Florianopolis was the best of both worlds. There was a white sandy beach on the one side and what could easily be mistaken for a jungle on the other. In her wildest dreams, Claire could never have imagined such a place…and Vincent lived here on a regular basis. Then, the Mercedes turned onto a narrow road that was surrounded by tropical trees and plants that raised so high, you couldn't see the moon. The paved road soon evolved into nothing more than a winding gravel path with so many bumps that the CD skipped. The thought occurred to her that she was now on her way to a secluded area of a foreign country with a man she new to be a contract killer. Everything in her head the was logical told her that this was a bad idea, but why would he go through the trouble of dragging her out of the country just to kill her. She had watched him, if he had wanted her dead she would have already been dead and probably lying undiscovered under Clay's fire escape. She cast a glance at Vincent. His face was serious as he focused on the road in front of him, making Claire smile. But it was a sad smile that didn't reach her eyes. So much had happened to her in her life. So many things had gone so terribly wrong, so why should this be any different. Thing was, it felt different. It felt right. She realized that she was smiling because being with Vincent right then at that moment…felt safe. The top line of the trees opened up and Claire found that the sky was so clear, she could see every star in the heavens. When she brought her gaze back down, she saw the small but elegant little house. It had white paneling, a brown roof, and a white railed porch that wrapped all the way around it. It had at least a dozen windows, which was a lot considering the size of the house. Vincent parked in front of the house and Claire had the door open and was stepping out before he had shut off the ignition. She wanted a better look at this place. As she walked toward the house itself, she found that it was hidden by the trees on three sides and the back yard was the beach. Gotta give the man credit, she thought, he sure knows how to pick his real estate. She rubbed her hand over the back of her neck to wipe away the sweat that had collected there. She had shed her coat at the airport, but she was still dressed for New York winter and had not been expecting to be dragged so close to the equator. She had started to wander around the house to the beach. She wanted to see the clear blue water, but was stopped by Vincent's voice. \"Claire.\" He called, \"Let's go inside.\" Claire looked back at him for a long moment. The idea of running to the beach crossed through her mind. Instead, she nodded and joined Vincent on the porch. Vincent opened the door and let Claire walk in ahead of him. He had never had anyone over to his home before…any of them…it was a strange feeling. He wouldn't have expected it to affect him so much, but seeing her walking over the hardwood floors, into the living room, her fingers brushing over the cushions of his sofa, did something to him. He had never been a man of many material wants, so his place was fairly simple. He had a comfortable living room with an amazing stereo system. He wasn't one for TV so he didn't own one. Claire turned and looked at him and her pretty eyes seemed to sparkle. She seemed so out of place in his home, though he figured anyone would have seemed out of place in his home other than himself. \"Um,\" he began, \"I'll take you in the morning to get some clothes.\" \"Yes,\" Claire said, \"preferably warm weather clothes. Is it always this hot here?\" \"You think this is hot? No, Claire. This is the cool weather.\" \"You're kidding.\" \"Not at all.\" \"So,\" Claire started, feeling that they had avoided the subject for long enough, \"what's gonna happen to me?\" Vincent crossed his arms and looked down at his feet. What am I going to do with her ? He thought, Can't I just keep her here ? He looked back up at her and felt himself smile. She was just standing there, staring at him and…as out of place as she seemed, she still somehow just…fit.

Arrival The subway train slowly pulled to a stop and among all the businessmen, junkies, and other occupants, who quickly stepped off the subway eager to get on with their day, there was a man. A man few people would notice. He was the kind of man who could come and go without anyone knowing he was even there. He stepped onto the platform of the subway station, his sharp eyes surveying the entire platform and everyone there in a single glance. Then with quick, confident strides made his way up the steps of the subway station and into the cold Chicago air. Standing near the curb he tried to hail a cab. There were few cabs out today and all of them seemed to have an occupant. With a disgusted sigh he waited in the frigidly cold wind until, finally, a cab pulled up alongside the curb and stopped. The man quickly slid into the backseat, glad to be out of the freezing wind. \" Where to?\" the fat, shabbily dressed driver asked as he surveyed his new passenger with a critical eye. The man only spared the cabby a glance long enough to tell him the address and then settled back into his seat his eyes casting a bored glance out the window at the scene outside. Thick gray storm clouds hid the afternoon sun and a biting wind blew trash and other debris every which way in a frenzied whirl that never seemed to slow down. On the sidewalks dozens of people hurried along their own separate ways eager to get out of the frigid temperatures. He sighed and then pulled a laptop out of the briefcase he carried with him. The cabby watched his passenger through his rearview mirror as the man tapped away at the keys of his laptop. \"A businessman\" the cabby thought as he surveyed the other. The man wore a well-tailored light gray business suit and black dress shoes. Clean-cut silver hair and slight beard and mustache, along with his piercing blue eyes gave the man an oddly distinguished look. \"You here on a business trip?\" he asked his passenger suddenly. Talking to the passengers was against the rules and the cabby knew it, but he was bored and hoped the man was in the mood for a conversation. The man lifted his eyes away from the computer screen, one silver eyebrow arched just slightly in question. \"What?\" he asked quietly, with just the slightest amount of irritation at being interrupted at his work coming out in his voice. The cabby didn't take the hint. \"A business trip\" he repeated. The man frowned and for a long moment he didn't say anything. \"Yes\" he said finally after a long pause. \"What do you do?\" the cabby asked, glad that the man had at least answered his question and too eager to talk to someone to notice the others irritation. \"Defense attorney.\" \"Mmhmm, I see\" the cabby said thoughtfully. \"Must be interesting work you do.\" The other shrugged. \" Not really\" \"What kind of a case are you working on now?\" the cabby persisted, hoping to draw the conversation out just a little longer. He could tell the man didn't want to talk, but hoped he would keep talking anyway \"I'm not allowed to discuss the details of the case,\" the man said with a slight smile. He could see the driver was bored and it amused him to see the cabby struggle to keep the conversation from drawing to a close. \"Is this your first time in Chicago?\" \"Yes, I'm on my way to see my client now\" The man said, and then after a moments pause, added, \"How long will it take us to get there?\" The cab slid to a halt in front of a red light. \"About twenty minutes.\" The man seemed to think about something for a moment then glanced at his watch. \" I'll give you twenty dollars extra if you get me there in fifteen,\" He said finally. The cabby turned so he was facing his passenger. \"Twenty bucks?\" The man grinned. \"Twenty bucks\" he affirmed with a slight nod. A large smile broke out on the cabby's chubby face. \"Alright, you got yourself a deal.\" \"Mind if I time you?\" The cabby's smile grew even bigger. \"No, cause I'll get you there on time. You don't gotta worry about a thing, oh and by the way, welcome to Chicago. My name's Matt.\" The cabby said sticking out his hand. \"Thank you\" the man said as he shook the driver's hand. \"I'm Vincent.\" Wellwhat do you all think? please read and review.[Chapter 2] Hello everyone, well here is the next chapter. Enjoy. And don't forget to read and review. Disclamer: I don't own Collateral(duh). I only own the characters you don't recognize(like Mkenzie) Chapter 2. Boredom Drip. Drip. Drip. The quiet noise of the leaky faucet was the only sound that broke the still silence in the dark apartment. The lone occupant slouched back in an old armchair that had been placed in the middle of the room, mere inches away from the black screen of the broken television set. The figure in the chair stirred a bit when the dripping started, her dark eyes flicking towards the direction of the sound. She watched the water drip from the faucet for about a minute then turned her eyes back to the blank television. At first glance one might have thought, with her slouched position and lazy demeanor, that perhaps she was simply too lazy to get up and turn the television on. A second glance however, would show that she was anything but lazy and relaxed. Her entire body was completely tense, as if she were going to spring from the chair at any moment. Her slender hands gripped the armrests so hard that the knuckles had turned white and a cold enraged fire smoldered within her dark eyes. Her jaw was clenched tightly as if she was struggling to prevent herself from flying into a verbal rage. The broken television, however was not the object of her anger. It was the silence. The silence was going to drive her insane, of that Mkenzie was certain. It was a good thing that whoever had coined the phrase \"silence is golden\" was dead because, if he hadn't been, she would have made sure that his life didn't last too much longer. She cocked her head to one side and listened, straining her ears, even though she had no clue what she was listening for in the first place. There was no noise save for the dripping of the leaky faucet and the whistling of the wind outside. Unfortunately these few sounds only seemed to make the silence more profound. With an irritated growl she leapt up from the armchair and headed for the door. She paused with her hand on the doorknob. Did she dare go outside? She let her hand slide off the knob and then simply stood there, staring at the door. Mkenzie let out a frustrated sigh and placed her forehead on the door and then closed her eyes. Ever since she had entered the Witness Protection Program three weeks ago she had only been outside her new apartment twice and each time she had always been on her guard. She had wanted to go out more but Mkenzie was not stupid. She knew that someday someone would be looking for her and that it would be someone she didn't want to meet. \"Well I guess that's what you get for pissing off the Mafia,\" she thought bitterly to herself. If only Armys hadn't been such a fool. \"Why are you being so childish?\" she scolded herself. \"Open the damn door and walk out.\" With that said she grabbed the knob and yanked the door open . . .. And leapt back with a startled yelp. \"Did I scare you?\" A high-pitched childish voice squeaked with glee. Mkenzie took a deep breath to prevent her from lashing out in anger at the child. \"No, Sarah you didn't.\" Sarah, who was only 8, giggled delightedly, her soft sky- blue eyes sparkling. \"Yes I did.\" She said. \"I scared you Carol.\" Mkenzie inwardly cringed at the name the FBI had given her to protect her identity. \"No, you didn't. \"Yes, I did.\" \"NO, you didn't.\" \"Yes I did.\" \"No . . .\" Mkenzie stopped herself. \"Why am I arguing with an eight- year- old?\" She thought. She shook her head. She wasn't going to bother answering that question now. \"What do you want Sarah?\" Sarah grinned. \"I have something for you.\" Mkenzie rolled her eyes. \"What do you have for me?\" She said trying not to sound impatient. \"Guess.\" \"I despise guessing games.\" If you don't guess then I won't tell you and you will never know what it is.\" Sarah stated gravely, as if not knowing was something Mkenzie couldn't live with. Mkenzie couldn't help but smile at this statement. Sarah was hiding her \"something\" behind her back, but since Mkenzie was almost twice her height she could clearly see what Sarah was hiding. \"Are you going to guess?\" Sarah asked impatiently. She wanted to show her friend what she had brought her. \"Please Carol?\" she begged. \"Ok, Ok I'll guess.\" Mkenzie said quickly. She had seen Sarah's eyes start to tear up and Mkenzie was not in the mood to comfort a crying child. \"Hmmm . . .\" she said, pretending to think really hard about it. \"Bugs.\" She said finally. Sarah made a face. \"Ewww…\" Mkenzie smiled. \"Well what is it then?\" Sarah smiled triumphantly and brought her gift forward. Mkenzie cringed inwardly. Sarah had brought her a plate of homemade cookies. \"I made them myself.\" Sarah said proudly. \"I see, well thank you very much.\" Mkenzie said as she took the plate, which was piled high with what looked like chocolate chip cookies. \"Are you gonna eat one now?\" Sarah asked. \"Umm…. Not right now. I just ate. I'll save them for later.\" Mkenzie lied, not wanting to hurt the little girl's feelings. \"Ok. I have to go now. Mamma said I have to come right back after I give them to you.\" \"Alright then, you had better get going then.\" \"Bye now Carol. When you're done with those ones I'll make you some more.\" Mkenzie waited till the girl had disappeared down the hall then turning quickly placed the plate of cookies on a shelf next to the door. She would get rid of them later. Chances were, Sarah would stop by later to see how many were left. Now, the problem was not that Mkenzie was ungrateful, the real problem was the fact that Sarah always put too much salt and not enough sugar into her \"special\" cookies. \"Poor Sarah.\" Mkenzie thought. The little girl had veryfew friends and considered Mkenzie to be her best friend. Unfortunately Sarah was a very hyper little girl who loved to talk about everything. Mkenzie was an anti- social young woman who liked being alone. Besides with the situation she was in now Mkenzie wanted to keep everybody, especially Sarah, as far away from her as possible. Mkenzie trudged quickly down the stairs towards the front end of the building. Marcus, the landlord, greeted her as she stepped towards the front door. She nodded a hasty greeting and stepped outside. A strong blast of cold wind nearly knocked her over and she had to struggle just to keep her balance. \"I hope there's a cab nearby.\" She thought as a she stood near the curb. As if on cue a yellow cab pulled up and stopped. Mkenzie was about to open the door and hop in when the door swung open and a man stepped out. From the moment she laid eyes on him Mkenzie knew there was something odd about him. She studied him intensely as he paid the driver then turned to go. He was a tall man and obviously well to do. His expensive looking gray business suit and leather briefcase seemed testimony to that. She couldn't even begin to guess at his age. His silver hair and stubble seemed to make him look older but the sharpness in his blue eyes seemed to tell of someone who was younger. At that moment however, it didn't matter to her how old he was because as he turned to go he seemed to see her for the first time. He didn't miss a beat as he stepped back and held the cab door open for her. For a brief moment their eyes locked. A cold shiver ran up her spine as he stared at her. The look in his eyes was like that of a predator who is stalking his prey. Quick as a flash she slid into the now vacant cab and pulled the door shut behind her. Too preoccupied with her own thoughts Mkenzie didn't notice that the man never left the curb till the cab was out of sight. \"Don't stay out too long my dear.\" Vincent whispered softly at he watched the cab leave. \"I look forward to our meeting.\" He smiled thinly as he thought of the future. This was going to be fun. She would never see it coming. Vripter: Hi. Thank you for your wonderful comments. I was very excited when I saw my story in your \"Favorite Stories List.\" I'm glad you're enjoying the fic.I hope you liked this chapter too. Until next time, Namarie(Farewell) Winged Seraph: Hi. I'm happy you're enjoying the story so far. And I;m glad to know that I got Vincent down right, because I wasn'tsure if I had it right. Well I hope you like the way it plays out. If all goes according to plan there should be a few surprises. Anyways thank you for you're kind review. Namarie(Farewell)[Chapter 3] Hello everyone thanks for not abandoning my story. Sorry it took so long to update but the computer I was saving my chapters on decided to stop working so I wasn't able to update. But don't worry I'm going to be saving my chapters on another computer so I'll be able to update more often. Okay now on with the story. Enjoy. Disclaimer: I don't own Collateral. I only own the characters you don't recognize. Chapter 3. \"I'm telling on you.\" As soon as the cab disappeared from sight Vincent turned and started toward the front entrance. There was no one sitting at the front desk when he walked in. Vincent already knew that there wouldn't be anyone there. Nicki, the secretary, would be watching her favorite soap opera right now and Marcus, the landlord, would be out buying whatever he felt he needed at the moment. Vincent couldn't help but smile. It was so easy to formulate a plan when people had a routine that they stuck to. He quickly made his way towards the stairs to the second floor. When he came to the landing at the top of the stairs, he paused for a moment. There was no one in sight. \"This is turning out better than expected.\" He thought. No one would even know he was here. He continued walking down the hall, his eyes darting back and forth between the numbers over the doors on either side of the hall. He stopped about halfway down the hall in front the door with the number he was looking for. Number 63. He paused for a moment to make sure no one was coming then pulled out a small skeleton key from his pocket. He started to insert the key into the lock when a small voice behind him caused him to jump slightly with surprise. \"What do you think your doing?\" The voice said, in a very accusing tone. Vincent spun around in shock. There, standing in the hallway, hands on her hips, trying to look intimidating and annoyed at the same time, was a little girl. For a half a second Vincent forgot how to speak. \"Well?\" The child asked impatiently. \"I'm here to visit a friend.\" He said quickly, looking around to see if there was anyone else around. There was no one. Vincent frowned. How had she gotten here? There had been no one there a second ago. \"Are you here to see Carol?\" The girl asked. \"Yes, I'm an old friend.\" Vincent said patiently, hoping that she would believe him and just leave. Unfortunately, it was clear that she wasn't buying it. \"If you're a friend why are you trying to break into her apartment?\" She asked haughtily, using the tone of someone whom knew exactly what you were doing and was simply asking to see what you would say. Vincent scowled. This girl was just plain annoying. \"I wasn't breaking in.\" He said, his eyes narrowing down to slits. \"I have a key.\" \"Carol doesn't give her keys out to anyone.\" She retorted. \"She gave one to me.\" Vincent replied, holding up the key. \"You're a liar.\" The girl said defiantly, crossing her arms in front of her chest. \"Why would you say that?\" Vincent said quietly, taking a step towards her. The girl backed up. \"B… because you are.\" She said hesitantly, suddenly unsure of how wise her actions were. \"How do you know that?\" Vincent asked, his voice still quiet, but with the hint of a threat. This girl was becoming a problem. Mkenzie strolled lazily down the cold street towards her destination. She had gotten out of the cab about three blocks from her intended stop. It didn't really matter to her; she wasn't in a hurry to get there.She sighed contentedly, not minding the biting wind that struck her face painfully. All around her people from all walks of life pushed past her eager to get out of the unfriendly weather. Mkenzie paid them no heed. She inhaled deeply, the cold air made the action rather painful, but Mkenzie didn't care. She felt alive. Out here, without the walls of the small apartment suffocating her at every moment, she felt free. Outside in the free air Mkenzie remembered why she was here in the first place. Revenge. What did it matter if she pissed off some people who really shouldn't be messed with? Whatever the cost, Armys would pay for his betrayal. Going to the FBI with information was the perfect revenge. Armys was a \"respectable\" man in the eyes of the world. If they knew him for what he really was, his reputation would be ruined. He would be ruined. However, it was not enough that he merely lose his reputation. She wanted him in prison. He had been in prison once before and he had sworn he would never go back. Being in prison would be like a slow death for him, and that was exactly what Mkenzie wanted. It was only fair that he should be punished, after all, because of his betrayal he had almost gotten her killed twice and he had succeeded in getting a close friend of hers killed. She shook her head, banishing all thoughts of Armys from her mind. It didn't really matter any more; soon the FBI would have enough evidence to put him away for good. Everything would be finished in a few weeks time. \"Nothing to worry about.\" She reassured herself as she reached her destination. Sarah wished that she had listened to her mother when she had told her not to leave the apartment. Unfortunately, the thought of being alone for a few hours while her mother went out had not been very appealing. When she had heard a noise across the hall, she had thought that Carol had come back. When she opened the door, silently since she was hoping to scare Carol again, the person she saw was not Carol. It was a man. He was doing something with the lock on Carol's door. Immediately she surmised that the man must be a robber trying to break in and, feeling very bold indeed, went out to confront him. The thought of what might happen to her if he really was a robber had never crossed her mind… until now. She stood still for a moment, wondering what she should do. When she had first spoken to him, she had felt so bold and confident, but now the man seemed very scary to her and she was suddenly unsure what to do. Should she scream? Try to run away? She quickly decided on the latter since the thing she wanted the most was to be far away from him. Sadly, before she actually tried to run she said something very foolish. \"I'm telling on you.\" The man seemed a bit confused by her statement. \"What?\" She drew herself up to her full height, which wasn't very much, and spoke again. \"I'm telling on you.\" She repeated, then spun around and ran off. She didn't get very far. Before she had taken three steps a strong arm wrapped itself around her waist and lifted her off the ground and a large hand clamped over her mouth, cutting off her surprised shriek. \"You're not going anywhere.\" He hissed. Uh-oh, another cliffhanger. Sorry about that people, but I couldn't resist. Well anyway, hope you all enjoyed this chapter. Please remember to read and review. All constructive criticism you might have is welcomed and appreciated. Oh and something else, The name\" Armys \" is pronounced \" Arimus \" Winged Seraph: Thank you so much, glad you liked the second chapter.Mkenzie didn't meet Vincent yet, but don't worry she'll meet him soon evil laugh. I'm glad you're enjoying the story. I hope you liked this chapter. It turned out to be longer than I expected it to, but that's ok. I think people enjoy reading longer chapters. Am I right? Anyways, thanks for the kind review. Namarie SpadesJade: Hi, glad you like my story. Well I hope you liked this chapter. Yeah, yeah I know, another evil cliffhanger.Lol. :-DDon't worry you shouldn't have to wait too long for chapter four(even though I think chapt.4 is going to end in a cliffhanger too evil laughter). Well anyway, thank you for your wonderful review. Namarie[Chapter 4] Ok people here is chapter four. Enjoy Chapter 4 \"If you scream, I will kill you.\" Vincent scowled at the struggling child in his arms. \"What the hell am I supposed to do with this thing\" He thought angrily. He glanced up and down the hallway again fully expecting someone to come strolling along and see him. There was no one, but Vincent knew that probably wouldn't last long. He had to get rid of the kid, and fast. Once again he ran through his options. There weren't many. He could take her into the apartment, tie her up and hide her somewhere. No, she might somehow make a noise and alert his target to his presence. He could put her in someone else's apartment and leave her there. No, too risky, while he was waiting for his target someone might discover the girl and call the police before his mission was accomplished. He vaguely realized that all the options he ran through revolved around the girl still being alive. It would be easier to simply kill her and be done with it. Vincent shook his head almost appalled by the thought. Kill a child? No, he couldn't do that. But what was he supposed to do with her then? He was out of options and he didn't like it. Frustrated, Vincent cursed angrily under his breath. Suddenly the girl stopped struggling. In his surprise Vincent relaxed his grip and nearly dropped her. The hand covering her mouth slipped just a bit, but it was enough for her to get her own grip on his hand, with her teeth. Vincent swore violently and dropped her. She may have been just a small child but she could bite hard. She was a bit stunned when she landed on the floor, but at first she didn't try to run, instead she just stared at him. \"You said a bad word.\" She breathed, her soft sky blue eyes wide with shock. Vincent hesitated for just a second. \"What is wrong with this kid?\" he thought. Here she was on the verge of being killed and she was worried about his language! Vincent didn't waste another second on the thought, because at that moment the girl turned and ran off. Again he caught her quickly, but he wasn't prepared for what happened next. As soon as he grabbed her wrist, she turned into a miniature hurricane. She turned and kicked him hard in the shin then tried to bite the hand that was holding her all the while swinging her other fist every time he tried to grab it. In all of his life, Vincent had never seen anything like this. The little whirlwind he was currently trying to restrain was putting up a remarkable fight. Finally, he succeeded in capturing her swinging fist and not a moment too soon. From the bottom of the stairs that led to the hallway that they were in he could hear voices. And the people who owned those voices were heading up the stairs. Vincent had to get out of the hallway and fast He glanced around and spied the open door of the apartment that the girl had come from. He would go there, but first he had to take care of the kid. As soon as she heard the voices, she had opened her mouth to cry for help, not knowing that it would prove fatal for her and the people coming up the stairs. However, Vincent was much faster than she was. He hated threatening children, but she left him with no choice. He pulled out his gun and placed it against her forehead. \"If you scream, I will kill you.\" Mkenzie hesitated just inside the door to the bar, taking a moment to get used to the smells and sounds that assaulted her senses. She didn't wait too long before she ventured in, otherwise people would notice, and that was the last thing she wanted. She chose a booth near the back, in a dark secluded corner and waited. A moment later a man stepped through the door. He was tall and well built, with a handsome face, sandy colored hair and grayish-blue eyes. Mkenzie watched him carefully as his eyes scanned around the bar, finally coming to rest on her. She put her elbows on the table and laced her finger together as he approached.[Chapter 5] Well here is chapter 5 (finally) I hope you all like it. Remember to drop a review please ( reviews make me happy) :-D Chapter5 First Meetings Mkenzie stepped into her apartment and sighed. She ran her fingers through her dark hair and tossed the apartment keys onto the small stand next to the door. They landed with a loud clank next to the plate of cookies, left there earlier when she had hurried out. Mkenzie made a mental note to get rid of them before Sarah saw them. She closed the door behind her and started towards her bedroom when, suddenly, a warning went off in the back of her mind. She couldn't explain why, but suddenly she felt as if she wasn't alone. A cold shiver ran down her back and she stood where she was wondering what had made the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. Her dark eyes flicked across the room, searching, then fell on the entryway to the kitchen area. Could someone be hiding there? A small noise on her left caused her to jump slightly and her eyes darted to the partially open bedroom door. The warning bells in her mind were practically screaming at her and her instincts told her that she needed to leave now, but she couldn't understand why. Senses now on high alert she took a cautious step backward. She paused trying to figure out what had alerted her in the first place. Had she heard a noise? Seen a shadow move? A flash of movement from the bedroom was the only warning she had. Without thinking, she threw herself towards the entryway to the kitchen. The first bullet, which had been aimed at her chest,hit her in the shoulder, knocking her backwards. The second bullet, which had followed quickly behind the first, grazed her arm and slammed into the wall behind her. Hot flashes of pain raced through her arm as she stumbled and nearly fell. Somehow, she managed to scramble into the kitchen and take cover behind the wall. Oddly enough, her attacker didn't immediately follow after her. A voice she didn't recognize cut through her stunned mind. \"You move quick.\" The voice sounded amused and perhaps a little surprised. \"I'm impressed.\" Mkenzie swore under her breath. \"I guess I'll take that as a compliment.\" She growled as she reached up with her left hand and clutched her shoulder. \"Shit.\" \"It was meant to be one.\" Mkenzie risked a quick glance around the corner. She was only slightly surprised to see the man she had seen getting out of the cab earlier. Should have known there was something odd about him. She thought. She could feel her blood slipping through her fingers. The feeling made her dizzy and she forced herself to concentrate her thoughts on getting out of this mess and not on the fact that if she didn't stop the bleeding soon she would probably bleed to death. That is, if he didn't kill her first. Getting away was going to be difficult. The man was a professional and he knew what he was doing. Mkenzie looked around and saw a large kitchen knife lying on the counter. Unfortunately, she couldn't get to it, since she would have to move across the open entryway to pick it up. She had to buy herself some time. \"Armys sent you, I assume?\" She said casually, as if she were speaking to an old friend instead of someone who was trying to kill her. \"Who else?\" \"Figures.\" She mumbled \"You were expecting it though.\" She scowled. \"Of course I was. I just didn't know when.\" \"Shit\" she hissed as a wave of dizziness hit her. She looked at her arm. It was completely covered in blood and she already knew the bullet was still there. \"I'm definitely going to feel this tomorrow.\" She said aloud to herself. The man let out a quiet chuckle. \"No, you won't.\" Mkenzie rolled her eyes. \"Thank you for that much needed reminder, asshole.\" She muttered under her breath. \"So what do we do now, then?\" \"Do? Simple, I finish my job.\" \"What makes you think it's going to be that easy?\" She could almost imagine him smiling as he said, \"I do this for a living.\" \"Really?\" Mkenzie said sarcastically, \"I almost don't believe that.\" \"Why?\" \"Because your aim sucks. I've never met an assassin who missed as badly as you did.\" \"Obviously you must be the expert on such matters.\" \"Actually I am. It was my job to monitor all \"personnel\" who worked for the Mafia. I had access to every file on every assassin who worked for the Mafia. In fact, I wrote a lot of them. I know how assassins are supposed to operate.\" There was a snort of derision and Mkenzie could have sworn that she heard, \"of course you do.\" She couldn't really tell. Aloud he said, \"Which would explain why Armys wants you dead.\" \"That's part of the reason.\" \"The other reason was Nicholas.\" Mkenzie froze. Why would Armys tell this guy about Nicholas? She swallowed hard, \"How did you know about Nicholas?\" \" Armys talks a lot when he's drunk.\" \"Typical, at least for him. Stupid drunk bastard.\" Another quiet laugh. \"Almost the same thing he said about you.\" The dizziness was hitting her fully now, and it was all she could do to stay standing. If you pass out your dead. Buy yourself more time and make it fast! She shook her head trying to clear away the fog in her mind. It was a mistake; the shaking only made the dizziness worse. She grabbed a rag that was sitting on the counter top on her left, and pressed it against her wound. \"What did he tell you about Nicholas?\" \"There wasn't really much for him to tell. Except that he died because he was stupid enough to listen to you.\" Mkenzie closed her eyes and leaned even heavier against the wall. Stay awake! Stay awake! \"He said that Nicholas would still be alive if you hadn't convinced him to come clean.\" Mkenzie's eyes flew open at his words. They had sounded so close… \"… because he was stupid enough to listen to you.\" Vincent paused for a moment as he listened. She didn't reply to his statement. There was only the sound of her harsh breathing. She was probably ready to pass out. He stepped forward, gun held in the firing position. She didn't even notice him until he spoke again. But by that time he already had his gun pointed at the side of her head. Oh so sorry for the short chapter. The next one should be up soon. Probably in a week or two, because finals are over this week. Please tell me what you think about this chapter. And I have a question for you all, how am I doing with keeping Vincent in character? Please tell me honestly. SpadesJade: ah well I'm not sure if this update was fast enough, lol. But I can assure you that the next update will be sooner since school ends soon. Hope you enjoyed this chapter. Laurenmlbc: Hi, welcome to the story. Glad you like it. Thank you for you wonderful comments. Sweet Treats: Hi, glad you like my fic. I hope you enjoy this chapter and the rest of it too. Lots of angst and cliffhangers if I have anything to do with it. Lol Cleric: Hi, thank you for your kind comments and for the punctuation tip as well. I'm glad you don't mind all the cliffhangers. Lol (there are probably going to be a lot more) :-D[Chapter 6] Ok here is chapter 6. I would have had it out sooner, but I ran intorna few problems. You know, all the usual stuff; Writers block, gettingrnsick, plus almost every single computer in the house doesn't work.rnThe only one that does work wouldn't let me open the file that thernchapter was saved on. I don't know why. Anyways, on with thernchapter. Enjoy. Chapter 6 Not all she seems \"Holy hell!\" Mkenzie yelped as she stumbled backwards. \"Whoa,rnhold on there a second.\" She said, holding her hand up defensively,rnthe other still pressing the cloth tightly against her shoulder. Sherncontinued to back up until she backed into the cupboards behind her,rnnow having nowhere else to go. This is not going to end well. She thought, a frown crossingrnher face as she stared down the barrel of the assassins gun . Damn,rnthis guy is smart. She mused as she eyed him, noting everything,rnfrom his stance to the way he held his gun. Yes, this guy definitelyrnknew what he was doing. The one thing that puzzled her however, wasrnthe fact that she didn't know him. Who was he? She had written uprnhundreds of files on hundreds of assassins and had even, on occasion,rntaken the time to look up the files on assassins that had beenrnwritten by others. Why then, didn't she recognize him? Thenrnsuddenly, she knew. Her line of work gave her almost unlimitedrnknowledge of the assassins in the mafia's employ, which includedrntheir methods and how they worked. Hiring someone she knew meant thatrnshe would be able to anticipate what they would do and try torncounteract it if she could. Armys knew this, so he had to hirernsomeone she didn't know so she wouldn't be able to anticipaternwhat he would do. Which meant that she knew absolutely nothing aboutrnthis man. Oh, I am so screwed. No, no your not. Not yet. Come on damn it! You're better thanrnthis! You've been in worse situations before. Remember that onerntime in Germany? I'd rather not, actually. Ah, but don't forget, he doesn't hold all the cards yet. Yournmay not know anything about him, but he also doesn't knowrneverything about you either, and if you remember Armys' nastyrnlittle habit… \"You know,\" the man's voice interrupted her train ofrnthought, \"I'm rather disappointed. Armys told me you would be arnlot harder to kill.\" \"Well, if you hadn't noticed, the circumstances aren't reallyrnin my favor, now are they?\" Mkenzie said. \"But, hey, I do think Irnshould congratulate you.\" \"For what?\" Mkenzie smirked. This just might be her ticket out of here. \"Forrnbeing the first one here, of course.\" She saw the confused lookrnflick across his face and continued. \"Oh, yes, I forgot. Armys doesrntend to leave out important information like that. Anyway, I meantrnthat you are the first assassin to come after me. Armys probablyrndidn't tell you this, but he has a bad habit of sending more thanrnone assassin after the same person.\" There was a slight pause as the man studied her, probably trying torndecide if there was any truth in her words. In the end however, hernapparently decided he didn't care. \"It doesn't matter.\" He said coolly, with a shrug of hisrnshoulders. \"Maybe not to you, but to the others? I think they might not likernit. Assassins tend to get very irritated when someone else takesrntheir job.\" She replied as she wound the cloth around her shoulderrnthen tied it off using her free hand and her teeth. \"And I'll betrnthey aren't too far behind you.\" They both heard the noise at the same time; a soft rustling ofrnfootsteps on the carpet. The man's eyes flicked towards thernentryway to the living room then, ducked backwards as a barrage ofrngunfire hit the wall, muffled by the silencer over the barrel. \"Vincent you son of a btch!\" A man's voice screamed furiously. \"Friend of yours?\" Mkenzie asked a slight smirk plastered on herrnface. Vincent didn't answer. He leaned against the wall, eyes closed,rnlistening. Another series of gunshots splattered against the wall,rnthen, the soft click of a magazine being ejected. Vincent steppedrninto the entryway and fired. The man, who had just reloaded hisrnweapon, didn't have time to move out of the way. Two bullets in thernchest and one in the head ended the issue quickly. Mkenzie knew thisrnwas her time to act. As soon as Vincent turned and began to fire shernleapt forward. He saw the motion and turned, but didn't have enoughrntime to bring the barrel of the gun in her direction. A high kickrnsent the weapon flying out of his hands and into the living room,rnwhere it landed with a clatter next to the body of the other man.rnAnother hard kick sent him stumbling backwards. \"Didn't I tell you? And he's not the only one.\" Mkenzie saidrnas she slowly backed into the living room. Vincent stood up and started towards her, his eyes never leavingrnher face. He was watching, waiting for her to make a move, and hernalready knew what her next move would be. She would go for the gun.rnIt was her only chance and he knew she would go for it. He would letrnher pick it up, but she would never fire it. Mkenzie paused next to the body of the other man. She looked down atrnit. \"Kevin Johnson\" She said calmly. \"New to the trade and not veryrnsmart I might add. Any idiot should know you don't simply emptyrnyour gun like that, and right out in the open too.\" \"They often make the mistake of overconfidence.\" Vincent saidrncoolly his gaze never wavering from his target's face. \"Kevin did that a lot. To tell you the truth I'm surprised hernlived this long, especially with the way he liked to screw thingsrnup.\" She laughed \"You did Armys a favor I think; too bad yournwon't get paid for that one.\" \"No, but I expect to get paid for another.\" She didn't answer. Vincent saw her gaze shift, for just a second,rndown to the gun at her feet. Then she went after it. As soon as she moved Vincent jumped forward, bringing out hisrnswitchblade at the same time. He spun her around and brought thernknife to her throat. She dropped the gun and grabbed his arm, tryingrnto pull the knife away from her neck. Almost simultaneously shernkicked upwards and hit him in the face with her knee. Vincent jerkedrnbackwards and dropped the knife, but regained his balance quickly andrnswiftly kicked her legs out from under her. She landed on her back,rnrolled and the next thing he knew she had his gun in her hand and itrnwas pointed at him. He backed up slightly and she stood up, her eyesrnblazing, and then she just stood there, unmoving. Well, what are you waiting for? Shoot him! I…I can't. You can't? Yes, you can! Just pull the damn trigger! No, I won't go back to that. It doesn't matter what you want. Whatever you try to do, it willrnalways be a part of you. Vincent watched her for a moment, and then smiled. She couldn'trnshoot him. However she tried to threaten him, she would never pullrnthat trigger. He took a step toward her. \"Put the gun downrnJuanita.\" Mkenzie's jaw dropped. \"Excuse me? Drop the gun? Are you insane?\" \"You won't pull that trigger; I can see it in you eyes. You won'trndo it. You write files on assassins, you might know how they work,rnbut I doubt you even know how to handle that thing.\" Mkenzie scowled and chewed her lower lip. \"You must think you'rernreally smart, don't you?\" Vincent's lip twitched slightly. \"Like I said, I do this for arnliving.\" \"Ah, but didn't Armys tell you?\" She retorted, as she slid backrnthe hammer on the weapon. \"So do I.\" Vincent reacted faster than Mkenzie did. He reached his hand out andrnpushed the gun to the side. Reflexively, Mkenzie pulled the trigger.rnVincent twisted the weapon out of her hand and slammed his fist intornthe side of her head. She stumbled and fell, but with the adrenalinernrushing through her veins she recovered quickly and lashed her footrnout, catching him in the knee. Her hand touched something metallicrnand she hastily snatched up Vincent's switchblade. Her hard kickrnhad slowed him, but only slightly and she had about three secondsrnbefore he recovered and shot her. Three seconds was all she needed.rnMkenzie flicked her wrist and the switchblade flew from her fingers.rnHer aim however was spoilt by the fact that she had used her injuredrnarm. The knife sliced across the side of Vincent's neck, not enoughrnto kill him, but enough to make him stumble backwards and trip overrnKevin's body. Mkenzie saw her chance and leapt up and sprang forrnthe door. She didn't like the idea of running away, but Mkenziernwasn't stupid. She was injured and knew that she could not hope tornwin this fight. Especially if she couldn't make herself kill him,rneven if she got the chance. She tore open the door and ran. As shernentered the hall a bullet whizzed by her head and hit the wall. Byrnnow the adrenaline rush was wearing off, but even though she was weakrnand dizzy, she somehow managed to reach the lobby a head of Vincent.rnFrantically she looked around, and suddenly she saw her means ofrnescape. Marcus' keys were still on the front desk, where she hadrnseen them earlier. Hastily she snatched them up and ran to the doorrnto the parking garage. Please be somewhere close, she prayed.rnLuck was with her this time. Almost as soon as she entered the garagernshe spied the blue Honda nestled between a red Volvo and a blackrnToyota. She hastily unlocked the door, expecting Vincent to enter atrnany moment, then threw open the door and climbed in. Her hands werernshaking so hard she could barely fit the key into the ignition. Nornidea how the hell I'm going to be able to drive this thing. Shernthought when she finally got it started and pulled out, not payingrnattention to the small noises coming from the trunk. Vincent swore violently as he jumped up and raced after his target.rnHe entered the lobby, his sharp eyes searching, completely ignoringrnthe couple staring at him in terror. He hesitated for just a momentrnto consider which way she might have gone. There were more optionsrnthan he liked. The front entrance was the most likely choice, butrnthere was also the elevator, the parking garage and two emergencyrnexits. He paused, and then saw the trail of blood that led toward therngarage. When he entered the garage he couldn't believe what he wasrnseeing. The blue Honda that he had put the little girl into was beingrndriven away; driven away by his target. Vincent raised his gun andrnfired rapidly into the back window of the car. The glass shatteredrnand there was a cry of pain, indicating that he had hit. However, itrnapparently hadn't injured her enough, because the vehicle was stillrnrapidly disappearing from sight. Forrna long moment Vincent just stood there staring at the place where therncar had disappeared, her last words still ringing in his ears. Sorndo I. JuanitarnMontoya was an assassin? He had been through her entire file and thatrninformation had not been in there. Why hadn't Armys told him? Shernhad worked for him for seven years, he would have known. That littlerntidbit of information was not something one simply left out. But,rnwait. Juanita wrote the files for most of the assassins under thernemploy of the mafia, which meant that she would have had access tornher own file. She could have deleted it. However that still raisedrnthe question; did Armys know or not? That was what he was going tornfind out. Vincent turned and started back towards the apartments; he had leftrnhis bag in the room and needed to retrieve it before the policernshowed up. He stopped for a moment a glanced back for one last lookrnat the place she had left. \"Enjoyrnyour freedom while it lasts Juanita.\" He said coldly, \"This isrnfar from over.\" Then he turned and left. Ohrnyes, this was far from over, but first Armys had some explaining torndo. Ooooh,rndid you like this chapter? It was so hard to write. Well tell me whatrnyou all think. Was anyone disappointed?[Chapter 7] Ok here is chapter 7. Enjoy :-D And don't forget to leave a review (They make me very very happy) Chapter 7 Enter the FBI Detective William Stevens stared at the mess in front of him in complete silence. A veteran detective in his early forties, he had seen worse. He didn't say a word as he walked around the apartment, brown eyes darting back and forth as he surveyed the scene. Silently he stepped around the body on the floor and stopped to watch the man currently dusting for prints on a nearby table. The man cringed slightly at the other's scrutiny of his work. Everyone else in the room went about their own work quickly and efficiently, making sure to give the detective plenty of space… as they all waited for the inevitable explosion to occur. It was well known to all of them that Detective Stevens had a violent temper and given the right circumstances would verbally lash out at anyone unfortunate enough to cross his path. The fact that Juanita Montoya, Steven's prime witness in his case against Armys Delgado, had disappeared, her apartment in shambles, and the end result of an apparent gunfight lying on the floor was enough to make all the police officers and Crime Scene Investigators wish they were somewhere else. Oddly enough the explosion they were all waiting for never happened. Instead, he turned and approached a tall young man in his early thirties, with light brown hair and blue eyes, who was currently writing something down on a pad of paper. Agent John Ferrera swallowed hard as Stevens approached him then waited for the other man to speak. For a long moment Stevens pierced Ferrera with his cold gaze, without saying anything, and then, very calmly asked, \"What happened here?\" Ferrera hesitated, unsure of what to say. The wrong words could set off Stevens' infamous temper in a heartbeat. He swallowed again. \"I…I haven't had enough time to collect all the details sir. I just arrived here a few minutes ago.\" He said carefully. He didn't know why he addressed Stevens as \"sir\". Stevens should be the one explaining things to him, not frowning at him as he were a teenager who had spoken out of line, after all Ferrera was a member of the FBI and he had the authority over Stevens, even if Stevens was ten years his senior. Stevens sighed, almost like he was wondering why he had wasted his time, then nodded and turned away. \"It looks like a gunfight broke out…\" Ferrera started. Before he was even able to finish his sentence, he knew he had made a mistake. Stevens spun around and narrowed his eyes at Ferrera. Ferrera froze, not noticing the room had gone quiet and most of the people were now looking at him. He opened his mouth, hoping he could say something useful, but Stevens spoke first. \"Is that all you learned?\" He asked quietly and calmly, but he had an edge in his voice like he was trying not to yell. \"Yes, sir.\" Ferrera said, trying to look eye to eye with the other man. Stevens sighed again. \"If that's all you have learned then I'm afraid you are not much use here. I think you should leave.\" Ferrera frowned. He knew Stevens didn't like anyone in the FBI; especially the agents that he thought had taken credit for many of his cases. Agents like John Ferrera. \"I only just arrived Will, and I don't think my superiors would like it if I just left without gathering all the facts.\" \"You mean you don't want to leave until you have enough information to steal my case.\" \"Juanita Montoya is connected too closely with Armys Delgado. We can't allow Armys to get off again. Now, the FBI is officially taking over this case and…\" \"Juanita Montoya is my witness, she's gone and it looks to me like Armys hired someone to get rid of her. This case is mine.\" Stevens started to walk away then stopped. \"And don't ever call me Will again.\" He turned towards an officer standing nearby. \"Ok Tom, enlighten me. What exactly happened here?\" \"Sir, I must protest…\" Ferrera said exasperated, interrupting the officer as he started to speak. \"Must you really?\" Stevens asked patronizingly, looking at Ferrera as if he were a child that needed to be placated, but his words were full of sarcasm and disdain. \"Because it really does annoy most people and it does absolutely no good when the person you are protesting to isn't listening.\" Ferrera grimaced and, gathering up his courage said, \"Will, I don't want to throw you completely off this case, but I can't have you getting in the way. Now, you can either cooperate or get yourself assigned to a desk job.\" Stevens' lip twitched slightly \"Do you even know anything about this case or did you just volunteer so you could feel special?\" \"I know enough about the case, my superiors said you would fill me in on the rest.\" \"You're out of your mind.\" \"Maybe, but you still…\" \"Alright, alright!\" Stevens snarled, \"Just step outside and give me a minute to talk to these guys.\" \"Step outside? Why?\" \"Because I don't like you. Now get out.\" Ferrera scowled, but complied. There was no use in staying really; if he stayed Stevens would simply make sure he didn't learn anything. That was Stevens alright. Even if he was taken off the case, Stevens would somehow make sure that Ferrera still came to him for information. Ferrera waited for over an hour before Stevens finally walked out. He walked right by Ferrera without so much as a glance and continued down the hall towards the lobby. Ferrera fell in step behind him, wanting to ask questions, but afraid of what Stevens might do. \"What do you already know about the case?\" Stevens asked suddenly as he stepped out into the windy streets. \"Juanita Montoya, high- level player in the Italian Mafia, wants some sort of revenge against Armys Delgado and decides to come clean and help put him away.\" \"Is that it?\" Stevens asked, frowning, \"Surely you would know more than that.\" Ferrera's face turned red. \"That's all I was told. You know the rest, I assume?\" Stevens rolled his eyes, and then sighed in resignation. There was no use fighting anymore. The FBI had already taken his case, he might as well give Ferrera the information now and spare himself the trouble later. \"Juanita was the file- keeper for the Mafia. A lot of the files on the various assassins we've been able to get our hands on were written by her. She also had access to the various \"projects\" the Mafia was planning.\" Stevens stopped by a black Sedan parked by the curb. He opened the front passenger side door and reached inside. \"Here, take this.\" He said, handing a black file folder to Ferrera. Ferrera took the folder and opened it. On the very front page was a picture of a young Portuguese woman in her mid twenties, with an olive complexion, shoulder length wavy black hair and dark brown eyes. \"I thought the Mafia didn't let non- Italians get so high up.\" Ferrera said as he studied the picture. \"They don't.\" Stevens said as he closed the car door and started walking away. \"She had connections though. Her foster father, Nicholas, was pretty high up and was able to pull a few strings.\" \"Where are you going?\" Ferrera asked suddenly, when he realized that Stevens was walking away from the apartment instead of back towards it. \"Coffee.\" Stevens mumbled. \"Ah.\" They walked in silence for a minute or two when Ferrera remembered something Stevens had said. \"What did you say her father's name was?\" \"Nicholas.\" And he's not her biological father, he's her adopted father.\" Ferrera stopped walking. \"Nicholas?\" He asked incredulously, \"Nicholas Montoya? You've got to be kidding me. I mean I realized they shared the same last name, but I didn't think they were related, especially after looking at that picture. Stevens shook his head. How did the FBI get to hiring an idiot like John Ferrera? He thought. \"Nicholas Montoya was the Mafia's number one assassin. I mean, this guy was one of the best.\" He said, \"Somewhere along the line however, Nicholas did something that really pissed Armys off, we're not sure what exactly, but Armys had him executed. His foster daughter, Juanita, decides to pay him back by ruining his life. Well, as you can imagine Armys wasn't too happy about that. We now know what he planned to do about it. Oddly enough, we think that Mark Antony, Nicholas' biological son, is still working for Armys. Mark is the Mafia's main contact for their assassins. Why Armys hasn't killed him yet is beyond me, but then, Armys always was arrogant. He probably doesn't think of Mark as a threat.\" Ferrera digested the information for a moment. \"I'm confused.\" He said slowly. \"Surprise, Surprise.\" Stevens mumbled. \"I meant the name. Montoya? It doesn't sound like an Italian name.\" \"It isn't, and it isn't Nicholas' real last name either. He changed it, but we were never able to find out what his real last name was.\" \"Interesting choice though.\" \"I suppose.\" Stevens said carefully, suddenly very suspicious of Ferrera. The FBI wasn't stupid and they didn't simply send agents into a case without giving them all the information they had to offer. Ferrera should already know about Juanita, why didn't he? \"So, what made Juanita decide to come to us?\" Ferrera asked casually. That was too much for Stevens. \"Ok, what the hell do you think you're doing?\" he said fiercely, glaring down at the other man. Ferrera looked surprised. \"Excuse me?\" He asked carefully, looking at Stevens as if he were insane. \"The FBI didn't give you this case did they?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You know exactly what I mean, you little shit. The FBI doesn't send agents out without giving them all the information they got, and you don't know a damn thing about this case. Now what the hell are you trying to pull?\" \"Look Will, I know you want to believe I'm trying to steal your case, but you've got it all wrong.\" Stevens crossed his arms in front of his chest. \"Well then, enlighten me.\" Ferrera swallowed hard, suddenly feeling very small. \"I…\" he started. \"Detective Stevens!\" A voice behind them called out. Ferrera let out a sigh of relief. Thank heavens he hadn't had to answer! That definitely would have set off Stevens temper, and Ferrera had a feeling Stevens wouldn't have stopped with just a verbal attack. \"Detective Stevens!\" The voice called out again. Stevens threw one last deadly glare at Ferrera, and then turned around to face Officer Thomas White, a short thin man with fiery red hair, freckles and shifty green eyes, who looked more like a nerd in high- school then a police officer working to join the SWAT team. White was out of breath when he reached the other men, having had to run to catch up with them. \"Detective I think you should take a look at this.\" White said breathlessly. \"What is it?\" White beckoned with his hand and started to turn away. \"It's easier to explain if I show you.\" Steven nodded and started to follow White back to the apartment. Ferrera started to follow as well, but was stopped by Stevens. \"You, stay out of this.\" He growled. \"Will…\" You little shit! I told you not to call me that. Stay the hell out of this. This is NOT your case.\" Stevens snapped, finally starting to lose his temper. Then without another word he turned and walked away. This time Ferrera did not follow. Instead he stood there, gripping the file folder tightly in his left hand, the other hand balled into a tight fist. He glared furiously at Stevens receding back. He had never felt so humiliated. Stevens would pay for that. \"I hope you're fond of desk jobs,\" he growled quietly, \"because that's all you're going to get for a long time.\" Review Replies SpadesJade: I know what you mean.

He bumps into a stranger, or so it seems… 'Sorry, are you okay? The guy in the suit says while putting down his briefcase, the other man also puts his briefcase on the ground. 'Yeah, yeah I am mate. Enjoy LA man' the other man says with a smile on his face. Vincent grabs the briefcase of the other man and he leaves the airport, while the other picks up Vincent's briefcase and disappears. Outside with other taxis. 'Even if the sky is falling down' man I love this tune, hopefully customers won't come and ruin my chillaxing time, but hey I need them to come if I need money. The door opens and a guy with an expensive looking suit enters my cab, I quickly put the music down and say 'Hello' 'Hi, can you take me to 452 South Union Street' 'Gotcha' I start driving towards his destination, man this guy is obviously rich, well I hope he gives me a good tip. 'So how long do you think it'll take?' 'Um, I don't know' 'U don't know?' eyebrow arching 'Well, I can probably guess, but it'll probably earn u a free ride, which would suck for me' I see him smiling in my centre mirror, it's kinda cute, and he seems cool as well Weird kid, but oh well 'But I have to say, your cab is pretty clean' 'Hahaha well yeah, my mum says the cab is miles cleaner than my room' 'Mum?' I feel my cheeks burn 'I-well meant my mother' seems like she's embarrassed, cute. 'Uh huh? How old are you?' 'I'm eighteen' young 'Are you a high school dropout?' 'No way, I just need extra cash, you know, to take care of my family and besides I'm on holiday so its fine for a few months' 'You're pretty cool you know' 'Um, well thanks' feeling my cheeks getting hot again 'I like people like you, you're someone whose pro-active' 'Well I can be lazy' 'Hahaha' This guy is not a stressful customer, phew and he's cute which is a plus hehee. 452 South Union Street 9:28pm 'Well here we are' working out the price 'Um, listen, I'm in town on a real estate deal. One night, collect signatures, see some friends. Then I got a six am out of LAX. Why don't you hang with me for the night? 'Well - er – I'd love to, but it's against regs, and my shift fins-' 'How about I give you six hundred dollars' whipping cash out and displaying it like a fan in his hand, just like magic. 'And an extra hundred if you get me to LAX and I don't run for my plane' I could not stop staring at the money; I mean normally I earn like two fifty to four hundred a shift, I could earn like seven hundred in one night, well if this guy insists. 'Okay, I guess' suddenly feeling guilty Smiling he says 'Here's three hundred down already' putting cash in my hand and giving me a firm handshake at the same time. 'What's your name?' 'Raven' 'I'm Vincent' and telling me to go round the back, I leave him to his business. I park the car, and putting my music up loud again, ah great my favorite song is playing, I start singing along with the music 'I'm only gonna break break your, break break your heart' I look at the back and see his expensive looking briefcase, man this guy is all about expensive looking huh? Jeez rich people, I feel like I was tricked, but oh well I got more than a good tip so it's all good. Some of this can go towards Melanie and Melissa, and I can spend some of it on me as well. I start singing again as the chorus comes on again. 'If fall for me, I'm not easy to please, I might tear you apart, told you from the start, baby from the start, I'm onl-' WHAM! The cab starts rocking on its wheels, and I hear glass raining down I crouch into a ball, man I feel like my cab is gonna explode or something, and then sudden silence. What the hell? An earthquake? I look through the windshield to see what's happened, a face of a dead man stares at me, I make a stupid high pitched 'eeeee' sound and frantically get out of the cab, well I actually fall out of the cab in a panic, I shakily get up and take a deep breath. Okay the guy is angled across part of my cab roof and the windshield. Dude's wearing a bathrobe, and there are shards of glass everywhere, it makes a halo around my cab, where the hell did that much glass come from. I look up; I see the window on the top floor is broken out, its white curtain flaps in the breeze. Hmm I see, so that's how it is, the guy jumped, ah poor dude, was living in a crappy apartment and being overweight too much for you? But still, you didn't have to fall on my cab now did you? Jeez. What the hell? Why's Raven out of her cab, shit I see my guy had landed on our cab, great. I see Vincent entering the alley, and stopping suddenly 'Yo Vincent' She's amazingly calm even though a dead guy landed on her cab; I'm surprised she can keep her head in this not so normal situation. 'You see this? The guy's a jumper, but he landed on my car' Pfft pretty innocent this kid 'Think he's dead, guesss we should call the police or something' 'I don't think so' 'Oh ok' Wait, he doesn't want to call anyone, what? He wants to leave the guy here or something, and I have this sudden feeling that Vincent has something to do with our dead guy here. 'Um, did you by any chance throw him out of the window?' please let me be wrong 'No' phew 'I shot him, the bullets and the fall killed him' Ah 'Heh I prefer my suicide story' slowly retreating backwards 'Whoa. Wait, red light Raven' aiming a gun at me, fuck, this can't be happening, this is surreal, is this some fucking movie or something? 'Oi' Oops I completely ignored the guy with gun while I was having the mental babble in my head 'Sorry' shit this is it Guess I should kill her, but that would probably draw more attention, well she seems to be fairing well and it's not like she'll be able to go up against me. 'Pop the trunk' I'm lost 'Huh?' '.Trunk' he wants me to go in there, he's not gonna kill me? I get to my cab and push the button 'Okay come here' I follow him to the side of my cab, and without warning he pulls off the dead guy off my cab, I recoil back, shit! 'Grab his hands' 'Huh? Why the fuck would I want to do that for' crossing my arms What's this? Get rid of the nice girl cab driver and all you got is a sulky teenager. Great. 'Well I can't leave him here, so unless you want fatso riding up with you…..and given the hygiene and his sphincters, let's put him in the trunk' 'But I don't wanna' 'Well given what I got in my back pocket, you don't have much of a choice' giving me a spine chilling smile 'Fine' I grab the guy's forearms and lift; damn this guy's heavy, then 'Waaaah' I drop the body and flinch away 'What the hell are you doing!' 'He was twitching, so he's like alive right?' 'He was having a fucking dead guy's spasm, so stop acting like a pussy and lift!' She lifts the body, but I hear I mumble 'fucking retard, as if I would know that dead guys would have spasms' I couldn't help but smile 'Well you better get used to it' Wise guy We heave the body inside the trunk, and I start getting my breath back. Vincent throws his tie into the truck and says to the dead guys 'Never heard of a treadmill?' Before slamming the trunk. Would love for reviews plz :) x[Chapter 2] Six litres of blood and you had to get it on the cab, pouring bottled water all over the cab, there that should be good enough. 'Oi, kid get in the car' I look and see she has something to say, but is biting her lip, hesitating. 'Um, why don't you take the cab?' 'Take the cab?' 'Yeah, you see, if you take it, you won't have to deal with my bullshit, and hey don't worry about the seven hundred bucks, and no one checks these cabs anyway, and later I'll say that er, that, well I won't tell anyone' 'Really' I nod 'You won't tell anyone' I nod again 'That's nice of you, now get in the fucking cab!' damnnit! It didn't work 'Tch' it was worth a try I get in, Vincent gets in the back and I turn the engine on and pull out of the alley into the main streets. While the taxi leaves, another car appears, it cruises down the street and stops in front of the apartment building. A guy emerges, gel backed hair, an earring, black suit, could be a player or a dealer, well he looks like he could kick your ass if he wanted to, he heads towards the entry gate, rings the buzzer, waits. Rings again. Nothing. He pulls a thin plastic card from an inner pocket of his jacket and jimmies the door lock. He goes up to the third floor and goes along the walkway looking for the right room. He knocks on a door, the door swings in slightly; he glances down and sees the lock was pulled. He tenses and his hand goes to his holster at his hip, and draws a Beretta, and pushes the door all the way open. The room is in shambles, old take outs rotting everywhere, a TV left on, the guy looks around cautiously, alert for any movement or sound. 'Ramone? Estas fiestando con una chica? Nobody answers, the guy is worried now, and warily enters the bedroom, and he sees the broken window, its glass missing, he leans out and sees a circle of broken glass and in the centre a big blank spot. 'Fuck' and he produces a radio 'Detective Fanning here, we got situation at South Union' he's a cop. 'Okay go to 7565 Fountain. You know it?' looking at his PC 'Huh? Why?' 'Were you deaf? I said I had five stops to make, one down four to go' 'But, aren't you gonna just throw them all out of a window' 'He fell' 'Same thing, you were the cause' 'Er, not really' really don't get her point here 'Just shush, anyway who was he? What did he do to you?' 'He was a nobody and nothing' 'Nothing? So you meet a guy and you shoot the hell out of him' 'Look bitch, why are you getting so worried about it? Just keep driving and stop asking questions' Shaking my head I say 'Man, seriously' I keep driving still thinking about it, hmmm 'Wait! You, you're a, you can't be a hired hitman?' 'Wow congratulations, great, well done you, for using your common sense' I pout 'now I feel like you're babying me or something' 'Yeah I am, and fatso in the back was apart of a criminal organization' 'Yeah but you're obviously working for another criminal organization' smart kid 'How do you know things like this?' 'Watch the right movies and you're educated' Heh I guess, but kid in the movies the good guy always wins, but in real life, the bad guys are the ones who win. Suddenly, I'm distracted by flashing lights behind me, and I see oh no, an LAPD cruiser behind us, the rooftop lights flashing. 'Shit' 'Great, just my fucking luck' 'Please pull the vehicle over to the curb' ah so they were after us, damn, damn damn. I pull over, and through my centre window I see two cops emerging from the patrol car, approaching us slowly 'Get rid of them' 'How' 'You're a girl, use your sex appeal, and get them to go away' 'S-Sex appeal' blushing yet again 'look man I'm no slut so I have no idea how to seduce a guy, and I never been with one, and being all girly girl isn't exactly my forte' I guess I understand, the way she dresses in all black, and I don't see any cleavage 'Anyway, get rid of them' The cops are now circling to either side of the cab, using torchlight's I look back and see Vincent taking the briefcase off his lap, and spreading opening his jacket, if he does that, it mean s he can reach for his gun easily. 'Wait, don't do anything' Referring to the cops he says 'probably married' A cop's hand raps loudly on the window his gold wedding band catching the light as it taps on the glass, I feel a stab in my heart, please let everything go alright. 'Maybe that one's got kids. Maybe his wife's pregnant' this cold hearted bastard 'I got this dude' rolling down the window 'Hello' I smile The cop on my side shines torchlight at me, and the one on the other side check Vincent in the back, I see him smile so good naturedly in my mirror. Oi oi stop the act, you are so not good natured. The cop on my side says 'Hi, license and registration please' I get them out of my purse and hand them over, the cop examines them. 'We pulled you over because your windshield's smashed, all of this current? 'Yes, officer' I noticed that the cop has been beaming his torchlight on the cracked windshield and damaged hood, with a serious look. 'Is this blood?' Shit! 'Yeah' my throat is dry 'How did this happen?' Gotta think fast 'Well a deer bashed into my car' A deer? really kid, nice imagination 'Where?' 'Slauson' I say a bit too quickly too fast kid, they are gonna clock on, but well done for not doing anything stupid 'A South Central Deer? Ooh how you gonna answer this kid? 'I-How the hell I'm supposed to know if its south or north or eastern? All I know the thing had four legs and two sticks coming out of its head' Pfffttt it's too much, I can't hold it in I'm gonna laugh I hear all three of them sniggering, I press on 'But I had a passenger, and his wife is at home alone and needs medication cuz, she- she's got Huntington's and as to have treatment like soon. I tried to tell him I couldn't but he insisted and I didn't' wanna be responsible for something wrong' wow that's some impressive skills there, it's a good thing I didn't kill you, now I need to do my act 'Is this true?' asking Vincent 'yes officer it is, I'm sorry for any trouble I've cause for my selfishness' 'No don't worry sir, and kid hurry and drop him and get back to the barn, I'll call your depot' 'Yes, thank you officers' Vincent watched both cops pile into the police car, and drive off, he turns to the front and sees Raven, her forehead on the steering wheel, deep breathing. 'That was a really good story' I get up and glare at him 'Yeah, well I didn't do it for you, I did it so they wouldn't get killed' she's shaking again but there's no fear, she's got guts this one, she dares to look at me with anger in her eyes. 'Anyways we've got a job to do, so drive' 'Damn you!' 'Stop whining'[Chapter 3] We stop; I see the penthouse, looks rich. 'I thought Californians exercised?' Vincent's talking to himself, I look at the centre mirror, he's looking at his PC, and then he pulls an identity card, and shit! A second gun from his briefcase. I turn slightly so I can better see his gun, he moves the slide, and I see a round in the chamber, as he holsters it in the small of his back, he notices me looking, damn! 'What you looking at! He sounds angry 'N-Nothing' facing forward He gets out and enters the passenger seat next to me, I watch him carefully for any violent moves. 'Hands on the wheel' that's weird 'Eh? Why?' 'Cuz I told you to' 'That's no reason' but I put my hands on the wheel anyway, and he quickly binds my hands to the steering wheel with, I can't believe this, plastic ties, are assassins too cheap to go round buying handcuffs, because if anyone was to see this, its fucking embarrassing. Ah, just realized I can't escape, damn he's sharp. As he heads out of the car…. 'Ravvvveeeennnn' my dispatch radio whines in a bitchy female voice 'That bitch' I hate my dispatcher, I hate her so much I wish she could die from her sun beds 'Oi bitch! I know you're out there, I know how you're trying to ignore me, pick up the radio you whore!' Grrr, if I wasn't tied to the steering wheel I would have a few words to say of my own to her, that blonde bitch! 'Who..is that?' Oh yeah, Vincent hasn't left 'Christina, my dispatcher' 'Oiii, pick it up, or I'll force you to do morning shifts' 'Look man, I gotta answer it, she'll just carry on, and on, and her voice is like a fucking bug, just annoying the shit out of you' I can't believe I'm pleading with him, but I don't want my mornings off gone, that's precious time for me. Vincent sits back down beside me and reaches across and pulls the mike off the dash, and holds it up to my mouth 'Don't blow it' he stares at my eyes, a silent but threatening gesture I nod, Vincent thumbs the toggle 'Yo, mega bitch wassup?' don't worry I always talk to her like this 'I just got off the fucking phone with the fucking cops, and they keep calling to check you brought the cab in' oh yeah. I look at Vincent, he shrugs and thumbs the toggle, what a big help he is. 'Yeah? So?' ''Well bitch, first thing, I hate talking to cops; second they told me you crashed the fucking cab?' 'Ah that, a deer crashed into me! I never-' 'I don't care; this is coming out of your pocket' 'What the fuck? Fuc-' 'Wait' switching the toggle off I see she's angry, angrier then she is with me 'Tell her it was an accident, you're are not liable' what? you want me to act so posh and polite, no way! 'Bullshit! It was an accident, I ain't liable' you could have not said bullshit, but then again her dispatcher is very harsh on her, she hasn't done anything wrong 'Whatever bitch, I hate you, so I'm making you liable' 'Watch when I fucking come down there and slap all that fucking make up off your face!...' well I'm glad she's responding and arguing back but she's doing it the very unintelligent way. Vincent quickly puts the mike to his mouth and thumbs the toggle. Eh? Weren't I in the middle of an argument 'She's not paying you a damn thing' 'Who the hell are you jack ass!' 'Richard Ricardo, Assistant U.S Attorney, 'just because you hate her?' what kind of bullshit is that! She's a hard working girl, and you know that your collision policy and general liability will cover the damages' '….' 'Wow, you got her to shut up, that a feat that's never been accomplished, you are really good at acting' Vincent clicks off, hangs up the mike. He smiles 'don't wait up hon, I gotta work late' He grabs the ignition keys, and shuts my door and strolls away, I mumble 'Don't call me hon, you old pervert' I watch through my windshield as he vanishes into the building, and I'm left alone, trapped in my own cab in the alley, I jerk and strain and pull against the plastics ties, trying to free my hands, it doesn't work, I give up, already breathing heavily. Meanwhile in the penthouse An overweight lawyer separates from two girls and a second man to answer a phone 'He identify himself?...Sure let him up' Back in the cab 'You could of left the music on' I wonder why this had to happen, I mean it started off like any other night, ah I guess it's a coincidence, well I hope it is. I look through the windshield, its empty, it's kinda scary, and something catches my eye, I look at the top of the penthouse, and see a flash light up the window, like flashbulbs going off, and another flash, oh no, it can't be, a third flash, jesus! Is it him? 'Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit' how many times did he fire his gun, did he kill anyone innocent up there?, man…He's gonna kill me, not now, but eventually he'll pull the trigger on me, I'm really scared, I wanna go home… I then see a moving silhouette, its Vincent he looks so calm and collected, and then out of no where these two white guys come out. 'Yo whassup?' Both men are in baggies, hoodies and they have lots of tattoos, very suspicious people. One pulls out a gun and aims it at Vincent, yep very suspicious people. 'Give me your wallet!' 'Woah, hey homie' 'You want my money?' I feel like something bad is going to happen One guy approaches Vincent from the front, and the other circles and approaches his Vincent's left, pulling his gun out 'Yeah, yeah I do want your money and anything else you got' He closes on Vincent with the gun aimed to Vincent's head, then without warning Vincent's slam's aside the other man's gun. Draws his gun and BANG BANG, the first guy receives two very loud gunshots, then Vincent swivels to the left and BANG BANG BANG, the other guy is dead before he hits the ground, Shit that all happened in like two seconds. Fuck I'm shaking. The guys never saw it coming, the second guy is dead, the other is on the ground, he seems to be moaning, BANG, I hear the echo of the gunshot in my ear, that…that was harsh….shooting him in the..the head…, I'm frozen, I…I can't. The passenger door opens and Vincent enters. 'Hey' 'Um, Hey' 'Let me get those' He flicks his hand, a folding switchblade, razor sharp; he leans over and he frees my hand from the steering wheel 'Oh look, you're low on gas' 'Huh? Oh Yeah?' Looks like the realization of what's happening has sunk in and she fully understands what is happening, well about time I reckon[Chapter 4] We're at a gas station; I'm filling up my car, Vincent's off to the side. He's so calm it's unnerving, it's like what happened earlier did not happen. I…I just witnessed a violent death, and on top of that just realized the lethal capabilities of Vincent; he's a natural born killer. I have to be careful with this guy, and not piss him off. But there's this one question I wanna ask. 'Uh, Vincent, have you ever heard of collateral?' 'Yeah, someone who at the wrong at the wrong time, they didn't need to be killed' 'Vincent?' her voice is so soft now, I can hardly hear her 'Am I collateral?' there's a long pause before Vincent answers me 'I haven't decided' a glimmer of hope? I don't know what he means by that but if there is a time when Vincent draws a gun on me I'm fighting for my life. 'But hey! New news. We're ahead of schedule' HUH? What's with his unexpectedly mood change! 'Oookay?' 'We got time to kill, so do you like jazz?' 'Err, to be honest….No' 'Anyway this guy told me about a place off Crenshaw. Leimert Park, where all the West Coast greats played. Dexter Gordon, Thelonious Monk. Chet Baker' who the hell are they? I don't know any of them Heh, guess she doesn't know who they are, well the young people today aren't into jazz as we were, but I ain't going there cuz of the jazz…I have a job to do there….. 'I'll buy you a drink, and the jazz will expand your horizons' I still don't get his mood change, he's like really excited now, oh well at least he ain't gonna kill anyone. For now. Meanwhile, at South Union Apartment Building…. The alley is filling up with police cars, cops and forensic technicians, and Ray Fanning, and his superior Weidner enter the crime scene 'This informant of yours, what's his name, Ramone?' 'Yeah Ramone Gallardo, supposed to take him out for a drink. I come here, find this' indicting to the glass 'You've been working him?' 'Four moths, a low level player, he's been feeding me stuff on Felix-R' '- Reyes-Torrnna? Forget that man; the feds are all over that. They don't want us anywhere near it' 'Who cares? My C.I flew out of a window, he's got Felix's handprints on his ass, and so that makes it ours!' 'Where's the homicide Ray? Where's a body? All we got is glass' 'And blood….' A criminalist says 'Huh?' 'Look, blood down here, and in the glass…and here's some more….and small splatter patterns here' shining her torch to show it the two cops. 'So Ramone flew out of the window, went splat, glass here, and then some tires roll over it' 'Maybe he jumped' 'Sure, he depressed so he jumps four stories out of a window onto is head ''Wow that feels better!'' Picks himself up. '' Now, I think I'll go on with the rest of my day'' I don't think so' 'Ray! Catch' Ray looks up and see a cop at the broken window dangling a clear plastic baggy. He drops it, and its falls in to Fanning' grasp, he shows it to Weidner, the bag contains two shell casings. Hmmm Weidner sees another cop and asks him 'So, any witnesses? 'Well, an old guy across the street, who lives above the deli, he says he saw a cab parked here earlier tonight, and saw a guy and a girl working under the hood' 'Descriptions of them? What exactly did he see?' 'Well he says the guy was wearing a suit, and the girl was in black clothes, and she looked hot, but the old guy does have glasses like coke bottles' 'And what kind of cab?' Fanning asks 'He says it's definitely a taxi cab' 'There are four thousand taxis in LA County, anything else?' Silence However, Fanning lost in thought… 'Hey Weidner, remember in 2001 in Oakland, a cabbie drove around all night, killing three people and then flipped out and put the gun to his head?' 'Yeah, So what?' 'So the Oakland detective, whatisname, he never bought' 'Why?' Weidner is now interested at what Fanning is getting at. 'Well the cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness, and just pops three people, and then himself? And the victims weren't random; they were involved in a pharmaceutical scam' 'Okay, so what did the detective think?' 'That there was somebody else in that cab' At Daniel's Jazz Club… The club is dark and elegant, the room has a 60's modern jazz atmosphere, with the low ceilings, small tables, leatherette booths, and the room is full of history. A jazz quartet playing on stage, and customers clustered at small tables watching the band play. And on one table is Vincent and Raven….. 'This...is jazz?' man its so dry, and there's no one singing, or dancing 'Yup' 'You're really an old man you know?' 'Hahaha, you need to enjoy it, look if you hear the music, you'll notice he's off melody, behind the notes, improvising off impulse. Kind of like…tonight' looking at me with a grin on his face 'Yeah, I can agree with you there' putting my elbow on the table and placing my chin in my hand, emphasizing that I'm still bored. A waitress arrives with a tray of drinks, and places a drink in front of me. I didn't order this. 'Um…' 'The gentleman over there told me to bring over to you' 'Seriously?' I look at the direction she pointed to, and find him, he's young, shaven face, blue eyes, black suit, and black hair, Caucasian, very handsome I must admit, Ah eye contact I look away and push the drink away. 'Wow, so this must happen all the time then?' 'No way! I'm not interested, and I don't exactly have time right now to respond to him with you here' 'True, he might die because of you' Scary 'Whatever' placing my head on the table, closing my eyes….. Vincent notices that the guy in the black suit gets up and gives Vincent a cold stare before leaving. Jealous much? 'Why you smiling for?' 'Nothing' Weirdo. He's all smug and shit.[Chapter 5] Another waitress arrives to Raven and Vincent's table with a tray of drinks 'Another Vodka tonic, hon?' 'Yeah, and one for my friend please?' who the hell is your friend prick? Man this guy! Every little thing he does pisses me off! 'Who's on the tenor sax?' 'That's Daniel baby, he's the owner' 'He's terrific. Would you be so kind as to invite him over after his set' he tucks in a twenty dollar bill into her apron 'I gotta buy him a drink' 'Sure thing darlin' Vincent gives her a radiant smile and she walks off….. 'You must have a lot of time on your hands if we're gonna be sitting here talking to the guy, but I ain't complaining' Raven is oblivious to the silent Vincent, who has a serious look on his face, as he stares at the sax player on the stage…. …Daniel has been sharing more than a few drinks with Vincent and Raven, the place is almost closed, and it's just the three of them. 'I was a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin tables. Right here, it didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point. Being around the music, that was the thing' Still sounds kinda lame to me, I'd rather work where there's a lot of money. 'Take this one night, July 22 1964, guess who walks in. Mr Louis Armstrong!' Never heard of him before 'You're kidding me' I'm guessing the guy was way before my time 'Right through those doors. The man himself' 'Jesus..' Weird, Vincent seems more human somehow… 'He was in town playing two gigs a night at the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel. After his last set, he decides to come on down to South Central to hang with his people. That's how he was, you see. Never forgot who we were. Money and fame and all that meant nothing to him, as long as he could blow that horn' 'So before you know it, he's up on that stage, doing his thing' Since I had been silent for a long time and was kinda bored I thought I might as well speak too 'Was it great? Well I mean it had to be…' Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling' so was Daniel himself, seems like both him and Vincent are enjoying themselves, that's good 'You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him?' 'Did better then that' grinning We give a questioning look. Daniel smiles, raises his hands, mimes blowing a trumpet. 'No' Vincent says in disbelief 'Cool' well I had nothing else to say 'Dix Dawyer the guy who owned this place back then, let slip to Louis I played. So he waves me right up. My heart about stopped, but I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes ' Vincent turns to me 'Unbelievable, you hearing this?' 'Err, yeah I am' I'm drawn into the story in spite of what's been happening tonight 'Erm, how did you do?' 'How do you think? You ain't shit when you're playing next to Louis Armstrong. But he was kind, he could see me trying. He carried my ass as best he could' 'I was born in 1945, but that was the moment of my conception. Right here in the used to be crowded room' 'Crowds not here now?' Vincent asks 'Oh, well jazz ain't the draw it used to be' 'Damn straight, it's all about RnB and Rock' 'Well those are nice music too' Daniel says smiling at me, oops maybe shouldn't have said that, but he seems nice about it. I smile back. 'But the place looks great' 'Thanks' 'What a great story. I gotta tell the folks in Culiacan and Bogota that story' I notice Daniel's hand freezes as he's about pour more drinks. He glances up at Vincent, I'm not sure what's going on but it ain't good 'You know the people in Culiacan and Bogata?' Softly Vincent says 'Fraid so' 'And here I thought you were such a cool guy' 'I am a cool guy. With a job I was hired to do. You know how it is' Shit! Just realized what's happening, but what's this regret in Vincent's tone, man my heart is pounding.. 'Whoa! Just wait! Please Vincent, you don't need to kill him? Let's do a bit of improv right?' 'Hehe. Improv? If only life was just that simple, now quiet! I'm working' I guess it's worth a shot 'Okay, fine! How's this? I'll ask a question?' 'What question?' 'A Jazz question. You get it right, we roll. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you leave town, and nobody, and I mean nobody ever hears from you again' I'm surprised he's even considered about letting him go, please let everything turn out alright 'I will take you word. And I will give you mine. If I walk out of here tonight, I'd go so far away; it'd be just like I was dead' We have a deal I see Vincent nod. He doesn't say anything, but I notice he eases something form his waistband. Oh no! My heart is pounding in my throat, and my hands are starting to shake, I place them on top of my knees so nobody sees them. 'Lay it on' 'It's simple. What was Louis' first musical instrument?' 'I know all there is to know about Louis' 'Then let's have it'. 'Coronet. Bought it form a New Orleans pawnshop when he was kid. Cost him five dollars. The moment now is frozen, seems like a endless pause, I hold my breath, it sounded like the right answer, I stare at Vincent, waiting for his reaction I'm sorry 'POP POP POP' The gun came up so fast I didn't even see it; it's a different gun with a thick, silent barrel. Daniel's head falls forward, I see a red mist swilling in the air, disappearing in seconds, I'm….I'm…Fuck I …the gun was so close, I could feel the heat. I leave. I catch Daniel's head as it falls forward, and arrange Daniel's arms so that his head can rest on them, as if he's taking a nap. This feeling? Is it…regret? No I never have regret for any of my victims, this is a job that pays and that's all. It's all silent now. 'Tin Horn. Cost him a dime' Outside the club… 'Raven' Can't believe he shot him, I'm leaving that guy, he's fucking insane 'RAVEN!' I turn and face him 'Let's go' 'No' I blink in astonishment, she carries on walking Chucking, he says 'Raven, seriously, let's go?' 'Stop stalking me! Find another driver! My shift finished an hour ago! And….and I had enough of driving you around and seeing you killing people. You can keep your seven hundred dollars. OW!' Vincent grabbed the back of my collar, and I'm slammed against the wall, shit it hurts! His hand on my throat, ready to strangle the hell out of me, my eyes are closed due to the pain, I open my eyes as I hear a low, threatening voice. 'I'm not playing' giving me a deathly glare. I glare back….and then… 'Ravvveeenn, u bitch!' my radio whines yet again 'What the hell is up with this lady?' releasing me and walking towards the cab 'She hates me. I think it's jealously' massaging my throat 'Really?' 'Yep' and to think we're back on speaking terms after everything. Vincent reaches into the cab and pulls out the radio mike, clicks it on 'You harassing my gal again?' Gal? This guy is gonna cause a lot of misunderstandings 'Who are you dick?' 'Same guy you talked to last time' 'What! The two of you on a little date?' 'What's it to you if we're star crossed lover' 'Why you!' I growl at him, giving him the finger 'Whatever, that slut's mum keeps calling me every ten minutes and those two kids of hers are making one hell of a racket and giving me a bloody headache down the phone' Heh serves you right. Kids? This kid right here has kids? She doesn't seem the type though 'Here, careful' I take the mike and click it on 'Stop calling me slut, slut! What's up?' 'Your mama keeps calling like it's the end of the world or something? Why didn't you show up?' Vincent whispers 'Show up for what' I ignore him 'I understand, don't worry I'll text her' 'Show up for what?' I get my phone out 'She's in the hospital' 'You visit every night?' 'Yep, and I told ya, my shift finished ages ago, so she knows I ain't doing my job, but don't worry I'll text her' 'No. Don't. It'll break schedule of you don't go' 'So?' 'So people will start looking for you, this cab. That's not good' 'Haha sounds like you wanna go see her now' Wait…. 'Aww hell no! No way am I taking you to see my mum! Nope not happening! Sorry. Let's go, next stop!' She crosses her arms and turns away, facing her back towards me, showing off her stubbornness, cute. Vincent comes round me and is facing me, and places his gun on the roof cab 'Raven when exactly did tonight become negotiable? 'But!' I glance at the gun, thinking this through 'Fine! Whatever' 'And stop smiling!' 'Sorry, it's funny' 'Whatever' he makes me so mad![Chapter 6] Stark corridors, fluorescent lighting, patients, nurses and doctors walking about, a row of injured people are seated along one wall waiting for attention. The automatic doors swing open and Raven and Vincent enter, the briefcase held at Vincent's side. 'Ah wait, I gotta buy something' I walk up to the gift counter 'Hmm, I'll have a Aero bar, and Mars, and for me I would like some Galaxy' 'What about flowers?' 'Why would I buy flowers for? No one likes them' He looks at me, he's wearing his sunglasses, and in a sincere tone he says 'She carried you for nine months in her womb, so you buy flowers. Here' he actually buys flowers and hands them over to me, this guy! As if he can talk, he probably killed his family or something. We reach the hallway where the elevator is, and we wait, the elevator arrives, and we get on. I press the button and the lean on the back wall of the elevator, and the doors start to close 'Hold the elevator please' 'Tch' Vincent puts his out hand, stopping the doors, a man slides in and join us in the elevator. We see its Detective Ray Fanning; he doesn't see Raven in the back corner. His back is to her… 'Level five, Thanks' he says Vincent hits the button, and the doors close, the elevator rides up, and we all stand in that awkward silence you only ever get with strangers in elevators, my heart thumping loudly as ever, as I know I'm putting my family in a very dangerous position by bringing this guy along…. 'Having a good night?' Why would Vincent be talking to the other guy? Isn't that dangerous for him, he won't be able to keep a low profile. Oh well, one witness I can mention to the cops, hehe 'Mezzo-mezzo, you?' Vincent nods 'Making do' The elevator stops, and me and Vincent get off to the right…. Fanning continues riding up one floor, where it stops and Fanning gets off, and turns a corner, heading towards a room with a sign indicting 'MORGUE' I enter the room with flowers, I glance back, and Vincent hovers near the doorway, good. I move towards the bed… 'Mum, hi, how you doing?' Vincent sees a young South Indian woman on the hospital bed looking very lively but with a slight look of weariness. Vincent sees the resemblance between the mother and daughter. 'Raven! I was so worried, you should of texted me if you were busy, I do worry that you overwork too much and you are forcing yourself to spend so much time at the hospital' 'Mum. Its fine, I am very good at my time management skills, and here you go' giving her the flowers 'here are some flowers' 'Wh- 'Why buy flowers?' 'You could have bought chocolates' I look where those two other voices came from and I see two girls in pajamas walk in, about four years of age. Twins. But they are definitely a younger version of 'Raven' they both approach their older sister 'Hey you two, waahh' cute, jumping into their sister to give her a hug, well looks like she's squashed though hahaha 'Missed you!' 'You saw me this morning, but I didn't just buy flowers, I bought these for you' handing them their chocolate. 'YAYYY!' they both yell in unison 'Raven! You shouldn't spoil them so much, and all your money always go to those two!' 'Mum its fine, seriously I like spoiling them' 'Hey Raven, you are so rude, introduce your friend, don't let him wait outside!' 'Wh-'with my mouth full of chocolate and crushed by my two sisters, I totally forgot about the scary dude who has been terrorizing the streets of LA. Guess I gotta do my bit of acting now.. 'Oh, don't worry, it's my fault Raven was held up tonight' setting his briefcase by the door and moving towards the bed to shake my mother's hand, I look at mum, dear god, she's totally misunderstanding, she thinks we are going out or something…I can totally read her expression right now, jeez….. 'Oh its fine, my, you sure are different from Raven's delinquent friends' 'Muuum, we ain't delinquents, we just have too much fun sometimes' 'Kyyaaaa!, the three of you on the floor like that is sooo cute, I gotta take a picture!' her and her pictures, she's takes so many, there's like fifty albums of us alone at home. 'Shush mum, we got company' cute family 'I'm sure you know by now, how you got to take a gun to her head to make do anything' 'Tell me about' he grins at me, I look away and fix Melanie's hair 'But you must be proud of her' 'Of course I am, she's my little fighter, and sure she can be trouble at times but if it weren't for her, Melanie and Melissa wou- 'Mum, stop, he doesn't need to know, in fact, Vincent shall we go?' 'No, I am interested, please tell me more' 'Mum, sto-'I see the briefcase on the floor; a very stupid idea just came into my head. 'What's your name again?' 'Vincent' I kiss Melanie and Melissa goodbye and with my finger to my lips I tell them to hush and stay quiet. 'Yeah she is a delinquent, but she's a lovely person, and she works so hard to take care of this family, even though it's supposed to be my job' I grab the brief and walk out, unseen…. 'I mean standing up against her father, he was scary, and so she's my number one' 'Will you come again?' 'Maybe, who knows, I'm in town only tonight' 'When you come back?' 'Sure, I promise' 'Well it was a pleasure to meet you Vincent' 'Raven lets-' she's no where in sight, the twins are smiling, I look round, my brief is gone…..that kid sure has balls. I race out of the room into the hallway, I spin around trying to see where Raven went, I see nothing but a few patients, and hospital staff, shit! And a door marked 'Stairs' swinging shut at the end of the hallway. Guess I'm heading for the stairs. I burst through the doors into the stairwell, I hear running footsteps below, I peer over the railing, and I see Raven, three flights down. Vincent sees her clutching the brief, and takes off after her, plunging down the stairs at breakneck speed I run frantically down the steps, hurtling from one landing to the next, phew, I'm out of breath already, no good. I hear footsteps coming from above, damn, not a smart move this was…. I'm going down the steps like a madman, what the hell was she thinking, that bitch, she thinks she can get away from a professional hitman like me, I get out my H+K from under my jacket, just in case….. Raven comes through the stairway door, racing like crazy along a row of huge industrial washers, trying to make it to the exit door at the far end, and Vincent bursts from the stairwell in pursuit, pausing to put two hands on his H+K, aiming down the length of the laundry room, as Raven vanishes through the exit door at the far end. I race out, and crash open doors that lead to the parking lot. 'Shit what the hell was I thinking?' mumbling to myself 'I'LL GO BACK AND KILL THEM' I freeze, its feels like my heart suddenly stopped beating like drum, I turn round, and he's stopped as well, breathing heavily, his gun aimed at me. Fuck, that's why I didn't want him to meet my family, he can totally use them against me, and it's like my weakness….not fair. He approaches me, I shift backwards, scared what's going to happen next, but the brief is yanked out of my hands. He hisses 'what the fuck was that' his eyes filled with an angry fire that burns through me 'Um…jazz?' 'Wahhh, ouch!' I'm suddenly on the ground, he tripped me up, I notice Vincent, above, staring at me, is he gonna kill me now? 'Are we getting hostile hon? What were you thinking trying to run?' each syllable like a bullet…. 'Well….you started all this hostility in the first place, and anyway I had a sudden urge to get you away from my family' He's just staring at me, I can't read his expression then he breaks into a grin 'Kid, didn't think you could that' 'You admiring me or something?' I'm suddenly pulled to my feet; I guess I'm still alive. For now. Meanwhile, at the morgue Fanning is in the cold room with a morgue attendant, who is checking his clipboard. 'We had three come in tonight, Two John Does, maybe one's your guy' The attendant nods at the first of the four plastic wrapped corpses lying on stainless steel tables, Fanning draws the sheet back: Homeless Man with a beard 'Nah, not Ramone' Fanning nods at the next corpse 'Try that one' The attendant draws the sheet back, its one of the guys who tried to mug Vincent 'No, next' 'You know what's funny; these three came in within half an hour of each other, and the kid and that last guy. They were done by the same shooter' 'Why do say that?' Fanning is alert now 'Same wound pattern. Two in the sternum, one in the head, and this cat is shooting tight groups; double taps are a couple millimeters apart' Intrigued, Fanning steps to the fourth corpse, and pulls back the sheet. Fanning stares down at the dead face. Instant recognition. Minutes later, an amped up Fanning is talking with Weidner 'Yeah I'm still at the hospital, no Ramone but you'll never guess who else is in the meat locker' 'Elvis Presley' 'Sylvester Clarke. Criminal lawyer turned lawyer-criminal' 'Also known as 'Sly' to his clients…' '….including my high diving informant, Ramone, who he represented, who's still missing. Both of whom were in the exotic - substance business' 'Ramone and Clarke in one night?' 'In one night. Something bad is going down. And I don't think the Feeb know about it' Weidner hangs up, hauling himself off the bed…..[Chapter 7] We are driving again, we drive in silence, but I feel Vincent's gaze on the back of my neck. 'So tell me' 'Tell you what exactly?' 'What your mother was on about?' Vincent is looking at his PC 'Why?' 'Cuz we have time' 'Well before Melissa and Melanie were born, we were a family of three, him, mum and me. When I was little, Dad did seem a bit angry at my mum, and I often saw her in bruises, but she'd tell me she fell down or something, I didn't understand anything when I was a kid' 'You are still a kid' I see him smirk 'Whatever man, anyway when I got older I realized my Dad was beating her, and one day he got angry in front of me and started hitting mum, I tried to tell him to stop, but he started on me. I often got beat cuz I always tried to stop him so to ease the pain of my mum, she would always tell me to stop, but I never listened. I still went school though, so people always assumed with my character that I gotten into fights' 'I'm guessing you often get into fights anyway' Bingo 'Yeah, but my close friends were the only ones who knew that some of the bruises weren't from kids' 'Things went on like that for a long time, and then when I was fourteen, mum told me and dad that she was pregnant, we were happy, happier then we ever were before. Until one night, an argument about money got my Dad angry again, and he actually got a baseball bat and was prepared to hit mum…my mum who was four moths pregnant with Melissa and Melanie, they wouldn't be here..if…I hadn't..' The memory of that night making feel angry, the moment where I felt like I had nothing to lose. 'You interfered?' jeez kid, a baseball bat swung by a full grown adult can kill you 'I just snapped, I realized that this man was not our father. Mum was on the floor begging him to stop, but as he swung it down, I quickly shielded mum, the bat hit me in the left shoulder' Ouch 'But weirdly enough I didn't feel any pain; I don't even know how my shoulder looked like at the time. Anger was all I felt, and the urge to destroy the man in front of me, I had taken preparations just in case' 'Preparations…?' I take a breath 'I took out a gun from my pocket with my right hand, I aimed and pulled the trigger, and I then passed out. I was in the hospital for months, they tell me my left arm is useless for throwing and punching, and carrying things, it super weak' 'And you father? Did he die?' 'No, but he was sent to jail, and restrained from seeing the family. And plus my mum told the judge how he pulled the gun, and I got the baseball bat and we fought, and then I took the gun and shot, so there was no charges against me' Silence 'We've been happier ever since' 'So why are you working as a cabbie? For your family?' 'Yep' 'Uh huh?' he's judging me, I think 'I've got hospital bills to pay, and plus Melanie and Melissa they need to grow up into fine women, so I need to help them do that' 'Go to a dance club called Fever, you know it' 'Yeah, that mad place filled with Koreans; well it's pretty cool though' 'Your mum is very different, not what I expected a mum would be' 'Don't know if that's a good thing though, but she's different from most mums' haha' 'I wouldn't know, never had one' 'Don't stare at me like that, I had one but she died in childbirth' 'I'm sorry' 'My father, he was a prick just like yours, hated everything I did, got drunk, and beat me up all the time' 'Then what?' Intimately 'I killed him' EHHHH, I was right! Dang….. 'I was twelve' he's got to be fucking with me 'He was the first' I turn round, and he sees my look, and laughs 'I'm kidding. He died of liver cancer' 'I'm sorry' 'No your not' 'Hey, wait, I am, you are talking to the girl who got her own shoulder smashed to bits by her own father' Maybe that's why he's a hitman, but then again, I never turned out like him…. Meanwhile…. Federal Agents clustered loosely at a row of monitors, in a hard location, on the monitors are multiple views of a Mexican club; two are of a hospital, and its parking lot, and of several homes, and cars. The room is littered with surveillance equipment and pizza boxes. Agent Pedrosa reacts to a soft knock on the door. Fanning and Weidner are ushered in. Pedrosa turns to them both for quick introductions. ' Weidner. Narcotics Division' 'Detective Ray , Major Nar…' Pedrosa interrupts, shaking their hands 'Yeah, hi, okay. Agent Frank Pedrosa' 'Thanks for seeing us' 'Yeah. You're welcome. How can I help? What's up? Why do you wanna know about our case? 'Has there been any unusual activity tonight?' 'As in….' 'As in a murder or maybe a murder spree on Wilshire Central' 'All quiet on the western front. Various people are asleep. Various people are not. They come and go in cars, pickups and taxis. Other than that we're watching air move. And so your interest in our case?' Fanning trades a surprised look with Weidner. A taxi? Fanning gestures. Pedrosa nods the okay, and Fanning rushes to the monitor which shows Raven's taxi heading out of the hospital. 'Hood's all beat to shit' Weidner's fumbling on his cell phone, out, already dialing. 'On what? The taxi?' 'Yeah' 'What's the license number?' A technician pauses the video and using the joystick zooms in on the cab, and scribbles down the number… The feds go apeshit at what they've been told. Meanwhile, Weidner answers his cell. 'Are you telling me Ramone Gallardo and Sylvester Clarke were murdered tonight? Both killed? 'Sylvester for sure, Ramone…' 'We got another D.O.A. One Daniel Baker in South Central' 'That's three? He killed three in one night?' a federal agent says 'Three what?' Pedrosa answers 'Three witnesses, for a secret grand jury, secret my ass…' 'So who's left? Before you lose them, too…' 'Yeah, uh huh… she? Raven, eighteen years of age? Srilankan-American, small build, black hair…are you sure?' Meanwhile, Pedrosa has separated from the group and on both a hard line and a Nextel is speaking urgently…. 'LA101 to chase units…I want a three-car revolving tail on that cab, we got to take down the driver before she gets to where she's going' 'Locate our witness, Peter Yip…wife, girlfriends, mommy, and daddy whatever. Get him evacuated. Get him safe' 'On the cab, the assault team, when they are in place, we'll do the take down. Do NOT spook her before. I want Air Support up and to maintain at 1,500 feet. Meanwhile…. Fanning is still on the cell phone 'E-mail me her license. Okay I'll wait….' 'You'll be late. Jump on the freeway and take me to the 105 west' 'Why?' I'm the driver and I think I know the streets better than you 'Do it' While the Feds are departing to interdict the killer before 'she' can take their next witness, Fanning tries to get a word in edgeways to a fast waling Pedrosa…. 'According to the cab company's dispatcher this cabbie's been driving that cab for three years….and has a young family….' 'So what?' '…..so, you're telling me this girl walks into a phone booth, and shazaam, changes into a meat- eater, super assassin? What's she do, squeeze 'em in between fares?' 'No. Cabdriver Raven is floating down a storm drain' 'Really, how can you be so sure?' 'Look. We see private – sector security working for cartel groups on Columbia, Russia, México…hiring ex- Special Forces types, ex KGB all the time, people with trigger time, skill sets…real tradecraft…and look like cabdrivers' As they near their cars…. 'What are you gonna do?' 'Take down her ass. Save our witness.' Pedrosa and the other Feds climb into their cars and drive off Fanning looks Weidner 'What if they're wrong?' 'We can't do anything, they won't listen, and this is their case' 'There is something else going on' 'It's not our game!' 'Pedrosa, Pedrosa….this is air support…' 'LA103 to Air 4…you still have her?' 'Air 4 to LA103. I lost her. You're in controlled air space. I gotta stay out till I get clearance from LAX tower' 'You lost her? She can head anywhere out of LAX…' Pedrosa's plan to intercept and take down the assassin just crashed. He rapidly recalculates. 'They locate Peter Yip?' 'On with the wife. She thinks he's at Fever. They called. Can't get through' 'Washington and Crenshaw. Move!' Raven and Vincent are riding in pensive silence through the neon visual noise of Korea town. 'You know, after this you should meet a guy' 'Huh?' Not what I would expect from him 'You need someone to rely on, and to relieve some of your stress' I hear the laughter in his voice 'I don't know man, my family comes first' 'Hmmm, well time is fleeting. Life is short. One day it's gone…you make it out of this alive, you should go out and meet a guy. That's what I think….anyway…' Wow, a not so important speculation from Vincent…ain't listening to him either way. The streets are empty, its four am. Reflected streetlights flow up the windshield, the city seems dangerous. Raven and Vincent's attention, suddenly, is taken by something else. Three coyotes separate and apart lope diagonally across Sunset. Hunting. Indifferent to urban habitation, as if they, not we, own this city… Raven parks her cab into the Fever forecourt, there's chaotic valet parking with Bentleys, a Lambo in choice spots. The party -till-dawn crowd, and they are pretty much in the thick of it….. 'We get Yip out. You take the assassin. Clean shot! Watch your backgrounds' Pedrosa tells his team, and then approaches the front entrance; they are a stooped by a bouncer who tries to get his superiors to stops the feds in tactical gear to stop, but fails…meanwhile… Vincent propels Raven past a bar, through screens of glass, frosted alcoves…jammed with people. 'Booth towards the back. That's where he hangs. Fat Korean guy. Terminal acne as youth. You go first' while the hell do I have to come? I guess I can use this as opportunity to run. 'Fifteen feet in front and three to my left. Wander, and innocent bystanders get the first rounds. Clear? 'Clear' so much for using this as an opportunity to run away. Jeez… Vincent with Raven in front and to his left, snakes through the crowd, swimming among them, scanning for Peter Yip, seeking his target in the back booths….. Pedrosa and the feds enter up the stairs, staying as discrete as possible while urgent. They search for Raven among the crowds of people, trying to spot her before she can assassinate Peter Yip. Pedrosa searches, desperately, for Peter Yip, his last witness, to get him to safety. Vincent, who is deeper among the dancers, now sees Peter Yip. He's located towards the back wall across the dance floor in a booth on a raised area in the semi – circular room. With him are two young Korean girls. The view gets blocked by the Korean bodyguards near the booth, facing out. Behind the booth are five or six Korean gangsters. But in the dance floor, are bodyguards within the crowd, looking for trouble before it gets to the row of booths and Peter Yip. Raven receives a glance from Vincent, she's gestured down the middle of the dance floor towards the rear. They work their way through the mass of bodies, Vincent takes an oblique path, sliding along a convex side wall. His path brings Vincent up behind bodyguard #1, who looks to the right as, Vincent pounds a fist into his kidney, the bodyguard's head is twisted around and torn back, the drops to the ground. Vincent's focus is already on bodyguard#2, a he kicks down with a ferocious force, slamming bodyguard #1 into unconsciousness….. Bodyguard #2 turns, and Vincent's' foot slams his knee sideways, breaking it, Vincent's palm bounces the man's forehead back, his fist slams into his exposed neck, so fast the bodyguard did not see it. 'Fuck! He is not human' Raven who is buffeted by dancers, backs away as Bodyguard #3, who saw the assault on one of the bodyguards. He grabs for Vincent, who breaks the grab, and pulls the guard's head and neck down towards him, slams his knee into his rib cage twice, breaking things, spins the man backwards, rips his head sideways and back, a centimeter from breaking, and holding it there with his left arm, Vincent's right hand grabs his H+K as he moves towards Peter Yip. Pedrosa sees Yip.. 'There's Yip! Get him out of here' The Feds move torwards to booth, and while Pedrosa crosses the floor, sees the disturbance and over his right shoulder, right there is….. 'RAVEN!' Into radio...'Middle of the dance floor! There she is' Feds with assault weapons push through the dancers towards Raven…. 'FBI! FREEZE, RAVEN! DON'T MOVE! FREEZE! HANDS IN THE AIR!' 'Huh?' why the hell is my name being called? 'Oh fuck!' there's like three, four weapons of cops fighting through the crowd, and they are all aimed at me! The people who aren't falling away from her are confused. Raven is the most harmless person in the room.. My hands are up 'Don't shoot; I'm not the one you are looking for!' But the Korean hip –hop is so loud that no one can hear….. Meanwhile, the bodyguards struggle to see from where the threat is coming from, and the Korean gangsters behind the booth take out their weapons as they see Feds slide I behind the patrons, closing in, to get Yip to safety…. To the gangsters 'FREEZE! HANDS IN THE AIR! ON YOUR KNEES! NOW! One Korean gangster who is pushed sideways by a Fed, who's trying to reach Yip, sees the weapon in the Fed's hand. So pulls his 9mm, which the other Fed shoves sideways but the gun fires, hitting an incoming Pedrosa in the upper thigh, slamming him face first to the floor. And with the first gunshot, all hell breaks loose….. I dropped to floor, man all hell has broken loose, I'm gonna die, if not by these cops, then by Vincent. Rounds are fired from everywhere; it is deafening, wait I think they are all aimed at me! Shit! A dancer gets hit in front me, and drops in front me, dead. I'm frozen….the fear comes back to me, making me numb… Paco and Rubio who have been taking orders from Felix, and checking all night if the target's been killed job's they decide to take out this Raven girl. Vincent advancing to Yip, sees the red line through the smoke and the jewel of a laser point dance around Raven's ear. He sees the source, and punches three rounds into Rubio. He..he saved me…he saved my life! I'm so confused, whose side I'm I supposed to be on, the cops are trying to kill me and shit…and then there's Vincent…who unbelievably saved my life! Peter Yip is protected by his confused scrum of Korean gangsters and bodyguards. The bodyguards struggle to get him out. Vincent, the only calm in the storm, is moving on to the cluster of protection at Peter Yip's booth, when from the left, the first bodyguard breathing in rasps grabs for the gun in Vincent's right hand, as Raven is on the floor amid destroyed, overturned tables, panicked dancers. 'I'm in a movie, there's no way this shit is real' someone grabs my hand, I jump and look, it's a woman, someone who came to have a good time 'Are you alright hon? We'd better get out of here' smiling at me like I'm a lost child…. 'Huh?' she thinks I'm a lost child! She pulls me into the crowd and towards the exit, before listening to any of my protests. A heavy Korean gangster slams Vincent's gun hand with a short baton. Vincent's disarmed. Two men are on him. A knife in Vincent's left hand sinks into the bodyguard's leg, dropping him. The gangster swings the baton for Vincent's head. Vincent steps inside, traps the man's arm. Take his baton, releases his torqued body and backhands it across the gangster's neck. Vincent slams a fore hand across his ribs. The concussed gangster falls backwards. Vincent swiftly places four shots into Bodyguard#4, and nears Yip's booth. A Korean gangster is blown back. Another tries to help Yip escape over the back. He's hit. Peter Yip falls back into the banquette, his eyes wider because Vincent's coming. Vincent reloads. As his thumb hits the slide release and it jacks forward, he already fired a round into Yip. Yip's eyes at the fierce face of death approaching, are filled in his last moments with Vincent, who fires four rounds. That fast. And the wall of the frosted glass with a plane of water running down behind it dead Peter Yip is untouched, serene. Raven is pulled past the karaoke and music recording rooms and escape down the back stairs. They reach the bottom of the stairs. They nearly reach the exit door to the back alley. 'Do you have anyone to call to pick you up?' 'Ah wait, I'm been trying to tell I'm with some-'this lady is too nice, I need to go back, we go through the door, and emerge into the side street. BOOM BOOM BOOM she's dead before she hits the floor. I freeze up again, and just stare at the lifeless body in front of me, the person who tried to help me, a total stranger, without knowing anything. Raven stands there horrified at what she just witnessed. Vincent grabs Raven. Propelling her forward. Fiercely Vincent says 'GET IN' he throws Raven behind the wheel, and gets in the back 'DRIVE!' I hit the gas, my door is left open, my hands barely on the wheel, it's as if my driving and motor skills are impaired, scraping off the adjacent cards. The nice lady, now motionless, is left behind.[Chapter 8] The yellow can is the only vehicle heading east. Everything else streams west. Emergency vehicles. Flashers. I'm in a dazed, back in this hell….eternally in my cab's front seat, and soon I'll die in this cab. 'What a clusterfuck. Only thing that didn't show up was the Polish cavalry' My life is being controlled by Vincent, it's a nightmare, and he's starting to piss me off! So compliant, no. that's not it, I feel anger from her. Oh. 'Ooh I see, you don't wanna talk to me, tell me to fuck off' 'Fuck off' Vincent chuckles and turns his attention out of the window at the streams of emergency vehicles, at the earpiece, filled with LAPD and news helicopters. 'What! The blood, bodily fluid and death get to you? Just remember we all die anyway' 'Why did you have to kill that lady! She was trying to help me; she thought I was a lost kid! You couldn't of just grabbed me or something! That lady probably has a family, maybe kids who gotta grow up without a mother, she was a nice lady and you kil-' 'So I shoulda saved her cuz she has a family' 'Yes!' 'Sorry but it's what I do for a living' 'heh, some living' 'Head downtown' 'What's downtown?' 'How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four' 'Che, one more' 'There you go!' 'Why didn't you just kill me and find another cab!' 'Cause you're good, we're in this together. You know…fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence. All that crap' 'That is the worst bullshit I ever heard' 'Yeah but you believed my other bullshit about bad guys killing bad guys' say what? 'So, what did they do?' 'They all are witness for the prosecution. It's some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted' 'Ah fuck, so that's the reason' 'That's the why. There is no reason. No good reason. No bad reason to live or to die' 'Then what are you?' 'Indifferent' Vincent looks out at the window again 'Get with it. Get over it, millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink…that's us. Lost in space. The universe doesn't care about you. The lady, you, me? Who notices?' 'You know, you are just low, I mean you just some cold, mean killing machine. Bet you can't even switch off and make friends, most likely you have no friends. Sorry to say this but, you is missing a few parts that make you human' 'Yeah. But what about you?' 'What about me?' 'Hmph, whose life are you living? You are just using the excuse of taking care of your family so you don't have to aspire to be anything else. You just gonna stay in this yellow and orange prison. Every day. The needle on the speedometer is creeping past forty…. 'What the hell is that man? You think I want to be in this mess forever! I do want to be something one day, but not now' 'Slow down' 'My family is my life, my mum is incredibly optimistic that it's crazy, I love Melanie and Melissa to bits' Needle pushing sixty…. 'But you know what, according to you, it doesn't matter. Cause we are…insignificant out here in this big –ass nowhere. Twilight Zone shit. Says the badass sociopath in my backseat. But there's one thing I gotta thank you for, thanks for saving my life' I must have gone crazy. The cab goes blasting through an intersection on a red light. A Los Angeles Time delivery truck slams its breaks, as Raven swerves, barely avoiding a collision. 'That was a red light!' I glance in the rearview, I'm glad to see Vincent unsettled. 'What's it all matter? If I go through a red light or a green light, there's no reason is there? Nothing to lose. Right?' Vincent's aims his H+K at my head, I nearly laugh, dear god, I am crazy. 'Slow the hell down!' 'Why? What are you gonna do? Pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot my ass! I've been waiting all night for you to do that' 'Slow down!' 'You know Vincent; there was always something I wanted to say to you' Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror. Vincent is arrested by a look in Raven that he's not seen before. It's the even, confrontational look of a person with nothing to lose. 'Go fuck yourself' Raven slams on the brakes and cranks the steering wheel hard to the right, the right wheel hits a low divider, the rear end comes unstuck, rotating over the front right and flipping into a violent roll onto it roof, spinning down the street, smashing off other cars, pieces falling off, spewing glass and then settling upside down, revolving slowly to a creaking stop, antifreeze spilling across the pavement. Then everything goes silent, motionless, still. Phew, that was some ride. I'm trapped upside down; thanks to my seatbelt I'm alive. Damn, my roof caved in on one side. Something trickles down my face; I'm guessing its blood. Oh well I've been through worst. Huh? There's movement in the back. A sharp intake of breath, then… 'Well. That was brilliant' 'Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?' then 'Woah!' a shiny object plunges through the headrest, missing me by inches, haha guess he wants to kill me now. I release my seatbelt; I drop and hit the ceiling of the cab. 'Ouch' That bitch! I'm fucking gonna kill her, and then her family; she's messed up my work completely! I lunge forward with my knife; Raven starts fighting wildly to keep the knife at bay, and crawls quickly out of the window, lucky that she's small. I hear a police siren; I kick out the window on my side, and quickly get out. I'm crawling away from the cab, keeping low, the taxi between us, and I look back, and see Vincent in glimpses, running off into the night and vanishing into the darkness, as the police sirens also disappear. I push myself painfully to my feet. Wow this is a surreal moment; I'm standing by my overturned cab, the empty city around me, and the cool night air. I'm Alive. I survived the night; blood is pumping though my veins is a fact. Ahahahahaha. I never felt so happy.[Chapter 9] How good is life? I fall to the ground, catching my breath back 'Ow, I'm in pain' I look at my cab, man. I hope I can get a new one. I see granules of shattered glass, and then Vincent's briefcase, with a PC inside, and it's still on, miraculously surviving the crash. I see two faces on the screen; one is the Korean guy and a lady 'Annie Farrell. Assistant U.S Attorney' Shit, I totally get it now, Vincent was killing people for the bad side, he was killing witnesses, and the fifth stop, the lawyer who was in charge of the investigation or whatever, was going down. Should I call the cops? No! They are out to kill me too. But I gotta go and save her, I never had a choice before, I was scared in the beginning but now, a fire is burning inside me, and it won't go out. Next to the brief, I see Vincent's gun, I know I'm gonna get my fingerprints on the gun that killed everyone but I don't care anymore. I start running, I'm not a trained assassin, and hell, I don't stand a chance against Vincent. But I'm purely operating on instinct. The gun in my hand, it's been a long time since I held a gun. The city is quiet; I only hear the sound of my feet hitting the pavement, as I race up the middle of the street. I take out my cell phone, I keep running and dialing the number I got from the PC. 'Damn!' no signal, great. I stop, gasping for air. I realize I'm standing near a parking structure, I dash towards it, my legs in pain, and I feel a throbbing sensation in my left shoulder, must've been from the crash, great it's gonna be as useless as ever. I run up the stairs, taking two steps at a time, hopefully I'll get a better signal. I see the federal building across the freeway. Dark offices. Only a few have lights on. Except three floors that are completely lit. I hold the cell phone to my ear 'C'mon, go through, go through' I hear static and then ringing. YES! I'm through…. Meanwhile, in the Federal Building, Vincent uses a card to gain access to the elevator lobby without setting off the alarms. The lobby beyond Vincent is vacant, that it looks sinister. Vincent enters the elevator, and rides up, watching the numbers climb. I'm waiting, my heart is pounding, I scan the windows, and I then see a figure on the uppermost well –lit floor, through the south windows, cross an office to grab a phone. That must be Annie. In the US Attorney's office, Annie lays down some files, and grabs up the phone, bleary from exhaustion. It truly was an all-nighter. 'Annie Farrell' 'The lawyer?...' I seem to be out of breath 'Yes, it is, erm this is a strange time to be calling'' confusion at this sudden call 'Look! This is gonna sound crazy, but a man is coming to kill you' 'Okay kid, not funn-' 'Seriously lady, he's coming to kill you, his name is Vincent!' 'Is this a joke?' 'It has something to do with people in Culiacan and Bogota' I try and remember everything that happened tonight 'You saying this is all connected to Felix?' 'Say who?' The elevators doors slide open. Vincent emerges onto the floor, using the master keycard to enter the office. Vincent's at a wooden door in the wood and glass office interior, and kicks in the door at the lock. It slams open. He's through, H+K up. Empty. No one's home. Vincent steps in… Annie tries to decipher what Raven is saying through the cell phone 'How do you know about my case? I don't understand..?' 'He's killed four people already tonight, I think they are witnesses, the fat guy, the penthouse man, the jazz man and the Korean guy. You're the last one! He somehow ended up in my cab and I was forced to drive the dude around, but then I crashed and he we-' I look across the freeway, no way! Vincent is looking through an office. Vincent knows she's still here, what with the purse, take out, coffee cups. 'He's two floors below you' 'In my office!' 'He doesn't know you're there' 'What's your name?' 'Raven' 'Raven, where are you?' 'Me? I'm on top of a car park, across the freeway' Annie looks out of the window and sees the parking structure below and a speck – the one who is on the phone to her now. 'Where are you then?' 'Floor sixteen, Law Library and Files' Vincent pauses from examining offices. His eyes going to a desk phone. Three banks of extension. All dark, except for one. Next to it is the extension's location. Files Section, 16th FI. Vincent looks up. He knows where she is…. I keep an eye on Vincent, and then I realized that Vincent knows where she is… 'Shit!' as I see him walk out 'What' 'Looks like he knows where you are, call 911, and hide somewhere, and don't worry I'm on my way' 'Hello? Where are you going?' No use, she's gone, there's no reason to come here, where there's obviously danger. I punch a clear line, and dial 911. I gotta get to her fast! I glance over the edge of the car park and see the grass slope below. There's no time to think. Fuck it! I jump, clumsily falling, rolling all the way down; I'm going to meet a lawyer in such a messy state. I push myself to my feet, my ankle twisted, I half race, and limp across the bridge over the Harbor Freeway to the office building…. Annie listens to the 911 recording 'call will be answered on the order received. If this is not an emergency….' I enter the federal building, still limping. The lobby is strangely vacant. No security guards, then I see a long smear of blood across the white stone….. Annie finally hears a click on the line as '911. How can I help you…? 'There's a man in the building! He's trying to kill me. I'm…. However in the utility room, WHACK, Vincent swings his axe again, instantly severing the 16th floor's power and telephone truck line. Sparks emit from the bundled cables in the thick conduit. He tosses the ax, exits into the hallway, jabs the elevator button…. Annie finds herself talking to a dead line…. I follow where the blood goes and see it's a dead night watchwoman squeezed behind the security desk. I look away and try to get through the glass doors that need a card to get in. I attempt to hurl a steel trash can at the glass wall with all my might but my shoulder burns with pain and I drop the can. I think for a while, I'm stopped by a glass door, just great! I realize there's an H+K in my hand. Duuh! I aim, brace myself. Squeeze the trigger. Nothing. Is there a safety on this thing? Found it! I try again. I fire two shots into the glass door. The gun almost kicks out of my hand. But the door disintegrates. I walk through…. Annie, frozen with indecision. What to do? Stay or go? The corridor's dark. Terrifying. She forces herself to move, to cross the office, run now…for the door to the…but she only gets teen feet before she's stopped by a door opening. A soft footstep. Somebody's there. She backs up, against the floor to ceiling windows. Frozen, her heart pounding, listening. She backs up further towards the windows, back into the files section. There is nowhere to hide. Annie crouches under a table and crawls backwards. She can't hear a thing. Her heart pounds. The silence makes her want to scream. A shadow? Did she see a shadow pass against the murky darkness out there? A soft sound. But did she hear it, or is she imagining it? The breath catches in her throat. Eyes wide. The shadow, in a bullpen by a corridor. It lurks, silently. Waiting. It's Vincent. Then he moves, softly. Quietly. Annie is on her hands and knees, trying to crawl away soundlessly, not realizing that walking upon her, silently, from the back is Vincent. She doesn't know. He's a shadow in the dimness. Annie senses. Stops. Turns…and sees the shape of Vincent, the stolen gun comes up. 'Please, don't kill me' Annie begs Vincent's eyes are cold, unsympathetic. His finger squeezing off the slack on the trigger. Annie closes her eyes, waiting for the end. Vincent senses something and turns. A silhouette in the doorway. Aiming a gun. Vincent can't bring himself to believe it. 'Raven?' 'Let her go' my hand holding the gun steady 'Let her go?' He smiles, it's ruthless, almost canine T his kid is gonna die; there is no where she can stand a chance against me. 'What are you gonna do, shoot m—' BLAM! A flash. Vincent goes down sprawling. Raven rushes up to Annie, grabs her arm, and running for the door. I hear a groan. Vincent gets behind cover. Sitting up, eyes glittering, hand clasped to the side of his head, blood coursing through his fingers. Jesus. Raven. You shot my ear off. He looks at the fleeing Raven 'Okay Raven, get ready for the Polish cavalry!' 'RAVEN!' I hear Vincent calling my name. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM! Gunshots punch through the glass, inches from me and Annie. Yeah, I didn't really think about what to do if Vincent chases me. We enter the elevator. The glass wall explodes into the corridor, by a chair, crashing through it, followed by Vincent, I hit the ground – floor button, and 'close', the doors are taking forever to close, before they do I see Vincent nearing the elevator, with his gun getting higher. I grab Annie's hand and pull her to the floor. I hear bullets punch through the metal doors, but the elevator starts moving down. Vincent is left behind, he darts for the stairs. I get up, breathing hard, leaning on the wall of the elevator before sliding back to the floor 'Phew, that was scary' 'He knows you pretty well I think, he wasn't expecting you to shoot him and was surprised when you did' Really? How the hell did she get the time to analyze Vincent? 'Heh you could say that, he became my love councilor and met my family' 'Thank You' 'Eh?' looking up to Annie, who has a genuine smile on her face. 'I would of died, If it weren't for you' Annie's blood freezing when she remembers the gun, and the cold hard stare from Vincent. 'Its fine' I smile back The doors open, and we race across the lobby for the exit. Vincent careens down the steps, the entire side of his head bloody. He slams through a door into the lobby. He finds the elevator standing empty. He hears a door alarm, turns, runs across the lobby. He goes through the door and races down the frozen escalator. Holding on to Annie's hand, we enter the MTA, and race towards the boarding area. There's no train, I don't know what to do. We run down another staircase to the Blue Line, there's no train here, either! Man we need to get away, before that scary bastard comes and gets us. Vincent sees Raven and Annie seventy five yards away, racing down the stairs. It's a difficult shot, I aim, take a deep breath, and…. BOOM! BOOOM! BOOM! Three rounds are fired from somewhere; bullets are chewing craters in the ceramic tiles, barely missing us. Huh? A train! Where? Damn! It's upstairs! 'Annie, we are going back upstairs' She nods, very out of breath. We run down the platform for the stairs back up to the Green Line. Vincent running sees the train arriving on the opposite platform. He looks down the stairs to the Blue Line. A train pulls there too! Heh decision time. We get onto the fourth subway car, crawling and staying low on the floor, waiting for the doors to close, the train pulls out. I pray that Vincent hasn't followed. I need to decide, I need to second guess Raven, where would she go? The train takes fucking forever to leave. The doors start to close, sliding permanently shut. Then he knows. With no hesitation, he leaps off the platform onto the rails as the train starts to pull out. I crumple into a seat, I know I shouldn't relax but I just need a moment to rest. 'Are you ok?' Annie says in a tone of concern 'Yeah, just need to-'I sense something menacing, and turn and I see Vincent standing in the fifth car, staring at me. If looks could kill, I would be dead already; he does not look like a happy man. Well I did shoot him, yeah….things don't seem to be improving when I rebel against him I grab Annie and race into the second car as bullets pound through the metal and glass. Vincent is approaching. Why the hell do I feel as if the terminator is coming after me? Ah shit! We reach the first and final car. We slide the door shut, yes this is as far as we can go. Annie is panting hard, terrified. My back against the wall, arm keeping the door handle wedged tight, my head just below the door's window. The train goes black, then the light return, stuttering, great now the train is against me! I look up, and peer through the window, ready to duck if bullets start flying. Shit! Here comes fucking Vincent, he just entered the second car. He sees me, and shouts, barely audible. 'YOU CAN'T WIN RAVEN! I DO THIS FOR A LIVING!' I take out the H+K and slide the clip, and see I have one bullet left. Great. Annie sees this and bites her lip; her eyes accepting that we are gonna die. I look through the window again, he keeps coming, a .45 at his side, a sheet of blood down his face, he's scaring the shit out of the early morning passengers, and I can't help but smile. But I know what I want to do. I clutch the H+K, take a deep breath, and step to the side to face Vincent. I aim, the train enters a tunnel and then I close my eyes… BLAM! BOOM! Two flashes, glass shatters, then silence…. Seems like I wasn't the only one who had one bullet. I slowly open my eyes. I do a quick scan of my body, I'm...I'm okay. I look at Vincent, he's okay too, a look of surprise on his face. The train stops and I look at where we stop, and without thinking I go through the door and grab Vincent's wrist and drag him out of the train. We walk briskly in silence; I guess we are both in shock. I didn't kill him and he didn't kill me, is this a messed up friendship? I stop, and let go of his hand and turn around, I hold my palm out. Vincent looks down, confused as ever. 'Ahem, my five hundred dollars, I went to all the stops and I've brought you to LAX' A plane flies over head. 'You…You're letting me go' 'I'm doing my job' An evil smirk on his face 'You know, I could come back and kill you' I'm taking a gamble, I must be stupid, this guy will come and kill me, but it doesn't feel right to let him go to jail or kill him. I look away and see the motorway with taxi cabs driving here and there. She takes a deep breath and looks at the motorway; she knows I could come back, jeez; this kid changed a lot tonight heh I guess it was because of me, and hell I'm supposed to be an indifferent bad guy. Not gonna lie though, I do like her. Somewhat. 'I know, just stay away from my family, and come straight for me, I'll be ready' She looks straight at me, and smiles, weird kid. He smiles, and limps away into the darkness Then I black out and crumple to the floor. ","Summary":" Collateral is not mine, but Raven and story is. Hope you enjoy Los Angeles International Airport ~ "},{"Movie":"Collateral","Title":"Soulless","Author":"SpadesJade","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2030104","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: Don't own anything to do with the movie Collateral. I only own Victoria. Summary: I just can't believe that someone like Vincent could die that easily. Like he said, \"I do this for a living.\" So here's my take on events after the credits rolled. I just saw the movie yesterday, and this work was composed at about 2 in the morning, so if it's a little disjointed, that's why. SOULESS He had no soul. She looked into his eyes. Clear blue. Eyes were windows to the soul. His shone, but were empty. Like the sun reflecting on blue glass. \"Vincent. Sit down before you fall down.\" Slowly, he obeyed. He was not the kind who ever obeyed, not when it wasn't fully within his own willpower, or an action he had already intended. Still, it sounded nice. Like she had some small kind of control. \"What happened?\" \"Got shot in the chest,\" he said, his voice low, calm. She could hear his breathing was slightly ragged. \"Grazed a lung,\" she said. \"Lucky if it's just that. Wouldn't have made it back here if it had done more.\" \"How did you get back here?\" She didn't waste her time just chatting. She was already preparing to clean him up. Hot water steaming in a tall ceramic bowl, clean washcloth ready. He did not lie down. She wasn't sure if she should ask him to, but as she approached, her fingers nimbly undoing the buttons of his shirt, revealing the wound underneath to be much uglier than she'd thought. It was low, which was lucky. Maybe it only had bruised one of his lungs, then her greater talents wouldn't be necessary. \"What do you think?\" he asked, still very calm, looking not at her but at some vague spot on her shirt. Any other man would have been looking at her cleavage. Sometimes she wondered if Vincent's equipment was fully functional - if he had a package at all. \"I think you should lie down.\" She reached over, pulled one of the thicker, heavier pillows off the couch, shoved it against the side of the bench, and he gingerly laid down, making sure he was upright enough to still breathe. She peeled the rest of the shirt away, quickly taking off his silver-gray suitcoat and sliding it out from under him before he landed. The shirt would stay on until he grew tired of smelling his own dried blood. Vincent was not comfortable being nude in her presence. Even half-nude. Quietly, she began her work of cleaning him. He was quiet as ever, feeling nothing, even when she had to pry down to pull the bullet out. He clenched his muscles, his entire body quivering as if an electric current had been shot through him, but he did not scream, did not even whimper in pain. And thankfully, he did not pass out. When she was done, she cleaned the wound and handed him a bottle of Jack Daniels. He took small sips, just enough to blanket himself. His endorphins had probably long since kicked in, creating in him a sort of \"runner's high.\" She could see from the slightly glazed look in his eyes. The stitches were a bit tricky, but the hole was not large, and the blood had clotted quickly. She almost shook her head - the man didn't deserve to have the kind of healing system that he did. But then again, a man without a soul had to make up for it somewhere. A body like a machine seemed a good start. \"Sleep, not that you will, will help,\" she said, putting all her used materials into the hot water and bagging all the bloodied gauze for tossing. She pulled away from his reclined form for a moment as she worked and he did not bother her, but as she stood up, one of his hands grazed her forearm. \"Thank you, Victoria,\" he said, his eyes meeting hers. \"Don't thank me, pay me,\" she said, knowing it was just part of their routine.[Chapter 2] Thank you, reviewers! I appreciate honesty. I hope I don't disappoint. Please keep reviewing, as it makes the work a bit easier. Disclaimer: Don't own anything from Collateral. And I don't own Shakespeare, either. Shakespeare He healed fast. Within three days he was able to get up, move around, and seemed quite ready to leave. But he stayed. She didn't know why he stayed. Maybe it had something to do with the conversation. During the days, she went home and slept, leaving him alone. The first day she had stayed to watch him, but seeing that he was quite capable of taking care of himself, hadn't done so over the next two days. When she came in at dusk, she checked the waiting room, realized that it was an obvious problem, having him lying there when other clientele came in for mending, so she decided to just make the waiting room off limits. She moved a few chairs into the small hallway, posted a makeshift sign telling people to sit in the hallway. During the quiet hours, of which there were plenty, she went in the waiting room and sat with him. They had started talking. He asked her how she had become a doctor. She gave him the standard story, up until the point where she'd discovered severe signs of advanced sexual abuse in a ten year old boy who was on the brink of death. She wished she had been more careful, checked out who the father was before going on the war path. Not, she told herself, and eventually him when he pressed it, that it would have stopped her. Wrong was wrong. And here she was. \"You and I are opposites, you know,\" he commented. He had wedged himself upright with some tattered sofa cushions, his white shirt, tainted pink now from the permeation of his own blood, partly closed, in spite of the huge, dark red oval over the right side of his body. She arched an eyebrow. She wasn't used to talking much with people. Having become a night person, there weren't many people around to talk to. There were a few prostitutes who came in now and again, talked to her about her life, wondering how she managed to be respectable in the same world they inhabited, where women were just a commodity to be bought and traded. There was one drug dealer who seemed to have a good soul, but had been sucked, like her, onto the wrong path, and didn't know how to get off it. He was good for a few philosophical discussions, but he was few and far between. She'd never chatted with an assassin. Usually when she got assassins they kept their mouths tightly shut. She hadn't pegged Vincent for much of a chatter in the beginning. She should have been somewhat used to it by now. \"How do you mean?\" \"You give life. I take it away.\" \"I don't give life, I just fix whatever's wrong with the human body.\" \"And if you didn't, these people would probably die.\" He smirked at her, the light from outside catching on the gunmetal-gray of his hair. \"Why is your hair that color?\" she asked idly, sipping at a cup of black Starbucks coffee that she had reheated at least three times in her microwave, giving it the strength now of nuclear waste. He shrugged. \"Premature gray, what can I say?\" She shook her head. \"You have dark roots. You did that on purpose.\" \"It matches my suit.\" It was her turn to smirk. Of all the things to clam up about, it was his damn hair. Some people were so funny. \"So you know how I became a doctor. How did you become what you are?\" \"A contract killer?\" he said, with the sort of indifference that reminded her of the coldness of the person she was talking to. \"Yeah.\" \"Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.\" Pure deadpan as he did it. A few years ago, she might have thought he was serious. She'd gotten used to his twisted sense of humor. \"Seriously.\" \"Seriously.\" He echoed, then looked away, as if the answer were written on the wall behind him. \"Well, it mostly had to do with a big spiritual revelation.\" \"Nihilistic ways of thinking can be called spiritual?\" she asked. \"White is called a color, when it is really the absence of all color.\" \"I see your point.\" \"After that, it didn't matter what I did. The first one was hard, I admit. The first one is always hard. I actually threw up, if you can picture that.\" \"No, I can't.\" \"After that, it was easy. The more I did it, the easier it was. Now.\" He gave a half-shrug. \"It's just a job.\" \"Somehow I expected more out of you than that,\" she said with a sigh, standing up. He seemed confused. \"What do you mean?\" \"Typical hard-hearted assassin,\" she said, dumping her coffee, even thought there was half an inch left. \"I guess I shouldn't have expected more,\" she added, this one to herself. \"What the hell did I expect, anyway?\" There was a rustling at the door. She stepped out of the waiting room, without having to tell him to be quiet. She turned off the single dim light on her way, closed the door behind her, went into her lab, anticipating whomever it was who had come to see her. She had just reached her lab table when she realized that there was more than a single pair of footsteps entering her office. \"Dr. Potter?\" Victoria turned, a scalpel carefully shifted into the fold of her sleeve, just in case. But it was business, a couple of men in suits, armed but not threatening. \"We need your help, Dr. Potter,\" the first one said. \"Most of my clients introduce themselves first,\" Victoria said, politely. \"I'm Mr. Cranke, these are my associates, Mr. Bottom and Mr. Puck.\" \"Read Midsummer Night's Dream one too many times, have we?\" Victoria joked casually, reaching for her medical bag. \"Excuse me?\" Mr. Cranke asked. \"I didn't follow you...\" \"No, but I'll follow you. You work for Marcus Shakespeare, right? How badly shot is he this time?\" Marcus Shakespeare---the man was nuts for naming himself that. It wasn't his real name, he'd adopted the last name legally. If legally meant by bribes and pressure on all the right people. He had the money to spare, too. It seemed he needed to spend more of it on better security. There had been so many assassination attempts on the man in the past six months alone, it was almost enough money for her to finish paying back her loans. She would have finished a lot faster if she wasn't the kind of person who liked saving money in savings accounts. And she never went on shopping sprees with her credit card, always a plus. They politely escorted her to their waiting car, where they asked her kindly if she would please place the velvet bag over her head, which she did. It was routine. No one saw where Shakespeare hid himself. Not even her, who was starting to become his regular physician. Bullet wounds had become something of a specialty for her, and they'd picked up on that fast. They treated her well. The inside of the velvet bag had even been scented with something that smelled like linen. Of all the things, she thought wryly. They offered her some mineral water when they arrived, which she took, to clear her throat, and after she was done, they offered her a meal in the dining room before she was returned to her office. It was routine. She got calls like this all the time. They paid her extra for her to wear the bag. Shakespeare - she hated thinking of him like that - Marcus liked her, she could tell by the way his eyes lit up when she arrived at his bedside. He was a rather large man, dark hair going gray, muscular enough to hold his own in a fight, but aged enough to be slowed down. Still, she was quite sure that whoever had dared put that bullet in his lower leg had suffered far worse than he. She didn't like to think about it. She didn't think about it, she just did her job. They were humans, they needed fixing. These people had all the supplies she needed, and she left Mr. Marcus in a state of half-bliss, the flattened bullet in the hands of people who knew what to do with those things. She was not a forensic expert, although she was starting to wonder if she should have taken it up, like she'd had the hunch to do during her senior year in college. But no, she'd wanted to work with people. The irony, it was agonizing. If that was irony, she was never quite sure of the meaning of that word. \"This is wonderful chicken salad,\" she commented idly to the man who stood close by -Mr. Puck, if she remembered correctly. \"The Bard ordered it especially for you, after your last visit,\" he said. \"And the tea?\" \"Passionfruit flavored,\" she said with a smile, finishing the last few drops. \"Could you slip me some of the leaves before I go?\" He did, and within a half hour she was back at her office. When she came in, she was met with a rather annoyed Vincent. \"Where have you been?\" he asked, trying to be calm and failing only in the sense that he was looking around everywhere, something she discovered he only did if he was nervous. \"Working,\" she said. \"I had a call.\" \"A call that made them put a bag over your head?\" Vincent asked, his voice heavy with incredulity. \"Yes, as a matter of fact. I'm fine.\" She put her stuff away, realized he was still mildly pacing her office. \"Who were you treating?\" he asked. \"Do I ask you who hires you to kill people?\" she said, after shoving the last of her gauze back in the box, standing up and pressing a fist against the small of her back. That chicken salad was going to make her fat. She could already feel the mayonnaise making its way to her thighs. \"You don't have to be rude,\" he said, although there was a hint of contrition in his voice. \"I understand, professional confidence. It's fine. I just don't like being kept in the dark.\" \"Vincent, you've been here three days. I think you're well enough to go home,\" she said, opening and closing some drawers, suddenly very uncomfortable with his continued presence in her office. \"You want me to leave?\" he asked. He stopped by the door, looked back at her, face a picture of innocence. She had studied that face before, how it could be so perfect, and so absolutely nuts underneath, she didn't know. She thought there was some kind of rule in nature against beautiful things going insane. Suddenly, she felt guilty. \"It's not that,\" she sighed. She slammed the last drawer shut. \"You still wearing that shirt?\" He looked down. His white shirt still hung open, ruined and bloodsoaked. \"I don't have anything else.\" She picked up her keys. \"Look, I'll go get you a shirt.\" \"At three in the morning?\" \"Well, I'm not going to send you off looking like that. And your ear-\" she stepped closer, and then suddenly the door behind her opened. She spun around, startled, vaguely heard - more like felt, as Vincent's movements were practically silent - Vincent retreat into the next room, invisible. There were four men in the room, none of them like the three characters she'd encountered earlier, all of them holding their guns in their hands in plain sight. \"Can I help you gentlemen?\" she asked, a bit loudly. \"You can,\" the first one said, turning on the rest of the fluorescent overhead lights. She blinked hard - keeping the lights low helped save her electricity bill, which was insane in this town - looked around at their faces, didn't recognize anything, stared back at them blankly. \"And-?\" \"Marcus Shakespeare,\" the first one said, raising his gun. \"You treated him a short time ago, yes?\" \"Yes,\" she said, her stomach doing a slow summersault. No sense lying, but it felt wrong. \"You know where he is, yes?\" \"They blindfolded me, I don't know.\" \"But you've gone many times before,\" said the second man. The third and fourth seemed to be mainly occupied with blocking the door and looking out the windows, making sure they were alone. \"I'm sorry, who are you?\" she asked. \"I'll ask the questions, Dr. Potter,\" said the first man. \"Anybody tell you, all you guys look alike?,\" came Vincent's voice from a doorway. \"What do you do, go to a cronies school or something?\" He had gotten his suit-coat back on, had buttoned up his white shirt and buttoned the suitcoat to mostly cover all the dried blood. They turned. Surprised to see him. \"Who are you?\" asked the second man. \"I'll as the questions now,\" Vincent said. \"Are you bothering my doctor?\" \"She is Marcus Shakespeare's doctor,\" the first man said. \"We need to find him. You,\" he said, to Victoria, \"will take us to him.\" \"I already told you-\" \"She was blindfolded, she didn't see anything. She's no help to you guys,\" Vincent said, and Victoria finally noticed that of his hands was behind his back. \"I suggest you apologize and leave.\" \"I suggest we shoot you and leave, if you're no use to us,\" said the second man, and they all cocked their guns. \"They teach you that in cronies school?\" Vincent asked, his voice pleasant, conversational, nearly teasing. \"Shoot everybody?\" \"This isn't any of your business, old man-\" \"Don't let the gray hair fool you,\" Vincent said, his eyes sharpening, his smile becoming dangerous. \"Like I said, Dr. Potter isn't any help to you. So apologize for wasting her time, and leave.\" The second man raised his gun at Vincent, obviously annoyed that this supposed nobody was bossing him around. He fired, but missed. As he fired, Vincent fired back. He didn't miss. Victoria had heard gunshots before, but not inside a room in which she was enclosed. The sound was horrible, like an explosion, a miniaturized volcano erupting and spraying hot lava blood everywhere. The man fell, surprised and, a few seconds later, dead. The first man looked at Vincent, impressed, but knowing damn well such a thing couldn't be tolerated. The fourth man, the one who had been scouting the other rooms, had somehow gotten behind Victoria, and she didn't know he was there until she felt his hand on her shoulder and the barrel of his gun pressed between her shoulderblades. She let out the smallest of startled noises, then heard that explosion again, this time with the bullet whizzing right over her shoulder and causing a sickening sound behind her. Vincent was looking at her, at her , as if he was angry, as if it were somehow her fault she'd nearly gotten shot. And then his eyebrows arched just a touch, and he looked as if he expected her to say something, but if she had intended to say anything, she didn't get the chance, as the other two men opened fire and Vincent had to duck back into the waiting room. The glass between her office and the room was shattered, and Victoria stepped back so quickly she lost her balance and landed with a thud on her bottom behind a tall, marble-topped table that she'd been given as a gift from Mr. Marcus after her first visit, when he'd told her she was the best doctor ever and would let no one but her ever take bullets from his body. It was a stupid memory, but one that managed to keep her from going into hysterics as her office was shredded by gunfire. When it was done, she heard the metallic clinking of empty bullet casings on the floor, and then Vincent was standing over her, his hand reaching down, offering her help to her feet. She was quite calm when she stood up. \"You okay?\" he asked. \"Fine,\" she said. \"I don't even think I got scratched. But my ears are ringing.\" \"That will pass. You sure you're okay? If you're stressed, you should concentrate on breathing.\" \"I'm breathing fine,\" she said. She stepped away from him, toward the dead bodies. She'd seen dead bodies before, even freshly dead bodies, but not in the background of her destroyed office. \"Fuck,\" she said. \"What?\" \"I'll never get this cleaned up.\" He almost smiled. \"You certainly won't have time. Come with me.\" \"Why?\" she snapped, starting to pick up some of the larger pieces of glass and throw them into one of the sinks. \"Because the police are going to be here and you don't want to have to explain four dead bodies.\" \"I'll just tell them it was a gang, they'll buy it,\" she said, searching for a broom. Even she was amazed at her own calm. Vincent fixed her with a look. \"You're serious?\" She looked back at him. \"What, you're afraid I'm going to tell on you? Come on, Vincent, you've seen that's not how I run my business.\" \"No, I saw that you didn't know how to get to Marcus Shakespeare, so you told them you didn't know. You were lucky. What would you have said if you had seen it?\" \"That's a stupid question. I would have lied.\" Vincent smiled. \"You know something, Victoria? I never lie. I believe in complete and total honesty. And so, I'm going to ask you to come with me one more time, then I'm going to throw you over my shoulder and lock you in the trunk of that car outside if you say no.\" She hesitated, swallowed. \"Why?\" she whispered. \"Just come,\" he said, taking her arm, and leading her out the door to the car the thugs had left parked just outside her office. A/N: Like it? Hate it? Suggestions? Manners are always good, reviews are even better.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: Don't own anything except Victoria.

Keep commenting and I'll post Chapter 4 ASAP, which is already ready and raring to go. Honesty They stopped at hotel near the airport. Vincent explained in his casual way that he was supposed to have made a 6:00 a.m. flight three days ago, and that he would probably have to call around a bit to get a decent rate. The hotel was a decent place, clean, well kept, but not fancy. The single luxury it boasted was the bathroom, which was nearly a third the size of the room. The tub itself was huge, deep oval, enough for two people. Victoria found herself wishing she could take a bath, or better yet, wishing she could move into that hotel room, with its simplicity and luxury in all the right places to suit her tastes. As it was, she didn't even have a change of clothes. She looked down at her simple button-down shirt and jeans, and the white coat she kept around her to protect her from whatever might be splattered on it. She noticed a thin spray-pattern of dark red. She slipped the coat off, went into the bathroom, began running cold water and unwrapped the hotel soap in an attempt to clean it. When she came back, Vincent was sitting at the table in the room, the television off, and he was flipping idly through the room service menu. \"You hungry?\" \"Do they have room service this late?\" \"It's an airport hotel, I'm sure they do.\" She had moved up into the space between the two queen size beds. The clock blazed the numbers \"3:35 A.M.\" at her. Sunrise would start to crack the horizon in a few hours. She wondered if the cops had even arrived at her office yet. She wondered if she would ever be able to go back there. She wondered what in the hell Vincent thought he was doing. She looked at him over her shoulder, turned slightly. He noticed, looked back at her quizzically. \"You okay?\" \"Fine,\" she said, tightly. \"Vincent, will you answer a question?\" \"Depends on the question. I won't lie to you.\" \"Why are you really doing this? I mean, what happened tonight didn't have anything to do with you. You could have just kept quiet, stayed in that room, let those men carry out their business, then disappeared when it was over. No one would have been the wiser and you could have gotten your plane out of L.A. What are you going to do with me?\" He arched an eyebrow. \"Well, that's not really 'a' question, it's more like five or six questions. Why did I get involved, what's my interest in you, all of that.\" He waved his hand idly, almost as if he didn't really know himself. \"I guess I just don't like it when people I have business with are mistreated.\" She frowned, slowly finished her turn, sank down onto the bed. It really wasn't a large room, they were barely ten, fifteen feet apart. \"So what are we going to do now?\" \"I figured I'd order some room service, somehow get my shirt cleaned enough to go buy a new one in the morning, get a few hours sleep.\" \"Do you sleep?\" \"Everyone sleeps, Victoria.\" \"You haven't slept much at all since you came through my door,\" she said, feeling a little braver. \"You act like it, but I can tell.\" His eyes, which had been politely focused on her, an American way to show that a person was paying attention to everything someone said, drifted to the right, just barely, losing focus. He was thinking, and not very quickly. \"They say the higher the life form, the less sleep is required.\" She almost laughed, managed to stop it at the smile. \"Higher life forms?\" \"Explains why cats sleep all the damn time, doesn't it?\" \"You don't like cats,\" she sighed, realizing he had utterly changed the subject. No, he didn't lie. When he didn't want to talk about something, he just didn't. \"You a dog person?\" \"Not really any kind of animal person. Except maybe fish. But fish aren't animals, are they?\" \"No, they're fish,\" she said, reaching up to pull her hair out of the ponytail it had been in for far too long. She shook it out, feeling how lank and greasy the locks were. God, she needed a shower. \"You want something to wear?\" he asked. She looked back at him, startled. \"I'm sorry?\" \"When I go for a new shirt, you want me to pick you up something? What are you, a ten?\" \"Junior eleven,\" she said, feeling slightly modest. She may not have been a beauty queen, but she'd been blessed with a good sized figure. \"I'm going to go take a shower, I just can't stand this anymore.\" So that was what she did. She took a very long, very hot shower. She relished the burn, the pain on her arms and legs and back, as the water was possibly too hot. When she finished, she noticed red blotches on her skin, dismissed them. The hotel was polite enough to provide a hairdryer, which she used, using her fingers as a comb. It almost worked, but she was glad that her hair at least felt clean, even if it didn't look too much better.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: Same as always. A/N: Hope this chapter doesn't bore anyone. Please keep reviewing, as I've picked up the habit of responding. (grin) It makes the work go a lot faster, knowing I have people waiting to know what comes next. Sometimes even I don't know! Protection It took him a while, and she found herself alone in the hotel room for a bit. She pulled down the heavy bedspread, wondering if she might be able to get a few hours of sleep before they had to check out. The hotel had those velveteen blankets she liked so well - not the knotty cotton that showed way too much use. She pushed the sheet down, let her legs, the towel discarded in Vincent's absence, relishing the soft feel of the blanket against her skin. She picked up the remote and flipped through the dial, watching for some late news headline, and seeing nothing, she turned it off. It was going to be morning soon, and maybe there would be something then. If she and Vincent were there long enough for her to see it. When she thought about it, she wasn't sure what she expected to see. And if she did see anything, it might only make her panic. It didn't seem that Vincent was willing to let her go anytime soon...not that she'd really asked. It dawned on her then. She hadn't asked him to let her go. What if she tried? When he emerged, a towel wrapped around his waist, his shirt hanging over the shower rail, some of the bright red blood diminished but the shirt itself utterly ruined, she wondered how he would react if she asked him. He hadn't let Max go, but Max was more of a hostage. He seemed to think he was helping her. Protecting her. \"Did I tell you I got to see Max's mother?\" Vincent asked as he made himself comfortable on his bed again. She had made herself comfortable and now was directly across from him. She leaned forward on her elbows, her lower half modestly covered by the blankets. \"You saw your hostage's mother?\" \"I prefer to think of him as a friend,\" Vincent said sincerely. \"That's what I told his mother, too. Turned out he'd been lying to her, telling her he was running a limousine company. It was kind of sad, but it really made a lot of sense. Max was the sort of guy who had to have everything be perfect and ready before he'd try anything. He was going to spend the rest of his life waiting for everything to line up for him - I even told him that. Although this was much, much later. I guess he got pissed off that his mother liked me so much, he stole my briefcase and ran off with it.\" She jerked up a bit. \"Stole your briefcase?\" \"All my work-ups. Threw it onto the freeway.\" \"And you still didn't shoot him?\" Vincent shrugged, picking at what was left of his potato chips. \"I made him go get me new ones. I have no idea what the hell happened when he did, but when he came back, he had it.\" Victoria stared at him. \"Wow.\" Vincent was staring idly ahead, out the window, over the lights of Los Angeles. \"Yeah. Impressed even me, I gotta tell you.\" \"So what happened then?\" Victoria asked, sincerely interested now, perhaps in spite of herself. \"We went after the last two targets. The first guy was easy, in a big club called Fever. Turns out making them think Max was me was a really good idea. My boss sent some of his goons after me to make sure I didn't fuck it up. Tried to kill Max.\" He turned, looked at her, gave her something of a smile, and said, \"I didn't let them. Want to know why?\" \"Because you still needed him?\" He shook his head. \"Max didn't deserve to be gunned down by goons like that. But he didn't appreciate it. He was very pissed off at me later when we got out of the club. Probably because I killed the cop who was trying to take him away from me.\" Victoria pulled back a bit as his words ran through her head . Tried to take him away from me . Like Max was his property. It was a little creepy. \"Wouldn't talk to me afterwards. Didn't even say thank you.\" Vincent frowned a little, as if still hurt by the memory. \"Then he tried to kill us both by running us off the road. I got the message, and I took off to take care of the last assignment.\" He chuckled. \"That's when things turned shitty.\" She had pulled back, was leaning against the headboard, watching Vincent from over a small pile of covers, like a child being told a scary story by a mischievous baby sitter. \"Turns out it was the woman he'd met earlier that night. You know, it's kind of funny.\" He stopped picking at his potato chips, took a long drink of water, which was mostly melted ice cubes by now. \"I was actually telling him a little while ago that he needed to call her. That he needed to take the risk. If we lived through that night.\" \"Didn't you already know she was your last target?\" Victoria asked. \"I guess I did. I don't know why I said that to him. Maybe I was trying to make him feel better.\" \"About having to kill him later? That's what you were going to do by then, wasn't it?\" After a heavy pause, \"Yes.\" Victoria shut her eyes. \"Vincent, I'm really tired,\" she said softly. \"Yeah, you should get a little bit of sleep. I'll wake you when we have to leave.\" She slid down onto her back, pulling the covers up close. \"Yeah. Thanks.\" She dreamed about being in that cab with him. She was an invisible person in the back seat, watching everything.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: While I don't own Vincent, I do own Victoria and now Allen...although from this chapter, I think you'll be able to see that as no kind of threat. :) Heh. A/N: How can I resist updating when I've got so many wonderful people begging for more? No, I'm not suffering from ego. I don't think...hmm...well, two more days until I get to see Collateral again! Right now Interview With The Vampire is on TV. Another great Cruise as villian role. Anyway, enjoy! Situations She fell into a hard sleep, one that lasted a long time, longer than she'd wanted. When she woke up, she saw that Vincent had already gone on his errands, and had brought back much more than a simple change of clothes. She sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes, attempting to push down the tangled mess that was her hair. She sat there for a moment, listening to the sounds of someone in the bathroom - Vincent, no doubt. As if she was going to wake up from all of this and it was going to be ten years ago, she and Allen on their honeymoon...not that that was the greatest memory, only just her most pleasant, up to date. She pushed off the covers and got up, looked at the clothes Vincent had lain on the chair both of them had occupied last night at some time or another. There was a dress, a rich blue-gray color, very dark and sleek. It was one of those dresses that professional women wore to the office, simple, straight up-and-down, no frills and yet totally elegant. It was sleeveless, with a straight across neck, zipped down the back. She held it up against her body, looked into the mirror. Funny, she'd never owned a dress like this before. She'd had nowhere to wear it. Usually she had always stuck to her simple black skirt and whatever shirt she felt like wearing, if the need arose. Whatever had compelled Vincent to get this for her--- Her thoughts were cut off as he emerged from the bathroom. He didn't look any different than he had the night before he'd first come to her, except all the blood stains were gone. His shirt, immaculate white, obviously replaced, was open slightly at the neck, no tie. She got the feeling he really didn't like ties, just wore them when he had to. The blood had apparently come out of the jacket well enough that she couldn't see it. \"I also got you a brush and some other...accessories,\" he said, coming around the bed. She had let the dress slip down to her waist, covering her exposed legs. He stopped a few feet from her, looked up at her, gave her a casual smile. \"You going modest on me?\" he asked coyly. \"I don't know when I wasn't being modest,\" she returned. He nodded, acquiescing. \"The other stuff is in the bathroom.\" He gestured behind him. \"Go on, get dressed. We'll go for lunch.\" Lunch...the clock blazed 1:30 P.M. at them. \"I take it we missed checkout?\" \"Yes, but it isn't a problem. I can't get a flight home until the day after tomorrow.\" She nodded, but he didn't see it, as she was in the process of closing the door behind her. He'd brought her a brush, a hat, a scarf, and some of that spray-in conditioner. She'd never used it, but figured it couldn't hurt, and when she was done her hair was almost back to normal. She wished he brought her something to tie her hair back with, as she usually had it up in a pony tail or a braid to keep it out of her way. The hat was made of leather, had a visor like a baseball cap, and a wide, blossoming crown that suited her. She twisted her hair up and tucked it under the hat, finding it fit perfectly. She tied the scarf around her neck, a simply colored piece of silk and velvet that he had to have picked up in a tourist shop. It had the pattern of lilies on it, gray and white with black enhancements. The neck of the dress was wide, showing much more of her shoulders than she would have liked, but the scarf helped. When she was done, she looked at herself and almost laughed. It was like she was playing dress up. And then it occurred to her that it was Vincent who was really dressing her up. The thought made her blush - she turned away from the mirror and stepped out of the bathroom. He had gone to get ice and was sipping at some tap water when she came out. He looked her up and down, and Victoria struggled not to slow her pace across the room as if she were posing for him. \"Nice,\" he said. \"You look nice.\" \"Thank you for the stuff,\" she said. \"But you really didn't have to go all out -\" \"I didn't? Most of the women I know would have been complaining that they didn't have any make-up.\" He looked directly at her face, smiled. \"You don't seem to need any.\" \"Well, with all the blushing I'm about to do, no, I'm sure I don't,\" she returned, a bit stiffly. \"You said something about lunch?\" \"Yeah, downstairs in the lobby. The desk said they make a good cheeseburger.\"[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: Don't own anything in the movie Collateral, I only own Victoria. And Allen, but he bit it big time. SIGH Special Note to Warm Mittens : Awwww...don't cry! Here, here's your hug! {{BIG HUG}} You are so sweet, girlfriend. I so didn't mean to make you cry...here, this chapter should make you feel a little bit better. I'm updating just for you. :) Reasons She didn't need to bathe. She'd already bathed the day before. She hardly smelled like anything, as she hadn't done anything that day except get dressed and go find her dead ex-husband. She ran the hot water, filling up the large, deep tub. There wasn't any bubblebath, but there was some bath salt, so she dumped it in, turning the water a milky off-white. When she stepped in, it was steaming like a bowl of soup, and she sank all the way to the bottom without so much as sucking in her breath. She lay back, trying to calm herself. She had the aftereffects of crying stuck in her throat, the hiccupping breaths that took forever to go away. She closed her eyes, tried to focus herself, tried everything she could think of to make herself calm down, but knew, eventually, that there was no way that was going to happen. Her logical doctor mind told her she was grieving. Grieving was a process. Denial, bargaining, anger, acceptance...she couldn't think straight enough to figure them all out. Something else, a fifth one...who the hell cared. She just wanted to lay her head back, sink down, drown. She'd just be another corpse on the mortician's slab that night. The thought was oddly peaceful. She slipped down far enough so that her lips went under water, but her nose stayed above, keeping her supplied with air. She wasn't going to kill herself. But dammit if she would ever be able to smile again. The water started to cool down. Her back started to ache from resting against the hard basin of the tub. She didn't want to get out yet, so she leaned forward, pulling her knees up to her chest, folding her arms in front of her, burying her face there, just staring into space, trying not to think of anything. There was a gentle rap at the door. It opened slightly, and a hand came through, holding one of the hotel room's drinking glasses, filled with a few fingers of some kind of alcohol. He shook the glass, making the ice tingle. Then the rest of him appeared. He had his hand over his eyes, allowing her her modesty, and since she wasn't screaming at him to get out, he was assuming it was safe to come in. He peeked at her though his fingers, saw she was shielding anything she didn't want to be seen, and then dropped his hand. He put the glass on the wide rim of the tub. She looked at it for a moment, then picked it up. He sat down on the sink. \"How to you feel?\" he asked. She almost choked on the whiskey, good old Jim Beam, left a burning trail down her throat that hurt more than usual after all the crying she'd been doing. It wasn't the pain that made her choke, it was the simple idiocy of the question. Something a doctor would ask. She put the glass down, looked over at him. Her throat hurt too much to speak, so she just shifted her shoulders up in a shrug. He nodded. \"I understand. I do. But you have to pull together. We're checking out tomorrow. We're going to go over to the Renaissance.\" \"Why?\" she croaked, surprised. \"Not good to stay in one place too long. Now that...well, things have happened, people are going to start looking for you in particular who aren't criminals. You want them to find you?\" She blinked slowly, her eyes aching with all the tears she'd shed. \"I guess not,\" she murmured. She closed her eyes, rested her head on her arms, feeling so weary. She hadn't meant to become a criminal, let alone a fugitive from the law. It wasn't fair, this awful deal she had been handed in life. Had God totally abandoned her? What was she going to do? Vincent reached out, pulling one of her wet locks of hair from where it stuck to the side of her face. The back of his fingers stroked her hair, just over her ear. She opened her eyes, looked at him. \"Come on, Vic,\" he said, his voice so soft, so compassionate. \"I'll go, you get out and dry off. I brought you a sleep-shirt, too. One of those silly, cutesy things with a cartoon cat on it, saying he doesn't do mornings.\" In spite of herself, she gave him a small smile. \"Okay,\" she whispered. She picked up her glass, finished the whiskey, and handed it to him, as his hand was out and waiting for it. He gave her a last, small smile and left her in peace, as he promised. For her end, she did get out and dry off, letting her hair stay wet, even though it was neatly combed this time. Vincent had put the shirt on the sink and it was just as he'd described it. When she came out of the bathroom and saw her bed, she realized how tired she was. She didn't feel she had the right to be that tired, as it was only eight o'clock in the evening, and she hadn't done much that day. Unless you counted crying for nearly four hours. It did take a lot out of her. She made her way around her bed, stopped at the foot, sat down. She didn't care. She didn't care what happened to her. She didn't care about anything. She felt totally numb. She wished she could just shut her eyes, and disappear. She actually tried it, letting her eyelids flutter shut. \"Victoria, I poured you another drink if you want it,\" came Vincent's gentle, cajoling voice. Opening her eyes, she sighed, stood up and made her way to the table between the beds. There were four fingers of whiskey in the glass now, and she raised it to her lips, taking a very healthy swallow. She let it burn down her throat; let the bitter taste snap at her tongue, relishing the unpleasantness of it. She finished the glass in another swig, opened her eyes, saw Vincent looking up at her, his lips twisted into an expression of admiration. \"You want some more?\" he asked. \"Although to be honest, alcohol doesn't dull the pain. It's a mood enhancer. If you're depressed, it will only make you more depressed.\" \"Then why do people drink when they're sad?\" she asked. He shrugged. \"Gluttons for punishment. Misery does love company.\" She sighed, sitting down. It took her a second to realize she was sitting on his bed, exactly as she had the night before. He was still fully dressed, gray pants, white shirt, now mostly open. She reached up a hand and checked to make sure that the gauze was still clean. \"It's pretty much stopped bleeding,\" he said. \"It's started to itch a little.\" \"Good sign,\" she nearly slurred. \"Means it's healing.\" He nodded, looked at her. \"How about you, do you itch? Are you healing?\" She raised her eyes to meet his. It took more effort than she would have liked. Hell, it was only three shots of whiskey. On an empty stomach. After a very difficult day. What was she going to say again? Oh, yeah. \"Are you making fun of me?\" \"Never,\" he said, and she could not tell if he was serious. She leaned closer to him. \"Am I drunk?\" she asked. \"Probably pretty buzzed.\" She realized he was flipping idly through a magazine, sitting on his lap. \"No body could possibly blame you, though.\" She reached out, pulled the magazine off his lap and tossed it onto her bed. \"What about you, do you blame me?\" \"Not at all,\" he said, softer, his smile so sweet. She smiled back at him, leaned closer, smelling his aftershave. It wasn't cheap - he must have carried something expensive on him, or bought it downstairs. It was like linen...crisp and fresh. His lips were so close to hers. She reached up, cradled his face between her hands, her palms tingling with the contact of his rough goatee. She wanted to run the soft insides of her fingers across it, but instead, she leaned in even closer and kissed him. He kissed her back. It occurred to her, in the part of her mind that wasn't completely controlled by the combination of alcohol and grief, that he had kissed her first, the other night. So drunk or not, she could have very rightly kissed him, as he seemed to be encouraging some kind of romantic liaison between them. She wanted to ask him if he seduced all his lady hostages, but knew he would be offended by her referring to herself as a hostage, as he claimed he was protecting her. And again, the question of WHY he was protecting her, what was her importance to him, it couldn't just be out of the goodness of his heart, that didn't fit in with him. Or did it? The part of her brain that was controlled by her grief and alcohol intake told the rest of it to shut up. He had his arms around her now, holding her close as she explored his mouth, massaging his lips with her own, gently and entirely at her own pace. He let her go on so long that she began to think he was just waiting for her to stop, so she did, in a moment of hesitancy. She pulled back. His arms were firm around her waist, her back. She gazed down at him. Then she set her head down on his chest, wrapping herself around him. He shifted, giving her more room on the bed, the warmth he'd created underneath him filling her up with the movement. He held her there for a bit, silent and gazing out the window, waiting for whatever she was going to do next. After a time, she began to grow uncomfortable with the closeness, and began to shift in his arms, almost pushing him away. He loosened his grip and she half sat-up, looking away. \"What is it?\" She didn't answer. She couldn't think, there was just too much in her head. \"Victoria?\" A hand gently lifted her face to meet his. She gazed into his eyes, those cold, soulless eyes. How could something so beautiful be so empty? She saw nothing more there than she had on the first night she'd met him. She almost laughed. \"This is ridiculous,\" she said, although it wasn't for his benefit. He shook his head, pulling her closer. She would have fought him if she'd had the strength, but the thought of completely letting go of him was a bit unbearable at the moment. She would start crying again, and she didn't want that. \"No, it isn't,\" he assured her. She was beside him now, almost prone next to him. They looked at each other, and she felt utterly foolish. \"Yes it is,\" she said, again more to herself. \"You want to get laid and I'm the only piece of pussy in the room.\" To her surprise, he laughed softly. \"You shouldn't talk about yourself like that. It isn't true.\" He pulled her closer, so close she was tempted to kiss him again, just because it made being this close to him less complicated. \"The heartless assassin is trying to make me feel better.\" Who in the hell was she talking to, anyway? Or worse yet, who was talking through her? \"Don't play pretend, Vincent.\" \"I'm not playing.\" He stroked her hair, her shoulder, down to her chest. She felt the first caress of his hand beside her breast, wanting to envelop it in his palm, but waiting. \"Tell me what you want, Victoria.\" \"What I want?\" \"What you want me to do. Tell me and I'll do it.\" It was her turn to almost laugh. \"Right.\" \"Seriously.\" Gently, his hand cupped her left breast, his thumb working at the nipple through the cotton of her shirt. She felt herself respond. \"Tell me. Talk to me.\" She was on fire, either from the alcohol or from the images that suddenly flashed into her mind. There was no way in hell she was going to tell him...she'd never even told Allen. It wasn't a big surprise that the two of them hadn't had much of a sex life. Then the thought of Allen made her close her eyes, flinch, turn away. \"No, no, Victoria,\" Vincent whispered, pulling her back, \"stay with me. Tell me.\" He kissed her, moved his mouth down her chin, down her neck. \"Tell me,\" he whispered against her skin. \"Tell me.\" Whether she told him or not, for that moment, he seemed to know exactly what to do. Various parts of her began to awaken; her body grew a mind of its own. Her hormones made her mouth open, started pushing out the dark secrets, things she had never told anyone, things she was ashamed to have rolling around inside her head. And he did them. He did all of them. (A/N: Sorry guys, gotta keep my PG-13 rating!)[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: Don't own Collateral. A/N: Yay! Tonight I get to go see the movie again! It will be weird, though...the first time I've seen it since I started writing this fanfic. I wonder if the ending will feel different...hmm...anyhoo, I've been listening to this new CD lately by an artist called Jem -- no, not Jem and the Holograms, a new artist, she's kinda blusey, kind of like Dido only a bit more upbeat. There are a few songs on there that totally go along with this fic. I'll post some lyrics in a later chapter. All right, I won't keep you in suspense any longer. Let's get to it! Claudia Vincent disappeared so quickly from beside her that she didn't actually see it happen; she only saw the faint blur of his silver-gray hair go past her. Her first instinct was to cover her nudity - she hadn't gotten dressed again, still flushed from her earlier exertions. It was a mistake, she knew that now, but then again, one never expected an ambush. The man who entered the room was low-level street trash, carrying a very large shotgun. Whether he actually dressed like that because he liked it or if it was a disguise was something for Vincent to know, but he had disappeared into the shadow and Victoria was starting to wonder what in the hell he was doing. The man walked into the room, got three wide paces, and then was abruptly shot from behind. Vincent had just stood up, shorts back on, protecting his own dignity. He'd found his gun, not that there was ever any question of that, and was aiming it toward the dead body. For a moment, Victoria was sure he had shot him, but as the man fell, there was another figure behind him. A woman. She slowly stepped into the large rectangle of light, tall enough so that her head and shoulders remained in shadows. She was all in black from the neck down, the only color on her being her very long, straight, golden blond hair. Victoria couldn't see her face. The woman, however, could see her, and quite well. \"Seems I've interrupted something,\" she said, her voice low and smooth, the same kinds of tones Vincent used during moments of tension. \"Claudia?\" There was actual surprise in his voice, although his stance belayed none of it. \"Hey Vince.\" Equally surprised, hiding it better. They were aiming their guns at each other, a perfect stand-off. \"Didn't know you'd gone private.\" \"For a while now,\" he said, although is tone clearly showed he would rather have said nothing. \"How about you?\" \"Even longer,\" she replied, equally tense. \"You know, I did just save you from a very unprofessional hit man, you can put down your gun.\" \"You first.\" She did so, without having to be asked again. She even put it away, then put her hands up. \"Come on, Vince. You're not going to shoot me, are you?\" \"Maybe not right this second.\" \"Aw. Still bitter? You knew it was over, I can't believe you're still holding that against me.\" Slowly, he lowered his gun. He stepped closer to the light, his shadow falling across Victoria somewhat, shielding her. \"These things are never personal, Claudia.\" \"Right,\" Claudia replied. She glanced down at Victoria, who was growing more and more uncomfortable by the minute. \"So, you going to continue to let your new girlfriend sit there, naked as a jaybird? Or are you going to give her some dignity?\" Victoria didn't see it, but the muscles in Vincent's cheek twitched, a very clear sign of his annoyance. \"Victoria,\" he said, \"get up, cover yourself.\" Cover yourself . Like she was a whore. She scowled, standing up, no longer caring who the hell saw her. She stepped out of the light, into the shadows, pulled her sleep-shirt out from where it had been tossed and then somehow shoved under the bed and put it on. She looked around for her underwear, only found her jeans. \"I'm surprised at you, Vincent,\" she said. \"You know people like us aren't supposed to get involved with our clients.\" \"What are you doing here, Claudia?\" Vincent was saying, not moving from where he stood, not giving her a single inch of the room. Claudia pushed the door shut behind her, although nothing kept it shut. It was only a matter of time before security showed up, and then, the police. It was amazing that they hadn't arrived already, but this was real life, not the movies. \"I work for Marcus Shakespeare,\" she said, her voice lowered. Pushing the door shut had put the whole room back into darkness, so she reached for the nearest switch, turning on the lamps in the middle of the room. Victoria saw her underwear underneath the other bed. She didn't bother, just put the jeans on, commando. \"Do you?\" Conversationally, as if they were at a party and they were two strangers getting to know each other. \"Yes, he heard about what happened at your office, Dr. Potter.\" Victoria turned around and saw the woman looking at her, addressing her directly. Well, at least that was some sign of respect. Still, Vincent didn't move, continued to stand between them like the Berlin Wall. \"And?\" Vincent pressed. \"How did you find us? How did you know that guy was coming up here? Your entrance is too perfectly timed, Claudia. It makes me suspicious.\" \"Mr. Shakespeare sent me to find her,\" Claudia answered. \"And how did you find us?\" \"With difficulty. I saw that guy creeping around here when I showed up, I have no idea who he was. I wound up following him up here; I guess luck was on my side. Or yours, depends on how you look at it. But now I know why it was so hard to find you. Are you involved in this, Vincent?\" \"Only because I happened to be in her office when a few thugs came around and wanted her to tell them where to find her former patient.\" \"Ah, so it was you who killed them,\" Claudia said, understanding. \"That makes sense. But I don't get why you're still here.\" \"Are you trying to ask me if someone's paid me to be here?\" Vincent asked. \"Because you know damn well I'm not going to answer that.\" Claudia shrugged. \"At any rate,\" she continued, \"Dr. Potter, Mr. Shakespeare was concerned for your safety. He's rather fond of you.\" \"How is he?\" Victoria asked, sitting down to put on her shoes. She was suddenly sounding like a doctor again, all professionalism. \"He's alive, and going to stay that way,\" Claudia replied. \"He would like you to come pay him another visit, though. So he can see with his own eyes that you're safe.\" Victoria stared up at Claudia, taking in her features. She had the appearance of someone who had deliberately altered her face on more than one occasion. Her eyebrows were non-existent, painted on with an eyebrow pen, and her large blue eyes seemed distant and icy. She was a beautiful woman, the kind of haughty loveliness found on the covers of Cosmo and other fashion magazines. But she wore no make-up, her pale features blending together at the moment, non-striking except for her eyes, which took in everything. Just like Vincent. So there was a certain look that assassins had. \"Sorry, Claudia,\" Vincent was saying. \"That's not going to happen.\" \"So she is under your protection?\" Claudia asked, unfazed. \"In a manner of speaking, yes.\" A nasty little half-smile curled the corner of Claudia's lip. \"Okay. Fine. My boss trusts me, I'll just tell him he'll have to take my word for it. But if I were you, Dr. Potter, I would stay close to Vincent, if you can trust him. He's never failed to reach an objective yet.\" She turned, left the room, leaving them alone with a blasted door and a dead body. Vincent picked up the shotgun, turned to Victoria, tossed it onto her bed. \"Take that, and pack up. We're leaving.\" Before she knew it, they were creeping down the back stairs and out into a parking lot. Vincent seemed to have eyes in every direction. He dragged her through the lot and into the street, which was deserted this late. They continued to walk, quickly but not at too fast of a pace, until they reached another hotel. It was the Renaissance.[Chapter 8] Standard disclaimer A/N: You guys had me worried there for a minute...I know that Sweet Arwen and Sweet Treats were keeping up with me, but until this morning I wasn't sure anyone else out there was awake! :) But now I have more reviews and I'm happy. Not that I wasn't happy before...I thought I was doing this for the fame and glory but I guess I'm really just doing it for fun. SO you have fun too, and don't forget to REVIEW! :) After this chapter, you may really, really want to....heh heh...(rubs hands together evilly) Coincidence Old town Pasadena was a lively little place, and extremely quiet that early in the morning. None of the shops had opened yet, and Vincent wasn't much of a window shopper anyway, so they soon grew bored and went back to the hotel. Victoria did not fail to notice that there was a church tower just a few blocks over. She had told Vincent once that she was a God-fearing woman. Was that true? Had she changed so much in a matter of days? A blush crept up her cheeks when she thought about the previous night...the things Vincent had done to her...the things she'd asked him to do...she looked away, down at her feet. She didn't know what to think of herself. Worse yet, she didn't really know what Vincent thought of her, either. Funny, though. She never got the feeling that he ever judged her. They were just crossing the threshold of their room when there was a small, definitive beep coming from Vincent's jacket pocket. He looked mildly surprised, reached down, pulled out the source. It was a pager, small and sleek, glinting silver in the light. He flipped on one of the lamps, turning it over to find a number. Victoria sat down on the bed, gazing out the window again. She felt very tired, suddenly, and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep. But the adrenaline started to flow again when she heard him walk over to the small table with the telephone, pick it up and start to dial. There was a long pause before she heard him say, \"It's Vincent.\" Silence. Vincent was listening intently to whoever was speaking. She heard him murmur things like, \"yes...no...I'm still in L.A.\" It occurred to her that he was speaking with his employer. The blood started to drain out of her face as she realized she could be sitting in a room where a contract on someone's life was being taken out. Her fingers felt numb, she had been leaning on her wrists wrong. She sat up, shaking them out. She had a lot of nerve now, getting all weirded out. \"Okay,\" Vincent said, his voice very soft, and he gently replaced the receiver on its cradle. He had his back to her, and for several minutes, he didn't move. She looked over her shoulder. \"Everything okay?\" she asked hesitantly. His head rose up, but he didn't look around. She saw him take a deep breath, give himself a little shake, and then stand up. He walked right over to her, stood in front of her. \"I've just gotten a new job,\" he said in the sort of low-key tone that made her think something was really wrong and he was just attempting to soften the blow. \"And?\" \"And it's on your patient, Marcus Shakespeare.\" She stared up at him, jaw going slack. \"Well, you didn't take it, did you?\" \"I did.\" Still so calm. She felt her heartbeat accelerate as her anger rose, bringing the blood back to her face. \"Why?\" \"Because it's a job.\" She stood up, but he didn't give her an inch of space. The area between his body and the bed was just barely enough for her to stand in. \"Vincent, you can't take that job, it's---\" \"Victoria,\" he was meeting her eyes, \"I told you I don't lie. I'm not lying to you now. If you're worried about your safety, you don't have to. I know you don't know how to reach him.\" \"That isn't the point,\" she snapped, taking a step closer to him, not caring about their proximity anymore. Her mind was whirling now, things spinning in her brain that she didn't want to let land, but were crashing into her reason with the speed of a meteorite. She found herself shaking her head, felt dizzy, almost lost her balance, but caught herself. Vincent reached out to hold her steady, her anger flooded what was left of her rationality, and she shoved him away, hard, making him take a step back. \"Don't you think that's too much of a coincidence?\" she said, her voice a low growl. \"Yes, I do.\" \"And you don't believe in coincidences.\" \"No, I don't.\" \"So this isn't a coincidence.\" It snapped into her brain, like a child's set of building blocks, forming a hideous monster. \"You...you knew that he was a patient of mine.\" Vincent just looked at her. \"That night you came to me...you were injured, but the reason you stayed around so long wasn't because you were recuperating, was it? You hate L.A. You couldn't wait to get out.\" \"No, I couldn't.\" \"But you stayed. You stayed because you were waiting for something. The night that those boys came for me, did you got a call then, too?\" He frowned, lightly. \"How would you know that?\" \"Wild guess.\" \"Or maybe you're just paranoid.\" \"So you didn't get the call then...when did you?\" He took a breath. \"The first morning, when you were asleep. Before I went out. They told me that they might need me, asked me to stay in L.A. for a few more days. Got me a flight out for later on today.\" \"So that's why you stayed. Not to protect me.\" \"No, I was protecting you. I knew you didn't know anything by then, but no one else knew that. I figured that keeping you close was probably a good way to keep track of things.\" \"What about Allen?\" she cried, her throat threatening to close. \"Why did he have to die?\" \"I didn't kill him,\" Vincent said. \"I suspect Claudia did.\" She shook herself. This was unbelievable . \"How do you know that?\" she asked softly. \"I only figured it out this morning,\" Vincent said. \"She probably went to Allen's house to see if you might be there. When she saw he was alone, she shot him. Then when we showed up, she followed us back, waited for an opportunity. She probably paid some poor desperate druggie to take that shotgun and shoot down our door, because by then she knew I was with you. She didn't want to take the chance that if we got into it, I would win. So she just came for information, tried to make it look like we're all on the same side.\" \"So Claudia is after Shakespeare, too? If she is, then you are on the same side.\" Vincent shrugged. \" If she is. I still don't know what she has to do with all of this, exactly, but I'm certainly not going to rely on any assumptions. Not when it comes to her.\" \"So what now? You're taking that job, what happens next?\" \"I go to my drop point, get my work-up, and we go see Mr. Shakespeare.\" \"We? I'm not going with you.\" \"I'm afraid you are, Victoria. I still need you.\" \"As a hostage,\" she said, and from the faintest flicker of guilt she saw in his dark eyes, she knew it was true. \"Forget it, Vincent.\" He reached out, one hand resting gently on her shoulder, pulling her close. He was smiling at her in his innocent, sweet way. \"Come on, Victoria,\" he said, \"we're still in this together. It's because of that man that your ex-husband is dead. Don't you want a little revenge?\" \"You said revenge was a bad idea,\" she hissed. \"Did I?\" His hand slid down her back, bringing her even closer. She stiffened. \"Yeah.\" She reached up, pushed away. \"You are a soulless bastard, aren't you?\" The smile faded in a wink of his eye. \"What?\" \"You used me. All this time, you used me !\" She pushed harder, getting more distance between them. When the back of her knees hit the bed she made her way around it, keeping her eye on Vincent, suddenly terrified and infuriated by him. \"It was all a game for you, wasn't it?\" \"I told you, Victoria,\" he said, his countenance slowly becoming more and more dangerous as he started to prowl after her, \"I don't lie.\" \"No, what you do is worse. You totally manipulate. You get into people's heads, and use whatever you find there. That's your scheme, isn't it? Your trick. Make them empathize with you, make them think they're in it with you. That's how you play them.\" Empowered by the slow, crumbling wall of his confidence, she continued, her voice getting louder, angrier by the second. She searched for the worst thing she could say, found the only weapon she had within her immediate reach. \"But Max had you figured out, didn't he? He knew you were empty inside, that you really knew nothing about anything , it was all just an act. And now I see it, too. You're just a heartless, soulless killer . That's it. There's nothing else to you except your workups and your expensive suit.\" She turned away, disgusted. But it wasn't enough. Maybe if she'd slapped him, like her fingers itched to do, it might have stopped what came next. His hand clamped down around her wrist, yanking her back, spinning her around until her back made contact with the wall, not painfully but sharp enough to startle her into raising up her head. Then his mouth descended on her, no mercy this time, his body pressing her against the rough fabric of the wallpaper, lips assaulting hers, his hands holding her in place so she couldn't get away, could barely struggle. At first the kiss was rough, intended only to assault and subdue her, and the second she felt his tongue touch hers, she wondered if he was going to shove it down her throat, just to make her gag. But just as quickly, the force was relented and he was gentle, caressing her mouth, finding the sensitive parts she had never known existed. He drew her tongue into his mouth, sucked on it, and she heard a low groan way in the back of his throat. When he stopped, she found she couldn't breathe properly. She was panting; the pressure of him holding her against the wall was the only thing keeping her upright. She blinked several times, trying to collect herself. He started on her neck and shoulders then, the roughness of his face driving her further away from reality. She struggled, but he held fast, knowing by now that she liked to struggle, it was part of her act, part of her secret. She focused on clearing her head, getting her mouth to work properly, and finally found the right words. \"You really missed your calling, Vincent. You should have been an actor.\" He pulled away, roughly, still holding her in place, glaring into her eyes. \"All this time, and you still don't know me at all,\" he spat. \"I know you,\" she returned, as if absorbing all his arrogance and confidence with their bodily contact. \"There isn't anything to know.\" She spat the words, almost literally spat in his face. For a moment, he went totally blank, and then he exploded. His face came together, a horrible mask that only mirrored her own rage, and he yanked her away from the wall, practically throwing her onto the bed. She rolled, visions of all kinds of horrid things spinning through her head, and she landed on the other side, barely getting her feet under her. \"You think I put my neck out for anyone!\" he howled at her, his voice high, screeching, tearing through her head like a pair of talons. \"I. DO. MY. JOB.\" \"Your job, YOUR JOB, shove your job up your ass !\" she screamed at him, feeding from the situation instead of being drained by it, which was probably more like her to do. But she was so hurt, so incredibly, deeply wounded by the fact that Vincent had played her that she no longer cared about being dead or alive. He leapt up onto the bed, covering half the distance between them. She flung back into the corner, unwilling to let him get close. She reached for the lamp, ripped it from the wall and flung it at him. He caught it easily, then hurled it across the room, where it shattered against the far wall. \" DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING !\" he screamed. \" HOW FUCKING STUPID CAN YOU BE?!?\" She darted around the bed, and he lost his balance temporarily on the mattress in an effort to snatch after her, sliding before he could get onto the floor and chase after her. She ran down the hallway, hit the stairs and jumped down half the flights, running the rest. She found a back exit and hurled her way through it. She was half-way across a back alley when a sound like thunder exploded beside her, sending a small spray of gravel up against the left side of her body. She stopped, knowing that sound. Vincent's gun. She turned slowly, telling herself it didn't matter. He couldn't do anything to hurt her, anymore. If she was dead, so be it. Maybe God would let her apologize to Allen before sending her straight to hell. He was walking up to her, his gun raised. When there was only about ten feet of space between them, he stopped. \"You're not going anywhere, Victoria,\" he said, his voice much calmer than before, although not completely his old smooth self yet. \"I'm not going with you,\" she said. \"You are,\" he said. \"You don't have a choice.\" She looked up. It was daylight. The man had fired a gun in daylight in the middle of Pasadena's Old Town. Where was everybody? It wasn't like they were in South Central L.A., where gunfire was part of the ambiance. She blinked, her adrenaline starting to clear, her brain starting to unravel. \"Are you going to shoot me, Vincent?\" she asked, her voice more level. He stepped closer, almost close enough to reach out. \"Victoria, don't make me do something I'll regret. I liked Daniel, too. And I shot him.\" To illustrate his point, he cocked his gun. She nodded, slumping her shoulders. Suddenly the urge to die wasn't so strong. Maybe it had been the thought about hell. She looked up, saw the church tower. No, it wasn't her time to die yet. \"Come on,\" he said, finally getting the nerve to reach out and take her arm. He put his gun away. \"We're going to the drop.\" Numbly, she let him drag her down the alley and into a cab. She didn't pay attention to where they were going, didn't even bother to look at anything except her feet in the bottom of the cab. \"Victoria?\" he said, a little bit later. When she didn't look up, he said it again. \"Victoria?\" She looked up at him, her expression not changing. He stared at her, expecting something. She could tell by the raise of his eyebrows. \"Am I your property now?\" she said, her voice low, spiteful. \"My property?\" \"Like Max,\" she bit out. He stared at her a moment, letting her words sink in. Then, abruptly, he laughed, as if she'd made a joke. \"No, Victoria, you aren't like Max,\" he said, adding a shake of his head and tossing her a coy smile. \"What's going to happen to me?\" He shrugged. \"The day is still young. Could be anything. Over there, Albert,\" he said to the cabbie. She hadn't even noticed that he'd learned the cabbie's name. \"On the right.\" The driver pulled up, Vincent paid him, and he pulled Victoria out of the cab with him.[Chapter 9] Standard Disclaimer A/N: Well, lots of great buzz about the last chapter...this chapter is a bit more low key, but I really enjoyed writing it as well. I hope you like it. Ungrateful She hadn't been paying attention to anything during the ride there, and noticed, with a little jolt of surprise, that they were back in downtown L.A., on Hill Street, not too far away from the Coliseum. His hand went from its pincher-like grip on her forearm to a more relaxed drip on her wrist, and then his hand went into hers, casually, like a high school couple walking through the hallways. She was tempted to try and pull her hand away, but knew that wouldn't succeed in anything other than annoying him, and she'd seen enough of his anger for one day. His grip only tightened whenever she went too slack, or moved too far away, giving the feeling that her hand was going to slip out. It was clearly a gentle warning - very gentle, considering he'd shot at her not more than a half hour ago. Stay close . They went into Union Station, which was still used as an MTA station and a regular train station. There were some lockers tucked away into one of the corners, probably mostly used by homeless people and the occasional drifter. He went straight to one of the lockers and opened it up with an easy spin of the dial. Victoria watched with a detached disinterest. She didn't care how in the hell he got his information, she didn't even care where they were going next. She was dead weight now. She even let her gaze drift across the station, toward the places where people sat. It was almost noon, there was lots of activity, families hugging each other, saying goodbye before someone got on a train, ordinary business people running for the Metro rail, the workers standing around enjoying a few moments of chatter, trying to kill the time before they went on break. A man walked through the station. He was older, early fifties at least, thin brown hair, very round about the middle. He was carrying something in one of his hands. He had large, ape-like hands. At first she thought it was a ball of yellow fluff, some kind of toy, maybe a doll, or something he'd bought for his little girl. But there was no girl with him, and he was just walking through. He was saying something, something she couldn't hear over the din. Vincent grabbed a thin brown leather satchel from the locker, pushed it shut, and started to walk. It pulled her closer to the man carrying the yellow fluff, and she realized that it was a dog. She saw four tiny little paws waving through the air, saw the ears flop up. She squinted, wondering what kind of dog could possibly be that small, could fit into a man's hand, even a hand as big as his. They passed very close. A few women had stopped and were petting the animal. They were asking questions. She heard the man say, \"He's for sale!\" and her feet stopped. Vincent tugged her hand. She strained her eyes harder, determined to get a good look at the tiny little puppy, to hear if what she suspected was correct. The man turned around, met her eyes. He held the puppy up for her to see, noticing her interest. \"He needs a good home!\" the man said, in the slick way street-sellers had, playing on sympathies. Someone beside him asked how much the dog was, and he said something that Victoria didn't catch, there was too much other noise, Vincent was saying her name, trying to get her to move without yanking her. The puppy was peering out over the rim of the man's fingers, his little chin resting there. His eyes were two shining balls of coal, and he looked so sad, so helpless, so in need, that she felt herself moving toward him. She knew what that felt like. Being trapped, being dragged around for the world to see, not having any choice in where you went or who you went with. Then, to her utter surprise, Vincent let go of her hand and stepped up beside her. \"How much?\" he asked, as if he didn't believe what he'd heard. \"Twelve hundred,\" the man said, catching Vincent's voice clearly, as it carried well over the crowd without being obtrusive. \"He's a purebred.\" \"Twelve hundred?\" Vincent said, incredulous. The other people were backing away, shaking their heads, either cooing over the puppy in sympathy, or shocked at the high price. \"Dog like that would go for five hundred in a pet store,\" Vincent continued. The man shrugged. \"I seen 'em go for fifteen hundred.\" \"Well, how about this one goes for seven hundred? What do you say?\" The man was slightly offended at the price, but didn't walk away. \"A thousand.\" \"Eight hundred.\" \"Eight fifty,\" the man said. \"Cash.\" Vincent reached into his pocket, pulled out eight hundreds and a fifty, and handed it to the man. The man handed him the puppy. \"If he's got worms,\" Vincent said, his hands just a little smaller, and he needed both of them to hold the miniature dog, \"I'm going to find out where you live.\" \"No worms, man, he's clean. We just can't afford to keep him.\" Victoria wondered how a man could get his hands on such an expensive dog if he couldn't keep him, but her thoughts were abruptly silenced when Vincent turned around and handed the puppy to her. It snuggled into her arm clumsily from all the handling, but she quickly righted it, brought it up to her shoulder, where it's soft nose, icy cold, sniffed her neck. She kissed its little head, her heart warming. \"Come on, let's keep moving,\" Vincent said gently, taking her free hand and continuing their walk out of Union Station. \"We were going to take the Metro, but they don't like it when you bring dogs on, so we'll have to catch a cab again.\" The puppy was very young. Victoria wondered if it was even old enough to be taken away from its mother. But the shock from being shuffled through public seemed to wear off rather quickly, and in the back seat of the cab, he began to squirm around on her lap, sniff her fingers, investigate the folds of her shirt that hung down over her stomach with his nose.[Chapter 10] Standard Disclaimer A/N: What's this? Updating early? WEll, the life that I don't have is suddenly about to get really full, so I'm racing the clock. That doesn't excuse everyone from reviewing EVERY CHAPTER, though. And you know who you are. ;) Hostage \"What are we going to do with...him?\" Victoria asked as Vincent picked up his satchel. She held the puppy in her arms. Vincent looked at it, at her, and then toward the bathroom. \"We could always put it in there. Put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door.\" Victoria frowned. She did not like that idea. \"You want to take him with us?\" Vincent asked. \"No,\" she said quickly. \"Then it's the bathroom. Go on, he'll survive. It won't be that long.\" Victoria went and put Max in the bathtub. Vincent had the hotel room door open and was halfway out into the hallway, waiting for her. She picked up her pace at the impatient flick of his fingers in her direction, stepped out into the hallway. \"We going to get another cab?\" she asked. He gave her a little smirk. \"There's an MTA station just a little ways away. We're going to take it.\" She frowned. \"The metro rail? Why not just get a cab?\" \"I'm a little sentimental about the metro rail,\" he said, putting his arm lightly across her back, his hand on her opposite shoulder. They stepped into an open elevator. \"Why?\" she asked. His smile didn't fade. She could have sworn he was enjoying himself. \"Because it brought me to you.\" The elevator doors slid shut. \"What do you mean?\" Vincent patted the place on his chest where she had pulled out that bullet. \"That's where this happened. The blue line, into Long Beach. It came all the way back to the other end, that's where I got off. I remembered it wasn't too far of a walk to your office from there. If it had been any other line, I wouldn't have reached you in time.\" Victoria stared at him. It had never occurred to her that he'd ever thought of her, during that ordeal he'd told her about. But, her rational voice intoned, it was strictly in a professional way. Although if Vincent truly thought of her in a professional way, her impulsive voice argued, he would never have done...what he'd done. It just didn't make sense. And it certainly couldn't be any good for business. \"Come on, Victoria,\" he said, taking her arm. She blinked and realized that the elevator had stopped and opened into the lobby and he was waiting for her to move. They exited the hotel and it was a short, few-block walk to the MTA station. He bought two round trip tickets from the booth at three dollars each, and they boarded the train. It wasn't the blue line, but the gold one that went back to Union Station. They got on the Red line, which took them up to North Hollywood. From there, Vincent grabbed a cab, and it was a solid fifteen minute drive through some very thick, windy neighborhoods before they came to the thick iron gates of an exclusive neighborhood. \"That's good enough,\" Vincent told the driver. The man pulled up along the curb and they got out. Victoria took in the huge black iron gates, beautiful guilded, decorated with heavy ivy that intertwined with pale purple flowers. \"This way,\" Vincent said as the cab pulled away. He indicated another direction, one she didn't expect. \"Where are we going?\" she whispered. \"I already told you.\" He took her hand again, just like he had before, in Union Station. \"Now let's go.\" How they managed to creep through that neighborhood was beyond her. It was guarded, with security patrolling the streets, up and down, occasionally flicking their heavy flashlights into the foliage. But Vincent seemed to know exactly where he was going. Victoria guessed that all of this had been laid out for him in his work-ups. Other people did all the work, and he just did the killing. Maybe she was being too harsh on him - he was just the last step in a long process. She shoved those thoughts out of her mind. A house came into view. She wished she could see it in its entirety, but it was too dark, and the place was covered by various kinds of bushes and plants - a protection from the street. What she could see, though, was deep gray stone and black trim, and various wings of the house. They approached a back door, with no light. Vincent reached into his pocket, pulled something out. He had to let go of her hand, but instead of freeing her, he linked his arm through hers, freeing up both of his hands. He silently picked the lock, and as the door creeped open, he reached into holster for his gun. He seized her hand as she gave a startled little noise, and glared at her bloody murder. She closed her mouth, let him pull her inside. She shut her eyes when he stopped, listening. She wished she could stop breathing...it occurred to her that he could have left her behind, in the hotel room. He could have tied her up to the toilet with an electrical cord. It would certainly have been easier for him, rather than dragging her behind him like dead weight. But no, she thought as she opened her eyes. There was a reason she was here. She was important somehow, although she had no idea why. So as she felt Vincent's grip slack, just a little, as he leaned into a room which appeared to be a dining room of sorts, and there was a series of noises coming from the ceiling, revealing where the people of the house were, she seized her chance. She yanked her hand away and ran for the nearest set of stairs. Vincent jerked around, watching her go, raised his gun, silencer in place. But he didn't fire. She made it up the stairs and down the hall. She was too loud, she knew she was too loud, but it was too late. A door flew open and there was someone there, a woman with long hair that she had originally thought was golden blonde. It was actually white. \"Well, hello there,\" Claudia said. Claudia ducked her head out into the hallway, then pulled the door shut. \"I take it Vincent is with you?\" she asked, turning on Victoria, who was trapped in the small, miniaturized bedroom, no immediate way out. \"Ye...yes..\" Victoria breathed. Claudia pressed against the door. \"Fuck,\" she muttered. She pulled out a radio in her pocket and then the house around her came alive. Various guards could be heard running through hallways. Claudia shouted various orders, obviously the one in charge. Victoria slowly sat down on the bed. \"So you are working for Marcus Shakespeare,\" she breathed. Claudia looked at her. Her cold eyes twinkled with merriment. \"What, you thought I was one of the bad guys?\" \"Vincent did, yeah.\" \"Well, talk about pots and kettles,\" the other woman snorted. She gave Victoria what was almost a compassionate smile. \"Poor kid, you've probably been through a lot,\" she sighed. \"Mr. Shakespeare is pretty worried about you. I'm sure he'd love to see that you're alive and well. Come with me.\" Victoria didn't get up. Claudia raised a delicately drawn eyebrow-line at her. \"Is there a problem?\" \"Who killed Allen?\" Victoria asked. \"Your ex-husband?\" \"Vincent and I found him shot dead, in our house.\" She swallowed hard, suddenly realizing what Claudia had just said. \"How did you know he was my ex-husband?\" \"You think Mr. Shakespeare doesn't know everything about his employers?\" Claudia returned. \"Even you?\" Victoria stiffened. She'd been around Vincent too long. She was starting to pick up some of his uncanny abilities. She opened her mouth, and heard herself ask, again, more loudly, \"How did you know he was my ex-husband, Claudia?\" Claudia looked at her, then opened the door behind her. \"Let's go see Mr. Shakespeare, Victoria.\" Victoria stood up, waited until she was in the hallway in front of Claudia, and then, in a desperate measure, brought her elbow up and smashed the other woman right in the nose. She heard the woman slump against the wall, cussing and swearing in languages she knew weren't English as she ran away. There were things that Victoria did not see.[Chapter 11] Standard Disclaimer A/N: Ah, well...so this is the end of the first part. I've already started on the first chapter of the next part,but unless I get my butt in gear there won't be much else. And freedom's days are fast approaching completion! So, feedback is vital, let me know your answer to the question I've got posted after the chapter. Until then, enjoy! And if you think it sucks, let me know. I can work on it. Disconnected Marcus Shakespeare really had a magnificent bedroom. It was wide, with a huge, four-poster king-size bed in the middle, a huge walk-in closet on one side and a private bath on the other. On the wall facing outside was a huge set of glass patio doors that led out onto an impressive balcony. For safety reasons, there was usually a guard posted there, but for some reason, there wasn't one there that night. The doors, instead, were heavily barred, which meant that the only way through them was if they were broken, which would make a lot of noise. Not the kind of thing a potential intruder wanted to do. \"Vincent,\" Victoria whispered from beside him. \"Please...please don't.\" \"Why not?\" he asked one final time. \"Because...I don't want you to.\" \"Because,\" Marcus Shakespeare interrupted, \"I can pay you triple whatever they're paying you, just to walk away.\" Vincent raised an eyebrow. \"I've been made that offer a dozen times before, Mr. Shakespeare. It's never worked yet.\" \"Four times. Or you name a price. You name a price and I will pay it.\" Vincent chuckled. \"With those boys ready to bust in here, I'm sure that they will give you the time to get that kind of cash before they blow both me and your doctor here to little bits.\" \"Claudia, give me your radio!\" Marcus barked down at her. She scuffled through her pockets, her expression pure sullenness, and handed him her radio. He spoke into it, \"Jefferson, can you hear me?\" \"Yeah, boss?\" \"Stop. Whatever you're doing in the hallway, stop now.\" There was a pause in the hallway, then the tapering off of all the various noises. Then, it stopped. \"Boss?\" \"Go to the safe downstairs,\" Marcus continued. \"Whatever is in there, bring it up here.\" There was a confused bustle of static, and then, \"Whatever you say.\" Vincent laughed again. \"This is ridiculous. There isn't anything to stop those boys from starting right back up again and-\" \"My word is enough to stop them,\" Marcus snapped. \"Your word doesn't mean puppy shit,\" Vincent said. \"You don't have any reason to live up to your bargain. I don't kill you, I'm dead myself.\" \"You're dead if you do kill me, Mr. Vincent,\" Marcus returned. Vincent looked toward the patio doors. \"You don't know me too well, Mr. Shakespeare.\" \"Marcus,\" came Victoria's voice, \"he does have a point. Why do this? I mean, other than the obvious reason, to save your life...but we don't have any reason to trust you to keep your word.\" Marcus stepped forward just a little, and Vincent steadied his gun. Marcus cast Vincent a quick glance, then looked straight at Victoria. \"Your husband's death,\" he said, \"is my fault, Dr. Potter. For this, and for the many risks you've taken for me these past nights, I owe you a life. If you wish that life to be Vincent's, say the word.\" She opened her mouth in astonishment. \"What are you saying?\" \"He's saying,\" Vincent said, \"he's serious because he feels he owes you. And he's going to pay you back by not killing me, even though he should.\" \"I realize that this situation doesn't please you, Mr. Vincent,\" Shakespeare said. \"After all, you do have a reputation to uphold. But you don't need to worry. I am tired of this life. I am going to disappear, I promise you all that.\" He glared at Claudia. \"My past associates have disappointed me, and I have no real reason to take these risks any longer.\" There was a rap at the door. The radio in his hand crackled. \"Sir? We have the money.\" \"Good.\" Marcus gestured to the door. \"Who do you wish to get it?\" Vincent hesitated. He looked to Claudia. \"Let her go,\" he said. \"Make her use her broken arm.\" Claudia looked to Marcus, who nodded. She pulled herself upright, and as if the arm were not broken at all, she went to the door, cracked it open, and accepted the large package of money handed to her. It was a brick of bills, two feet by two feet, wrapped in shrinkwrap. \"For emergencies,\" Marcus said. \"Like this one,\" Vincent said, looking at the money. He rubbed his chin. \"I don't like this.\" He pointed at Claudia, who still stood by the door, holding the money. \"Set it down and open it up. I want to see it.\" Claudia obeyed...and pulled out from the midst of the smaller bricks of cash a hold-out pistol that she brought up and aimed right at Vincent. Vincent reacted so quickly, Victoria wasn't even fully aware that he had crashed down on top of her until she heard the terrible sound of someone's throat rupturing. She looked up from underneath and saw that Marcus had been thrown back on the bed, and there was a small fountain of blood squirting up. The jugular, the doctor inside her said. The artery was like an oil pump without a basin. She heard a terrible crashing noise, swore there was furniture flying in the room. The felt the hot spray on one cheek as Vincent pulled her up by her waist, her feet hardly touching the ground as he dragged her toward the patio doors, which had been blasted open by bullets from Vincent's gun. Then, she was outside, on her feet, Vincent was firing wildly behind them, then grabbed her hand and they were running. What had happened was this: Claudia shot at Vincent, who was just fast enough to throw Victoria down under him and duck the bullet. Unfortunately, Marcus was right behind him, and the movement sent the bullet right into his throat. He fell back, dead within seconds from blood loss. Claudia aimed again but Vincent was too fast. He opened fire, caught Claudia in the shoulder, and she reached behind her, throwing down the chest of drawers Vincent had pulled against the door. The chest nearly fell onto them, but Vincent caught it as Claudia pulled the door open, allowing other men through, although there were too many trying to come in too fast in a small space. Vincent didn't even blink - he used gravity to shift the weight of the chest so that it flew through the patio doors, then grabbed Victoria and half-carried her outside with him. Knowing he couldn't carry her the whole way, he set her down just long enough to turn and open fire, taking out a few of the guards in the process. Then he grabbed her and headed for the nearest ledge. Below was the roof of one of the garages. He picked Victoria up, one arm around her back, the other around her knees, and jumped. The roof of the garage was sturdy enough, but the crack as they landed was unmistakable. He kicked down, finding the soft lining through the heavy supportive beams, and made a hole. He grabbed Victoria by her wrists and lowered her through, hearing the soft thud of her landing. He looked down. She had landed in the back seat of a convertible. He followed, aiming for the driver's seat. Victoria picked herself up, dazed, her backside screaming bloody murder but otherwise unhurt. Vincent had landed on his feet in the driver's seat, but was climbing over the door, onto the concrete floor. He went to a rack on the far wall, his fingers gliding over several sets of keys. He glanced over his shoulder quickly at the car, then pulled the keys of the rack that held the large letters \"BMW.\" He came back, and she scrambled into the front seat as he climbed in and started the engine. \"What about the door?\" she asked. \"Duck,\" he said, reaching for her and pulling her head down, almost into his lap. He hunched his shoulders forward as they plowed through the wood and plastic, scaring the hell out of a few other guards who had started to close in on the garage in the chaos. Before she knew it, they were in the street, tearing down the winds at an incredible speed. \"They're going to follow!\" Victoria said, raising her head up and watching behind her. The wind from their velocity whipped up her hair, sending it flying into her face, and she struggled to push it back, unsuccessful until she turned around again. \"Maybe,\" he said, taking a sharp turn. There was an exit straight ahead, a guard posted there. Vincent tore through it, not bothering to even slow down. Out onto the open street, he made a series of twists and turns until finally they hit a freeway exit. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Don't own anything to do with the movie Collateral.

I hope you enjoy the ride. :) 1-Like Any Other Night Callie walked into the garage, past where the other taxis were being tuned up, washed, routine maintenance. She gave a half-hearted wave to Lenny, who stood up on his platform, Jabba the Hutt with legs, a wire hanging from his ear across the wide girth of his belly and to his waist. Through the open door was their room, sparse but comfortable, wide benches, coke machine...she'd always watched the television show Taxi when it was on Nick at Night , and had been amazed, her first day on the job, at how accurate that show had been. Except for Danny DeVito in the cage. She had hoped for that, as he had probably been her favorite character on the series. Everyone else loved Christopher Plummer, or the guy whose name she could never remember, the one whose life they made a movie of, starring Jim Carrey-Andy Kauffman? But no matter. She was glad to be distinguished from the rest. She always had a soft spot for the \"bad guy.\" \"Hey Cal,\" came a soft, half-distracted call from the end of the bench. She looked over and saw Max bent over his evening crossword, waiting for his day-shift guy to come in with his cab. Dark skinned and soft spoken, Max usually kept to himself. She was one of the few he bothered to speak to. \"Hey Max,\" she said, sitting down across from him. The noise and hum from the garage outside would have deafened others. They were used to it. \"How's it going? How's your mom?\" \"The same,\" Max said, tossing her a smile. His gold-rimmed glasses seemed mildly out of place on his face, and she always got the feeling from him that he should be somewhere else. Not driving a cab. \"So how about you, how's school?\" \"The same,\" she answered. She fished in her pocket for some change, having a craving for the sludge they had the nerve to call coffee from the machine that only worked if you were lucky. She winked at him when he gave her a mildly reproachful look. \"Not really, but hey. Sometimes I can't keep track of what day it is.\" \"Someday you are going to have to share with me your secret,\" Max said, filling in a few letters on the puzzle. \"What's a six letter word for hate, begins with an L?\" \"Loathe,\" she replied. \"My secret? What secret?\" \"How you do everything you do and still drive a night shift. What are you, twenty-three? You should be out dating, not driving the zombies of L.A. around all night.\" She chuckled. \"That's the difference between us, Max. I love my job.\" He seemed genuine puzzled. \"I still don't get that.\" \"You don't like your job, you should quit.\" \"That isn't it, I mean, I don't mind it. But you...what are you, double major? Criminology and Psychology?\" \"With double minors in English and Creative Writing,\" she supplied. \"I'm going to write a book someday.\" \"How many hours do you go to school?\" \"Mostly my classes are between eight and noon, all week. Then I catch about a four hour nap, get up, eat dinner, head over here.\" \"Four hours? That's all the sleep you get?\" \"Insomnia runs in the family,\" she said. \"We've never needed a lot of sleep.\" \"They say that the higher the life form, the less sleep you need,\" Max said. \"Could explain why you're so smart.\" \"The smartest cab driver in L.A.,\" she joked, finally finding enough quarters. As she stood up, Max looked toward the entrance, where his cab was coming in. Clean as a whistle. Sometimes, Callie felt sorry for Max. He didn't have enough to do, so he kept his cab immaculate. She noticed hers, coming in a few cabs back. Relative clean, but she could already smell the tobacco and feel the nicotine residue on her fingers from the steering wheel. Neil had to stop smoking, it was going to be the death of him. Max stood up. \"See you tomorrow, Callie,\" he said, scooping up his crossword. Callie gave him a wave over the shoulder as she went to get her coffee. 8888888888 People didn't appreciate the city. There was a kind of spectacular beauty to L.A. at night, on the surface, that no one stopped to notice. Especially from the freeway, coming in from the airport on the 110, heading North, toward Pasadena. Her fare was a couple who had just come in from the airport, right from Indiana. They were visiting their daughter, who lived in Pasadena, and normally the woman would have picked them up, but tonight, as the couple told her, she was involved with stuff at her church, and Mom and Dad hadn't had the heart to tear her away from it, even to pick them up. They were fine with a cab. Even though, by the time they reached their destination, it had gone a few dollars north of a hundred. And a twenty-dollar tip. She was appreciative, took their heavy bags out of the car for them, even though the gentleman almost insisted he do it, taking in her youth and assuming both suitcases would just be too much for her. She didn't even chip a nail. Not that there was much to chip, she kept them trimmed low. She headed for the hotels toward the downtown, having dropped the couple at a residence. Pasadena wasn't the best place for fares. People who needed taxis here usually called them. She swung by a Marriott by the Freeway entrance and caught a fare going to downtown L.A., and earned another healthy fare. Then she wound up making her rounds, and ended up at the Justice Building, pulling up in a rather long line that was moving through pretty fast. She was pulled up behind Max. She recognized him because he was turned, talking to the woman in his back seat, and apparently quite engrossed in the conversation. When the woman got out, Callie could easily see why. She was beautiful, with long, straight black hair, and a sharp figure. Obviously a lawyer, from the briefcase and the way she carried herself. Then, to Callie's surprise, the woman stopped half-way to the door, took something out of her purse, and went back to the cab. Callie saw it happen. The woman gave him her card. She could see Max shaking his head in her headlights. She couldn't help but smile. Poor Max. She'd gotten to know him, a little bit, from the brief times they'd sat together, drinking coffee, doing a crossword (him doing it, her helping him whenever he got stuck) and found him to be a really nice guy. He wasn't like eighty-percent of the cab drivers around here, who were sloppy in their style and in their manners. He had class, and brains. Probably one of the reasons they had always gotten along so well. But he wasn't happy. He'd talked, once upon a time, about starting up his own company, but hadn't gone into too much detail. And then his mother was sick; from their brief conversations on that topic, his mother was not pleasant even when she was well. Callie adjusted her rearview. Slow spot, soon there would be fares, they'd get moving again. She sometimes wondered if she should move to Vegas, or maybe even Chicago. Cab driving there was a fine art, and having personality was only a plus. Nobody ever wanted to talk out here, only the tourists. Never the locals. Nobody ever knew each other out here, and nobody cared. But no, she still loved this place. It was her home. Her mother was buried here, her father was retired here, and her brother lived and worked here as a detective in the L.A.P.D. narcotics division. Leaving would be like cutting out her heart and leaving it on a street corner. It simply was too hard a thing to imagine. A man came out of the building. He was sliding sunglasses off his face, and approaching Max's cab. He leaned down, into the passenger window, but then looked away, pulled back, and started walking toward her. Max was distracted. Apparently that woman had really taken it out of him. Callie smiled again, this time to herself, and waited for Max to call the man back. He didn't. The man reached her window, leaned in on one arm. \"Hey,\" he said, his smile subtle at first, then widening when he got a look at her. What a smile. Coupled with a silvery-gray suit and a lower-face-full of facial hair that looked like salt and pepper, he was a striking figure. His hair was also gray, but his face had rather young features, the kind of smooth, chiseled look of someone who was handsome and knew it, yet wasn't arrogant about it. Yet it was his dark green eyes that pinned her in place, not bothering to tell him that Max was probably the better bet, since he was first in line. No, she would take this fare, and apologize to Max later. Considering he'd just gotten a very foxy lady's number, he would understand. \"Hi,\" she replied, keeping it low key. \"Where you headed?\" \"452 South Union,\" he said. \"Come on, I'll take you. Max is a little out of it right now.\" He gave her a tighter smile, nodded, got into the back. She pulled out behind Max, drove off, not worrying about how annoyed he might be at her. 8888888888 \"So how long do you think this will take?\" he asked her. He had a nice voice, low-key, calm, slightly gravelly. He was messing with something in the black briefcase he carried, looked like it might have been some kind of oversized palm-pilot. One of the few \"typical-girl\" traits she still carried was her lack of knowledge about cutting edge technology. \"Less than ten, more than five,\" she answered, weaving in and out of some late night traffic, people half-asleep at the wheel. She briefly looked down at the clock. It was about twenty after nine. He seemed to be satisfied with this answer. Went back to his work. Glanced up at her again, taking in her appearance. He'd gotten a better look from the front window before, but now he could admire her at a bit more leisure. She was reasonably attractive, he thought, most definitely so for a cab driver. Young, too. Somewhere in her mid-twenties. Her long hair was pulled back into a French braid, which was partly tucked underneath a hat with a wide, blooming crown and a visor like a baseball cap, only made out of blue suede. From his frontal view, he'd seen that she had a suede coat, too, made out of fitted yellow-brown leather and low riding jeans, revealing an inch and a half of belly covered in some kind of dark green shirt. She wasn't unnaturally thin, like the supermodels on the billboards above him, or even the girl in the Bacardi Silver advertisement that crowned almost all the yellow cabs in this town. She had a nice, modest roll of belly that puckered out just a little over her hips, natural, soft, where the shirt disappeared into the waistband of her jeans. He caught the flash of a sweater underneath her coat, and a shirt underneath that - it was a California thing, particular Southern California, dressing in layers like that. Now, watching her from the back, he could see that her hair was a natural, almost mousy brown, but it had been streaked with lighter, honey-colored brown, giving her an exotic touch. The most admirable part about her, though, was the complete lack of jewelry or make-up. Fashionable girls who dressed like her also put on three layers of lipstick, eye-shadow, mascara as thick and black as Egyptian kohl, and big gold hoop earrings. He rather preferred her natural look. The silence settled over them, and was broken by the deep hum of a cellular phone. She reached toward her waist to pull it out, turning it on by flipping it open. \"Hey Ray,\" she said. There was the tinny sound of someone talking on the other line. He didn't get how people could stand cellular phones. He found them obnoxious and ugly. Not to mention, he didn't really like talking on the phone. He had his own text-message phone, tucked into his pocket, and did all his communicating that way. Numbers on both sides, it was fancy enough for him. \"No, on a fare,\" she was saying. A pause as she listened. \"I go every night, Ray, it's okay if I miss one night.\" Pause. \"I'm sorry, I know you've got work, too, but Dad will be fine for one night. Look, I've gotta go right now, I'm working, I'll call you back on my break if you're free. Bye.\" And she hung up the phone. \"Husband?\" Vincent asked. She laughed, a bit loudly. \"No, my brother.\" \"Ah. I figured the 'Dad' meant one or the other.\" \"Yeah, definitely the other. I'm not married.\" She said it with a throwaway casualness that Vincent saw through. He smiled. Generally, women seemed to find him attractive, and it was something he had never really argued with. \"You and your brother close?\" he asked. \"Pretty much, yeah. We help take care of our dad.\" \"You can't be that old. How old is your dad?\" \"I'm twenty-five,\" she said. \"He's sixty-five. I was their last-minute miracle.\" She tossed him a friendly smile into the rearview, but stayed focused on the driving. He gazed back at her, listening. \"So your brother can't make it over tonight and is putting it all on you, then?\" She shrugged. \"He's not that bad. I usually go over anyway, during my break. Even if I can't, he's over there, but he's busy tonight.\" \"What does your brother do?\" \"He's a cop,\" she said, with just a touch of embarrassment. Vincent almost flinched, stopped himself. No way he was going to even risk a cop coming anywhere near him. \"What about your mother?\" \"She died about ten years ago. Cancer.\" Vincent considered this. \"You were young,\" he said, his tone sympathetic. \"Fifteen.\" \"Yeah. It was a rough time.\" Casual again, almost evasive. To her it was a simple fact, an afterthought. \"Well, you're lucky you knew her,\" Vincent said. \"I never knew my mother. She died when I was too young to remember her.\" She looked at him in the rearview again. She had real sympathy in her eyes, not his synthetic substitute. \"I'm sorry.\" He smiled a half-smile, nose back against his work-ups. \"Don't worry about it. It was a very long time ago.\" \"I know what you mean.\" She turned, swerved to miss someone who attempted to run a red light, righted them as if nothing had happened, and turned back to him in the mirror. \"So what about you? You're awfully young to be driving a cab,\" he said, his voice still that low-key drawl, but interested, not just making casual conversation. \"I'm in school. College, at USC. Double major, it's taking a while to get everything done, and I can't go full time and work, so...\" she trailed off, distracted by a few drivers in the lane to her left that seemed to nearly have a rear-end collision. \"What are your majors?\" \"Criminology and Psychology,\" she said, making a turn through a yellow light as it went to red. Orange, they called it. \"Interesting.\" His voice perked up a bit, and she noticed the change in her rearview. He had stopped looking altogether at his computer, the plastic pointer lodged between his fingers like a pen. His eyes pinned her again with that same intensity as before. She felt a slight shiver of discomfort that wasn't all that uncomfortable. \"So what are you planning to do with that?\" \"Criminal psychology,\" she said. \"There are lots of different fields. I'll have to get my masters, probably enroll in another school...maybe have to leave L.A., depends on what happens. Maybe I'm just delaying the moment.\" \"Maybe you are. So you're interested in criminals? Catching them or understanding them?\" \"More like understanding them,\" she said, and her tone suddenly switched to dismissive, as she felt the terrible urge to change the subject. \"But I really don't want to leave L.A. Is this your first time here?\" \"No,\" he said, shaking his head, lips curling in mild disgust. \"But I don't like having to come here. Every time I do, I can't wait to leave.\" \"Hmm.\" She seemed a little taken aback by this comment. \"You seem to like it, though,\" he said. \"I love the city,\" she said softly. \"Especially at night.\" \"That why you drive your shift at night?\" \"Yeah. Even if it's just appearance, the city is beautiful then.\" He nodded, then half-shrugged. \"I don't know....this place is so disconnected. The fifth biggest economy in the world and nobody knows each other? I heard this story about a guy who gets on the MTA, has a heart attack, dies.\" Another twitch of his lip, a shake of his head. \"Six hours before anybody realizes it, and his corpse has been doing laps around the city, people on and off, sitting next to him...nobody notices.\" He gazed out the window, sighing. She glanced up at him again. She had hazel-colored eyes, which seemed to shift from blue to green to brown in the light. At the moment, they were a soft, toffee brown. \"Well,\" she said, \"some of us try hard to notice.\" He gave her a half-smile, went back to his work. 8888888888 They pulled up a few minutes later. \"452 South Union,\" she announced as she put on the break. Vincent glanced around. It was a relatively deserted area, not in the sense of people, but there wasn't a lot of public transportation around. He couldn't stick around here, not after he did his work. And she was still a cab. He could just ask her to wait, let her keep the meter running, tip her extra. He put his equipment back into his briefcase and leaned forward to ask her, but as he caught her eyes, something in him hesitated. She was pleasant company, after all. And if things went well, nobody would ever be the wiser. \"Look,\" he said, \"I'm in town for one night, closing a real-estate deal. I've got five stops to make.\" Her eyes were hesitant. She already seemed to know where this was going. \"Why don't you hang with me? For a bit, anyway.\" She shrugged uncomfortably. \"It's against regulations,\" she admitted. \"We can't hire out cabs.\" He laughed. \"I should have expected that from a criminology major,\" he teased lightly. \"How much do you make in a night?\" \"Three, maybe four, if I hustle,\" she replied, unsure. He leaned back a bit, flipping, like a deck of cards, six brand new hundred dollar bills. Her eyes widened a little and her smile faded when she saw them. \"I'll pay you six hundred. One hundred per stop, the last one being L.A.X., and an extra hundred if I don't have to run for the plane.\" She squirmed. \"Look, I can wait for you out here, but I'll have to keep the meter running. After that, well...\" He smiled at her, turning on the charm. He pulled himself closer, slipping three hundreds back into his pocket, and palming the other three. \"What, you going to pass up twice your nightly fee for a little qualm of conscience? Nobody ever has to know.\" She sighed, deeply. \"I don't want to get in trouble.\" \"You won't.\" He paused. \"Besides, a girl like you is too good to be driving cabs around, anyway. Fuck 'em if you do get in trouble, you probably don't even need your job, you could get another in a heartbeat. Pretty girl like you.\" He winked at her, just for good measure. At first, she responded with a very \"yeah, right\" sort of look, but then she was chewing the inside of her cheek. She let out a deep sigh. \"I guess...yeah.\" \"Great.\" He pressed the three hundred into her hand, his fingers closing around hers, noticing that her hands were warm, unlike the cold fingers of a dozen other women he'd known in his lifetime. \"Here's three now, and three when we get to the airport, plus the bonus.\" He glanced at her license. \"Callie?\" \"Yeah.\" \"That's an unusual name.\" \"Short for Calliope,\" she admitted, the hundreds in her palm, crunching with their new folds. \"Is that Greek? You don't look Greek.\" \"My great, great-grandmother was, on my mother's side.\" She looked back up at him, struggling to be polite, not wanting to examine his money right in front of his face. \"Mom was really, really fond of her.\" He smiled, reached out, squeezed her shoulder. \"Well, I'm Vincent. And thanks, Callie. Trust me, it will be worth it.\" And he climbed out of the cab. \"Hey,\" she called as he closed the door. \"I can't stay double parked here. I'll have to meet you in the alley behind the building.\" He nodded. \"Fine.\" And he headed into the building. Callie watched him go. She glanced into the backseat, having noticed he didn't have anything with him as he went. His briefcase was sitting there, expensive black leather. \"Some people,\" she muttered, but she was smiling. It was almost refreshing, to see that kind of naïveté in someone who came across as so hardened. She drove around back, pulled into the alley, and waited.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: Not mine, although you'd think I was trying to take it over by all the fanfic I keep compulsively writing. 2--And You Throw A Hissyfit Calliope Fanning, known as Callie to everyone who knew her, waited, sitting back in her seat, pulling the brim of her cap down over her eyes. She had been warned, on occasion, not to do this, but her windows were up and her doors were locked, and she wasn't particularly worried. People who had never been mugged generally didn't worry, not until it was too late. She considered munching on the snacks she'd brought with her, but the most appealing thing at the moment was her Snickers bar, and she didn't want to get herself hyped up on sugar at the moment. It would just pique her irritation at Ray. Ray. Detective had gone to his head. It had been bad enough when he'd been a street cop, coming home all the time in his uniform, badge shining. He was seriously trying to make his way through the ranks, and succeeded. Now, he dressed like an undercover cop, hair slicked back, long brown trench coat. She constantly berated him for it, but he insisted that if he was going to work the narcotics division, he had to blend in with the street life. That was Ray. Total chameleon. Could be whatever you wanted in a blink of an eye. He'd had a girlfriend, briefly, but it hadn't worked out, and now he didn't seem to have anything else to do with his time except bug her about finishing school and getting a real job, and if she was going to visit Dad during her break. Of course, she knew that right now, he was on a big case, and that always made him tense. More obnoxious and difficult to bear than usual. But still, she loved him. In spite of the fact that he was an asshole. There was a rap at the back window. She ducked her head, saw Vincent standing there. It had only been a little over five minutes. She clicked the unlock button and he opened the door, sliding in. \"Any problems?\" he asked. \"Not a one. How about you?\" \"Other than a close encounter with a window,\" he said with a bit of a smirk, \"no, no problems at all.\" \"So where to now?\" she asked. \"7567 Fountain,\" he said. \"West Hollywood,\" she said, her fingers tapping at the computer's screen buttons. He asked, \"How long do you think that will take?\" He was very conscious of the time. He reminded her a little bit of Ray because of that. \"About twenty minutes, give or take,\" she said. \"Sounds good. Let's go.\" So she put the car in drive and went. 8888888888 This drive was longer than the last, and Vincent turned chatty. Not that he hadn't been before, but now he was getting personal, asking questions that she nearly felt comfortable asking. Did she have a boyfriend? Why was she so interested in criminal psychology? What exactly did she plan to do when she finished school? Did she have any particular graduate schools in mind? Had she traveled much? What kind of music did she listen to? Discomfort or not, she found herself answering them all. It was a very easy flow of conversation, and he'd even leaned forward, one arm partly looped over the front of the seat so he could hear her better without her having to turn her head and take her eyes off the road. \"No boyfriend?\" he asked. \"I find that hard to believe.\" She chuckled. \"No, no boyfriend, but I warn you, I'm quite used to my customers attempting to flirt with me, and I assure you, I'm quite immune.\" He smiled, laughed. A big, toothy grin. She noticed that the center of his front teeth was actually a little to the left. He was well manicured, the way his one hand grasped the back of the seat. She liked men who took good care of their hands. So many were so grimy and sloppy, jagged nails. Truth be told, it had been one of the things about her current pursuer that kept her interested. \"So if you're so used to your customers flirting with you, then you must be aware of how charming you are.\" She gave him quite a look. \"Laying it on thick, aren't you?\" \"I'm sorry,\" he said, his expression only mildly contrite, but still smiling. \"I don't get to meet a lot of pretty girls in my line of work. Well, I do, in real estate. Just most of them are married. Single girls don't generally buy houses.\" \"No, they don't,\" she said. \"That's usually something reserved for couples.\" \"We single people live in apartments. Or condos, depending on how much money you have.\" She laughed. \"Well, none here, I'm afraid. Although my dad keeps talking about leaving the house to me when he dies. I always make him change the subject, it's too morbid.\" \"Well, it's only natural to think about those things,\" Vincent said, relaxing a bit, sounding less flirtatious and more serious. \"I mean, his wife has passed on, I'm sure you and your brother are all he has to think about now.\" Then he sobered, glancing out the window, very serious. \"Funny thing about marriage...sometimes, after the first one goes, the second one just wants to follow.\" \"Yeah, we went through that,\" she said softly. She shook her head, tossed him a smile. \"So I take it you have a condo,\" she remarked. \"Definitely. Are you an apartment girl, or do you live in a dormitory?\" \"I live in school housing, it's not really like a dormitory, but it's much cheaper than renting an apartment. Especially around the campus, you wouldn't believe how expensive things are out here.\" \"Oh, I would,\" he said. \"Never ceases to amaze me how poor people can afford to live where they do, in the conditions that they do, and yet put up with the prices they have to pay for it.\" \"Sometimes we don't have any choice,\" she said. \"No. Same thing goes for crime, really,\" he went on, letting go of the seat and leaning back, talking loud enough for her to hear, but now on a personal roll. \"I mean, think about it - the kids that grow up there, what do they see? So they want out, naturally. But when they go to school, they can't get good grades because they can't get help with their homework, they can't afford tutoring, and they can't get enough sleep at night and eat regular enough meals to be ready to learn the next day. Plus, the only examples of adulthood they have are just bigger versions of themselves.\" \"There are ways around it,\" she said, feeling mildly defensive. \"School systems offer free tutoring, breakfast, lunch, clothing if they need it. The schools do everything but give the kids showers and places to sleep.\" \"Maybe it would be better if they did,\" Vincent commented, looking out the window. \"What can you expect from a kid who grows up without a mother and a drunk for a father?\" She grew thoughtful. \"I guess some of us are just really lucky, then,\" she said, more to herself. \"Yeah, you are,\" he said, turning back to her. She looked into the rearview. He was smiling at her, gently. There was a deep sadness in his eyes, and it touched her. \"You look like you made it out,\" she said, trying to be of some comfort. \"I mean, whatever your background. You seem to be doing pretty well.\" He made a soft grunt in the back of his throat and looked down. \"I'm doing what I can,\" he agreed. \"What I do best.\" \"I guess...\" she trailed off, wanting to say something about how being deprived left wounds that sudden influxes of material goods couldn't make right again. She'd known too many kids in school who were so messed up, getting older and wealthier didn't serve any other purpose than to make them even colder on the inside, more out for themselves, rather than trying to help others have the good life they now enjoyed. \"You guess?\" he prompted. \"Well, society can't fix everything,\" she said. \"No.\" His eyes turned sharp. \"It most certainly can't. In some ways, it makes things much worse.\" She had to shrug. \"Sometimes. But it's better than anarchy.\" \"Really?\" \"Sure. I mean, everyone out for themselves? Think of it. The violence that would come out of it, everyone being a law unto themselves? Judge, jury, executioners. We have enough murders every day in L.A. without going that far.\" \"Survival of the fittest. It's the way of Nature,\" he said. \"Maybe,\" she agreed. \"But still, I like to think of human beings as being more than slaves to their natural instincts.\" \"The lucky ones are,\" he said. \"So that's why you want to be a criminal psychologist? Want to try and convert criminals into being better people?\" \"Is that such a bad thought?\" she asked. \"No, not bad. But probably...\" Now he trailed off, hesitating. \"No, not bad at all,\" he finished. Just then she turned the corner and their building loomed into view. 8888888888 Another alley. This one was much more deserted, and she shut the car off after she had parked. It made her a little uncomfortable, thinking of sitting here, alone, in the dark. It wasn't as well lit as the other alley before, even if it was in a better neighborhood. She glanced at the clock. It was almost ten now. It wasn't that late. Real trouble wouldn't start until the graveyard hours. She calmed herself, waited patiently as Vincent shuffled in his briefcase, pulled out something rather official-looking, and got out of the car without so much as a word. She locked the doors behind him, watched him go inside. Earlier, she had looked at the hundreds he'd given her. They were real, brand new mint, complete with the little sparkles in the corners and the double head on the far right side of the bill, impossible to counterfeit. Obviously this guy had some serious change to throw around. Which made her criminology-tuned mine suspicious. She'd seen her fair share of mob personalities and he just didn't strike her as that type. But the briefcase, the suit, the sunglasses he would slip on his face as he stepped into the light outside... She shook herself. She was being slightly paranoid. Sure, she lived in L.A., but he'd been polite enough to her, and hadn't done anything so far that could back up her suspicions, so she decided to let it go. She let it go so much that she leaned back in her chair, adjusted her shoulders, and let herself rest for a moment. It was okay, the doors were locked. There was a tapping at her window. She looked up, saw the face of a man, not much older than her, with a natty beard and long, greasy hair. He looked like a Kid Rock wannabe. He pushed a lock of the stringy hair behind his ear and grinned at her, wiggling his fingers, motioning for her to roll down the window. She was an L.A. cabdriver. She gave him the finger and shook her head. His smile, which hadn't been pleasant to begin with, disappeared and darkened into an angry scowl. He reached back into his pocket and slammed something large and metal onto the glass, making it crack. He struck again. It shattered, sending glass over her shoulder, onto her lap, and all across the pavement. Then the barrel of his gun was staring her in the face. \"Fucking bitch,\" he was saying, \"you wanna give me attitude? I'll make you fucking blow me!\" Her hands had flown up instinctively to shield her face, and she slowly lowered them, wondering how she could have been so stupid. He'd caught her completely off guard, although what the hell she'd been expected to do, she had no idea. \"What do you want?\" she managed, her voice maintaining some semblance of strength, even as the gun loomed close to her temple. Stupid idiot, he carried it to the side, like out of a movie, trying to look cool. You never held a gun like that in real life. \"Gimmie your fuckin' purse, bitch,\" he said. She reached down to comply, trying not to show that she was actually relieved. She never carried her credit cards in it. Her purse was just pure decoration, holding tampons, Kleenex, lip balm, and her reading glasses. Her driver's license was wedged up in the visor above her head, ready to hand over if an officer should request it, and the money Vincent had given her, she'd shoved into her back pocket. \"Your fuckin' fares, too, bitch, hand 'em over!\" She went to the glove compartment, to the bag where she kept them. She handed it over to him, and he found the lock. \"Where's the fuckin' key, bitch?\" She almost sighed. He couldn't come up with anything more original than bitch ? She'd gotten worse on the playground when she was seven. She reached for the keys, pulled off the small one that unlocked the bag, handed it to him. \"What else you got for me?\" he grunted, going to the back seat. She flipped the unlock switch so he wouldn't have to shatter that window, too, He opened the door, and said something very stupid, like, \"Ooh, jackpot!\" taking the briefcase with him. She felt her stomach sink. No doubt, Vincent was going to be very pissed. And speak of the devil. The Kid Rock wannabe had just slammed the door shut and stepped to the side of the cab. He wagged his gun at her one last time, said something moronic, pretending to fire at her, and tromped off, another guy joining up with him a few feet up the alley. Callie looked up, saw Vincent step out into the alley, through the door. The clipboard he'd been carrying was gone, and he was empty handed. This would have struck her as strange if she hadn't been suffering from a mild adrenaline high. Vincent glanced back at her, then stepped toward the twosome. \"Hey, homie,\" he called. \"Is that my briefcase?\" The skinny guy turned, then flounced back to him, run raised and pointed at his face. \"Yeah, it is! You got anything else for me? How about your wallet?\" Vincent slowly raised his hands into the air. It happened so quickly after that, it was just a silver-gray blur to her eyes. Somehow he managed to slap down the younger kid's gun, pull out one from somewhere at his waist, and shoot the kid twice in the chest. Then, he spun on the other, shot twice in the chest and once in the head. As the kids lay there, the one who had mugged her still alive, Vincent reached down, picked up her purse, his suitcase, and then casually, like an afterthought, without even looking at the guy, shot him right in the forehead. He was definitely dead after that. Vincent walked back toward the cab. At this point, Callie wasn't sure what to do. Part of her knew that to get out of the cab and run was a stupid idea, he would just shoot her in the back. The other part knew it was equally stupid to sit there and make herself an easy target. She shrunk back into the seat with each of his approaching steps, though, as if by some miracle she could just suddenly disappear, become invisible, melt into the seats and never be heard from again. She actually thought, for a moment, that she was going to faint. He walked up to the passenger side. She had hit the unlock button before, and she couldn't remember, suddenly, where the lock was to keep him out. He opened it up, threw his briefcase in the back seat, and slid into the passenger seat beside her. He gently set her purse down beside her on the seat. \"You okay?\" he asked, his eyebrows raised, his expression filled with concern. She didn't have enough wits about her to determine whether it was genuine or just a facsimile. She just stared back at him. Her jaw had gone slightly slack, hanging open a little, and she was taking in small breaths of air through her mouth. Her chest felt tight, and it was a laborious process. Vincent looked past her, toward the window. \"He break the window?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" she breathed. His eyes focused on her. He seemed unsure of what to make of her, unsure of her reaction, waiting for her to say something, anything, and give him a clue. \"You...shot them,\" she said, swallowing to moisten her throat. \"They mugged you,\" he said. \"And me. They would have shot me if I hadn't shot them.\" She looked down, toward his lap, as if the gun would be sitting there, in plain sight. Her eyes traveled to his waist, to where his gray coat hung open, and she thought she saw a slight bulge over one hip. \"You're carrying a gun,\" she said, her voice coming just a little bit easier as shock wore off and panic started to set in. \"You're in L.A., and you're carrying a gun.\" He nodded. \"Yes. I am.\" \"You don't carry a gun here in L.A. unless you're a cop or a criminal,\" she said. \"What the hell are you doing carrying a gun if you're a real-estate agent?\" \"I never said I was a real-estate agent,\" he replied, calm. \"You said you were closing a real-estate deal-\" \"That's what I said.\" \"And you need a gun to do that?\" \"It can be a tough business.\" His look had softened, as if he'd figured her out, and knew exactly how to handle her. She realized that in the process, she had seized hold of the steering wheel and her knuckles were turning white. She forced herself to let go, but it was a mistake. Her hands had been taking the damage her stomach had been trying to ignore. It heaved inside her, although there wasn't anything to heave, as she hadn't eaten in at least six hours. \"I'm going to throw up,\" she said, turning to the door and fumbling with the latch. Gently, he reached over and took her hand, enclosing it in his. He pulled her back, his arm warm across her chest, his fingers against her skin, not letting her get out but not forcing her, either. \"The window is open. You've got air. Just breathe, it will pass. You're stressed, it's natural, after what just happened.\" She took big gulps of air. He reached into the back seat, produced a large bottle of water. \"Here, it's cold, drink some of this.\" He opened it. She took it and took a tentative swallow, thinking only afterwards that there might be something in it. She looked at him suspiciously. \"You killed them,\" she said again. \"I did. They would have killed me.\" She shook her head. \"They were stupid punks. That gun was just for show.\" \"Then why did you let them have your purse?\" Vincent asked. \"It was easier. There isn't anything in it anyway. I put your money in my back pocket.\" She considered, her brain calming just a little bit. \"They took my fares, though. You didn't happen to see them, did you?\" He glanced out the windshield toward the bodies. \"No. But I don't want to leave you until I'm sure you're all right.\" She looked at him, feeling a giddy sense of sarcasm. He didn't want to leave her because she might bug out of there, like a smart girl. \"You just killed two men in cold blood and you're worried about me being all right?\" He gave a small sigh. \"Cold blood implies I didn't have a reason. I did have a reason. They tried to steal from us.\" Us. Together. Solidarity. He was wooing her to his side, trying to get her to sympathize with him. She took more deep breaths, her chest rising and falling. Then he scowled at her, his impatience starting to show. He looked away, out the window, and said, annoyed, \"They put a gun in your face, robbed you and me-I shot them out of pure self-defense, and you throw a hissyfit .\" \"I'm going to call my brother,\" she said, reaching into her pocket for her phone. His hand landed on hers again, this time with a much more aggressive grip. \"Don't do that.\" \"He's a cop. He'll know what to do.\" \"Even so. Don't call him.\" \"But I have to. This is a crime scene. Sure, you can argue self-defense, but we have to call the police-\" His grip became so tight she felt her bones push together. It was nearly painful. \"I said. No cops .\" Low, dangerous. He glared at her sidelong, his dark eyes catching the faint streetlight from outside and glowing their smoky emerald green. \"My brother-\" \"You're going to have to forget about running to your brother this time, Callie. You gotta deal with that. Sorry,\" Although he didn't sound like he really meant it. He'd taken a very frank tone, now, no bullshit from him. Although he still seemed to want to play it nice. He could, after all, have easily shot her by now, too. She took a last, deep breath, and calmed. She put her hands in her lap, surprised to find that he let her go to do it. \"So what do we do, then?\" she asked, her voice soft. \"You pop the trunk,\" he said. \"We can't leave them here.\" She closed her eyes, shook her head, felt dizzy enough to vomit again. She second she got out of the car, she might not make it three steps. Then again, she felt a strange kind of resilience in her. As if her brain were telling her to get used to this kind of shit, if it was going to be her life's work. With the exception that she planned on being one of the good guys. \"We're going to put the bodies in the trunk,\" she said, clarifying. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Let's go.\" She just sat there for a moment, looking at him, shock making her movements sluggish. \"I said,\" he repeated, \"Pop. The. Trunk.\" She reached under the dash, found the button, popped it. There was a slight commotion from the building beside them, and for a moment, Vincent froze, listening. Then, he motioned for her to hurry, quickening his own pace. \"Come on,\" he snapped, although it was more forceful than angry, \"let's go.\" She realized he was keeping her just in front of him. Watching her. He kept looking around, especially at the building. Just looking, everywhere, every which way, down the alley, up the alley, back at the car, at the door he'd come out of. It was like a twitch. Funny...she had never met a flesh-and-blood criminal before, at least, not one that was still free in the outside world and going about his business. All her criminal meetings had been with men safely locked away behind bars, telling her their stories for whatever project she was working on that week. Some men in prison will open up to a pretty girl - not that she'd never considered herself pretty, but anything with a vagina qualified as a beauty queen in that place. Some of them tried to intimidate her, true, tried to wow her with their shocking exploits, gross her out with lurid details. None of it had really bothered her. She'd welcomed all of them, really, wanting to harden herself to it. It was even funnier, how calm she felt as the night air enclosed her and she got closer to the two dead punks. She saw her locked pouch lying on the concrete about a foot away from where it had fallen out of the Kid-Rock lookalike's pocket. The other kid reminded her of a skinhead, with half the brains and twice the decoration. \"That one, grab the feet,\" Vincent ordered. She looked up, saw that the cab was much closer than she'd realized. The walk had just felt longer, that was all. She grabbed him by the ankles. Vincent got the kid under the arms, encircling his chest, the head lolling against the gray lapels of his jacket, and they carried him, a bit quickly, to the trunk, where Vincent unceremoniously dumped him in. He motioned for her to go back. \"Why me first?\" she asked. \"I didn't shoot them.\" He gave her a very deadpan look. She turned and walked, cursing under her breath. Stupid kid had gotten blood on her jeans. These were her favorite jeans. Fuck them if they ruined her shirt, she wasn't going to let any of their slimy blood ruin her favorite jacket. She got the ankles again and helped Vincent with the second haul. Two dead bodies in a trunk was quite a bit. Vincent reached up to his collar, unbuttoned the top button, and took of the thin, gray tie that hung there. He threw it in on top of the mountain of dead human flesh, and then slammed the trunk shut. \"All right, get in.\" \"Wait,\" she said, \"my fares. Did you see them?\" Vincent looked back down the alley. He squinted. Then he looked at her, and stepped around her to reach into the driver's side. When he stood up, her keys dangled from his hand. She watched as he walked down the alley to pick up her locked bag, getting into the car as she did so, and waited until he was a good ten steps away. At exactly his eleventh step, she slammed the door shut, reached up and pulled down the visor over her head. She always kept a spare key taped to it. Just the ignition key, you never knew what could happen in a bad situation. She'd heard, too many times, about women getting mugged, and using their keys to fight the guy off, only to find themselves in a car with no way to make it run. If she had to use her keys, she wanted a back-up. She ripped off the duct tape, slammed it into the ignition, and started the car. Vincent spun around at the sound, and she turned the wheel, making the tires squeal. He looked like a moving shadow from the corner of her eye as she turned. She saw him step into a particular stance, similar to the one he'd used when he'd shot those kids. The back of his suit coat flew out, and something was in his hand. His gun. It was raining. The alley was slick with oil in the gravel stones. Her tires couldn't get the fast traction she wanted, and she had hit the acceleration too fast. He was running toward her. She heard a shot fire about two feet from her head. She knew it wasn't a miss - Vincent didn't miss, no hit-man worth his salt would ever miss. He was giving her a warning. She ignored it. Before she knew what was happening, he was beside her, lunging in through the broken window. He grabbed the wheel with one hand, his gun aiming at her with the other. She reached out, grabbed his wrist, tried to push him away. The bullet went through the windshield. In an utter panic, she slammed the break, suddenly unable to see the dark world through a spider-web of splintered glass. Vincent was half-way into the car now, reaching over to push up the gear stick into neutral, so as not to blow the transmission. He pulled back a little, his hands on the edge of the window frame, knocking away the bits of glass. \"Stupid, Callie,\" he said to her, more calm than he had any sane right to be. \"Very stupid.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter Three---Do You Like Jazz? She had an odd memory. It was the last time she and her brother had had a quiet drink together, in his house, on a rare night off. They were going to go over to their father's house, together. Ray was telling her about a woman he was seeing, a teacher, with a certain air about her that he liked. She was very dry, very much in control of her world around her, and while she didn't have the physical appearance of a supermodel, Ray found her to be incredibly sexual, from her mousy brown hair to her perky breasts and her long, slightly skinny, natural legs. Normally, Ray was very much a gentleman with the ladies, but he worked too much. It was his flaw. Probably the same flaw that existed in all cops. This woman, however, seemed to be fine with that. \"I feel funny talking about this with you,\" he said as he refilled her glass. It was a Friday, late, on a rare night off that she had, and she spent it here, relaxing with him. When he wasn't being a nag, he was a really great guy that she totally adored. \"Why?\" she asked. \"I tell you all my secrets.\" He chuckled. \"What secrets do you have?\" She hesitated. \"Well...I met somebody.\" \"What?\" He set down his beer, favoring it over the harder stuff that she liked to sip at, over long periods of time. \"That has a definite sound to it.\" \"Yeah, well, you don't have to be a detective to figure that out.\" She rolled the amber alcohol around her glass. \"I've known him for a little bit. He's a graduate student. We wind up crossing paths on a regular basis.\" \"Yeah, go on,\" he prompted. \"Well...he asked me to cover for him on something, I can't even remember what it was now, and then sent me a thank you note a few weeks later, after we hadn't seen each other in a while. He made some offhand comment about how we hadn't run into each other lately. I sent him back a little note mentioning that I noticed the same, that maybe we should have coffee or something.\" \"And when are you going to have coffee?\" \"Next week, when I have a day off again at the same time he's got one.\" \"Coordinating your schedules already, huh? I guess that's the real world. Modern romance.\" She sighed. He noticed. \"What's wrong, then?\" \"Well, he's a nice guy, I like him. I just don't know how I feel about him.\" \"You don't have to know. Just let whatever happens...happen.\" \"I know.\" She sighed again, looked away. \"But...\" \"No, it's silly.\" \"Tell me. I told you all about my sexy new girlfriend.\" He watched her carefully, his penetrating detective eyes seeing through her evasiveness. \"What, is this back to your childish fantasy again?\" \"Everybody's gotta have a dream,\" she said, sipping an extra large mouthful. \"Swept off your feet, huh?\" He laughed. \"That could happen, too, when you're not looking for it.\" \"Come on, Ray. You know me. I have to classic situations. Either I'm more interested in him than he is in me, or he's more interested in me than I am in him. And I can't decide which one I hate more. Although being more interested is certainly more fun.\" \"You mean more psychotic,\" he joked. \"You know how obsessive you can be. That's why you're going to be a great detective someday, just like me.\" \"And then I'll be better than you and publish a best-selling novel to top it all off.\" She had clinked her glass against his. Callie could hear a clinking noise. She looked down, noticed that there was an aluminum can rolling across the parking lot, to land against the curb. The snapping of the gas pump shutting off drew her attention back to the present. She pulled it out, capped it off, and placed the pump back in its place. She looked up. Out across the lot, not more than thirty feet from her, stood Vincent. His back was to her, and he was looking around, not with the kind of nervous intensity he'd previously show, but a calm, long glancing, his lips occasionally parting to reveal his teeth, then closing again. He shuffled so he was partly facing her. He looked across his shoulder, and his expression was just as cold as before. He'd been angry when he'd stopped her. He reached across and yanked out the key from the ignition, then reached down and unlocked the back door for himself. He climbed in, leaving her bag of fares abandoned in the middle of that alley, and angrily tossed her keys at her, letting them land painfully against her thigh. \"Drive,\" he ordered. He made her stop at this gas station, threw a twenty at her and told her to fill up the tank. Then he'd walked away, and had been standing there ever since. This was the first acknowledgement he'd made of her presence since. \"You do anything like that again, and you might get very badly hurt,\" he said. His voice was loud enough for her to hear it, but not so loud that it attracted attention. Besides, it was past ten o'clock at night, there weren't too many people around. She wished she had a watch so she could see the exact time. She'd been too afraid that Vincent was going to make her pull over and shoot her in the back of the head before to worry about it then. \"Do you understand?\" he snapped, a bit harsher. She nodded, thoroughly chastened. \"Yeah?\" He nodded himself, his expression stiffening. Either he was trying to cool off, or he was attempting to lighten himself up. \"Well...new news, then.\" He clapped his hands, and it made her jump a little, as she wasn't expecting it. \"You like Jazz?\" \"Jazz?\" she echoed. \"Jazz, do you like Jazz?\" He was stepping closer to her. She turned a little, confused. The closer he got, the more relaxed he became. \"It's...okay. I listen to the jazz stations every now and again.\" He looked away. \"Well, there's this place I heard about. All the greats played there, Charlie Mengis, Chad Baker...\" He gave her a little smile, and she could have sworn it was mildly apologetic. \"Come on, I'll buy you a drink.\" She shook herself, feeling like she'd slipped into a stupor and was imaging all of this. \"I'm sorry?\" \"A drink, you know?\" He got closer to her. \"Come on, Callie, there really isn't any reason for there to be hard feelings between us. We had a misunderstanding before, that's all.\" She glanced at the windshield of her car. Some misunderstanding . He seemed to catch her meaning. \"Come on, nothing's done that can't be undone.\" His smile widened. \"Maybe they'll have dancing. You like to dance?\" She grunted, in the back of her throat. \"Yeah, I guess,\" she said softly. He handed her they keys to the cab again. \"Come on, let's go.\" 8888888888 So what he'd really meant, she gathered later, was that she hadn't yet seen anything that could make her a liability. Sure, she saw him shoot two punks who threatened their lives. Sure, they'd done a bad thing by not calling the cops and removing bodies from a crime scene, but that was small potatoes for him, she was sure. It was hard to believe, but as she drove to the jazz club, she was sure of it. She was driving a real live hit man. She had always known that such things existed, although they seemed more myth than reality. She saw a TV movie once that starred Tim Matheson, who played a hit man who, instead of shooting the woman he was contracted to kill by her husband, had instead made a deal with her to put her husband in jail and let her go free. Turned out that he had a serious soft spot for her, could have potentially been in love with her, if the movie had been willing to go that far out. Instead, it realistically - in as much as a television movie could - portrayed the twists and turns of trying to set everything up to protect everyone and actually get the husband arrested. They had succeeded, but all was not happily ever after. The hit man wound up serving some time in jail, the husband was paroled early, and the woman had to change her and her children's identities so she could have some peace. Supposedly it was based on a real life story. Probably explained the \"real\" aspects of it. Tim Matheson's hit man hadn't been anything like Vincent. Matheson had been a scruffy looking teddy bear, smart but small-time, and ultimately, lonely and pathetic. Vincent was sleek, well oiled, a machine. And he was...strangely charming. In an anti-social kind of way. It took a good while to get to Leimert Park, at least forty-five minutes. He didn't seem to mind. In fact, he attempted to make conversation with her, but she was a bit too shaken up to really respond. \"What else do you listen to, besides jazz?\" he asked her. \"My favorite station is...\" she trailed off, knowing he wouldn't know it. \"They play a wide variety. Popular music.\" \"Huh. Never cared much for it myself, but I guess it's called popular music for a reason. Any particular favorites?\" \"Barenaked Ladies,\" she answered, turning a corner. \"Vanessa Carlton, Smashmouth, Black Eyed Peas, you name it. A little of everything.\" \"Any else?\" \"Some new wave stuff. Sarah Brightman, Enya.\" She struggled to concentrate on driving. Only now that she realized what she was dealing with did all the other things come snapping into place. She'd been much more attracted to him initially than she'd thought. The disappointment that he was what he was, it was much more potent than she'd imagined. It was like a deep hole had been opened inside her, the kind of raw sorrow that only comes in dreams, emotion in its pure form. She shook herself. She was getting dizzy, sentimental, and worst of all, unwound. Her brain was just going through reflexes in its attempts to defend itself against the reality of the situation. She was, bottom line, a hostage. She could not walk away at any time. As nice as he was being about it, she was his prisoner and he would not let her go. The next question became, would he ever? The feelings of helplessness, of being trapped, squirmed into her stomach and made her feel like there was a vortex inside her, sucking away all the hope, all the light, every drop of happiness she'd ever known. She attempted to step outside of herself, examine her feelings, but the doors were locked and she was trapped inside. What if this was her last night on Earth? What if he was going to kill her in the end? She shook her head, feeling her eyelids starting to flutter. She couldn't panic, she couldn't get upset. He was taking her to a club. He was going to buy her a drink. He talked about dancing. She could play pretend. Pretend it was a date with a handsome guy. A handsome guy who killed people for a living. No, she didn't know that yet. Although her brain kept replaying, again and again, his motions in the alley, the lightning reflexes, the cold, detached expression he had when he walked away from that kid, shooting him in the skull as he went. She had done enough profiles. She had gone to enough classes. She knew what the hell she had in her cab. But she dared not say a thing. Maybe if he thought he'd convinced her that he was harmless - or at least not a legal threat - he would let her go when it was all over. She drew a shuddering breath. He was rambling about jazz, about the different artists, and he seemed to have realized somewhere that she wasn't listening to him anymore. \"Hello?\" he called, gently, leaning forward. She jumped a little, shaking herself again. \"You okay?\" She nodded. He cocked his head. \"You're not very convincing. It's stress, though, just stress. Are you breathing?\" \"Yes,\" she said, a bit more tersely than she thought herself capable of at that moment. \"Look, if it makes you feel any better,\" he said, knowing where her mind was without her saying a word, \"those two were criminals. Engaged in continuing criminal activity. We did the world a favor, you know. Any cop, including your brother, would have done the same in that situation.\" Surprisingly, the words had their desired affect. Ray would have done exactly that. Her fingers itched. She wanted so badly to talk to him. She had never wanted him more in her life. \"When this is over,\" Vincent went on, and she heard the faint tapping of his pointer on the screen, \"you can call him, tell him everything. Make yourself happy. But tonight your job is to be my driver, and until that job is done, you stay with me and do what I say.\" There was a hint, just a hint, of force behind his words. Anybody else would have used a lot more, but Vincent didn't need to. \"Yeah,\" she replied, swallowing to moisten her drying throat. \"Yeah.\" \"You still breathing?\" \"That's the plan,\" she said, focusing on the road. \"In the meantime, there's no reason in the world that this can't be a pleasant evening.\" She glanced up at him, and he was faintly smiling at her again. She felt a chill when she realized that her attraction to him might be mutual. The thought was terrifying. Utterly so. \"Yeah,\" she said, unable to find another word. Then, \"I guess.\" \"You'll like this place, it's a piece of city history.\" He trailed off, and let out a small sigh when he noticed that her expression hadn't changed, her shoulders hadn't unclenched. He was very good at body language, and she was coiled to jump, secretly wishing that the driver's seat was actually an ejection seat in disguise. \"You know, I didn't mean for that to happen. It was never a part of the plan.\" She didn't say anything. \"But you know, shit happens,\" he said. \"And we have to just roll with it, go with the flow.\" His eyes were brighter, staring her down in the rearview. \"Right?\" \"Right.\" \"I mean, nothing ever goes exactly the way you planned it. I'm sure your brother could tell you stories. I'm sure you have stories of your own, you've lived here long enough. You've studied Darwin, right? E-Ching?\" She blinked. \"Are you trying to talk me down?\" she asked, her voice faint. \"I'm sorry?\" She stared up at him, stopped at a red light. It was amazing. She'd expected a lot of things from meeting a criminal personality, but this guy actually seemed to think he was right, and wanted her to think so, too. Sociopath , her criminology-mind told her. That's what sociopaths were like. They weren't psychotic, they simply saw the world a particular way, and didn't understand why others didn't see it the same. Sociopathic and anit-social. His earlier comments about society had to be a clue. If she really wanted to live through this night, she was going to have to play along. Thoughts of Patty Hurst and Stockholm syndrome danced in her head, but she managed to really calm herself down, think soothing thoughts, let herself focus on the more pleasant aspects of the situation. When they reached the club and she parked, he paid the fee, and they got out together. \"Wait,\" he said as she closed the driver's side door. He looked down at her pantleg. \"That punk ruined your jeans.\" She'd nearly forgotten. She was so focused on keeping her body calm, however, that her mouth had quite lost its ability to form words. He reached out, gently pulled away the leather jacket she was wearing. \"You've got a sweater on underneath,\" he said. \"Take it off.\" She took off the leather coat. He held out his hand for it. She removed the sweater. \"Tie it around your waist,\" he said. She obeyed, letting the longer part cover the wide smear of blood on her upper thigh. When she looked up, she caught him looking at her, and realized that she was wearing a thin, satiny tank top underneath everything, fitted and cut around her waist and breasts, but high enough not to show any bared cleavage. He seemed to approve. \"Good, put this back on.\" She took it back, slipped it back on. It looked nice without the bulk of the sweater underneath. \"Okay, that will work. But one more thing.\" He reached up and removed her had, tossing it inside the cab through the broken window. Then he crooked his fingers for her to step closer to him, which she did, hesitantly. He gently turned her around, and she felt his fingers at the end of her long braid. \"Hey,\" she managed. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but the night's taken its toll on your hairdo.\" He took off the band and pulled the locks apart gently, until her hair in all its streaked glory lay across her shoulders, spreading across her back. She felt his fingertips thread through it, coming close to the nape of her neck. His touch was gentle, caressing. She found herself closing her eyes as it came around again, combing through the locks, smoothing them out. Unconsciously she let out a small sigh of pleasure. She hadn't had her hair brushed for her since her mother was alive. Then he turned her around, and he was grinning. \"Perfect,\" he said. He took her hand and looped it through his arm. \"Let's go.\" 8888888888 The club was dim, but comfortable. There was a round area where tables and chairs and even a few booths were spread out for people to sit and listen to the band, which played on the stage with a wild abandon she hadn't seen in most rock stars. Jazz wasn't like other music. Vincent seemed utterly delighted by the sight, although how she was able to detect any of his moods was beyond her. But his face definitely changed. It softened, and he smiled, and the tension went out of his shoulders. \"This is my kind of place,\" he said. Her hand had been resting on his arm the whole way up, and he took it now in his hand, palm to palm, fingers gently enclosing hers. Something in his touch was different. Before it had been informal and rough, but now she was reminded of the gentleness of his fingers in her hair, and her scalp tingled. He pulled her close to his side, even as he motioned to a host to seat them at a table. Then she realized that it was a mistake. She was letting herself go soft. She was letting herself sympathize with him, allowing her natural, physical attraction to him blind her to everything else. She was letting him totally charm her. She had to get away. She wiggled her fingers in his grip, noticed that his hold tightened ever slightly. \"Vincent,\" she said, low enough for only him to hear. \"What?\" he asked, turning to her, raising his eyebrows, all innocence. \"I have to go to the bathroom,\" she said. It was lame, but she squeezed her thighs together for emphasis. She looked embarrassed, and genuinely was, as it was unlikely she would be able to make a movie-like escape through a bathroom window. There wasn't anything getting past him. He calmly walked her toward the sign that said, in red neon, \"RESTROOMS,\" and led her down the hallway. It was a single seater, no windows, which he allowed her to enter without protest. She went in, attempted to go in case she really did need to, and the tension of the evening was just making her ignore it, and saw that her hair didn't look half bad, even though it had spent a good part of the day smashed under that hat. When she came out, Vincent was waiting for her at the end of the hallway, and she caught a small smile on his face, maybe of appreciation, maybe of triumph, she couldn't tell. He led her to their table, in the middle of the floor, wide open, hardly any people there, but it was a weeknight and people did have jobs. She wasn't too familiar with all the different artists, but there were pictures and names on the walls. Vincent let his hand rest lightly on hers as the music changed from a more quick pace to a slower one, lazier. He glanced around, as if he meant his earlier offer about dancing. When the waitress came to take their order, he kept his very simple - seltzer water with a lime. She, however, felt the terrible craving for a simple shot of bourbon on the rocks. She made herself drink it slow, not wanting to buzz herself, but knowing that that was the real reason she'd wanted it. Vincent asked her if she wanted another, and she declined. They didn't talk much during the evening. Vincent was totally absorbed in the band. There was a childlike delight on his face, bright and glowing. When she finished her bourbon, which didn't take as long as she'd hoped, she found herself wanting to talk. Just watching him, getting comfortable with him, it went against her instincts. She was having a silent argument with herself and was desperate to do anything to shut herself up. \"I've been trying to learn to listen to jazz,\" she muttered. \"It's off melody, behind the notes. Improvised. Just like tonight.\" He flashed his eyes at her, a smile lingering his face but not reaching his lips. He leaned forward on his arms, eyes trailing back to the band as he got a little closer to her. \"Everybody always plays it so safe. Same job, same house, same people, everything the same, same, same. Ten years from now...hell, you don't know where you'll be ten minutes from now... do you?\" He had turned his head completely to her now, pinning her in place. She grunted, looked away, annoyed. The cute-boy act didn't seem to work as well with a bit of alcohol in her. Vincent leaned back, his hand going out. It took her a second to realize he was stopping the waitress. \"Who is that, on the trumpet?\" he asked, his voice still soft in the noisy room, carrying perfectly. \"That's Daniel, baby, he's the owner,\" the woman replied, the tone all hip, mingled with modern-day L.A. Vincent reached down, pulled out some money from his pocket. \"Well, he's fantastic. Can you ask him to join us? I gotta buy him a drink.\" He put the money on the small tray she supported against her hip. \"Sure thing, baby,\" the woman said. \"And bring us another bourbon on the rocks,\" he added before she walked away. Callie tossed him a look. He was grinning at her.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four---I Am A Cool Guy So she was two bourbons down now. It was okay. Not that it mattered. She was going to die. Maybe if she drove drunk, Vincent wouldn't be able to use her anymore. Maybe they would get pulled over and she'd be arrested for drunk driving. It was a possibility. Then, the horrific thought of Vincent shooting a couple of innocent cops to keep himself from getting dragged into the mess was unbearable. She glanced over at him. It had been a while. She had a faint buzz going from the alcohol, nothing major, but smooth and mellow. He looked back at her as the set wound down. \"So,\" he said, leaning forward, close to her, as if they were having a private conversation. \"Did you last boyfriend take you to places like this?\" Mute, she shook her head. He shrugged. \"Maybe if he had, you wouldn't have broken up with him?\" His look was nearly flirtatious, held back only by the fact that his eyes were still roving the room, taking in everyone. Watching, always watching. \"What was he like, your ex?\" \"I never said I had an ex,\" she replied, clinking the last bits of mostly-melted ice in her glass. \"Well, if you had previous boyfriends that you don't have anymore, technically, they're exes.\" She looked at him, leaning her chin on her hand. \"What about you? Don't you have someone?\" \"Didn't we already cover that?\" He sipped his water, noticing how the waitress went over to Daniel, telling him that a particular table wanted to buy him a drink. \"Not really. Not to my satisfaction. If you want to know about my love life, it's only fair I know yours.\" He gave her a brief smile. \"Well, probably not the best conversation to be having right now, anyway.\" She laughed a little, glanced out toward the floor to where the musicians were cleaning up. A thought struck her and slid out of her mouth before she could stop it. \"I'm going to be alone forever.\" \"Why?\" he seemed perplexed by her statement. She sighed, shook her head. \"Because I'm a complete and total fucking idiot.\" She sighed again, letting the breath slip out of her lungs. If only she didn't have to put it back. \"Well, maybe occasionally, but not as a general rule, I'm sure,\" he said, sounding mildly consoling. \"You don't know,\" she muttered. \"Try me. Since you seem to want to talk about it so badly.\" She looked at him. \"There's this guy now, nice guy, likes me a lot. We have coffee, dinner on occasion. He hasn't even held my hand yet because I'm not ready for that.\" \"So...what's wrong, no spark?\" \"Nope, not a one. And I know he's interested in me. I got so uncomfortable that after only our third or fourth conversation, I called the guy and nailed the poor bastard with the 'I want to be your friend first' speech. I was lucky he ever talked to me again.\" \"Ouch. But is he still talking to you?\" \"Yes. But still no spark.\" She realized he was leaning closer to her. His hand hovered next to hers, ready to take it. \"Don't worry about it,\" he said. \"You did the right thing. Honesty is always the best. You had to give it to him straight, you did. Relationships are always better if people make their intentions known up front. No stupid games. Anyway, if he's still talking to you, you haven't wrecked it.\" She nodded, feeling mildly comforted by the thought. \"Someone told me once that if it's meant to be, you can't screw it up.\" Vincent let out a low, sarcastic laugh. \"I don't know if I'd go that far. I mean, millions of people in this city alone, billions on the planet. How can anyone believe that there's only one person out there for them? That there's some kind of predestination that will bring those two people together? That's a little far-fetched.\" \"Well, that doesn't surprise me, coming from you,\" she said, sipping the remains of the water in her glass. She looked at him, caught how his cheek muscles twitch. \"Exactly why?\" he asked, still casual, curious. \"Well, that would imply faith in something bigger than yourself,\" she replied. \"You don't have beliefs like that and then become a hit man.\" He cocked an eyebrow. \"Miss Criminology Major is attempting to psychoanalyze me,\" he said dryly. \"What makes you think I'm a hit-man, anyway?\" \"What are you, a nihilist?\" she asked. \"God is dead, all that noise?\" \"You've had a bit too much to drink.\" \"Only enough to make me say stupid things. Don't worry, I can still drive, and I'm not drunk enough to try and run away from you again.\" His hand finally closed over hers. \"Good. Because I would hate to have to hurt you, but I would if you made me.\" She seemed puzzled by this statement. \"Have you ever had to shoot someone that you liked?\" she asked. \"Liked? You mean, how, a woman I was sleeping with?\" She rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, that, or someone you were just friends with. Do you have any friends?\" He shook his head. She shrugged. \"Figured that, too. So you only sleep with women, you don't get to know them first? You don't have relationships?\" \"It's hard to have a relationship when you have to travel as much as I do.\" \"Or live like you do. Do you even have a home?\" His hand squeezed hers a bit. She looked up. Daniel had approached, and now the conversation was over. For the moment. Daniel stuck out his hand, shook Vincent's, then kissed Callie's. He told them he would be right back, he just had a little bit of business to take care of. The band was playing something quiet and low, and the club was nearly empty. Vincent took her hand fully in his, gave it a mild tug. \"Well, I promised you a dance,\" he said. \"How about it?\" It was very cool, the way he said it, very casual, confident. She wondered where he got it from. Nearly every guy she'd ever known had always fumbled on that line, even when they were dating her and dancing was expected. She looked at him, unsure. Before they'd been on the verge of fighting. Now, the adrenaline pushed the alcohol through her system, giving her a moment of clarity. He stood up, taking her with him. She let him lead her to a small section of the floor, and before she knew it, he had one arm around her back, and felt the warmth of his chest inches away from hers. Her hand rested on the shoulder of his suit coat, feeling the polished cotton against her fingertips. \"You didn't answer me before,\" she said. \"Do you have a home?\" \"I have a place to lay my head,\" he said. \"Homes are for people with families.\" She bit back something sarcastic, like, poor little hit man . Instead, she just let the silence rest, not sure of whatever she wanted to say next. Sometimes, in moments of extreme discomfort, silence was a haven instead of an addition to a difficult situation. She'd always found this to be true on dates - if a guy said something she didn't like, she would let the silence speak for her, finding it easier. As dense as men were, they usually got the message and hastily changed the subject. Suddenly she realized that Vincent was looking right at her, gazing down into her face. He was only a few inches taller than her, although he was well built, she could sense his muscle frame against her, knew he could most likely snap her in half if he wanted to. \"So, this guy you're seeing...why are you seeing him?\" She was a bit startled by the conversation. \"Why not? He's a perfectly nice guy.\" \"That you don't like. Why not?\" She shifted, uncomfortable. \"He makes...insinuations. I don't know if he means to, but they made me uncomfortable.\" \"Insinuations...you mean sexual?\" She nodded. \"And you're offended by them.\" A statement, not a question. He seemed to be attempting to understand her, even if he didn't quite grasp it - she could tell by the squint of his eyebrows. She said, \"I'm of the belief that when two people are getting to know each other, the man should be a gentleman. On his best behavior.\" \"Only depends on what the relationship is for,\" Vincent pointed out. She stiffened. \"No, it depends on the person you are,\" she corrected him. \"Really?\" \"Yes. You see, in spite of the popular view, that sex is good for recreation, or a natural need, a basic instinct, I believe that it should stay within the confines of marriage.\" \"You do.\" Very dead-pan now, nearly amused. \"Yes.\" She was getting more annoyed by the second. \"Well, maybe that's the problem. Maybe this guy is trying to sleep with you and you just think you should be friends. Hence why he doesn't seem to get the message.\" She shrugged. \"Doesn't matter.\" She let out the part that she didn't really believe she was going to live through the night at any rate. \"It does,\" he insisted, and then she felt herself being pressed up against him. \"You see, you're keeping this guy at arm's length because he isn't what you want. If he was, you wouldn't care. If you had a spark, it wouldn't matter.\" She felt his fingers sliding along her lower back, sending chills up her spine. \"Now, someone you're attracted to could do just about anything, and you'd come back for more without a single complaint.\" He leaned very close to her ear, ticking the delicate hairs there. \"Right?\" She turned away, nearly speechless. She felt slightly dizzy, wondering if he was going to do something really stupid, like kiss her. And hating herself for secretly hoping he would. Then he pulled away, looked down at her, and smiled, wickedly. \"Isn't it nice, though, when two people feel the same way?\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" she said. \"I've never been there.\" His smile widened, and he gently let her go. They went back to their seat, as Daniel had returned and the waitress had brought their drinks. 8888888888 \"That was the way Miles was, though,\" Daniel was saying, his drink half-watered down in front of him, totally engrossed in conversation with Vincent. \"When he was in his musical headspace? Fierce.\" Callie listened, her eyes going back and forth like at a tennis match. Vincent had metamorphosised (sp). He'd gone from being cunning and wicked to being friendly and polite and downright interesting. His admiration for Daniel was clear. She didn't think she would ever see something like this in a man like him, but the second they started talking about Miles Davis, it was like a spell had been cast. Until then, Vincent had been idly reaching for her hand ever now and again, to give the impression that they were together. Careful not to piss him off, she'd played along, although coolly, not wanting to seem too submissive. Now, he was completely into whatever Daniel was saying, leaning back in his seat, hands on his thighs.... And funny thing. He'd started looking around the room again. At first, she'd had a moment of unwelcome jealousy when she simply thought he was checking out the waitress, like he had before. But now, she was starting to wonder... \"But did you get to talk to him?\" Vincent asked. Daniel had been telling them all about a night in 1964 when Miles Davis had come into this club while Daniel was a mere busboy, just wanting to be around the music of the jazz scene. She could picture him, that young. She could imagine what it felt like, just wanting to be around something you admired so much. There had been times when she'd snuck away for weekends to various writer's conventions just to be around the brilliant minds she would meet there, chance at a meeting with a favorite of hers. \"Better. I got to play for twenty minutes,\" Daniel said, as if dropping the punchline of a brilliant joke. \"Man,\" Vincent breathed, playing it cool but still amazed, \"had to be...\" \"Oh, it was,\" Daniel replied, as if they could finish each other's thoughts. \"How did you do?\" she heard herself asking. He laughed, smiled at her, showing her the respect that a mildly interested girlfriend deserved. \"Well, you're really not much when you're playing next to Miles Davis, but he carried me,\" he replied, watching his mouth, being respectful to her because she was a woman. She found she really liked that. If she'd been a guy he would have used a lot more swear words, but he was a real gentleman. She wished there were more like him the world. \"What did he say?\" Vincent asked, still being cool but interested. \"He said one word. Cool.\" The word 'cool' was spoken in a husky whisper, and she could imagine it perfectly. \"Cool?\" Vincent said, much sharper, quicker, without the special effects. \"Cool,\" Daniel affirmed. \"It meant good, but not ready. It meant, look me up when you are.\" \"Did you?\" \"No, I got drafted, and then there were...other things...\" he shot Callie an uncomfortable look. \"By the time I came back to it, the season had passed.\" Vincent sighed, as if feeling a deep sense of empathy. \"The crowds aren't here, now,\" he said. \"Well, jazz ain't the draw that it used to be. You know, I was born in 1945, but that night was the night of my conception.\" Vincent smiled, shook his head. \"Wow. That's a great story.\" \"Yeah,\" Callie agreed, \"really.\" She glanced at Vincent, and felt a real familiar feeling between her legs. \"I'll be right back,\" she said, standing up slowly. Vincent's eyes shot to her. \"Bathroom,\" she said softly, pointing. He nodded, and watched her all the way there. She could feel his eyes drilling holes into her back. But it was for real this time, and she actually used the toilet, took a moment to fix her hair, and headed out again. Only to find Vincent coming toward her. 8888888888 Vincent watched Callie walk away. It was perfect, really. And even if she tried to leave, she wouldn't get far, as he had her keys in his pocket. He turned back to Daniel, who was smiling, pleased at the enthusiastic response he'd gotten for his story, raising his glass to take a drink. Vincent said, \"I'll have to tell the guys in Cartajena and Kublikhan that story.\" Then Daniel's smile vanished. The world changed to black and white. Vincent sat his target, watched him lower his glass. \"You know the guys from Cartajena and Kublikhan?\" \"Afraid so.\" The smile was long gone, having dropped from dead-pan into an expression of deep fear and loathing. Daniel had gone from looking at Vincent with the admiration of a fellow enthusiast, to looking at him as if he'd murdered his father. Vincent saw a tingle of color. He felt the merest pang of guilt. It was unusual for him, and he studied it, wondering where in the hell it had come from, how it could possibly exist. He'd been killing for years. Only six for private hire, but before that, he was a certified, card-carrying, government-funded assassin. It was part of the reason he'd gone prematurely gray. He'd never regretted a single kill. \"And just when I thought you were a cool guy.\" \"I am a cool guy,\" Vincent said, not skipping a beat, \"with a job I was contracted to do.\" Daniel continued to glare at him, his cheeks having dropped so that they hung like the empty pockets in a squirrel's face. He sighed, considering. \"Okay, listen,\" he said, doing a quick calculation in his head and knowing he only had a few more minutes to do this without Callie seeing. She'd watched him gun down the guys in the street, but that was defendable, even forgiveable. This, however, would not be, and there'd be no turning back. He'd have to kill her when the night was over. Strangely, he did not want to do that. \"Yeah?\" Daniel breathed. \"I'm going to ask you a question.\" \"What kind of question?\" \"A jazz question,\" Vincent said, his tone condescending. \"If you get it right, we roll.\" We. As if Callie were involved in this. \"I guarantee you,\" Daniel said, grasping at the thin line, desperate, \"that if I walk out of here tonight, I will go so far away, it'll be just like I was dead. And you tell these people and their rep here, Felix? Tell them I'm sorry. Tell them, I was compelled to give testimony. It was either play ball or go back inside, and I'm not going back inside.\" Vincent barely nodded. He moistened his lips, and said, \"Where did Miles learn music?\" \"I know everything there is to know about Miles Davis,\" Daniel said. \"Then let's have it.\" \"His father was a dentist, invested in agriculture, made a lot of money, sent Miles to Julliard, school of music, New York, 1955.\" Vincent coolly raised his hand, which now held his gun, and planted three bullets right into Daniel's head. Before the man could fall, Vincent stood up, knocking his chair out from behind him, reaching out with one hand to catch the man's face as he fell. Gently, so gently, he set him down, as if the man were his son and he were putting him to sleep. Then, just as tenderly, he reached down, pulled up his hand, his left one, and set it beside him on the table. \"Tripped out of Julliard after listening to Charlie Parker, who mentored him for the next three years,\" Vincent murmured, as if to confirm the truth of the answer to some silent listener. He closed his eyes. So this was what regret felt like. He didn't like it, it was bitter in his mouth. He closed his eyes, let out his breath, tried to swallow the taste away, but it wouldn't. Then he heard the bathroom door open. He let go and shoved the gun back into its holster, heading right for her as she stepped out into the hallway. He managed to block her view, but scared the piss out of her in the process, he could tell from the look on her face. She jumped, pulled back, seemed offended. \"I really was using the bathroom,\" she said. \"I know,\" he said. \"We have to go.\" \"But I thought you were talking to Daniel,\" she said, poking her head around his shoulder. \"What happened?\" Vincent tried to pull her back into his shadow, but she had nearly pushed herself into him, and had already gotten a glimpse down the hallway and out into the room. \"What's Daniel got his head down for?\" she asked. \"Is he sick?\" He almost laughed. The first time he'd ever seen a dead body, he'd asked the same question. Then she pulled back, turned and looked up at him. The horror slowly registered there. \"We have to go,\" he said again. He grabbed her wrist and led her through the club, out the back door, and out into the street. A/N: Quick shout-outs to SYNB and Sargonne, who have both begun their own Collateral fics. Sargonne's is called \"Vestige,\" and SYNB's is called \"Music For Serial Killers.\" Both of them quite excellent and totally unique. I recommend them both highly. I seriously think we HAVE to make put up at Collateral section, we'd totally fill it up! I'm with you, Sargonne! Plus, they really need to open up a Miracle fanfiction section, there are at least a dozen of those fics on the Misc. Movies page! LOL[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: Don't own Collateral. Although with all the fics I wrote for this movie, you'd think I did. But no, alas, Tom Cruise isn't currently owned by anyone. And did you hear that Jamie Foxx will be working with Michael Mann again, this time co-starring with Tom's arch nemesis, Colin Farrell, to be in a movie-version of a modern day \"Miami Vice\"? But I'm digressing... Welcome back! Oh, wait, I'M the one who's been away. Oh well. But anyhoo, I'm back and running with this fic. I don't know how often updates will be coming because I have a problem. When I got the Collateral DVD, I wasdetermined to use it to finish this fic. Well, it took me a while to get around to the Collateral DVD because my obsession switched people for a while, and when I came back around and I watched the movie with the commentary, I just started to appreciate how utterly brillaint the movie was and I felt terribly inferior. I mean, this story feels inferior to the brilliance of the movie. So I'm struggling right now to keep true to the spirit of the movie and yet make the plot unique. Which isn't easy. I had to go back and re-read Solace/Soulless to regain my \"Vincent\" perspective, but then I realized that Vincent only has one true love, Victoria, and that this story isn't really a romance...well, not a strict romance, anyway. It's more an angst/psychological thing than anything else. All right, I'm so done talking. You've been waiting quite a few months for this update, if you still are keeping track of this fic, so onto the good parts... Chapter Five Since When Is Any Of This Negotiable? (For those who don't remember, we just left the Jazz club scene where poor Daniel gets popped in the head three times. Vincent has just dragged Callie out of the club, and Callie is NOT a happy camper.) \"What happened? What did you do?\"Callie cried, even as her breath turned into steam in the open, chill air of the night, even as Vincent continued on mercilessly, towards the cab. He did not even look back. She dug in her heels and threw back her weight. She would have been yanked off her feet if she hadn't also decided to bend her knees and brace herself against the ground, like a child throwing a temper tantrum. He staggered, turned, took her other arm, pulled her up, and she lost her balance, falling chest-first into his frame. His arms caught her, pulling her tight, rigid against his body, not giving her an inch of space. \"Let…me…go!\" she rasped as her arms flailed uselessly where his pinned them down against her sides. She looked to her left quickly, saw there were pedestrians approaching, that the streets were not so deserted, at least not on this side of town. Vincent saw them, too, let her go, caught her by the forearms and brought her heavily forward again, so that their faces were nearly level. He bent down. His mouth covered hers, absolutely. As a kiss, it was different. At first she knew damn well it was an act, his attempt at trying to make it look like this was some kind of lover's quarrel. The fact that she wasn't already screaming for help, that their body language clearly indicated that they knew each other, was enough to keep even the nosiest person from intervening. The kiss was the clincher. The climax of the scene. And then, a few seconds into it, her amazement wore off and she realized exactly what was going on. By the time her brain hazily processed it, he really was kissing her. Really. Kissing her. The fact that Vincent was attractive hadn't escaped her. Sure, he was prematurely gray, and had shot at her, but that didn't stop his eyes from being so green, didn't stop his voice from being raspy in all the right ways, and didn't stop his very masculine frame from feeling so good against her body. Then there was pure chemistry at work. She had never understood the power of a kiss. She had always heard the myth that you never knew if you were right for a certain guy until you kissed him – the Shoop song, \"It's In His Kiss,\" seemed so silly, but it was absolutely true. The spark went through them both, back and forth a couple of times. It seemed that his lips were never going to let go. She stopped fighting, falling limp against him, only her willpower keeping her on her feet. She let her arms hang, then slowly drew them back to her body as he relaxed his grip, and then, when the kiss broke, she just stared at him, too shaken to speak. To her amazement, the same look was in his face. Or at least, she though it was. He seemed to blink, and it was gone. \"I am not playing,\" he said. She opened her mouth to speak, realized she didn't know what to say. \"Not playing?\" she managed. \"You've been playing me all night .\" His lips twisted, and the hints of his wicked smile seemed to glimmer down at her. He relaxed his arms further, and she was able to twist out of his grip. She looked at him, barely five inches in front of him, and let out a long, deep breath. \"All right. I'm finished with this,\" she said, quietly, as if to herself. \"You're getting yourself another damn cab driver. Take your fucking money back.\" She reached into her back pocket, pulled out the three hundreds. \"I quit.\" \"Doesn't work like that,\" Vincent said plainly. \"Yes it does. You don't know me and I don't know you. Have a good night.\" She took a step back. He matched it with a step forward. \"You don't get to walk away now, Callie.\" \"Watch me.\" She spun. The next thing she knew, Vincent had grabbed her and thrown her up against the wall, his hand at her throat. She felt the curve of his thumb and forefinger across her windpipe, ready to close it in a heartbeat. \"You're not listening to me,\" he said. \"You're not going anywhere except where I tell you.\" \"Fuck you,\" she managed. He almost smiled again. \"Maybe another night. But never when I'm working.\" She struggled against his hand, too angry to be afraid for the moment, although the fear was creeping up on her, slowly, a chill in her limbs. \"Let go of me!\" she cried, although with his new pressure, it came out more like a squeak. \"Relax,\" he said casually, \"and I'll consider it.\" She glared at him, then, slowly, forced herself to stop moving. Then, gently, he extracted his hand from her neck, and grabbed her shoulder, and what he was about to do next, she would never find out, as her cellular phone went off in her pocket. Vincent looked down. She imagined that few people in the world ever saw him truly surprised. He seemed to have forgotten about her cel-phone, and could imagine that for a guy in his line of work, that was a big, fat mistake. He looked up at her, annoyed. \"Hey, don't blame me, you're the one who's supposed to know everything,\" she said, turning away from him, pressing her cheek into the roughness of the brick wall behind her. Then she felt a tremor of embarrassment as his hand delved into her pocket and took the phone out. \"Who's Ray?\" he asked. \"My brother.\" The phone stopped ringing. \"You talk to him a lot,\" he commented. \"Yeah. Well, he is a cop,\" she reminded him, then regretted it with the look Vincent gave her. \"So what happens if you don't answer? He just leaves a message?\" \"No, he calls back until I do answer,\" she said with a sigh, knowing she had to be truthful, that if she lied, it would just make Vincent angrier. God knew where she stood at the moment, but she was an idiot to think that he wouldn't kill her, even now. As if on cue, the phone started to ring again. \"What is it with this guy?\" Vincent snapped. He considered the phone, considered her. \"Answer it.\" She seemed amazed at this suggestion. \"And say what?\" \"He's your brother. Lie to him.\" \"I can't. He'll see right through me.\" \"Then you'd better make it good, if you don't want him to get hurt.\" Her stomach lurched. She hadn't thought of it quite that way yet. The fact that she was in danger hadn't escaped her, but that her brother might get hurt purely by extension was horrifying. She took up the phone in one hand, and shakily pressed the green phone button. \"Hey, Ray,\" she said, hoping the fear in her voice wasn't too obvious, even as she tried to bury it under a mask of exhaustion. \"Callie,\" came Ray's voice. \"What's going on? You really busy?\" \"Yeah, it's been a crazy night,\" she said, knowing that wasn't a lie, watching Vincent's face the whole time, searching for cues. \"What is it?\" \"Well, I know we already had this discussion \" \"That's never stopped you before.\" \"I really want you to go over and visit dad,\" Ray said. \"Not this again,\" she sighed, her weariness genuine. \"Callie, he's having a rough night. His insomnia is really bad; he needs some company. I would go over in a heartbeat, but I stumbled into a crime scene about an hour ago and now I'm getting dragged all over town.\" \"Crime scene?\" Callie pressed, her spine starting to tingle. \"What's going on?\" \"Same old bullshit in L.A., really,\" Ray said, \"but one of my leaks got shot, and supposedly one of his higher-ups is dead, too.\" She wanted to ask where he was. She wanted to ask who was dead. She didn't dare, not with Vincent looking at her. \"I'm bogged down, I'll be lucky to get off shift three hours late. Come on, Cal, drop off your fare and head on over, five minutes. I'll really owe you.\" She sighed deeply. She was ready to tell him that she absolutely couldn't that night, but knew it was just going to lead to an argument. \"Tell him you'll go,\" Vincent whispered, who had been listening to the conversation the whole time. It was remarkable how loud the tiny speakers of a cellular phone actually were. She glared at him. \"I'll see. But I can't promise.\" \"That's enough,\" Ray said, \"Love you. Thanks.\" \"Love you too.\" She hung up the phone. \"I don't lie to my brother very well,\" she said. \"He's going to be really pissed at me when he finds out I didn't go, although I really doubt that you give a shit.\" \"You're going to go,\" Vincent said. \"We both are.\" She stared at him, not reacting at first. Vincent mistook it for confusion. \"We have to go,\" Vincent attempted the rational track. \"If you don't go, Ray finds out, he comes looking for you. Not good. For either of you. We go, there's no problem.\" Speaking softly and forcefully, she said, \"I'm not taking you to see my father .\" \"Since when is any of this negotiable?\" Vincent asked in a dangerous tone, stepping closer to her. She calmed, backed off. \"Who the hell am I supposed to tell him that you are?\" she said. \"I never bring fares home.\" \"I'll think of something on the way. Let's go.\" He handed her the keys to the cab, and they got in and left. 8888888888 It was midnight. Even though the clock flashed 12:01 a.m. on her dashboard, it was pure midnight. She'd seen an episode of some show like Twilight Zone a long time ago, where an old man, who was really a vampire, explained that actual midnight was not the literal 12:00 a.m., but a few minutes before or after, when the true hour struck, and evil came out to wreak havoc on the night. Evil had already been out to play for a while, now, she thought ruefully. Then, she remembered, with a pang, how much that episode had upset her. In the story, at the midnight hour on Halloween, the old man/vampire had been torn to bits by the neighbors, all of them becoming mindless zombies under some weird kind of spell. In the morning, no one remembered what they had done, but the boy the old man befriended discovered the truth. At the very end, the boy was with his father, and the wind started to blow, and for no reason, the father started coughing, which was the exact reaction everyone had to the old man/vampire, and the boy had a look upon his face as if he understood that whatever the old man was had been passed along to him, and that one day, he would suffer the same fate. She blamed her father, really. He was far too into creepy stuff like that. Outer Limits , Unsolved Mysteries , you name it, he had seen it. Only that episode had ever really bugged her. The knowledge of your horrible fate, hanging over your head. What was she going to tell her father? Vincent had been pretty much mum since they'd gotten back on the road, and she was more than content to keep it that way. A part of her burned with fury, knowing how she was being manipulated, how she was being used, and the other part shuddered regularly in fear, knowing her life might be over after this one night, than these might be her last hours to live. Which only made the rage worse, as it was all directed at him. She knew the route by heart. She was surprised to find herself already climbing up the winding street that led to her father's house, her headlights barely making a discernable path before her. She found the right driveway, and pulled in, tucking the car deep into a pocket by the garage, not wanting to block the main door. It was an old habit, one Ray had instilled in her, about never letting your car ever block anything else. She considered that her father wasn't going to go anywhere that night, he certainly wasn't much of a wanderer, but she was clearing the way anyway, grasping at the familiar patterns of her life, trying to stay somewhere within normal. She turned off the engine and glanced up into the rearview, expectant. He looked back at her, his eyes dark in the shadows, his hair seeming less silver and more a dirty brownish-gray. \"Here's your story,\" he said softly. \"I'm a friend.\" \"A friend in an expensive suit who rides around with me in my cab after midnight?\" she quipped. His eyes moved out of the shadows, pierced her for a moment, and then he resumed in that same low voice, slurred together in the slight way of someone speaking quickly. \"You had an accident. Ran into a deer.\" She cocked an eyebrow. She wanted to echo, \"A deer?\" but didn't dare push her luck. \"You didn't know who else to call. You knew I worked a night shift, so you called me. You wanted to make sure that the cab still ran all right, so we took a ride. You were upset so you wanted to go see your dad.\" Looking away, Callie gazed toward the front door. It wasn't so unthinkable. \"So we're friendly,\" she muttered. \"Aren't we?\" he said, his voice still that same low-key, but that wicked twinkle back in his eyes. He pressed, \"Maybe we're even dating, a little. You haven't told anybody yet because you weren't sure where it was going.\" She didn't want to look at him now, didn't want to see his amusement at the obvious discomfort this suggestion caused her. He was having too much fun reveling in the knowledge that she found him attractive. To save her dignity, she said, \"Fine,\" and pulled back on the door handle, making it slid open. Vincent buttoned his jacket as they approached the walk, probably to hide his gun, Callie thought, glancing at him. With the way he'd trussed her up for that club, it did conceivably look as if the two of them were out on a date. Although that didn't explain her using the cab or all of the damage to the car, either. It occurred to her, perhaps for the millionth time, that this was totally insane. Her hand went to the screen door, familiarity only mildly soothing her nerves, and she slipped her key into the lock on the doorknob. The wooden door opened and she leaned around it, calling softly, \"Dad?\" \"In here!\" came the reply from the living room. Within seconds, before Vincent could close the doors behind him, Callie's father, Raymond Fanning, Sr., was standing in the small dining room that connected the kitchen and the living room, wrapped in his robe. He looked mildly started to see that his daughter wasn't alone, but he recovered quickly when Callie approached him confidently, wrapping herself in his arms for a warm hug. \"Hi, Daddy,\" she whispered. Ray Sr. kissed her cheek and smiled down at her before politely turning to Vincent. \"You brought a friend?\" \"Yeah, this is…this is Vincent,\" she said, letting her awkwardness play in her favor. She looked bashfully up at her father. \"We're, uh…sort of…dating.\" \"Sort of dating, or are dating?\" Ray Sr. asked, turning smiling eyes to Vincent and extending his hand. \"Raymond Fanning, nice to meet you Vincent.\" \"Likewise,\" Vincent said, and Callie noted the guarded look on Vincent's face as he took her father in. \"I had a little bang up with the cab,\" Callie said, rushing on as if she were embarrassed by the whole thing. \"I called Vincent to help me…Ray's busy and I wasn't sure if you were up, so he came down and rescued me.\" \"I thought I saw something funny about the cab,\" Ray Sr. said, frowning as he glanced out the back window again. \"What did you do, hit a deer?\" \"Yeah, who would have thought you'd find deer in South Central?\" \"Oh, hell, I'm surprised you didn't hit a bear or a coyote, but I know there are some deer out there too. Why are you still driving it, though? Shouldn't you have taken it back to the barn?\" At this point, Vincent stepped in. \"Well, Callie was worried about her boss giving her hell over the damages. We were driving it around to make sure everything still worked okay.\" Ray Sr. squeezed his daughter's shoulder. \"What, Callie let her boss push her around? You haven't known my daughter too long, have you?\" But his smile was gentle, teasing. Vincent's gaze drifted to Callie. To her father, it just seemed affectionate. The intensity of the look made Callie's breath catch for a moment. \"Well, we're still getting to know each other.\" \"I wanted you to meet him,\" Callie interjected, just to put the finishing touches on the lie. She squeezed her arm around her father's waist. \"I'm sorry I've been keeping it from you guys, I've just been so busy lately—\" \"No, sweetie, don't sweat it.\" Ray Sr. made a motion with his head to indicate they follow him into the dining room. \"Come on, let's sit down and talk, get to know each other. I'll make us a snack. You hungry, Vincent?\" \"Famished,\" Vincent replied with his most cordial smile. 8888888888 One of Ray Sr.'s talents was the art of sandwich making. Vincent watched as the man stacked everything carefully, laid out the sliced onions, the lettuce, the butter pickles and then spread equal parts mustard and mayonnaise over the top layer of bread, where it would touch the meat. Cheese was placed between the pieces of roast beef and sliced chicken, one Swiss and another darker, looked like a mild cheddar. Then he cut it, corner to corner in both directions, and pinned it through with toothpicks, just like a restaurant, and served it with some chips from a bag on the top of the fridge. He hesitated to dig in. Vincent wasn't much of an eater when he was on the job. Hunger was one of those alien sensations to him, like remorse and lust. He glanced over at Callie. He'd hit two out of three that night, might as well go for broke. She was already eating, devouring her sandwich with a ravenous appetite that belied her situation. People were strange in situations of stress. Some lost all appetite and some buckled down like pigs in their slop bins. Although she was considerably neater. They chatted. It was light, friendly banter, with Ray Sr. asking him what he did. Vincent talked about how he was a private consultant, that he spent a lot of time traveling, and made up something about meeting Callie on campus, where he was doing a part-time teaching job, passing on some of what he knew. \"That's rough, traveling all the time,\" Ray Sr. said. \"You like it?\" \"It's all right,\" Vincent replied. \"Some places are nicer than others.\" \"Vincent's not an L.A. fan,\" Callie murmured, finishing her glass of soda. Ray Sr.'s eyebrow arched. \"Well, it's not for everybody, Cal. I'm personally thrilled I live all the way out here. Where I can see the city lights without drowning in them. When I was younger I had to travel, leave Callie and her brother and mother for a week on end at times. I always hated it. I guess it's easier on single people.\" \"Yeah,\" Vincent said in a low voice. He caught Callie rubbing her eyes, saw the tiredness in her jaw. Her father was much quicker, though. \"You want to lie down for a bit, sweetie?\" he said, placing a comforting arm on her shoulder. \"You've had a rough night, with this accident and all.\" Callie managed to suppress most of a rather bitter, ironic laugh. \"No, Dad, I pass out and I'm done for at least a few hours, and Vincent's taking time from his very busy schedule to help me out.\" She cast him a look. \"I don't want to keep him too long. But the snack was great, I feel recharged.\" \"You didn't eat dinner again, did you?\" Ray Sr. sighed at Callie's sudden look. \"You don't take care of yourself, Callie! I've told you again and again that a body needs energy. I don't care about this getting thin nonsense. You mess up your metabolism and you certainly won't lose any weight, anyway!\" \"I'm not trying to lose weight,\" Callie said, fidgeting. \"I just get…caught up in stuff.\" Ray Sr. turned to Vincent. \"Contrary to modern society,\" he said, addressing whom he thought was Callie's potential suitor, \"I don't believe in all this being skinny as a twig. Callie's mother wasn't skinny, she had curves where a woman needs curves.\" \"Dad,\" Callie grunted, getting up and putting her plate in the sink. She started to rummage through cabinets at this point, almost nervously. \"All this pressure to look a certain way, act a certain way. Your mother would roll over in her grave if she knew you were starving yourself!\" \"I'm not starving myself!\" Callie said, bending down and managing to find a back of chocolate chips. \"Look, see, chocolate, I'm going to stuff my face! Happy?\" Vincent smirked. It was echoed by Ray Sr.'s amused harrumph. \"Now, don't get carried away in the other direction.\" Callie just gave him a completely flustered look and shoved a handful of chocolate into her mouth. Ray Sr. turned to Vincent. \"You know, I'm not going to totally embarrass Callie by asking you if you're one of those guys that insists on girls being skinny as rails—\" \"I'm not,\" Vincent said, with the kind of level-headedness that utterly convinced Ray Sr. within seconds. \"I promise.\" \"Good. You want some coffee? You need any more caffeine to get you through the night? I'm making some for Callie, she always needs at least a liter of it before she goes back out the door. Did you bring your thermos, Cal?\" Callie had finished her temporary chocolate attack and was rolling the bag back together and rubber-banding it. \"No, I forgot it in the car, Dad. I can go get it—\" Vincent jumped, ever so slightly. Just a quick jerk of his eyes toward her, showing her his displeasure at this plan. She understood, instantly, and amended, \"No, wait…oh, hell, I left it at home. I didn't get to dishes last night and it's in the sink, dirty.\" \"No problem, you can borrow mine. I'm not taking it anywhere, anyway.\" He started to get the coffee maker ready, opening up a glass container of ground coffee beans and pouring a healthy amount into a filter, then slapping everything in place and getting the concoction started. \"Why don't we go sit in the living room? It's more comfortable. Callie, I still think you should put your head down for a minute. You used to do those power naps, remember? They always helped you.\" Callie was cleaning melted chocolate off her fingers. \"Yeah, I guess I can try that,\" she murmured, not convincingly. She shot Vincent a nervous glance as the man stood up and watched Ray Sr. retreat into the living room, expecting his guests to follow. He motioned with his hand, and she scooted out in front of him. \"You're fine,\" he whispered so only she would hear. \"Just keep it cool.\" The living room was cozy, as all rooms in California had a tendency to be. There was an old barkalounger in one corner, obviously the prized seat in the house, and a small overstuffed couch against one wall. The television was on the other side, and the rest of the room was taken over by pictures Vincent's eyes couldn't help but roam to them. They covered the walls, sometimes in single sets, sometimes hung in group frames, smaller pictures peeking out from different shapes in the lining of the frame. Pictures of a family's life. It gave him pause. He watched as Ray Sr. made himself comfortable in his chair, and Callie sunk into the corner of the couch closest to him, familiar, trusting. And for the second time that night, he had a very uneasy feeling. This man was not the kind to reject his children. This man was not the kind to ever raise his hand in anger and smack his daughter or his son across the face. It was envy, Vincent suddenly realized. Envy for this father who was so much of what he should be. Callie's nervous expression didn't hold for long. In her secure position at her father's feet, there was a relaxation there that seemed to surround her like an aura, as if there she couldn't be touched, that there wasn't anything anyone could do to harm her, least of all Vincent, while she was there. Her body language screamed of trust, cried out that even in this crisis she endured, sitting here, by her father, was a reassurance that was so soothing, it was almost as if her father could actually protect her from anything. He wanted to feel the cruel irony of that situation. He wanted to relish the fact that he could easily kill them both, right this second, and not bat an eye. That if he demanded it, he could submit her to the most humiliating of situations, right there for her father to watch, and there wasn't a damn thing the old man could do about it. Those thoughts did not appeal to him. Instead, they nauseated him. As Ray Sr., in an unconscious gesture of affection, reached over and ruffled Callie's hair, Vincent could almost believe that this was a safe place, that maybe it was the sort of place he wanted, that he had always wanted. But no. This night was far from over. Three down, two to go. Callie glanced up, seeing that Vincent was hovering in the doorway, not quite at his ease. He knew she was looking at him, and even let her stand up, trying to pry her away from that ease she had suddenly picked up. \"Daddy, I think we need to go,\" Callie said, when Ray Sr. noticed her move. \"Vincent's got to get back, and I should finish my shift. I'll come by tomorrow afternoon, we can have lunch, okay?\" Her voice trembled slightly over the last words. Vincent's eyes inadvertently went to the pictures, stepping closer to them. \"We still have a few minutes,\" he heard himself saying. \"Is this your mother?\" He pointed to the picture of a dark-haired woman, large brown eyes, full lips, having a definite Greek air about her. It was her wedding picture, and her dress was a bit much, all ruffles and lace, but she seemed happy, and so very, very young. \"Yes,\" Callie said. \"That's her wedding portrait. That's one of her taken closer to when she…when she died.\" Vincent turned his eyes to a group of pictures. It was from a Christmas holiday, Mom in the kitchen, family opening presents, sitting around the table. The picture was such a collage of perfection that for a moment, Vincent felt as it someone had struck him directly in the gut. It wasn't like he hadn't seen facsimiles of perfection before, but none of them had seemed so real. Callie was in a few of the pictures, a spindly girl of thirteen or fourteen, braces and pony-tails, all legs and no chest. She had her arms around her mother in one picture, which was surprising considering she was just at the age where she should be starting to push her family away in the adolescent search for independence. Instead, her arms were wrapped firmly around her mother's waist, and her chin was resting on her mother's shoulder, and the two were both beaming, wearing matching sweaters that might have been gifts on that very day. Callie chuckled in the back of her throat. \"Oh, God, Dad, I'd almost forgotten about that one,\" she said, pointing to it. \"That was such a joke. My Aunt Carolyn thought it would be funny to buy me and my mother matching sweaters the year before,\" she told Vincent. \"And so we put them on and said that each year we would take a picture in them, and send it to Aunt Carolyn to remind her of her faux-poi. (sp?)\" She paused, a breath of pain in her throat. \"This was the only year we were able to do it.\" Vincent nodded, glancing at Callie. Then his eyes drifted to Ray Sr., who had turned on the television, and was absently flipping the dial. When he turned back, as Callie went to get her coat, his eyes met Vincent's. \"She and her mother were very close,\" he said in a low voice, so only Vincent would hear. \"It's hard for her to talk about her.\" Vincent just nodded in understanding. And felt yet another strange, peculiar feeling. As if he understood exactly how Callie felt. He had never understood how anyone felt before. It just hadn't been important. Suddenly uncomfortable in that stifling house, he shook Ray Sr.'s hand goodnight and managed to get Callie out into the driveway. Just being outside was a good change. He followed Callie to the car, and they rounded the corner, disappearing from the view of the house. \"Callie,\" he said. \"Wait.\"[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: Don't own Collateral, and I don't own the song that I named this chapter for. Although I was listening to it pretty heavily while I was conceiving this fic. Thanks for the nice comments from the reviewers, both about this story and about Purity , which I think really should have been named Fearless , but it's too late to change it now. And to answer a question I was asked about Colin Farrell: One of his first big-budget movie roles was playing Det. Danny Whitwer, Tom's character's nemesis in the movie Minority Report , not one of Tom's best flicks, but very good to Colin. I love Colin Farrell (as an actor and a looker) so my comment wasn't supposed to be negative toward him in any way, just amused. P.S. This chapter is slightly shorter than the previous ones, but it's packed with angst so I hope you enjoy it. Chapter Six: I Dare You To Move (A half-hour ago) Ray was having a difficult night. It wasn't so much that it was a bad night, but it was definitely not one of his best. That was the way of being a cop, though. You were only really busy when things were going very, very wrong. Ramón was supposed to have shown up at their meeting place, and an hour passed with no Ramón in sight. So Ray rolled to his apartment, and found him shot dead in the middle of his living room floor, Chinese food flung all over the place, staining the cheap tile with the thick, dark sauce that had dried into the color of blood. One in the head, two in the chest. This was a professional hit, the corner said. Ray went to the hospital, to the morgue, for the official report. Danny was there, on shift as usual. The two of them knew each other on and off, and Danny fancied himself to be a bit of a detective. He was actually pretty good at it, too. Then, things had gone from bad to worse. Sylvester Clark had come in, not twenty minutes later, just as Ray was about to leave, about to go shake up some people that he knew were part of Ramón's regular routine, see who had talked to him last, who could have hit him so professionally. Street punks didn't shoot in such tight groups, Danny pointed out. The shots were mere millimeters apart in the chest. Sylvester Clark had the exact same wound pattern. Ray called Richard. Richard wasn't a bad cop, not by any stretch of the imagination, but he was a bit lazy, as most cops were. Ray looked street, but he was by the book. Richard looked by the book, but he was street. It was a fitting complimentary relationship, in spite of the fact that the two of them had a tendency to bash heads like the best of headbangers. Richard was sleeping. \"Yeah?\" he said, his voice fuzzy. \"Yeah, I'm down here in the morgue, Sisters of Charity, and you'll never guess who they just rolled into the meat locker.\" More awake now. \"Who?\" \"Sylvester Clark, criminal attorney turned lawyer criminal. And he has the same wound pattern as Ramón, whom he represented. There's something going on.\" \"Both done by the same shooter?\" \"I think we're looking at a highly paid assassin. Only question is, why?\" \"Felix Reyes-Torena,\" Richard said. \"Do the Feds know about this?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"Well, we can go tell them, but you know they're just going to take our stuff and use it to build their own case.\" \"What, so we shouldn't tell them?\" \"I just know how excited you get, Ray.\" \"Fuck you.\" \"I love you too. Listen, stay on your cell, I'll make the calls and hook up with you in a half-hour.\" \"Good.\" He hung up. If his C.I. flew out a window with Felix's handprints on it, fuck the Feds—that made it HIS. And if that meant Sylvester Clark, too, so be it. L.A.P.D. didn't work for the Feebs, as they were not-so-affectionately called. He left the hospital, picked up his cell-phone, pressed the number 3 where Callie's phone was sure to go off. He'd made damn sure that they all had the best cellular network money could buy. \"Hey, Ray,\" she said, seeing his ID pop up in the window. There was something…off about her voice. But with the night he was having, he could just be getting paranoid. \"Callie, what's going on? You really busy?\" \"Yeah, it's been a crazy night,\" she said, her mouth straying from the phone for a moment, causing it to fade slightly. \"What is it?\" He drew a breath. God, he needed her not to give him any sass, he wasn't sure how he'd react at the moment, and he hated yelling at her. \"Well, I know we already had this discussion \" \"That's never stopped you before.\" \"I really want you to go over and visit dad,\" Ray said. \"Not this again,\" she sighed, wearily. Ray winced. \"Callie, he's having a rough night. His insomnia is really bad; he needs some company. I would go over in a heartbeat, but I stumbled into a crime scene about an hour ago and now I'm getting dragged all over town.\" \"Crime scene?\" There was a sudden interest in her voice, not something uncommon. She had cop tendencies, she was studying criminology, but hell he wished she would find another line of work. \"What's going on?\" \"Same old bullshit in L.A., really,\" Ray said, \"but one of my leaks got shot, and supposedly one of his higher-ups is dead, too. I'm bogged down, I'll be lucky to get off shift three hours late. Come on, Cal, drop off your fare and head on over, five minutes. I'll really owe you.\" There was a pause. A sigh. And then, he swore he could just pick up the faintest traces of sound. If she was driving then she probably had a fare in the back seat, but the sound of the weather, the cold evening wind, was too clear, she might be outside. Someone was talking to her, he couldn't make out a single word. Then, she said, guardedly, \"I'll see. But I can't promise.\" He decided to let it go, relieved that she was being that cooperative, at least. \"That's enough,\" Ray said, \"Love you. Thanks.\" \"Love you too.\" She hung up the phone, more abruptly than usual. Ray knew she was mad at him but he'd make it up to her. After all, she was the closest thing to Mom he had, and he'd die before he let anything happen to her. 8888888888 (Now) \"Callie,\" Vincent said, outside of her father's house, \"wait.\" She stopped at the trunk of her car. She looked stiffly over her shoulder, not quite sure what to think. In a way, she was relieved to be out of her father's house, to have her father out of danger. It had not escaped her for a single moment what Vincent was capable of, and how he was watching her. She played as if nothing was wrong, determined to protect her father; now it was over, and she was glad. Then again, she was also furious. Because now, standing out there with him, in the cold night California air, outside of her house, her shield, her protection, she was at his mercy, and she loathed him for it. He closed some of the distance between him. His eyes were distant, gazing off down the driveway, toward the sparkling view that could be seen just above the treeline. \"What?\" she asked, keeping the snip out of her voice. She folded her arms, realized that she was still in that silly thin tank that Vincent had made her strip down to before going into that club. She decided to use her nervous energy to button up her coat, making sure all the snaps were tightly in place. He stepped around her, and went and leaned against the car. \"You come visit your father every night?\" \"We have a routine,\" she said, her discomfort shifting, but not decreasing. \"Why don't you live with him anymore?\" She started. It wasn't any of his business, but now her psychological skills were starting to kick back in. The shock and fear was slowly starting to pass and her brain could unclench and think for a change. \"Well, I guess like any red-blooded American young adult, I wanted some independence.\" Vincent cast her a sideglance before his eyes went back to the dark horizon. \"But you don't really have it, do you?\" She folded her arms, more to protect herself from the steadily increasing chill than in defiance. \"Well, I guess nobody really does. But living on my own is nice. I like it. I can do what I want, go where I was…most of the time,\" she added, with a bit of an edge. \"I don't have to worry about bothering him.\" \"But you do,\" Vincent said, now fully turning his face to her. \"Because you care about him.\" She frowned slightly. There was something there, something she couldn't quite pinpoint. There was a kind of disconnectedness in his expression, as if neurons were firing and trying to meet, but kept missing. There was something that was baffling him. \"Of course I do,\" she said slowly. \"He's my dad. I love him.\" Vincent nodded, looked down. \"What about your mother?\" \"Well, Mom's been gone for a while. I always was mostly a daddy's girl, anyway.\" Vincent chuckled lightly. \"I've always been curious about that expression.\" \"You've never known a daddy's girl before?\" \"What does it mean?\" This puzzled her. His question was so simple, like a child asking what clouds were made of, that she was thrown. \"Well, basically, it means that my father spoiled me, he was the good parent for me. Not that he played favorites, but I sort of favored him over Mom.\" \"So you put him before your mom.\" A sudden tightness there. \"Your Mom, who carried you in her womb for nine months.\" \"Oh, don't get me wrong,\" she said quickly. \"I loved my Mom, too. But, well, there's something about losing a parent during adolescence. It has certain repercussions. I sort of got pushed closer to my dad, him being my only surviving parent, and it made us a lot closer. But yeah, it was mostly like that when I was a little kid, too. Mom was constantly on him for being too soft with me.\" \"You remember your mother?\" Softer now, more innocent. She could hardly believe this was the same man she'd watched gun down two punks in an alley, all within a few seconds. \"What was she like?\" \"What's anybody's mother like?\" Callie said absently, not quite thinking about her words. \"She was more laid back than my dad, my dad's a fusser. But when it came to raising children, my mother had systems, psychology, she knew exactly how to put us in our places when we got mouthy. Mom wasn't somebody you wanted to mess with, that was for sure.\" \"Did she ever…hit you?\" \"No, Dad was the one with the belt. Mom wouldn't do it. She did so many other things that when it came to the rare occasions of corporeal punishment, she made my dad step up. But hitting wasn't something that happened too often after we got out of our elementary years. Except for the occasional tap on the cheek when I was disrespectful.\" She stepped closer to him as she talked, amazed at how intently he was drinking all of this information in. As if she were giving him the answers to life, the universe, and everything. \"Why do you want to know all of this, Vincent?\" she asked, whispering so that the words couldn't possibly sound abrasive. He looked away, and she noticed that his face had turned to a strange sort of pale, with bright patches of red here and there. The lines in his features were much deeper in the distorted, shadowy light, and she couldn't quite see his eyes anymore. Except that they looked very sad. \"I envy you,\" he whispered. For several moments, she found she couldn't breathe. That he would say such a thing, such a vulnerable thing in such a situation, was enough to completely throw her. So she stayed silent. \"You have so much,\" he went on. \"At least you knew your mother.\" She drew a deep breath before asking the inevitable question. \"What about your father?\" The question was like a sudden jolt of electricity, the way it ran through his body. He seemed to try to shake it out at the other end, but it wouldn't go. \"No, my dad…didn't have much to do with me. Well, when he wasn't drunk or beating me up, anyway. I spent a lot of time in foster homes.\" She made a silent \"O\" with her lips, unsure if she should apologize, as was the polite reaction, or if she should press on, if maybe he wanted to talk about it more, but needed to be drawn out. Looking at the Teflon steel man in front of her, she wondered how she could imagine such a thing. Yet here it was, plain as the sun in the middle of the night. He lifted the arm closest to her, and she stayed still long enough to let him touch her, his fingers gently wrapping around her upper arm. He pulled her closer, applying only the slightest pressure. She could have been knocked over with a literal feather at that moment, most likely. \"But you,\" he whispered, as her face drew closer to hers, \"you have something so beautiful.\" \"Everybody else's grass always looks greener,\" she attempted, but it was a pathetic one at that. \"Only in your case, the grass is actually green.\" Vincent paused, thoughtful. \"What if it was true?\" he said. \"What if what was true?\" \"That we were dating, and that you brought me home tonight to meet your father. Did he like me? Would he think I was suitable?\" At the look she gave him, he amended, \"I mean, taking out the…obvious.\" Swallowing, knowing this was impossible, she carefully picked her answer. \"He seemed to like you well enough, Vincent. You were very polite.\" \"Yeah, but would we get along?\" Vincent pressed. \"Like family?\" Shaking her head, she attempted to put a few more inches of air between them. \"I don't know, Vincent. It's been a very difficult—\" He reached out with the other hand and firmly drew her to him, so that she stood between his legs, which were parted slightly to get her closer. Their faces were inches apart. \"You know, I'd almost hoped you'd be an unappreciative brat,\" he murmured. \"Complain about your parents even though they're saints. But you don't. I'll be every night when you pray, you pray to your mother to watch over your father. I'll bet you're keenly aware of how much he misses her, and yet love him all the more for staying with you.\" \"You talk about me like I'm special,\" she said. \"I'm just someone who's mature enough to appreciate her parents.\" \"Which makes you probably the most well-adjusted person I've ever known,\" Vincent said. And then, after a beat, he kissed her. Again. 8888888888 The motion of Vincent's lips on hers was so quick that it took her by surprise for a moment. It wasn't really a full kiss, she realized, when she pushed him away. His mouth had been open, and had gently rested on the corner of hers, fully expecting her to kiss him back. The surprise and – was it? – hurt on his face threw her, and she wasn't quite sure what to do for another second. Surely he couldn't be serious. His face, which had been so cold for most of the night, shifted slightly. The way he stared at her, as if he were sizing her up, had now become a careful scrutiny of her expression, trying to read her. For a moment, she felt an embarrassing flush of shame – the only other time in her life she had ever been looked at like that was when she had upset her father, which was rare, and he was more hurt than angry at her behavior, that she would treat him, him , that way of all people. Then, he stepped close to her again, his face gentling a bit, but a glint of malice in those strange green eyes. \"Your father might be watching us,\" he said, so softly that it was more of a breath than a whisper. \"You wouldn't want him to think anything was wrong, would you? You wouldn't want him to come out here, thinking you might be in danger, and then wind up getting hurt himself, would you?\" Her teeth clenched together behind her closed lips. Vincent did not miss the tightening her jaw and instantly regretted his words, and then hated himself for regretting them. He did not regret. He was indifferent . But this , a small, barely audible voice inside his head said to him, is a new low . Ignoring it, he pulled her back to him, gently, wanting to do something to get her to unclench. His hands found her hips and slipped under the waist of her coat, feeling her warmth underneath radiating from the thin silkiness of her coat. She looked away. Her revulsion came off her in waves, her anger making her eyes terribly dark. He opened his mouth. \"I'm…\" I'm what , I'm sorry ? Yes, that's the only way to reach her now, apologize, suck it up and apologize. It'll be even better if you let her see how hard it is. \"I'm sorry, Callie,\" he said. \"Really.\" Her eyes darted back up to his, guarded, lips still pursed in anger. The muscles in his face were twitching now, just barely underneath the surface. He tried to cover it up by turning his head, wiggling his jaw, but she saw it. Her eyebrows twitched a little, smoothing over her expression just the tiniest bit. He moved his hands down to the jean-clad hips, out of the warmth of her jacket. He was careful not to make his touch too intimate now, he had her on the ropes and one slip would lose her again. \"I'm just not,\" he went on, \"I'm just not used to…I don't know. Seeing normal people. I don't even think I know what normal is.\" What the hell are you talking about? More softening. There was no warmth in her eyes, but she didn't seem as angry to him anymore. \"You're so used to manipulating people,\" she said, her voice thin and fragile, \"you don't have any idea how to carry a normal conversation, do you?\" \"I don't know if I'd go that far,\" he said with a mild grin. \"You and I weren't doing so bad at the beginning of the night.\" He paused, considering her. Carefully, carefully . \"You know, when you picked me up, you said something about a guy named Max. Was that the driver in front of us?\" Puzzled, she frowned. \"Yeah?\" \"So technically, since he was first in line, I was supposed to get into his cab, right?\" Ah ha . Hit home. She almost seemed to wilt, as if he'd struck her. \"Well, you're the customer, you do whatever the damn hell you want,\" she managed. \"Yeah, but courtesy and all of that, the unspoken bond between cab drivers not stealing each other's fares. Yet you took me anyway.\" He raised one eyebrow slightly. \"Why?\" Her cheeks were starting to turn red. Almost imperceptibly, he moved his hands up, just at the edge of the warmth. \"I…I don't know. Max owes me a few favors anyway; I didn't think he'd care. Besides, I was bored, just sitting there.\" He made a slight clicking sound with his tongue. \"Surely your father taught you that it's bad to lie.\" Full on scarlet stained her cheeks now. Her eyes had gone hazy, distant, a desperate attempt to escape the stress of the situation. Using the opportunity, he lifted one hand to the snaps on her jacket. His knuckles pressed ever so gently against her breast through the denim. \"You were attracted to me?\" he whispered, ruffling the thin hairs around her ear. She shivered as one snap came undone. \"Never trust your first impression,\" she muttered. Humor was the last defense. He slipped two fingers into her jacket as he undid the next snap. She wasn't pulling away. \"Oh, always trust your first impression,\" Vincent smiled. \"Maybe I went with you because I thought the same thing.\" Confusion fluttered all across her face. He had her on the ropes and he just kept yanking her around. In a few more minutes she was going to be helpless. He made himself stay focused and slow as he undid the snaps, one by one, and watched as she struggled to think. When his hands finally slipped inside, caressing her curves, reaching up and finding her breasts, her eyes shut and she was almost scowling with the effort that took. He shifted his weight, his fingers enjoying the softness of her body and the slinky sensation of the shirt, as he pulled her farther and farther into his grip. Soon, her face was resting against his, the bridge of his nose pressed against her forehead, so he had a front row view to her face and how she was fighting back against her attraction. It was so amusing, how the human body could rebel so completely against the mind and the heart. As a finishing touch, he rolled his thumbs slowly around her nipples, feeling them harden through her clothing. She sucked in a breath, opened her eyes. She seemed to remember where she was, and her face flushed so dark, in the shadows it was nearly black. As if the effort took every ounce of strength she had, she lifted her hands and placed them on his elbows, and pushed his hands away, getting a single inch of air between them. She pulled her chin back and met his eyes, her own still glazed, but just starting to clear. \"No,\" she said. \"No, stop.\" Simple words, put in a simple, civilized tone. How could he deny that request? How could he honor it? That was when he realized that he didn't have as much control over himself as he thought. It took tremendous effort for him to put the next inch between them. Shaking himself, he withdrew completely, looked away, back toward the sparkling horizon. She was breathing heavily. Her mouth was dry and she was swallowing, trying to remoisten it. She pulled her coat closed but didn't snap it shut this time. \"We need to go,\" Vincent said. \"Stop number four awaits.\"[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: Don't own Collateral, but I did watch the extra scene, which wasn't all that much to shout about. Michael Mann is very conservative with his scenes, isn't he? That guy puts film together like a surgeon…too bad he killed off a perfectly good character in a rather cheap death! (SIGH) Anyway, this chapter comes a lot from the extra scene, and from the earlier scene with the two cops. Thought I'd forgotten about that scene, huh? Well, pretty much everything from the movie is going to find its way into this story one way or another. Special thanks to Piper (Winged Seraph—what happened to Plan B? It got taken down, and I was enjoying it! We can't afford to lose a good Collateral fanfic, girl! Get it fixed and back up there!), Dawnie-7 (been with me a while, girl, where would I be without you?), asd (don't know your real name, but your comments are appreciated, even if they're brief) and my new reader, Hockey-Gurl (don't worry about not reading this fic before, it had been lost amidst the sea of Misc. fiction before the Collateral category was posted and I didn't want to move it until I could resume it) As for the rest of youI know you're out there! Leave me a note! (Especially YOU, Eccentric Banshee , after all the grumbling you did! LOL) Chapter Seven: Don't Let Me Get Cornered \"So what did you get on Clark?\" Ray Fanning asked as he tossed down onto his desk chair in the busy room. The two officers who had gone over the crime scene started to flip out their notebooks, one of them cooperative, the other having a slight attitude, as most men did when they were a little too old to be wearing the uniform and yet hadn't gotten their shiny detective's star. The younger, more cooperative one, started to read. \"Shots were heard fired at approximately 11:07 p.m. One witness saw a taxi parked in the alley right before it happened. Another witness claims to have seen a man and a woman arguing briefly before the cab left the alley. The man was standing outside the cab, as if he were leaning into the driver's window. Then he got into the back and the car took off.\" \"Did this witness get a good look at the man or woman?\" Ray asked. The younger man turned to his older partner. The other shrugged. \"Says the woman was mostly in shadow. Thought she was wearing a hat.\" Ray felt a strange, prickling sensation in the back of his neck. \"Was she younger, older, what?\" The cop shook his head. \"Couldn't say. The man was a gray blur. This guy didn't exactly have the best vision – glasses like coke bottles.\" \"They weren't that thick,\" the younger man said, earning him a dirty look from his partner. \"A gray blur?\" Ray pressed. \"You mean he was dressed in gray?\" \"And had gray hair, too,\" the younger cop supplied from his notes. \"Gray head to toe. Thought he might be an old man who was hassling a driver.\" \"Well, we're not here to conjecture,\" Ray muttered, the tingling in his spine getting worse. \"No, that's your job,\" the older cop muttered briefly. Ray ignored it. Richard came into the office. \"Let's roll,\" he said. \"I got the stake out on Felix, we're gonna go talk to the Feds.\" This earned an even more bitter guffaw from the older cop. \"Yeah, go talk to the Feebs, they's smarter than us anyway.\" Ray shot him a perplexed look before he followed Richard out the door. 8888888888 When Ray entered the abandoned restaurant that the Feebs were using to spy on Felix Reyes-Torena, he had a particular feeling. Not one of premonition or something equal nonsensical, but as if he were stepping through a door that would forever change his life. The introductions were made. Agent Frank Pedrosa wasn't thrilled to see them. It was apparent that he'd been instructed to help them, but he wasn't doing it willingly. Questioned were asked. Vague questions, Ray had to admit, but the guy had an attitude and he wasn't going to give anything away. Pedrosa gave an equally vague answer. No help. Dead ends. Ray chuckled slightly, looked away. Richard, the smarter one when it came to public relations, started to talk. He mentioned the names Sylvester Clark and Ramón Iella, and Pedrosa came to life as if someone had just hooked him up to a car battery. \"Are you telling me that Clark and Iella were both killed tonight? Murdered ?\" \"Apparently by someone who's quite professional with a gun,\" Ray said, unable to keep the smugness out of his voice . It's our case, guys, drool all you want but you can't have it . There was a phone call on Richard's cell, disabling the man's ability to converse for a moment. Pedrosa had started to grill Ray about the condition of Ramón's apartment, how he had found him, if anyone had seen anything. No one had even known anything was going on. The closest information anyone could give was that at about that time, someone had seen a taxi sitting in the alley. A taxi. There was that feeling again. \"Ok,\" Richard said, hanging up his phone, \"that was a call reporting another dead body, same wound pattern, a Daniel Baker?\" \"That's three,\" Pedrosa said, turning to the younger woman who had been identified only as Zee. \"Three what?\" Ray asked dumbly. \"Witnesses,\" Pedrosa replied, forgetting all the previous hostility and vague words. His eyes brightened and he looked nearly grateful. For a moment he almost seemed ready to hug both Ray and his partner. \"We've got to get to the last one,\" Zee said, picking up her phone. She started making calls. \"What? Who?\" Ray demanded, using the opening he had. Pedrosa seemed willing to talk now. \"Peter Lim, the last State Witness in our Felix Reyes-Torena indictment. We have to get him to a secure location.\" \"How do you know the guy is even—\" Ray stopped himself, forcing himself to calm down. \"Look, to do that, you're going to need help.\" Pedrosa had already picked up his coat and the whole team was moving out of the small, caged area where they had set up camp. The monitoring screens were abandoned, forgotten, as they moved the whole party through the empty entrails of the restaurant and headed for the parking lot. \"You don't even know who this guy is!\" Ray was arguing, even as Richard dogged his heels, trying to get him to shut up. \"For all you know, he could already have taken down Lim and be on his way out of town!\" \"That's a chance we'll have to take,\" Pedrosa snapped. \"What other choice do we have?\" \"Wherever Lim is, move your stake-out,\" Ray said. \"Flush out this guy.\" Pedrosa nearly laughed, shook his head. \"Ain't gonna work, my friend. The guy they hired to do these hits is a very highly trained professional. He's not going to let himself get caught. And we can't risk our final witness on something like that.\" \"What, a real meat-eater super assassin's got you scared? What if he's already there when you reach Peter Lim? What are you going to do?\" \"Take his ass down and save our witness,\" Pedrosa replied bluntly. They were packing up their car, and had forgotten about both the L.A.P.D. detectives by then, and Ray found himself standing in an empty lot with Richard. \"I don't like this,\" Ray said. \"'Course you don't,\" Richard replied, bored. \"Happened just like I said it would.\" Ray turned to him, his eyes wide. \"Look, I'm…\" He hesitated, considered his words. Richard was going to think he was a fool, but he couldn't risk it. \"Look, both times, they saw a taxi leave the crime scene.\" \"Yeah?\" \"And the second time, a man and a woman were arguing. It was a woman driving the cab, and she was wearing a hat.\" Richard studied him. \"Ray, not every hat-wearing female taxi driver in L.A. is your sister.\" Ray struggled to keep calm. \"I just can't leave this alone. I'm going to follow.\" He looked at Richard, looked past the neat appearance, past the lazy cop, and searched for a man who was, occasionally, his friend. \"Will you watch my back, or do I have to do this alone?\" Richard considered for a moment, then let out a deep, heavy sigh. \"I'm going to go, just to show you that you're wrong. And when I do show you that you're wrong, you are going to owe me a serious amount of beer the next time we're off shift together.\" Ray almost smiled. Almost. 8888888888 They had left the suburbs and were finally back on the main drags through town. In the silence of the car, Callie found herself staring through the windshield. The shattered windshield that looked like a spider web of glass. On top of that, the side window had been broken, so now all she could hear was a roaring in her ears from the wind that whipped past them, and she was particularly irritated about how it kept messing up her hair, which had, once upon a time, been in a neat braid, but Vincent had taken it down. Aggravated, no, beyond aggravated, more into full-on, pissed-off mode, she was going perhaps a tad bit faster than was wise. \"Where are we going?\" she asked when she finally hit a stop-light and could hear herself speak. \"You didn't hear me before?\" Vincent asked, his voice sounding distant from the back seat. \"No, I can't hear shit because those punks broke my window,\" Callie snapped. \"Koreatown, a club called Fever, you know it?\" She sighed. \"Yeah.\" The light changed, she pressed the accelerator. And then heard the sound of a siren behind them. Instantly, everything froze. She pulled up to the curve on automatic, her hands starting to shake, her belly queasy and her throat constricting. It had only been a matter of time, her driving around with this shattered windshield. Lenny was going to kill her, if Vincent didn't do it first. \"Get rid of them,\" came Vincent again, terse, commanding. \"It's the L.A.P.D.,\" she managed. \"What do you suggest I do?\" \"Be creative,\" Vincent returned. \"You're a cabbie, you're a girl, talk your way out of a ticket.\" She scowled at the second reference. Oh hell, her poor body couldn't take any more adrenaline. She could hardly think as it was. She felt…high, exactly, that was it, high, like she'd smoked twenty joints and then washed them down with a bottle of vodka. She hadn't been in this bad a shape since her twenty-second birthday, because she'd missed out on really getting to celebrate her twenty-first. When she came down, God knew what was going to happen… Vincent was looking around, watching the cops get closer. She snuck a glance at him in the rearview, saw the tense expression on his face. \"Look,\" she said, pushing through the chemical haze, \"just don't…don't do anything, okay, let me do this.\" \"Then don't let me get cornered,\" he replied. \"You don't have the trunk space.\" She felt the world swim. Then it exploded back into focus when the cop on her passenger's side tapped on the window. She rolled it down. \"Hey, my partner's going to help you out over there,\" the guy said, pointing. Callie knew it was a standard diversionary tactic, just to be prepared in case the driver was a threat. Her conversations with Ray had a tendency to come in handy now and again. She turned the other way to see the second one, this one a woman, Latino and very pretty with a stern face, dark hair pulled severely back, approach with her flashlight dipping into the car. \"License and registration please,\" she said, her tone flat, formal. Callie automatically reached up and pulled both these items out of their flap underneath her visor, always ready for an emergency. The woman took them, looked at them carefully. \"I'm pulling you over because your windshield is smashed and your cab in unsafe to drive,\" she went on, meeting Callie's eyes this time. Callie nodded, squinting in the beam of the flashlight. \"I was on my way back to the barn, officer, right now,\" she said, her tone complacent. \"Then why are you carrying a passenger?\" the cop asked, motioning her flashlight to Vincent. Callie didn't dare turn and see the expression on his face. \"Well, his stop is on my way,\" she said. \"It's been a long night, officer, can you please just let me take the car in?\" \"Sorry, your vehicle is unsafe to drive,\" the woman said. \"We're going to do a vehicle inventory before the tow-truck gets here, so I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the car. You, too, sir,\" she said, bending and looking directly at Vincent now. \"Is that really necessary, office? I'm just a half-a-mile from my stop.\" \"Yes, sir, I'm sorry. Come on,\" she said, motioning with her hand and giving the rest of traffic a bored glance. \"Let's go. Pop the trunk.\" Callie heard Vincent's voice close to her, even though he was still all the way in the back seat. \"You open that trunk, they go inside.\" She had to think of something. She glanced up at the officer, searching her face. Then, it hit her. Bingo. \"I'm sorry…are you Laura Cervantes?\" she asked, leaning out of the window. The woman looked surprised, blinked, looked down again. \"Officer Cervantes,\" she corrected, her voice cool. \"Well, you might know my brother…Detective Ray Fanning, Narcotics?\" Her heart was going to fall out of her mouth any second now, she was sure of it. She was amazed her lungs had the capacity to pass breath over her vocal cords so she could produce sound. One eyebrow arched. \"You're Calliope,\" she said. \"Yes, I remember you.\" Callie managed a smile. \"Well, if you call my brother, I'm sure he'll be more than happy to explain that you could let me off with a warning and let me make my own way to the garage. Save the taxpayers the charge of a tow-truck?\" Officer Cervantes looked at her partner over the top of the car. He was studying the windshield, the way the glass had shattered. \"How did this happen, anyway?\" he asked. \"Looks like something went right through the center.\" \"Uh…I think it was a…\" Oh, come on, girl, be creative but don't be stupid. \"I think that I got too close to a truck, on the freeway, you know? Spat a bunch of gravel right into my windshield.\" She chuckled, forcing it to sound natural. \"Thought we'd been shot at for a moment, you know?\" The cop didn't look convinced. Apparently, he was one of the brighter bulbs on the Christmas tree. He could tell the difference between a hole going in and a hole going out, and this one was going out, not in. Because Vincent had been aiming his gun inside the cab when he'd fired. \"Maybe we should call your brother, Miss Fanning,\" Officer Cervantes said slowly. \"I think maybe you're going to need his help. Could you please step out of the car, now?\" She pulled on the handle, let the door slip open, then backed away, eyeing Vincent in the back seat more cautiously now. Callie froze. She casually glanced down, moving just her eyes, to the gear by her hand. She had always appreciated the cars that put the gear shift on the floor. Her hand gently moved toward it, and she realized that in her state, she had not put the car in park, but only in neutral. Her hand grazed the gear, pressing in the button. It moved down, slid into drive. She kept her foot tightly on the break so as not to give herself away. Officer Cervantes had shifted her attention now to Vincent. The woman's sharp eyes seemed to miss nothing, and possess nearly an X-ray power. Her cop instincts were telling her something was very wrong about this situation. Lady, you have no idea. She heard the faintest click in the back seat. Vincent had pulled back the hammer on his gun. It was more than likely someplace where the cops couldn't see it. After all, Vincent was a professional. Shooting the woman cop one more pleading glance, she realized that there was no turning back now. It was kill or be killed. She was not going to let Vincent murder two police officers. She slammed the accelerator. The car jerked forward so fast that her open door flipped back from the force and snapped itself shut, just barely. Vincent jerked, going half-way into the air before he righted himself enough to lean out the window and fire a single shot. Callie didn't know if she hallucinated the scream in her panic, or if it was real. She wouldn't know for hours to come, but Vincent had hit the lady cop's partner. It was possibly the smartest move he could have made, in his situation, because the other cop was now unable to pursue, but instead had to call for medical assistance and then request that back-up be sent. Back-up that would take time to get there. They were driving a cab. There were over four thousand cabs in L.A. alone. \"Head for the airport,\" Vincent rasped, by her shoulder. \"The airport?\" she echoed. \"Why?\" \"Just do it!\" he snapped, his voice temporarily reaching a rather high pitch, shaking her eardrums in spite of the wind that rushed past her head, flipping her hair in every direction. Callie, at this moment, was convinced the squad car was following her. She looked up into her rearview but Vincent completely blocked the view, his gray head all over the back seat, looking in ever feasible direction. So she obeyed and made a run for the freeway. She had never driven so fast in her life. She had seen chases on the news, L.A. was full of them, from intense, short, high-speed chases, to low-speed chases where the car just wouldn't stop and eventually the police had to blow out its tires. She had seem them all, been raised on them. She knew how they worked. It would be a matter of minutes before a helicopter spotted them. \"There's the 105!\" Vincent snarled, pointing with the barrel of his gun. \"Go!\" It was so late at night, traffic was considerably less and the freeway was nearly empty. Callie had little trouble maneuvering her way through traffic, although the terrific speed at which she was driving made her a little nervous that she might flip the car over, or possibly lose control of it in some other way. She dodged in and out of traffic, thinking she could hear sires and see flashing lights out of the corner of her eyes. She didn't bother with the traditional exits, but instead sped on past them toward the back end entrance of LAX. There were cabs everywhere. The traffic was still tremendous at the airport, even at this hour of the night, but she knew what she was doing. Maneuvering through heavy traffic was nine tenths of a cabbie's job. She managed to duck and weave her way around several large airport shuttles and rental buses, and even when she was sure she did see flashing lights coming from her right, her flying hair simply would not let her get a closer look. So she focused on the job. She drove. Finally, finally, they came out and blended back into traffic, just as neatly as before. She almost went back to the 105, but Vincent stopped her. \"Take the 405,\" he ordered, his voice cold, angry. She obeyed. She hated the 405, but it was much less obvious than going back the way they came. Or maybe the police were smarter than she gave them credit for – after all , a wry voice said, look at your brother – and they would figure them out. At any rate, as she moved into the heavier traffic of the next freeway, she began to calm down, the adrenaline leaving her system, sending her crashing into a numb state, and her brain was finally unleashed so that she could think calmly. They had gone through the airport to blend in with the other taxis. And because no helicopter could enter that restricted airspace. It was a brilliant plan, and she had followed it to the letter. So why was Vincent pissed at her? \"This exit,\" Vincent said, his voice strained. She turned off the exit, and found herself in a rather lonely corner of Los Angeles, surrounded by industry that was long since closed, small, shack-like businesses that boarded their doors and windows at night, and wide, empty streets no one dared to walk. She rolled to a stop at a light, which seemed to be stuck on the color red. \"That was stupid,\" Vincent said, the anger now simmering. \"What was stupid?\" she asked, feeling like an idiot savant, able to do tremendous things behind the wheel of a car but unable to function like a normal human being. Even her tongue felt swollen as she tried to talk. \"Attempting to bolt like that,\" Vincent continued, the steam of his rage starting to ease off on the sides. \"It would have been better if we'd just shot them.\" Callie jerked a little. \"You mean if you shot them,\" she corrected. Vincent, she realized, now that she could turn her head a little more, the paralytic shock starting to wear off, had continued to jerk his head around in every possible direction, and he turned to her briefly, disdain in his face. \"Yeah, me,\" he snapped. \"Doesn't matter now, you're wanted for evading arrest. You're right in this with me.\" She glared at him. \"She wasn't going to arrest us,\" she said coolly. \"She was going to arrest you .\" \"How do you figure?\" \" She figured. She had you all figured out. I could see it.\" Callie looked away. \"I'd rather be a fugitive than be responsible for you shooting two perfectly good police officers.\" Vincent chuckled, a low, throaty sound in the back of his mouth. \"So you were trying to be a hero, huh?\" The light finally changed. She jerked the accelerator again, causing his head to flip back for a second, making an unpleasant jerking motion. \"Fat lot of good it did,\" she grumbled. \"Did you manage to kill one of them?\" \"The one on my side, I think. I'm not sure.\" He said it so casually, as if they were having a normal conversation. \"Now, Koreatown. Let's go.\" Callie slipped into a sullen, angry silence throughout the drive. A/N: People who review will get free rides through the airport with Vincent in the back seat…provided they don't mind running from the police at the time. Void where prohibited by law.[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: Been there, done that, don't own anything. A/N: And at last, the chapter all of you have been waiting for…the Fever scene! This remains possibly my favorite sequence throughout the movie. And there are a lot of good sequences, y'know? (of course you know, otherwise you wouldn't be reading Collateral fanfic). I just hope I didn't blow it. I just get in a hurry to post the next chapter, because I live for the reviews...if I really bombed it I'm totally open to adjusting it. So without further ado… Chapter Eight: Everything But The Polish Cavalry Callie had been to a few nightclubs in her day, but not many. Fever was nothing like she'd ever set foot inside. It was a black-lit swamp of writhing bodies and thrumming music. The close atmosphere was nearly claustrophobic, even though the main room itself stretched for thousands of yards. Screens filled the upper part of all the walls, lining the ceiling, each showing images of people dancing and doing other things that looked erotic at the subliminal-quick flash they went across her field of vision. It was long after midnight. It had to be getting close to one in the morning. It was a weeknight and this place was singing like a beehive in the middle of September. Still, the people came, in and out, running to and fro across the street, some drunk out of their minds, high, or both, and the occasional one that was fresh for the taking, ready to lose their sanity and their sobriety to the fever pitch that was the Korean club called Fever. Somehow, they had managed to leave the cab in the large alley behind the building, which was just as busy as the front entrance, with people swarming in and out at their own pace with the occasional bouncer keeping anyone from idling too long. This wasn't some exclusive place where you had to pay to get past the front doorman, it had its own unique system and Callie had no inclination to decipher at the moment. She numbly followed Vincent's lead as he dragged her out of the driver's seat and into the narrow doorway of the club. Outside, it had been cold. Inside, it sweltered with the heat of moving bodies. A thin haze filled the air above them, and whether it was some kind of mist effect or the steam rising from the flesh, Callie couldn't tell. She noticed that the far walls were much nicer than the ones around the common dancing floor – although where the dance floor started and ended, she had no idea, as everything seemed to be one giant wiggling mass of arms and legs. There was the soothing effect of running water down several of the transparent fiberglass walls, and around the bar area. How anyone could need anything soothing in this place was beyond her. Then again, at this moment, it was all beyond her. Callie had lapsed into a state of utter apathy. Her brain had overloaded on the night's events, and now she was a zombie, an empty puppet letting Vincent pull her strings. He made her walk in front of him. He murmured in her ear, just loud enough for her to make out, \"One step ahead, one pace to the left.\" She wasn't quite sure how she followed those directions, but there was no jerking hand, nothing to correct her. She must be doing something right. Or maybe , a dry little voice commented from the center of her brain that still cared, you've wandered too far from him and he just hasn't noticed . She was surprised to find her chin swinging around to make sure he was still there, and sure enough she caught the flash of silver-gray at her shoulder. He darted a look at her, his eyes flickering silvery-blue in the black-light. But no, he was occupied with other things. She turned her head back, nearly rolling her eyes. Wake up, girl. This is still serious business . Her eyes wandered around the room. Everyone here was skinny and beautiful…well, maybe beautiful was an exaggeration, but they were certainly shapely made in this end of town. Delicately, graceful arms lifted in the air, swaying to the beat, hips jerking back and forth in distinctly sexual motions, legs long and slender, narrow hips, perky breasts. Even the men were pretty, flopping their manes of straight hair that either hung black or had the distinct multi-colored hue of Hot Topic hair dyes. She didn't belong here. It occurred to her that Vincent didn't belong here, either, but maybe Vincent just didn't belong anywhere, so what did that matter? Vincent…she felt a low level thrum of anger in the back of her skull. Vincent, who had manipulated her this entire evening. Vincent, who had forced her and coerced her and taken advantage of her at every turn, and when that didn't work, he resorted to bullying or brute force. Vincent, with his features of a Roman god, his eyes like emerald pools, a smile that rivaled the sun, and hands that made her melt with their knowing touch, all the right pressure in all the right places. Vincent with his gun and his briefcase and his expensive gray suit. She was clenching her teeth when he stopped her. The motion sent a jolt through her stomach that she recognized as pure animal fear. It passed, but left a nasty wake of loathing and resentment behind, causing her eyebrows to permanently furrow and make a line between her eyes. \"Move fifteen paces in front, three to the left. Wander, and innocent bystanders get the first rounds.\" She blinked, then looked toward where he indicated. It was close to the bar, at an empty spot that she could reach if she moved quickly enough. He wanted her to wait. \"Why the hell don't you just leave me here?\" she said over her shoulder, and then thought her voice might be too low for him to hear. She felt his eyes turn on her. She moved her head, then her body, wanting to face him, wanting to stare him down. Somehow, being surrounded by people seemed to make her feel safer, even though she knew damn well that Vincent would start shooting every living thing he saw if he felt so inclined. The look on his face warned her, plainly. Just do as you're told . She wanted to scream at him. She wanted to ask him why the hell didn't he just either let her go, or shoot her then and there. She was tired, she didn't want this anymore. She was sick, sick with the emotional pain of being jerked around like a toy all night, being swung back and forth between the line of exhilaration and terror. He had looked away for a moment, his eyes anxiously searching. Apparently, he'd found what he'd come for – or rather, who – and was anxious to get on with his business. He darted her another glance, this time with an eyebrow mildly raised. What are you waiting for? She turned, obeyed. The space by the bar was temporarily closed, but managed to just open again by the time she reached it. 8888888888 \"What the fuck is that?\" Ray snapped, although he knew perfectly well what it was. It was a taxi. The hit man was already here. The FBI had long since arrived, their cars parked in all sorts of illegal positions with their red lights flashing to indicate they could do as they needed. Richard was rather calm as they got out of the car and headed for the narrow back entrance. Ray took a slight detour and headed for the driver's side window of the cab, checking. \"Ray, come on,\" Richard called, not wanting the man to do something stupid, like panic. Ray wasn't necessarily inclined to panic, he was very much by the book, very good at doing the procedure, and for those reasons, he was usually quite successful. But when it came to his family, especially his sister, he had a tendency to go a little nuts. Ray bent down, raised a hand to ward off the streetlight glare on the window, and peered inside. Sitting on the driver's seat was a hat. A hat of blue suede, a hat his sister usually wore. And her scarf was slung over the back of the passenger seat. Just then, the cellular phone at Richard's waist went off. Ray nearly jumped, eyes wide, temporarily frozen in a moment of panic. Richard answered; there was police jargon, and then finally a name. \"Detective Ray Fanning,\" came the crackling voice. Richard lifted the phone away from his lips, like a police radio, so Ray could hear it. \"This is Detective Widener, I'm with Detective Fanning,\" he said. \"Officer Cervantes just radioed in with an urgent message for you,\" came the voice, undistinguishable at the moment, as Ray was already grasping for the phone. It continued, unhindered. \"She reports that your sister, Calliope Fanning, was just reported as being involved in a high speed pursuit in\" Cackling static cut off the location. \"Repeat, this is Fanning, repeat,\" Ray said. \"Officer reported down. Calliope Fanning was the driver of a taxi, with an unidentified man in the back seat being the shooter. When the cab was pulled over for a shattered windshield, she refused to exit the vehicle and then proceeded to drive off. They were last seen heading into L.A.X., but their location is now uncertain.\" Richard scowled. Some shoddy police work, that's what it was. Even he, being as laid back as he was, wasn't so sloppy. And no doubt, it was someone who owed Ray a huge favor that was making this call go through. Ray looked back at the taxi. The windshield was shattered. \"Report that I have apprehended the vehicle,\" Fanning said, juggling the phone against his ear as he grasped for his wallet. \"In pursuit of Calliope Fanning and unidentified assailant.\" \"Negative, Detective,\" the voice said, which sounded more distinguishable by the second. \"Allow Detective Widener to apprehend Ms. Fanning. I shouldn't even be telling you this shit, anyway.\" Ray slapped the phone shut and tossed it back at Richard. Richard barely managed to stuff it away before they were both inside the nightclub, just barely catching up to the small team of F.B.I. agents preparing to storm the front. Pedrosa had his team getting ready to go into the thick of the nightclub. Fanning caught up with him just by the skin of his teeth. Irritated to find this L.A.P.D. detective following them, he almost turned away and ignored the intrusion, until Fanning grabbed him hard by his elbow and shoved a picture into his face. \"Look for this girl,\" he said. \"It's my sister.\" \"What the fuck—?\" \"Whoever our meat-eater super assassin is,\" Fanning barked, \"he's with her. Look for her, and you'll find him.\" Reluctantly, Pedrosa took the picture. He couldn't really argue with that kind of logic. 8888888888 Vincent had spotted his target. Sitting at a booth against a far wall, in an elusive, exclusive area of the club, Peter Wu, target number four, lounged with a flock of bodyguards around him. Bodyguards…well, it was standard. Three rings of them, one patrolling the outer floor, moving back and forth like sharks in the shallows, a second one like a wall around the booth, and the third just behind the booth, all of them armed. It was time. Vincent's mind went effectively blank and slipped into pure stalking mode. He chose a guard, and he attacked. Weaving through the crowd like a panther through the jungle brush, he slipped between three girls who were bouncing together like a sex sandwich without noticing them. He came up behind the first guard, and sent a paralyzing kick to the small of his back, bruising spine and crippling him. Catching him in his hands, Vincent wrenched his neck and then threw him forcefully to the ground, sending one last crushing kick with his heel into the soft windpipe. Without looking down, he moved on. The next one came a little harder, because as soon as Vincent had the guy on the ground with a heavy kick to the back of his leg, throwing the knee out backwards, and then a few hard punches. Vincent's teeth gritted with the effort, and to his amazement, he found himself…actually enjoying kicking the crap out of a few people. There was a nasty voice in the back of his head. Little Callie's got you all riled up. All hot and bothered . The third guard came, and Vincent knew his cover was blown. Even in this sea of bodies, someone was bound to notice the downing of the guards. But no matter, he easily counter-assaulted the man and then drew his weapon, pointing it at his temple, the back of his hand flush against the side of the man's face, just in case he had to fire. He hated getting brains on his face. Like that, he started to make his way through the crowd, with a bit less trouble this time. People were cowards, generally, and not one of those pretty little dancers was going to fuck with a guy holding a gun to another man's head, moving purposefully through the throng. 8888888888 Callie didn't see much. She caught motions, waves through the crowd of the chaos that Vincent was creating, but nothing was enough to start these cows into a stampede. Then, she happened to look over her shoulder, and her brother's face suddenly appeared. She started. What the hell was Ray doing here? He never messed around on the clock, so that had to mean… Holy shit , they'd called it in and word had come down the pipe. But how in the hell had it happened so fast? There was no way Ray had gotten over here so fast. He must have been close by at the time. The goose pimples rose around her cheeks, a sure sign of her exhilaration. He'd been following Vincent's trail, that had to be it. Not thinking, she turned away. All she could think of was the dead bodies, those two kids in the alley, the jazz man slumped over the table, the loud thunder of Vincent's gun exploding as she'd driven away from those two patrol officers. She couldn't let that happen to Ray. Ray was tracking Vincent. He'd been finding the dead bodies and somehow it had led him here. As soon as she turned her head, her eyes landed on something equally upsetting. F.B.I. agents. It wasn't that they were particularly conspicuous, or that she was particularly astute. They just stuck out pretty badly in the middle of this club filled with Korean dancers – a big fat white guy and his pretty African-American woman partner, her with her gun drawn, him with a piece of paper in one hand and grasping at his lapel mike with the other. The man's eyes landed on her. Recognition flared. She turned away again. Only to run smack into Richard Widener, whom she had only met once and hardly recognized. It was the fact that he recognized her, and called her by name. \"Callie, we're getting you out of here.\" 8888888888 Vincent caught movement out of the corner of his eye. The thriving movement wasn't enough to block his senses from picking out something unusual, which was Callie. She wasn't following orders. She was starting to leave her designated area. Vincent's teeth ground in frustration, he was much too busy to deal with her shit at the moment. Then he saw someone come up to her. Someone who had a cop's appearance. That was when all hell broke loose. There was firing coming from Peter Lim's table. Vincent saw a white man in a suit struggling with one of the Korean bodyguards in the inner circle, both of them grasping at a gun. The gun had gone off, into the crowd, and someone went down. 8888888888 Ray grasped her arm. She spun, looking up into his eyes, knowing it was all falling apart around her, disintegrating like a sugar cube in a cup of hot water. She thought he might be angry, but instead, he looked tremendously relieved. \"What the fuck are you doing here?\" they said to each other at the same time, but both voices lacked venom. She wanted to hug him, wanted to rest her head against his shoulder and feel his strong arm around her back, telling her it was going to be okay, just like her father would do. It was a shame that one never appreciated one's family until the circumstances were so dire. At that moment, Callie fully realized how much she truly adored her brother. Richard yanked her away. \"I'm getting her out of here,\" he said. Ray nodded. Yes, it was better if she go with Richard. Cops weren't supposed to get involved in family matters on the job. It just messed up their judgment. \"Yeah, please, get her out of here.\" Then his dark eyes narrowed on her, the cop now looking out, plain as the nose on his face. \"Who are you here with?\" \"Gray hair,\" was all she could say, and Ray looked up, his eyes scanning the sea of dark heads that had began to stampede, now, finally, that there was a bullet in one of them, God knew who. He nodded, giving her a little push, and Richard started to drag her toward the exit. It was slow going. 8888888888 Vincent dropped the guard, letting him fall onto the ground like the useless sack of meat he had become. He moved deeper into the crowd, now fighting against the chaos, a salmon swimming upstream. But suddenly the piranha were all around him, grasping him on every side. One of them had a metal stick of some kind. Vincent felt the sharp thwack of it against his wrist, causing a high-pitched sting and then a throbbing welt. He looked up. Callie was between two men. One of them had a rather intimate set of body language when it came to her. The look on his face…like he wanted to kiss her. But the other one dragged her away. They were taking her away. Vincent glared, willing her to look at him. Her eyes turned as she was pulled away from the more familiar man, and briefly dragged across him. He glared harder. It held. She nearly stumbled in mid-step, startled by the distant face. Distance made no difference to the intensity of that look. The men around him were pulling and yanking and generally being very annoying. Feeling a surge of adrenaline, Vincent reached into his pocket and pulled out his switchblade, then embedded it into the nearest thigh he could find that wasn't his. Someone screamed; the crowd around him broke. Still simmering, Vincent threw punches, grabbed the thin metal stick and did some swinging of his own, catching one or two of them across the face. He swung so hard, one of them slumped unconscious in mid-flop, and then abruptly came toppling down onto Vincent. He caught the bodyguard drawing on him out of the corner of his eye. Falling back with the body on top of him, he used it as a shield from the incoming fire. Just as the bullets riddled the body, Vincent spun away, sliding across the now-cleared floor to his gun, and brought it up, knees bent and legs parted, firing a straight line, right into the body-guard's chest. Vincent got onto his knees with the kind of versatility that would have made an Olympic gymnast jealous. He fired again, catching the guard in the head and taking out a few others that looked like they wanted to play, too. Then he got onto his feet and pushed the rest of the way, right up to Peter Lim. The coward of a man was attempting to use the cheap whores around him as shields, but they were having none of it. The remaining guard from behind was on the edge of the seat, trying to pull Lim out of the way. Vincent shot him in a blink. He put the last two bullets in his clip right into Lim's chest. The gun was empty. Vincent slid out the next clip. His mind briefly registered that his pocket felt lighter than it should, but there wasn't time to worry about it. He shot once more into Lim's chest, and then right into his forehead. The man hadn't been pretty to start with. Now he was just repulsive. Smoothly, Vincent turned and headed out of the club. Callie was out of sight…for the moment. 8888888888 Richard was behind her now, propelling her forward. Callie moved down the stairs in a nearly trance-like state, and marveled secretly how this was possibly her first moment of the evenly truly away from Vincent. The narrow door that led out into the alley was wide open and alive with the people pouring out like ants. Screams and shrieks could be heard echoing up and down the alley, the police were on their way, helicopters screamed above them, their bright lights sweeping over the crowd. Richard had let go of her. She moved onward, oblivious, seeing nothing. Was it true? Was she free? Was this horrible and confusing even finally over? She stopped, turned, caught the strange, acrid smell of the L.A. night air and watched as Richard made his way out of the doorway behind her. And was abruptly shot down by three familiar rounds, two to the chest and one to the head. He fell back against the doorjamb, slid down, slumped and lay still. Callie turned around, her expression frozen into one of horror. Vincent was behind her at the open driver's door of the cab, looking up and down the alley, around every which way, and making his way toward her, gun out. \"Come on!\" he said, then moved faster when he realized she wasn't moving. He grabbed her by the sleeve of her coat and yanked, and she nearly stumbled against him. The despair was utter, crushing, and black. He dragged her back jerkily toward the car, still looking around, compulsively watching everything, his attention scattered all over the chaos, but his grip firm on her. She couldn't get free – in his current state he would definitely shoot her before he even fully realized what she was doing. She couldn't escape. He wouldn't let her go. And she didn't understand why. Before she knew it, she was behind the wheel, staring numbly out the fractured glass of the windshield, looking down the alley at the cars that lined her way. \"Now drive!\" Vincent ordered, then, louder, \" Drive !\" She realized that the car was running. She pushed the gear into D and pressed the accelerator. She didn't realize that she'd sideswiped the other cars around her until it was much too late and they were already back out onto the open streets. 8888888888 The state of shock that had settled on her wasn't nearly as paralyzing as it would have been if the incident had occurred earlier in the evening. Vincent's violent behavior had deadened her to the reality of the situation, and instead of the sickening repulsion she felt at the fact that she had actually witnessed him drop a body, she found her key emotion was anger. Not just anger, though, oh no. This was a seething kind of heat, making her mute with its force. Her jaw clenched, her teeth grinding together as she glared at the road, her hands so tight against the wheel that her fingers were losing circulation. \"Everything but the Polish Cavalry,\" Vincent quipped breathlessly. He was moving all over the back seat, his head craning every which way, looking out the back window, the side windows, occasionally glancing out the front. \"We're lucky to be alive.\" She moved only her eyes up toward the rearview mirror, and managed to catch his eye. Her rage was written on every line around her mouth. \"What, don't I get any thanks?\" he snapped. \"Thanks for what?\" she growled. \"They were arresting you,\" he said. \"They think you're my accomplice. I saved you.\" She drew in a hissing breath. \"No, you didn't. That was my brother's partner you shot.\" \"Your brother?\" \"My brother, the cop!\" she snapped back, her tone matching his. \"And his partner Richard, that you murdered !\" \"Oh, so I should have stopped and asked him first what he was doing before I shot him?\" She opened her mouth to reply, found too many horrid things wanting to crawl out to assault him, and then snapped her mouth shut. \"I go through a lot of trouble for you, and all you can do is clam up,\" he muttered, his eyes going out the back window. \"Fuck you!\" she hissed, remembering, briefly, those days when she was a pre-teen, and her mother was alive, and they would fight about things that girls fought with their mothers about, and she would walk away, wanting so badly to have the last word, and managing only those two words, too soft to be effectual, or to get her into worse trouble. Vincent heard them. \"Hey, at least I didn't shoot your brother,\" he pointed out. \"Oh, and I'm supposed to—\" she cut herself off, her fist balling up and then slamming against the wheel. \"What the hell is going on?\" \"As in?\" \"As in, why the hell are you murdering all these people?\" She had ceased to make any sense of her emotions, and had reverted back to pure, simple knowledge. She had to know why she was suffering like this, what was the purpose of it all? \"What the hell did any of them ever do to deserve you ?\" \"How the hell should I know?\" Vincent returned, equally annoyed by not nearly matching her frustration. \"They all have the same, witness-for-the-prosecution-look to me. Some major federal indictment for someone who majorly does not want to get indicted.\" Disgusted, she spat, \"So that's the reason.\" \"No, that's the why. There is no reason. There's no good reason, there's no bad reason to live or to die.\" She looked up into the rearview again, her face losing the mask of rage and shock. Suddenly, everything came into incredibly sharp focus, as if she had just adjusted her lens through which she saw her life. \"What…what is with you?\" she whispered. He looked at her, and she swore she caught the mild flicker of alarm in those ice-green orbs. \"As in?\" he repeated. She turned away, struggling with herself. \"You…you murder people. For a living. Someone pays you and you kill whoever they want you to kill. How much is the going rate for a human life today? I'm really curious.\" \"Depends on the life,\" he said. \"What, how hard they are to get to? How difficult the target is to reach?\" \"Something like that.\" His voice was unsure, most likely thrown by her sarcasm. She hadn't been too sarcastic with him. In fact, until that moment, she'd been pretty meek. That moment was over. 8888888888 A/N Pt. 1: Thanks to my loyal reviewers, who all risked their lives (and libidos) in the taxi ride through the airport with Vincent. Now if all of you would be so kind as to return his clothes, so he can get out… A/N Pt. 2: Just to give all of you a head's up, I'm probably going to be ending this story after the next two chapters...but never fear, because over the last few days a serious sequal has been sneaking around my head, and I finally found the major plotline to carry it through! So there will be a sequel, which I will start posting as soon as I can. (Which should reassure some of you out there about Vincent's fate, especially after what I did at the end of Purity...heh heh...) A/N Pt. 3: Hope everybody has a happy, blessed and joyous Easter![Chapter 9] Disclaimer: Vincent is a man with a gun. You think I'm going to try and steal him? A/N: Okay, people, this is winding down...yes, I have a sequel in mind but in the meanwhile, there's a good fanfic you should be reading out there by Winged Seraph called \"Effigy.\" She polished it up and it's all sparkly and neat and waiting for your reviews, so I use my \"Vincent's intense stare power\" to command you to go read it. And leave a review. Special thanks to Dawnie-7 for returning Vincent's shirt. Although he did look pretty good without it. He he. Thanks to my loyal reviewers, I hope to hear from you at least a couple more times before this strand must end...and a new one begin! Chapter Nine: Why Haven't You Killed Me? Vincent watched her, suddenly unsure. It was the first time in the evening that he hadn't been sure about her. It was an unsteady feeling, one he didn't care for at all. Gently, he leaned forward, toward the rise of the front seat that divided them. The plastic barrier was wide open in the middle, more than enough room for him to reach through. He slid his opposing hand over and touched her hair. She stiffened. Not so unusual, being female she had a natural inclination to distrust any man who tried to touch her. But their earlier intimacy hadn't been forgotten, at least not by him, and she was in no position to push him away. \"Head downtown,\" he said softly, close to the back of her head. \"What's downtown?\" He almost smirked, but she could see him in the mirror. A smirk would ruin the moment. The tremor of her voice told him plainly that the physical contact was working. Just like it had always worked. \"Don't worry about it. Just drive.\" He kept his tone mellow, soothing, and he moved his hand deeper into the thick mass of her hair. God, it was so soft. He'd forgotten how good a woman's hair could feel against his scarred fingers. The tips of his fingers just touched the nape of her neck. She bridled. Her shoulders rose almost imperceptibly, putting the smallest barrier between them. Then, as if the effort to speak were tremendous, she said, \"Don't touch me.\" The corner of his mouth quirked into a nearly teasing smile. \"Look, you've had a rough night, I know. I've put you through hell, but you've come through, you know?\" A little louder. \"Don't touch me.\" \"You need to relax. It's almost over.\" Her eyes darted up into the mirror to meet his. He was amazed at the depths of rage he saw there. \"Yeah, I'm sure it is,\" she snapped. Shaking his head, he leaned closer to her. \"Come on, Callie, get with it. Millions of galaxies, hundreds of millions of stars, and a speck on one in a blink …that's us, lost in space. You, me…what do either of us really matter? Why not just enjoy the moment we have? Because it's all we have, trust me.\" \"All I have? So when this ride is over, so am I, right?\" Blazing now, he'd forgotten what color her eyes were, but now they were nearly black in the shadows, two glittering onyx staring fire at him. \"What makes you say that?\" She sighed, as if impatient with him. \"Come on, Vincent, I'm not stupid. You've killed everyone else you've met tonight. After number five comes number six. That's me, right?\" He swallowed. No, this was coming apart. He was tempted to tell her that of course that wasn't true, he wouldn't hurt her…but the fact that it wasn't a lie was what stopped him. Startled at himself, he pulled back his hand. She had pinned him now, with those eyes. \"You know, I probably deserve it, you know? Being so incredibly stupid . I mean, right now, I feel like the most stupid person on the planet.\" \"Why?\" \"What I said to you before was all true. All of it. You've been playing me from minute one. The charming smile, the seductive attitude. All of it was pure manipulation. Because you don't feel anything. You don't care one speck about any human being on this planet.\" She narrowed her eyes, her teeth showing with the venom of the last words. \"Not even yourself .\" He backed away, deflating slightly against the back seat. His eyes slid away from her, unable to take that gaze any longer. What's wrong with you? Snap out of it! She drew a breath, then let out a sharp, bitter laugh. \"God, how could I? I mean, I go to school, I study this, and yet a live field experience lands in my lap and I fall in like some dumb cheerleader who doesn't know her boobs from her ass. You're so typical, and boring, do you know that? I mean, daytime T.V. creates more imaginative hit-men than you. But you, you're just a machine, pressing buttons on other machines. Pressing my buttons, and idiot that I am, I let you. But you don't feel anything, do you? You probably don't even know what the word means. Sure, you can read people, figure them out, but their hearts are just empty spaces on your radar, because you don't have one. No human being could murder another human being if they had a single clue as to what they really were.\" She stopped, stunned by the silence in the back of her cab. She looked at him again, saw him listening, saw his numb look. In sadistic – and perhaps masochistic – enthusiasm, she plodded on. \"So let me guess…Daddy beat you up, Momma ran out on you, you were isolated and alone, wound up in some juvie hall somewhere, where you learned the law of the jungle, eat or be eaten? Keep the bad things away by never letting anything in? Destroy anything you touch before it touches you? How long was it before you realized you were a walking corpse? Anybody home?\" She snorted, looked away. \"You think you're this bad-ass sociopath and it's all just a façade. Just like your expensive suit and silver-fox hair. It's almost enough to make me feel sorry for you, you low….just…low.\" Stumbling on her words, feeling something catch in her throat, she looked out the window. \"I don't know why the hell you haven't killed me yet. But don't think for a second that I don't know that's how all of this is going to end. So don't, for one second, try to play it sweet on me. At least give me the dignity of knowing better than to fall for that transparent shit.\" Silence. Slowly, so slowly, Vincent pulled his head straight onto his shoulders, not realizing that it had been unsteady until that moment. \"Next time I come to L.A.,\" he quipped, \"I'm going to have to remember never to get into the cab of a little college girl who thinks she's already a shrink.\" \"Fuck you,\" she snapped. \"Fuck me?\" He arched an eyebrow, feeling the anger starting to boil, sliding up his throat like bile. \"Yeah, that is what you wanted to do, isn't it? I mean, why else would you have let yourself be used like that? Isn't that the classic, bad-boy complex your daddy was talking about?\" \"Leave him out of this,\" she hissed. \"Why not? He's the reason you have it. No man in this world will ever be as good or noble as your father, or even your brother, so why try? Instead, play the other side of the street, that way you know how everything is going to end. Well, don't get pissed at me if that little complex of yours gets you into trouble, it you hadn't been such a coward to find yourself someone who was good enough for you. If they even exist.\" She blinked. Hell, why had that barb stuck so hard? It was pure defense, pure table-turning and she was falling for it, like the idiot she felt like at that moment. \"One day, you'll be thanking me, Callie,\" Vincent went on, finding his tone of disdain and scorn that made her nearly want to cry. \"You'll remember me as the one man who didn't let you walk away without giving you what you asked for.\" \"I never asked for you!\" she shrieked, hitting the accelerator. Vincent's head snapped back as the sudden G's came upon him, and she swerved the car to make a heavy, ugly right turn. \"Fucking savior complex, Stockholm syndrome, whatever the hell…I could have risked it any time I wanted to…\" She was rambling now, almost laughing, as the near-deserted late-night streets of L.A. became her own personal racing track. \"Red light!\" Vincent said, attempting to keep his cool, but she heard the panic, reveled in it as she sped right through, the accelerator now going north of sixty. \"But new news!\" she mocked, looking up at him, taking her eyes off the road in a moment of reckless glee. \"This moment is all we have, right? May as well make the best of it !\" The tires screamed against the pavement as she made another turn, nearly lifting half the car off the road. It slammed back down, jolting them both, and to Vincent's utter amazement, she started to laugh. Not just laugh. Giggle hysterically , that was more like it. \"What the hell do I have to lose , anyway?\" she roared as the engine screamed around them. Vincent reached for his gun, pulled it out, pointed it at her temple. \"Slow down!\" he ordered. She looked at him, and it was plain to see that she didn't buy it for a second. \"What, you going to pull the trigger and kill us? Go ahead, I dare you, Mr. I Don't Have A Fucking Clue What Anyone Else Is Thinking ! Go ahead and call my bluff!\" Another sharp turn. Vincent almost lost hold of his pistol. \"I said, slow the hell down !\" he said again, a bit more loudly. \"Lost in space…trust me, I'm not lost anywhere, not in this city. But you can go ahead and fly away any time, be my guest, if you think you can hide your ass from the entire L.A.P.D!\" The road had straightened out ahead of them. There were cars lined on each side, the road a bit narrower than the others. She had turned off onto a side street, the debris making her speed that much more dangerous. \"SLOW DOWN!\" Vincent barked, the fear now showing on his face. Callie smiled in smug triumph. \"You were right, Vincent,\" she said, her eyes landing on a large truck, abandoned where it had broken down in an empty lot, \"my brother is my hero. He's coming to save me. Who's going to save you?\" Then she spun the wheel. The front of the car barely missed the truck, but the side glanced off, bouncing as if the metal had been turned into rubber. The car whirled around in a full 360 degree angle, going across the street to slap hard into other cars parked there. Finally, the right front fender slammed hard into a large dumpster, killing the taxi's engine and bringing them both to an abrupt stop. 8888888888 Callie opened her eyes. She was looking right into a street light, flickering on and off, and the glare hurt. She reached up with a hand to ward it off, only to find someone else had beaten her to it. \"So you're alive,\" came Vincent's voice. \"I was wondering there for a second.\" His powerful grasp snaked around her forearm and yanked her upwards. Her door had come off in the crash and part of the roof of the cab had been pulled away, so it was like lifting a sardine out of a freshly peeled can. She found herself unsteady on her feet in the middle of the street. Head spinning and stomach churning, she struggled to keep from barfing then and there on his shoes. But sure enough, Vincent was right there, in front of her, looking at her with an equal mixture of utter annoyance and reluctant respect. There were cuts on his face, skin scraped off his knuckles, and no doubt his suit was ripped in various places, but he was alive and relatively unhurt. She blinked, letting her vision clear. It felt so quiet and strange around them, deserted. Vincent was looking around, nearly laughing. \"What did I tell you?\" he was saying. \"Nobody notices anything in this town.\" She looked around her, at the distant lights of moving cars, straining her ears for the sound of a police siren. Surely someone had seen their wreck. Someone had to have called the cops. Where was Ray? Hadn't he caught up to them by then? Vincent grabbed her wrist, yanking her along with him. \"Come on, Speed-racer, let's go, the night isn't over yet.\" Mercilessly, he dragged her through the streets, finding ways through alleys, going through places she would never had set foot inside on her own, but he trodded fearlessly. Her head felt fuzzy and her mouth had a strange taste in it – it took two fingers and her tongue for her to realize that she had bitten something pretty badly and it was blood that she tasted. Her lip, and something else, something on the inside of her cheek. \"Let…let me go,\" she murmured weakly, his momentum causing her steps to become stumbled and uneven. \"No way,\" he said. \"You fucked this up, now you're going to fix it.\" \"Fucked what up?\" she moaned. \"How in the hell can I fix anything? My cab is wrecked. You don't need me anymore, just shoot me or let me go!\" He stopped, letting go of her. She almost fell to the ground, her legs nearly giving out under her, but she didn't. She stood there, swaying in the night breeze like a scarecrow, all arms and legs. When she was able to raise her head, she realized she was staring down the barrel of his gun. \"You want to die?\" he asked her. She just looked back at him. The trauma, the shock, the adrenaline, the apathy, all came crashing at once. She was going to faint, that's what was going to happen, she was going to… There . Sirens. Vincent's eyes jerked up and his gun withdrew just the slightest. Then, holstering it, he lunged for her and tossed her over his shoulder, then took off at a dead run down the next alley. The movement made the world swim and her hair blocked her vision of everything save Vincent's legs. How in the hell he was able to carry her and run so fast, she didn't have the foggiest, but it didn't seem to matter, as it was happening, it was real. How long he went, she didn't know, but the world browned in and out several times before he stopped and set her on her feet, his hands firm on her shoulders before he propped her up against a wall. She slid down, nearly on her backside. She started to cough, the saliva in her throat slipping down the wrong pipe and choking her. Vincent had knelt down and was rummaging through something. She realized as her cough cleared that it was his briefcase. \"Justice building,\" he said, more to himself than to her. \"Just a few blocks that way. Get on your feet.\" He snapped the briefcase shut and seized her hand, and she was forced to run alongside him for two blocks before they came to a large building A building she recognized from earlier that night. The building where she had picked him up. Vincent reached to his waist for something, and she realized he had a very large tangle of keys and cards hanging there. One card went through a security strip and the door popped open, but the guard sitting at the stand inside didn't seem to happy to see a man coming in, dragging a half-struggling girl behind him. Vincent shot him without blinking. Callie screamed, jerked, her adrenaline returning. \"Move!\" Vincent snarked at her, giving her a particularly brutal yank. He dragged them both through another security-cleared turnstile and then headed for the elevator. There, she was allowed to slink into the corner and catch her breath. \"What…what are you…going to do with me?\" she managed to direct at his back as he watched the numbers light up for the floors. \"Shut up,\" he snapped. The elevator came to a stop, and Vincent turned to her, grasping her by the hair on the back of her neck. She squealed in surprise and then pain, but had no choice but to move her feet as he propelled her now in front of him, into the hallway, toward an office door. Behind her, his foot snaked out and kicked down the door, the gun pointed into the room Which was empty. Callie's eyes settled on the plaque just outside the door. Two names appeared, but it was the title that caught her eye. District prosecutors . Vincent shoved her into the room, tossing her down into a chair. He took something from his briefcase and dropped it onto the floor, temporarily abandoned. \"Get on the floor,\" he ordered. She looked up at him, still confused, and realized that her hesitation had come at the worst possible moment. Brutally, Vincent seized hold of her by the collar of her jacket and yanked her across the room, then kicked her feet out from under her, causing her to land in a heap at the foot of the desk, right by one of the legs. The back of her head jerked with the movement and smacked into the hard wooden edge, and the pain made her vision temporarily swim. Taking advantage of her swoon, Vincent grabbed both her wrists and she felt something thick and plastic loop around them, then pull painfully tight. He left her there to investigate the vacated desks, one of them having been recently occupied, if the smell of Chinese food coming from the white plastic boxes was to be believed. Callie was amazed to realize that the smell actually made her hungry. She could hear him kick at the chair and it slid across the floor, banging into the window. Then there was silence. Whatever he was doing, it couldn't be good. Callie felt the flesh on her arms begin to crawl, her muscles ache with the strain of being pulled so tightly behind her. He stepped quietly, back and forth, his stare on the desk. She couldn't see him, but she could picture it, and it frightened her how clear the picture was. Then, abruptly, he came around the desk, heading toward the door. \"Where are you going!\" she shrieked, not sure if she was more freaked out at him leaving, or her being left behind. \"Upstairs,\" was all he said, and then he was gone. 8888888888 Annie Farrell sat in the law library. She liked working here, it gave her access to anything she needed. It was a routine, that's what it was. It was the night before a big case, and this was her way of dealing with it. Sure, she loved her job, but it wasn't the easiest job. She represented the department of Justice. The fear that she was just running a charade all these years pressed upon her each time a new case started. The terror that her exhibits weren't in order and her opening statement was going to fall flat at the most important point was enough to induce her to a bout of tears, but those had passed about four hours ago. Now she was in her zone, reworking her exhibits, rewriting her opening statement, and she would stay at it until sleep finally demanded she doze for about an hour, and then the day would start, the trail would begin, and she'd be fine. The telephone was ringing. She didn't hear it at first. Her brain was so wrapped up in her statement that she was murmuring around loud to herself – which was fine, considering she was very much alone – and not even tuned in to outside noise. The building made enough noise to get attention to anyone who wasn't familiar with it – that was the way of these L.A. skyscrapers, the way they settled during the night, it was enough to convince a skittish person that the place was haunted. It didn't bother her. She liked the noise. She liked the feeling. The phone was just ringing and ringing and ringing . She looked down at it, slowly coming out of her work haze, and frowned. Who in the hell could be calling? More than likely it was a wrong number. She decided to let it pass. Then the thought of Max floated past her. He'd run through her head each time she'd come up for air, and now was not an exception. No, there was no way he was calling her, not at this strange hour. Dammit, the phone would not stop ringing . Finally, she picked it up. \"U.S. Attorney's Office,\" she said, her professional voice sounding strange to her own ears at this extremely late hour. \"Annie Farrell?\" came an unfamiliar voice. \"Yes?\" she scowled. \"This is Detective Ray Fanning, L.A.P.D. narcotics. I'm here with Agent Pedrosa of the F.B.I. He instructed me to call you and inform you that you're in danger.\" She scowled. Pedrosa was her Fed, the guy who was bringing her everything for the case. Some days she wasn't sure if he worked for her, or if she worked for him. But in spite of his pompous-ass attitude, the guy was good at what he did. \"What? What are you talking about? Is this a joke?\" \"No, ma'am,\" came Fanning's voice, dead calm and serious. He had the sort of confidence that took the edge off the fear that would have started creeping up her throat, but Annie wasn't the sort of woman who scared easily. The two times someone had attempted to mug her, she'd sent stiletto heels through their feet and neither one had walked again without thinking of her. \"I'm going to be straight with you, ma'am. There have been four executions tonight of the witnesses against Felix Reyes Torrena. A hit man that Felix hired may possibly be coming your way.\" \"My witnesses? What's going on? What do you know about my case?\" \"Enough to know that you're in danger. We have a squad headed your way, so don't—\" Just then the entire building went black. 8888888888 Callie felt the throbbing in the back of her head where it had smacked into the desk. She wished she could rub it, not that it would actually do any physical good, but psychologically it might make the pain recess a bit. Instinctively, she started to tug at the plastic strips that bound her. The kind of plastic strips used to bind packages in post offices, she was sure. The stuff had some give…if she could just get it to stretch far enough to slip her hands through A few minutes of that and the numbness in her fingers where the circulation was starting to get cut off was enough to clear that delusion. No, the only way she could get out of this was if she could somehow lift up the desk… That was stupid. This thing was made of a combination of oak and steel, and when she tried to stand herself up, the weight was tremendous. She cursed herself for not being more faithful to a work-out program, like Ray had always suggested. You want to be in a cop's line of work, you gotta be fit. No time like the present, Opie. Opie . He would call her Opie when he was teasing her. She hadn't though of that in a while. Like that kid on Andy Griffith, who grew up to become Ron Howard, director extraordinaire. Maybe someday, he would make a movie about this night… If she lived to tell about it. Vincent should have shot her by now, of that she was dead certain. Maybe he hadn't done it on the street so as to not leave a body in the open. He'd been particularly conscious about that, she reminded herself, thinking back to the two kids he'd shot in the alley. But now that they were inside, she should be dead. But instead, he'd tied her up. Bloody hell if she was just going to sit here and wait for him to come back. Getting her feet under her in a heavy squat, she started to pull upward. This wasn't going to work. She could get the desk off the ground, but she couldn't get her hands out from under the chair leg. Somehow, she had to prop up the desk and slide her hands out at the same time, but that was impossible Unless she was able to topple the desk. Taking several deep breaths, using the last bits of strength she had, she lifted. She strained and pushed and yanked, knowing she just had to get the desk to tip so far and then gravity would take care of the rest. No, this wasn't working, the desk was at an angle and she couldn't get enough weight behind her. Unless she threw herself against the desk. Maybe that would work— Her wrists were going to be bruised and purple for a week, of that she was certain, when she felt the first ugly yank of her first failure. Steeling herself, blocking out the pain and amazed at her ability to do so, she tried again, this time turning herself so that the desk moved up, both front legs at once, long ways back, and then lifted up her foot to push against the bottom, which she was just able to reach. There was a thud and a jerk as she toppled, her back landing against the smooth wood and her feet in the air over her head. 8888888888 Annie looked around the office, wondering what in the hell could be going on. The phone was dead, and this was just all too creepy. She didn't know whether to shove aside her disbelief or to embrace it in the hopes that all of this was just going to be a dream. But no, she was awake, her heart was pounding, and the lights from outside gave everything a muted, green glow. Her eyes adjusted slowly, and focused on the largest source of light there was, the large glass wall through which the emergency lights glowed And a silhouette of a figure appeared, hands together in front of him, holding something that her imagination told her had to be a gun. She ducked down behind the desk, and watched. 8888888888 Bloody hell, she'd done it! Sliding forward, Callie's hands slipped easily around the loose desk leg. Now all she had to do was untie herself. There was another desk in the room. She made her way to it, searching with her eyes. If Vincent heard her, would he come back? She didn't know, which meant she also had no time. Frantic for anything with a sharp edge, she found a tape dispenser with a bright metal cutter. Turning, she pressed the plastic strip down against it, feeling the bite of the metal teeth against the soft part of her thumb, ignoring it as she rubbed, her hands going slick with blood but eventually the plastic giving way and freeing her hands. Then the lights flickered. All the electricity around her disappeared, leaving her in a black nothing. Ok, smart ass, now that you're free, what the hell are you going to do next? Struggling to hasted the adjustment of her eyes to the dim light, Callie raised her hands in front of her, groping her way to the door. When she found it, she realized that not all the power was out. Dim emergency lights hung in the hallway, and the elevators had to be on a back-up system, because their buttons glowed as if nothing had happened. She pressed the up button, remembering Vincent's last word. Upstairs. Where the hell upstairs? There had to be at least a dozen more floors to this building. She had absolutely no clue. But as she stood blinking in the sudden light of the interior of the elevator, she thought to herself, Come on, girl, you're a writer…if you were a prosecutor working in your office this late at night, and you weren't at your desk, where would you be? She looked down at the buttons. There was a smudge of blood on one of them, the 16. Beside it, carved into the panel, were the words: law library and files. She pressed the button. The doors slid shut and up she went.[Chapter 10] Disclaimer: Don't own, so don't sue. All right everybody, this is the last chapter of this story…but the sequel is in the works, and it just won't stop swirling around my head, so it might be a week or so before I get the first chapter up. If I can do it sooner, I will, but I'm not making any promises. And it will be rated M, as the new rating system goes, because things are going to get a bit...interesting. heh heh. So be sure to show your ID at the door. Special thanks to all my reviews, especially Dawnie-7, Hockey Gurl , and of course, Winged Seraph – her story over there is getting really good, guys, you need to go read and review! Plus all the other people who have dropped in their two cents from time to time, you are always welcome and I hope to hear from you all again come the sequel! Chapter Ten: Think Anybody Will Notice ? The silence and the darkness were comforting.Vincent listened to the sounds around him, acclimating, probing, sensing. He felt invisible here, and it was a pleasant feeling. This was all there was, the hunt, the kill. This was all his life was good for, all he was good for. He heard the sound. The faint scratching of stockings against carpet. He propelled himself toward the sound. The woman had long, black hair that hung across her back like a curtain. She didn't hear him at first, but pure tension forced her to turn her head and look behind her. She let out a small, breathy gasp and turned around, pushing herself as far away from him as she could as the barrel of Vincent's gun came level with her head. She was against the wall, looking afraid, as they all looked afraid, and then she shut her eyes and turned away, unwilling to see it coming. She was brave, he had to give her that. Other women would have been shrieking and crying hysterically by now There was a noise. Vincent looked up, startled. Someone was charging through the darkness, toward him. He caught the outline of a figure, saw something bright and metal rise into the air— And barely shifted his hands in time to catch the heavy metal chair that had been flung at him. One of the legs got past his barricade and caught him smartly in the ear, sending a flare of pain through his head. It was just enough to make him lose his balance, and he landed on the ground with a thud. 8888888888 Callie watched Vincent topple, and looked down at where his gun had been pointed. A woman huddled there, Callie couldn't make out anything in the dark, she just reached out and seized a hand, yanking the girl to her feet and dragging her with him. \"Callie!\" came Vincent's enraged scream as he rose up from the ground. \"Run!\" Callie shrieked at the woman as they both headed for the door to the hallway. There was the sound of thunder and explosions, glass shattering so loud it was more terrifying than the rage that came behind it. The elevator door was still open, doubtless because the building was very empty and its programming gave it little else to do. Callie nearly hurled the woman into it in front of her as she caught the door and spun herself around, her thumb locking down onto the \"close doors\" button. The darkness outside disappeared behind a wall of bright silver steel. In the elevator, Callie turned and looked at the woman in the corner, still stunned out of her mind. But she was a quick study, this one, and managed to gather her wits enough to ask a very good question. \"What the hell is going on?\" \"My name's Calliope Fanning,\" Callie said. \"Call me Callie. I take it you're Annie?\" \"You know who I am?\" \"I saw it on your office door.\" \"My office?\" Annie repeated, this time in anger, as if feeling violated. \"Long, long story,\" Callie panted. \"We have to get as far away from here as we can, and I'll explain everything…but not now.\" \"Wait a minute…Fanning? Do you know a Detective Fanning?\" Callie stopped, her breathing suspended for a moment. \"My brother?\" \"He called, warned me something was going to happen…he said a squad was on the way but he got cut off—\" Callie shook her head. \"I don't think he's going to make it in time.\" She looked down at Annie's feet. \"Lose the heels. You can't run in those.\" Without hesitation, Annie flipped them off. She looked at the other woman again, scowling. She knew her from somewhere…earlier that night…\"Max,\" she said aloud as the bell sounded, signaling that their floor was near. Annie frowned. \"What about Max—you know him?\" \"You were the woman from the cab, earlier…when I picked up Vincent…the man who's chasing us.\" Callie shook her head, knowing she wasn't making any sense to the lawyer, but knew she didn't have time. \"That's when I met Vincent, when he got into my cab, when all this mess started.\" The elevator doors opened and they charged out. Callie reached out and caught Annie's arm, her eyes catching a sign far to the right. Annie spun on her, frustration in her face. \"This is the street!\" she said, as if it should be obvious. \"This way,\" Callie said, her eyes finally focusing on the metro sign. Vincent would be down any second, no doubt he was charging the stairs four at a time. He would expect them to take to the street, but at this hour of the night, with everything deserted and empty, they would be easy prey. The metro, however, meant people. And it meant options. Yanking on Annie's arm again, she directed her toward the escalator, where they hustled down as fast as they could without falling. 8888888888 Vincent was so angry, too angry. He shouldn't be this angry. It was bad to be this angry. It made him sloppy, careless. He was going to make a mistake. He put the energy into his feet. He hardly felt he impact as he slammed them again and again against the hard tile of the landings in between the flights of stairs. Before he knew it, he was back in the main hall. He turned to the left, where the front doors awaited. But no, something stopped him. The street was too quiet. Nobody had been through those doors. He turned around, looked the other way – And saw the metro sign. Without hesitation, he pursued. 8888888888 Annie had shifted in her grip and was now gripping her back, their arms linked as if they were long lost sisters who had just found each other. As Callie slowed, Annie slowed with her, the connection between them immediate and intimate. \"Which way?\" Annie asked. Callie looked down. \"Escalator,\" she said, dragging the woman behind her down another flight. When they reached the bottom, just then, there was a flashing of light and the distant sound of brakes. \"Stop!\" Callie barked, and they froze. Turning, Callie watched the escalator they had just left, making sure to stay just far back enough so that whoever was at the top couldn't see them. Nothing. Had Vincent followed them, or had he been successfully tricked? Fat chance . She turned around, saw the next escalator going up. Vincent was going to think that they would hop on the next train, and any second he was going to appear on those stairs. But what if they went back upstairs again? There was another track, going perpendicular, cutting the station effectively in half. He couldn't follow, not without coming down here first, and by then, it would be too late for him to catch them if by some strange luck there was another train up above. These thoughts were neither logical nor random in her head, they simply existed, and she acted on them. She started up the escalator, taking the steps two a time, Annie barely keeping up with her. 8888888888 Vincent stopped in time to see the second train roll in. He looked down. The other train's doors had slid open, and waited for passengers to enter. Where were they? Which train? He looked up, he looked down, he felt himself begin to move, stopped himself with a mild stumble, and then moved again. He ran forward. There was a track separating him from that train, no entrance on from this way. The train was starting to move. He jumped. He landed on the median. The train was just starting to pick up speed. He jumped again, reaching, every muscle in his left arm straining with the effort. 8888888888 They crawled on the filthy floor, but Callie paid no notice, and Annie made not a sound. They hunkered down, out of sight of the windows, and waited. The doors hissed shut. The train started to move. Slowly, so slowly, Callie pulled herself up, found that her palms were slick with sweat and slid against the cold metal bars. She had to sit down in one of the cheaply lined blue and plastic chairs to keep from falling back to the floor. Annie was panting. She had run her stockings, which was a good thing, as nylon got nearly no traction on the slick tile flooring. Still, it was better than running in those blasted heels. The woman was in shape, Callie had to hand it to her. The only thing keeping herself going was the adrenaline. She was so full of it now, she doubted she would feel it if the train suddenly decided to flip over and landed on them all. There was a pounding sound coming from somewhere distant to their left. Callie leaned forward, not sure if it was just a loud sound, or if her hearing was so intensified by the situation, she had temporarily become Superman – or Supergirl, as the case may be. A flicker of movement. Callie didn't hesitate. \"SHIT!\" she rasped, grabbing at Annie again. The other woman was on her feet in a blink, this being her first adrenaline rush of the evening. She was all panic and running, and Callie let her get in front of her, not sure if it was some kind of protective instinct or if it was the anger that Vincent was chasing them. Vincent was chasing them . God knew what he was going to do. She almost wanted to find out. He'd had a dozen chances to kill her, had even shot at her before, but now, this was serious, and she had a bizarre desire to push her death into his face, to make him take some kind of action and just stop leaving her hanging all the damn time… \"There's a station!\" Annie said, and they swung into the gap by the doors, hiding behind the metal barricades, and waited. 8888888888 Vincent crashed through the doors, one after the next. He caught the flash of dark hair ahead of him and increased his pace, but the girls were fast, he had to give them credit. Then he felt the train start to slow. They were going to try and get off. He moved toward the closest door and waited. The train stopped, and the doors popped open. Vincent moved sideways, into the station, and pointed his gun forward. 8888888888 Callie leaned out, caught a flash of gray, and pulled back in. Annie was standing there, watching her, unnerved by her unwillingness to get off the train. \"He's out there,\" Callie hissed at her. Annie mouthed a curse, looked around, desperate for something, anything – Callie found herself wondering what would happen if she ran out there. If she ran right into Vincent's path. Would he just fire? Or would he hesitate long enough for her to make a break for it down the stairs? Would he chase her or would he just get right back on the train? No, Callie couldn't risk it, she couldn't leave Annie alone. She felt the urge to laugh, bitterly. \"You know,\" she said, just as the bell sounded and the doors began to close, \"Vincent almost got into Max's cab.\" Annie looked at her, even more discomfited, if that were possible. \"What?\" \"He walked away. Probably because Max was in dreamland over you. He came over to my cab, I took him, I shouldn't have…tell Max how close he came to being right here, when you see him.\" \"When I see him?\" Annie echoed. \"What are you—\" \"Callie!\" came the scream. Both women jumped. \"Run,\" Callie said, \"when I move into the aisle. Head for the driver, tell him to call the police.\" Annie shook her head. \"I can't leave you! He'll kill you!\" Callie stepped out, not hearing her. She stood in the middle of the car, and motioned behind her for Annie to run. Vincent threw open the last door and stood there, gun on her, enraged, bleeding from the nick the chair leg had made in his ear. The blood stained his dark suit, accenting the tears from the earlier accident. \"I do this for a living, Callie,\" he said, a bit softer, but not much. The car was empty around them. \"You want her, you go through me,\" Callie said. Vincent almost smiled. \"What, that's supposed to be a threat?\" He turned his gun and fired. The bullet screamed past her, hit the plastic behind her, shattered it with an explosion. Annie shrieked behind her, pushing hard at the door that separated her from the driver's cab, her panic making it a more difficult task than it should have been. Vincent stepped forward. He lowered his gun just a little, and Callie lunged at him, catching the gun with both hands. She struggled for it, trying to keep the barrel away from her and away from Annie, but Vincent was far stronger than her. He looked down into her face and he smiled. \"You know, I gave you credit for being smarter than this,\" he said. The next thing she knew, something hard had caught her right against the side of her face, right behind her eye, and her face felt like it was exploding. She landed on the floor of the car, winded, staring at the ceiling. Then she heard it. She heard the three shots, heard the muffled cry of death. Callie screamed. She didn't know why she screamed, not until a long time later. The moment suspended itself, as her scream seemed to come back onto her, drawing back into her lungs, choking her into sobs. How long she really lay there, she didn't know. She felt utterly alone, abandoned, forsaken. She looked up at the blank, white ceiling, her mind reeling, everything crashing on her at once. And then Vincent appeared. He looked down into her face, then bent over her. \"Get up,\" he said. She just stared at him, hating him. He bent closer. \"Come on, Callie. It's almost over.\" Was that…tenderness she heard? No, that was too twisted. She looked away from him, then felt his hand against her cheek, felt him pull her closer to him again. \"I'm sorry I hit you,\" he said, his fingers stroking the slowly-forming bruise behind her eye. She scowled, incredulous. \"You're…you're sorry ?\" She pulled herself up, hiccupping on her tears, hardly able to breathe with the force of her sobs, which still pounded out of her, involuntarily now. He shook his head, looking into her eyes, really looking now, as if what had happened hadn't just happened. \"You should have stayed tied up, Callie. It was for your own good. Now you had to go dragging us all the way out here.\" Vincent looked over his shoulder, at what, she didn't want to think. The thought of Annie… oh, God, Annie… Callie curled away from him, sobbing harder now, burying her face in her arms on the dirty, ugly floor of the metro car. She felt movement on her arm, it felt wrong, it felt like her skin had stopped feeling at all. Someone was rubbing her there but she couldn't feel it. \"You're getting awfully bent out of shape over someone you knew for five minutes,\" Vincent said, still sitting beside her, now leaning over her, sheltering her with his body. He laughed, a short, dark sound. \"Think anybody will even notice her before the sun comes up?\" Callie sobbed harder, and tried to crawl away from him. Anything, just any distance at all, an inch, a centimeter, a millimeter , it would help. He grasped her shoulder, pulling her arm away, giving him a view of her face. \"Callie, look at me,\" he pleaded, his voice still laced with that hard, angry edge. She shook her head, refused. \"No,\" she groaned, then threw her other arm over her face, and twisted away. \"God, let it just be over…just get it over, Vincent. Just shoot me and end it, for God's sake!\" If she'd been more together, she would have noticed Vincent's startled expression, the pullaway, the way his eyebrows came together. \"Get up, Callie,\" he said, straining to keep his voice gentle. \"Why?\" she cried, dissolving into sobs and whines again. \"Why get up? Just leave me here, with her…just…just do it, Vincent. Don't play with me anymore, please, for the love of…God…anything…just please, I'm begging you, stop .\" Her last words finished in nearly a whisper. There was silence for a moment, and then, abruptly, Vincent pulled her to her feet. \"We're almost at the next stop,\" he said, pulling her into his arms. He looped one firmly around her and grasped a bar above him with the other, steadying them both. He pressed her against his chest, and she had no choice but to muffle her sobs against his shirt, as she was unable to get any other breathing room. Once she stopped pushing against him, he gave her a little more space, but didn't let go. Finally, she raised her eyes to his, knowing there wasn't any other way. He looked down at her, and gave her the smallest of smiles. He let go of the bar, and she realized that the train had stopped. He grasped her hand. \"Come on,\" he said. \"It's time to go.\" 8888888888 The blue line connected into the green line, which lead right to the airport. At the very next stop Vincent pulled her off, and she followed, pushed past her point of endurance, now just a dead weight hanging off the end of his hand. How they wound up getting back on another train to another station and a connection, she would never remember. She would never remember those moments, except in fragments and dreams. When they arrived at the airport, the sky was light, the sun hadn't made its first appearance but the morning had the fresh scent that only California could create. The winds swayed the tall palm trees from the south, making them bend and dance. The cold entrance to the airport was like entering a prison. Vincent had her firmly in tow, and she no longer had a single clue as to what to expect. What she was still doing with him, it made absolutely no sense, he should have killed her by now, he should have killed her when he killed Annie, hell, before he'd even gone to find Annie. With no luggage to check and an e-ticket, all Vincent had to do was stop at a check-in terminal, punch the right buttons, and he was cleared to go. Looking around him carefully, his eyes going up and down Callie once to make sure she didn't look suspiciously haggard, he made their way to a seating alcove, right in front of the security check in. Vincent looked down at his watch. \"Five-forty,\" he said with a nearly jovial smile. \"The plane has already landed, they're boarding on time.\" He turned his smile to her, his grip on her hand gentling. \"So now we say goodbye.\" She lifted her eyes to meet his. Red-rimmed and nearly swollen, they took him in with the kind of amazement that a torture victim might feel to suddenly discover themselves liberated. \"You're…you're letting me go?\" she whispered. He stepped closer, his face close to hers. \"I should never have gotten into your cab, Callie,\" he sighed. His breath felt warm against her cold cheek. He let go of her hand, and took her chin in his fingers. Then, he lifted both hands, letting his fingers slide into her hair, pulling her close in a lover's embrace. As their faces neared, Callie was sure it was just a show, a final act, to put the last touches on a splendid performance before he vanished for the curtain call. Softly, his lips closed over hers. She didn't respond, didn't even move, and he sensed it. He pulled away, puzzlement in his face, and then, something she didn't think could possibly emerge from those cold green depths. Remorse. He held her eyes, waiting, counting the minutes. It seemed that he could have stared at her forever, expectant, waiting. What he wanted from her, she didn't know. Her eyes narrowed a bit, her rage starting to flicker again. To her surprise, the corner of his mouth quirked into a grin. \"There she is,\" he murmured. \"I was wondering where you'd gotten to.\" He shuffled in his pockets, then brought something out in his fist. He took her hand in his free one, then enclosed it in both of his, and she felt the rough caress of the bills in her palm. \"I owed you three hundred more, plus an extra hundred, think of it as hazard pay.\" She raised an eyebrow. Her fingers had closed around the money only because Vincent had made them, and she wanted to let go of it, wanted to throw it at him, to do anything, but not to take it, hell no, it felt dirty and wrong to even have it in her hand. Her lips parted to speak, but Vincent kissed her again, and this time, she had no choice but to accept it. It was a strange thing, what happened. His mouth pressed against hers, his hot breath flowing into her mouth, the taste of him, the touch of his tongue against hers, so humbly requesting entrance, the feel of him so hopeful, so hesitant. She wanted to pull away, even felt her body weight start to shift back as reflex tried to put space between them, tried to reject what was happening. It was like holding a block of ice to the side of a hot stove. The ice started to melt, against its will. Unable to withstand the strain, her mouth twisted to join with his, just to relieve the pressure. He took full advantage, pulling her closer and closer until she was sure she could feel every part of him, that he was touching every part of her at once. Then, slowly, he pulled away. She felt a terrible betrayal when the sensation of a blush crept into her cheeks, and her hands, with a will of their own, still clung to him, reluctant. When had they ever grasped at him? She didn't know, didn't care. She yanked them away as soon as she noticed them, but it was too late. He was smiling at her. Smiling in such a strange way, a way she had not seen that evening. It was so strange that he was going to leave now, and it really was going to be over. He stepped away, reached into his pocket for his boarding pass, and took the half-dozen steps to the security guard to hand it to her. He tossed Callie one last look over his shoulder, went through the checkpoint, and disappeared into the crowd. 8888888888 Epilogue \"This is impossible. She shouldn't be alive.\" The monitor just slowly beep, beep, beeped. The patient in the bed was not out of danger, not by a long shot, but that heart just kept beating, and as long as it kept beating, there was life. It didn't show any inclination to stop. Ray stood outside the intensive care unit, looking through the fiberglass window at the prone figure of Annie Farrell. Letting out a deep, stress-filled sigh, he turned and walked toward the waiting room area. He hadn't been quite sure what he'd expected when he'd picked Callie up from the airport a little less than an hour ago. She'd called from a payphone, and she sounded so hollow, so distant, that he almost didn't recognize her voice. She'd also been remarkably serene about everything, level-headed and calm as she told him what had happened on the subway (although the rest of the details of the story he hadn't heard yet, and somehow doubted he wanted to). He'd gotten the paramedics to roughly the right place at the right time, and what they'd found was amazing. Callie still didn't look right. She was so terribly pale, her hair was flush against her skull, in bad need of a good washing. Whenever Callie stressed, it seemed to go right to her hair, a trait she had never been happy with. Her voice was strained, her eyes were bloodshot, and her lips Her lips were bruised. \"I can't believe he missed,\" she whispered to him as he sat down beside her. Ray shook his head. \"I saw the other bodies, Callie. This guy doesn't miss.\" She wouldn't look at him. Her eyes were turned away, down, toward the tile floor. Her eyes seemed to be tracing the lines there, over and over, trying to find a pattern. The doctor came out, still in his scrubs but with the mask and gloves disposed, a clipboard in his hand. He was shaking his head. \"I've seen a lot of things,\" he said, \"but this one is for the history books.\" Ray stood up, even though he had just sat down. He felt like a Jack-In-The-Box. \"So what's the story?\" The doctor, his name was Lemming, met him straight in the eyes. \"That woman had two bullets in her chest and one in her head. That kind of grouping didn't leave any room for doubt.\" The sharp eyes slid to Callie, but wisely didn't address her. \"Something must have gone wrong, or it's a miracle, plain and simple.\" \"So she's going to make it?\" \"If she makes it to noon, I'll be more confident,\" the man said. \"The bullet in her brain missed the apex. It went to the right, toward the soft tissue. She'll need a lot of physical therapy and I doubt she'll ever practice law again, especially considering the two bullets in her chest are responsible for the lack of blood to the brain, which was where the real damage was done. Yet they also veered to the right, missing the major arteries, hitting her lung and the other passing through, tearing a nice hole in its own right but nothing we weren't able to repair and that time won't heal.\" Ray looked down at Callie, and was startled to find her looking up at them, her eyes wide, haunted. \"This is impossible,\" Ray murmured, almost against his will. Callie looked away again, her head shaking slightly. \"Did he know?\" she whispered. The doctor was watching them both curiously, Ray noticed, and so he decided to remove the audience. \"Thank you, doctor,\" he said with an air of finality as he sat down beside his sister. The man got the message and moved on, busy enough with his night. \"You don't know?\" Ray asked. \"You don't think it was deliberate?\" \"Why would it be deliberate?\" Callie said, still not looking at him. \"Why would he do that?\" \"He might have been…distracted,\" Ray tried, treading lightly. Callie shook her head, her expression turning fierce. \"No, he wasn't distracted.\" \"Look, Cal,\" Ray said gently, putting an arm delicately around her frame, \"a professional like that, I mean…you don't make a mistake like that, it just isn't possible. The only way he could have done that was if it was on purpose. Like the only way a genius could possibly fail a test was if they knew all the right answers and deliberately picked the wrong ones.\" The fierce expression didn't leave. \"That doesn't make any sense, Ray. You don't…I mean, this guy…\" She struggled for words, growing frustrated. \"Shh, Cal, it's okay, you don't have to talk about it yet,\" Ray said. \"You've been through a lot. I want to get you somewhere safe. Why don't we go to Dad's?\" \"Oh, God,\" Callie moaned, slapping her hand against her forehead. \"Oh, God, Ray, don't tell Dad about this. He will totally freak out!\" Ray frowned. \"Well, yeah, but –\" \"No, no, I mean…\" she finally looked up at him. \"I had to take him to Dad's house. Before. Remember?\" Ray turned pale. \"That man was in Dad's house ?\" \"It's your fault, you made me go,\" she muttered. Ray was almost relieved to find that that comment had a tone that sounded faintly normal. \"I knew you'd figure out a way to blame all of this on me,\" Ray said, taking her hand and pulling her upright. \"Come on, we're going. You can tell me whatever you want, whenever you want. I'm just…\" He pulled her closer to him, wrapping his arm tightly about her shoulder. \"I'm just glad you're safe.\" Callie nodded. Ray did not realize that the closeness between them, the tightness of his grip, which had always been comforting and familiar in the past, suddenly brought on new memories. And it was just as well that she didn't tell him. 8888888888 Vincent settled himself into his chair. First class all the way, he hated coach, it meant being smashed into a tiny place like a bunch of canned sausages. He liked the room in first class, he liked the food, he liked the quiet, and he also liked flirting with the stewardesses. He sighed deeply as he turned away from the one who had been waiting on him, disinterested. He was right, he should never have gotten into Callie's cab. It had been a mistake, he'd known it from minute one, and yet he'd done it anyway. Stupid. That was all it was. He also knew that he was damn lucky to be alive after the evening's chaotic events. That didn't really bother him, though. There really wasn't a good reason to live or to die, not for him, and the only thing that made it all bearable was the jazz, the improvisation, the rhythm and the lack of reason. But, after all, the past was the past, the future lay ahead of him, and he was on his way home, as far away from the stinking sinkhole of L.A. as he could be. Yet…somehow…he knew that from now on, he would think of L.A. a bit more fondly, because of that one little star. The one who would probably never quite be able to shake off the feeling of his kiss. It was amazing how he could still so soundly believe that he was lost in space, and yet he had managed to crash into the singular body in the world that could affect him so uniquely. Life never made much sense to him anyway. And he wasn't even going to use the word love in the context of himself. He shrugged it off, sliding the headphones back on, letting himself get lost in a sea of jazz, and trying not to think about that dance he'd shared with her, to the slow, seductive rhythm of a saxophone, in a jazz club he would probably never visit again. Sometimes it was just too bad. And sometimes it wasn't bad at all.[Chapter 11] I love DVD blooper reels and deleted scenes. I love them so much that I made one for \"Lost In Space.\" I don't own any of the characters whose names appear in People Magazine on a regular basis, and please keep in mind that this is COMEDY, and JUVENILE comedy for that matter, so don't be offended, all bashing is done in good fun.

Crossword scene Callie and Max sit together Callie: So what's a nice guy like you doing driving a cab for 12 years? Max: It's temporary. Callie: Twelve years isn't temporary, Max. Vincent: That isn't your line. ( Max wets his pants ) Writer: Chill out, Max, he's not here for you. Look, I told you to wait in the parking garage. Vincent: (whimpers) But it's loooonely out there! And I'm bored. Writer: Oh bloody hell...(sighs) Here, take these key cards and go play with them. See what kind of trouble you can get into. Vincent: (skips away) Yay! 8888888888 Max: What's a five letter word for \"behind?\" Lenny: Booty? Callie: I want that guy fired. Can't we get Danny DeVito? At least he makes perversity look funny. 8888888888 Ext. Justice Building: Max and Annie's scene. (Annie hands Max her card .) Annie: In case you ever want to investigate...uh...something...or...I dunno... Michael: Cut! That's \"Investigate a fortune five-hundred company or argue cab routes,\" ok? Max: (Drools on the card) Whatever, honey, I'll call you, we'll hook up. Annie: Cool. (Walks away) Michael: All right, that's it, you're both fired. Vincent, go to the next cab! ( Vincent appears on the curb, looks around, and then heads toward Callie's cab.) Callie: Yippie! Vincent: Cool, I might get some in this movie. Haven't done that in a bit. Not on screen anyway. 8888888888 Ext. Justice Building ( Callie pulls up to the curb. She moves forward slowly, slowly...and then hits the car in front of her .) Callie: Oh, shit...cut! I told you I have poor depth perception! 8888888888 Int. Cab Vincent: So how long do you think this will take? Callie: What, I have Mapquest written on my forehead? Michael: Cut! 8888888888 Vincent: (to Callie) So you're interested in criminals? Catching them, understanding them...undressing them? (gives sexy eyebrow-raise) ( Audience stampedes the set. Within seconds, Vincent is sitting in the backseat, naked .) Michael: CUT! 8888888888 Vincent: How much do you make a night? Callie: Three, maybe four hundred... Vincent: I'll make it six hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you give me a lap dance... Audience: Hell, we'd do that for free! 8888888888 Int. Cab ( Callie looks into the back seat to see that Vincent has left his briefcase behind ) Callie: Some people. ( She looks up and down the alley. Then she reaches into the back seat and pick up the briefcase. Dragging it into the front seat, she opens it and finds...women's underwear .) Vincent (through the window): Knew you'd look! 8888888888 Ext. Alley ( Callie sits in the cab and waits ) (A body comes crashing down from a broken window and lands on the cab. Callie looks up, annoyed, and then gets out of the cab.) (Vincent runs into the alley) Callie: What kind of idiot hitman lets a body fall out a window? Vincent: I know...doesn't make me look too cool, does it. Callie: Get the writer. We are so fixing this. 8888888888 Int. Ramon's apartment (Ray Fanning enters, gun drawn, scoping the room. Big dramatic close-up on the face, until we reach the bedroom, where he sees...a dead body on the floor) Ray: What the fu? That's not in the script. Writer: I changed it. Ray: Why? Writer: Because any hit-man worth his salt is so not going to let a body fall out the window. I don't care where the guy is when he shoots him. You know how fast he'd have to be going to hit that glass and break it? Ray: But what about the sub-plot where I play the by-the-book detective who puts all the pieces together and gets it all right? Writer: You WANT to get shot at the end and die a cheap death? Ray: Good point. 8888888888 Ext. Alley Punk: Gimmie your fuckin' purse, bitch! Callie: I'm sorry...are you sure you aren't Kid Rock? Punk: Do I LOOK LIKE I'm Kid Rock? Callie: Actually, yeah. Can I have your autograph? 8888888888 Ext. Alley Vincent: Hey, Hommie, is that my briefcase? (The punks turn around, take one look at Vincent, and run away like screaming little girls.) Vincent: (picks up briefcase) That's what I thought. 8888888888 (Vincent hauls the body of the Punk into the trunk) Callie: See, I told you he looked like Kid Rock. Vincent: Just as well. I hate Kid Rock. Kid-Rock: Hey! (Vincent slams down the hood. The Punk's fingers are in the way) CRUNCH Callie: Ewww! I am not cleaning that up! 8888888888 Behind the Scenes Vincent and Callie sit in their chairs as they wait for the next take. Callie reaches over and takes the huge keychain/cardholder from his belt. Callie: Doesn't this thing weigh a ton? Vincent: Yeah, and it bangs against my hip all the time. Callie: What the hell are all these things, anyway? Vincent: Well, this one is to get me past security in the Justice Building...this is my preferred shoppers card from Ralphs... 8888888888 Ext. Gas Station Vincent: Come on, I'll buy you a drink. Callie: I'd rather you paid for gas. You see the price of this stuff? Vincent: Holy shit! For that money, we may as well drink it! 8888888888 Vincent: ...this is the key to my mother's house, this is the key to my girlfriend's house, this card gets me a great discount at Kohl's, you know they have everything there... 8888888888 Vincent: Come on, Callie...there isn't any reason for there to be hard feelings between us. Callie (Looks down): You sure? (Vincent looks down at the bulge in his pants. He just grins.) 8888888888 Vincent: ...this is my Hot Topic card, they have really cool '80's stuff there, although I'm still waiting on some Risky Business merchandise to show up... 8888888888 Int. Parking Gargage Under the Jazz club. Vincent smooths out Callie's hair. Callie: Hmmmm...(enjoying it immensely) Vincent: Um...Callie? Callie: Yeah? Vincent: I think you have dandriff... Michael: CUT! 8888888888 Vincent smooths out Callie's hair. Callie: (starts purring) Vincent: Oh great...remember, I'm a sociopath, you're supposed to be afraid of me? Callie: Since when was any of this about reality? So why don't we check out the shocks in the cab by rocking the back seat? Vincent: Jazz first. Callie: (pouts) Fine. 8888888888 (Vincent walks down the hallway to the restrooms with Callie. Callie goes through the door. A second later, her hand reaches out, grasps Vincent by the lapels, and drags him in. A bunch of NOISES can be heard, and then Vincent comes out, blushing, disheveled, and his face smeared with lipstick.) Vincent: Get that woman another drink! 8888888888 Vincent: ...this is my Curves membership, they signed me up free even though it's for women only, I guess they figured it would be good for business... 8888888888 Int. Jazz Club (The table in front of Vincent, Callie and Daniel is laden with empty drinking glasses) Callie (smashed, raising her current empty glass into the air): Garcon! Another! Vincent: How many have you had? Callie: As many swallows as it takes to carry a coconut. Or something. Vincent: You're not going to be able to drive. Callie: I can drivehell, I can fly! (flaps her arms) Vincent: But not legally. Callie: You care about legal? You're a hit man! Daniel: Excuse me? Callie: Yeah, he's a hit man, he's going to get all friendly with you, and then like the bad-ass he thinks he is, he's going to make some cold remark about the guys who hired him, and he's gonna play you and make you think he might let you go because you play really good jazz, but in the end he'll put three in your forehead before you can blink, so take some advice, fat man, and run like hell. Vincent: (sighs) She's just pissed at me because I wouldn't have sex with her in the back seat. Callie: Damn skippy! (Bangs glass against the table) I said another! 8888888888 Vincent: ...this is my Sam's Club card, this is my Preferred Reader card from Borders, and this key is to the diary I keep in the top drawer of my dresser... 8888888888 Ext. Jazz Club (\"The spark went through them both, back and forth a couple of times. It seemed that his lips were never going to let go...She stopped fighting, falling limp against him, only her willpower keeping her on her feet. She let her arms hang, then slowly drew them back to her body as he relaxed his grip, and then, when the kiss broke, she just stared at him, too shaken to speak.\") Vincent: Damn, this is so much more fun than kidnapping Jamie Foxx. OR Callie: Oh, so you shoot a guy, and now you want to make out. That's just...gross. 8888888888 Ext. Jazz Club (Callie and Ray are on the phone, Vincent watching) Ray: I stumbled into a crime scene about an hour ago and now I'm getting dragged all over town. Callie: Crime scene? What's going on? Ray: Well, there was supposed to be this broken window and a bunch of glass in an alley, which made for a really compelling mystery, but then I got accosted by some psychotic, obsessive writer who was hell-bent on changing everything, and now my story line has been reduced to really boring background stuff. Callie: Oh, I'd just wait it out. Things might get interesting pretty soon. Ray: What, you know something? Callie (looks at Vincent): Um, you're breaking up. Gotta go, bye. Vincent: You know, I sometimes wonder why I don't just shoot you. Callie: Because you want to screw me, remember? Vincent: Yeah. Stupid writer, since when did I get a libido? Callie: Since you entered the fanfic world, man. Now let's get on with that next snog scene, make Eccentric Banshee happy. 8888888888 Int. Callie's Father's House Ray Sr: I'm going to totally embarrass Callie Callie: Da-ad! Not in front of the good looking hit-man! Ray Sr:by asking you if you're one of those guys that insists on girls being skinny as rails. Vincent: I'm not. I like my women with...curves. (The ground begins to tremble as every single fangirl in the Collateral fandom rushes Vincent and effectively smothers him in a dogpile of girl-flesh.) Vincent: Cut! 8888888888 Int. Morgue Widener: I just know how excited you get, Ray. Ray: Fuck you. Widener: No, this isn't a slash fic, we can't...but I'll keep it in mind for next time. 8888888888 Ext. Callie's Father's House (Vincent and Callie make out in front of the taxi) Callie: Why does this feel familiar? Vincent: What are you talking about? Callie: The way you're unbottoning my shirt. It's exactly like in Eyes Wide Shut. Vincent: I don't know what you're talking about. Callie: Yeah, that scene where you went to that prostitute's apartment and couldn't find her, so you decided to have sex with her roommate instead! You were a really horny bastard in that movie. Vincent: You are really spoiling the moment. Callie: All of that to cheat on Nicole Kidman. That's really lousy. Vincent: Forget it, I'm out of here. Callie: And then you start dating that chick with the same last name as you! And then you dumped her! You seriously have problems with committment, you know that? Michael: CUT! 8888888888 Vincent: ...and this is my Mission Impossible spy-card whenever I want to pretend to be a secret agent... 8888888888 Int. Abandoned Restaurant: Fed Scene Widener: Richard Widener, L.A.P.D., narcotics. Ray: Ray Fanning, L.A.P.D., narcotics... Pedrosa: Yeah, yeah, stuff it, I'm only talking to you because I have to. Widener: Yeah, thanks for seeing us, Frank. Ray: Wipe that brown spot off your nose, Richard. Pedrosa: What the hell do you two want, anyway? Ray: Hey, aren't you the guy from Miami Vice? Pedrosa: What if I am? Ray: Well, you'd better be careful. You got shot on that show quite a bit...wouldn't want something like that to happen again. (CUT ToClub Scene) (Pedrosa lies on the floor, remarkably calm for a guy who just got shot in the leg.) Pedrosa: Damn. I shoulda had a V-8 (Ray takes a picture with his camera phone) Ray: Told ya! 8888888888 Int. FEVER (Bodies thrive and dance everywhere) (Three girls dance together, the camera showing only their hips and legs.) (Vincent pushes his way through them.) Girl #1: Hey, Tom Cruise just touched my ass! Girl #2: I thought he was gay. Why would he touch your ass? Girl #3: Tom Cruise is NOT gay! (Callie appears from behind and slaps girl #2. She falls unconscious, and then the three start dancing.) Girl #3: Tom Cruise isn't gay, but his girlfriend is! (Callie slaps girl #3 to the ground. Then she looks at girl #1) Callie: You got anything to add? Girl #1: Hey, Tom Cruise just touched my ass. I could die happy now. 8888888888 (Vincent pushes through the crowd. Suddenly a random fangirl throws herself at him.) Fangirl: Hey, is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? Vincent: (Shows it to her) It's a gun. (Fangirl screams and runs away. Vincent winks at the camera, points the gun at his mouth, and it squirts liquid into it.) 8888888888 ( Vincent grabs the first bodyguard and knocks him to the ground. Then he grabs the second one and they start fighting.) (Suddenly the music in the club changes from a fast-paced dance groove to a slow waltz.) (Vincent and the bodyguard stop fighting and start to dance across the floor.) Bodyguard: Wow, your breath sure smells nice. Vincent: Thanks, I put Scope in my squirt-gun. Girl #2: To cover up that sperm-scent. (Vincent draws his squirt gun and fires it at girl#2. It hits her dead in the eye and she runs away screaming) 8888888888 Vincent: ...this is my Walgreens card, this is my CVS pharmacy card, and this is my OSCO Drugs card... 8888888888 Callie sits at the bar, licking a Martini glass dry. Callie: Bartender, another! Vincent: (appears from behind) Not again! More alcohol? Callie: Well what do you expect me to do, waiting between make-out scenes? Vincent: We can't do anything here, your brother is right over there, watching! (points to Ray, who is watching them from across the floor and waves) Callie: He's not even my brother, he just plays one in this fanfic. You know, he's not bad looking, either. If you won't make out with me, maybe he will. Vincent: Ewww! Callie: What, haven't you learned from Star Wars that brother-sister love is perfectly natural? Vincent: (sighs) Ok, maybe I was a little premature about that whole Jamie Foxx thing... 8888888888 ( Vincent stalks through the crowd, gun poised. He has his deadly-serious, no-nonsense look on his face) (Suddenly Jason Lee /Vanilla Sky/ appears ) Lee: Hey, dude, you made it! And they fixed your face! Vincent: What? Lee: Although they really fucked up your hair, man... Vincent: What's wrong with my hair? 8888888888 Vincent stalks through the crowd, gun poised. He has this deadly-serious (Penelope Cruz appears) Cruz: David! You made it! And you look normal...except for that funky hair. Callie: (from behind) I LIKE his hair! Victoria: (from Soulless) So do I! Collateral Fangirls: So do WE! (All the girls dogpile on Cruz and beat the crap out of her) Lee: Still have quite a way with the ladies, I see... 8888888888 Vincent stalks through the crowd... (Penelope Cruz appears again and throws her arms around him.) Cruz: Man, you're hot! Why the hell did I ever dump you? Vincent: You didn't dump me, I dumped you, now let go, I'm busy. Cruz: Doing what? Isn't this our club scene? Vincent: Wrong movie, Penelope. Now go back to the desert with Matthew McConaughey. Cruz: But I want to stay, and talk in my cute accent, and say eccentric things like, \"I'll tell you in another life when we are both cats.\" Callie: (suddenly appears) You want to see cats, girlfriend? Meeeeeeow! 8888888888 Vincent: ...and this is my security card from when I pretended to be a Fed-Ex guy, I never told them I kept that... 8888888888 Ext. Fever Widener drags Callie out of the club. Callie goes to stand in the alley, watching Richard. Suddenly three bright red PAINT BALLS explode all over Widener's beige trenchcoat. Widener: Hey! Callie: (turns to Vincent and pulls out her own paintgun) GOTCHA! She fires at him and blue paint balls explode over his suit. Widener pulls out another paint gun and starts firing yellow paintballs at both of them. Then they run around screaming in the alley, firing paint-balls at each other and hiding among the cars to avoid getting hit. Ray comes out of the club. He looks up to the sky and shakes his head. Ray: Fanfic actors... 8888888888 Ext. Fever Vincent: Come on! (Callie looks back to Widener, covered with blue and red blotches of paint) (Vincent grabs Callie and drags her backwards.) (Callie slips and falls on her ass in the middle of the alley. She starts to laugh drunkenly and shows Vincent the paint on her foot that made her fall) Vincent: Damn paintballs! Michael: CUT! 8888888888 Ext. Fever Callie gets into the car and puts it into drive. She presses the accelerator and crashes the cab head-first into another car, then bounces across the alley. The car pulls to a stop. Random fangirls dressed as crew run to the car. Callie: I'm fine, I'm fine Fangirls: Fuck you, get out of the way! Vinceeeeeent! 8888888888 Callie starts up the car and starts to drive. Vincent realizes his door is still open. Vincent: No, wait, wait! (reaches to close it) Callie jerks the car, Vincent loses his balance. His feet kick the door farther open and it slams against a nearby parked car. It SLAMS back against his foot and catches his ankle. Michael: CUT! Vincent: Great...how the hell am I supposed to carry you now? Callie: (blushes) Oops... 8888888888 Vincent: ...and this is a laminated card of all the women I've been married to. Apparently I'm legally required to show it on a first date since I've been married so many timesyou know, girls need to know what they're getting into... 8888888888 Ext. StreetAfter the car crash Callie stands in the middle of the road, Vincent clutching her arm. Vincent: Come on, run. Callie: It says in the script you're supposed to throw me over your shoulder. Vincent: (pointing to the ice-pack wrapped around his foot) Do I LOOK like I can carry you? Callie: Geeze, what are you, Kid Rock now? Talk about grumpy...it was your own stupid fault. Vincent: Just get moving. (grumbles) Max wouldn't have done this... Callie: Yeah, but you would have left Max's ass back with the car, after beating him with a stick. And Max also doesn't have breasts. Vincent: Neither do you. (Callie turns and slugs him) Michael: CUT! 8888888888 Int. CabCallie's \"Max\" moment where she \"flips\" the car.

Vincent: I can't believe Jamie Foxx got nominated for an Academy Award and I didn't...(grumble grumble) 8888888888 Callie: What's this last card, the Happy Bunny? Vincent and Callie look at a picture of a Happy Bunny with an ax in its head. Underneath the caption reads, \"Everything's great, thanks for asking\" Vincent: Nicole (Kidman) sent me that. Think she was trying to tell me something? 8888888888 Writer: Ok, guys, I'm changing the car flipping scene. Callie & Vincent: Why? Writer: Well, as much as Eccentric Banshee likes it, I have to made SOME adjustments. I mean, after all, this fanfic isn't one of those \"rip off the movie and just change who says whatever line\" stories, it's a true parallel universe, so I don't think Callie would flip the cab, I think it would just spin around. Callie: But I LIKE the car flipping scene. I took this job just so I could flip the car over! Writer: Uh...it says here that you took the job so you could make out with Vincent. Callie: Well...that too... 8888888888 Int. Law Office Night (The telephone rings. Annie picks it up) Annie: Joe's Mortuary, you stab 'em, we slab 'em. Michael: Cut! 8888888888 (The telephone rings.

Annie picks it up) Annie: District Attorney's Office Ray: Better clear out, Niobe, Agents are on the way! 8888888888 Vincent: ...and this card gets me into a very exclusive gentleman's club, I won't give the name, but I'll tell you they use a certain long-eared animal as their symbol... Callie: What, a jackass? 8888888888 Int. Law Office NIGHT Vincent stalks around the room. Suddenly there's a very loud THUD and Vincent hops away on one foot. Vincent: Damn coffee table! Who put that there? I think I broke my shin! 8888888888 Vincent limps around the room. He spots Annie. He backs her against the wall and then squirts his gun at her. Annie: (spitting in disgust) What is that, Listerine? Vincent: Scope. 8888888888 Vincent backs Annie into a corner. He looks up to see a looming figure in the dark. Vincent: Max? Morpheus: No. And you messed with the wrong crew. (Annie jumps up and kicks Vincent square in the jaw) Annie: Some things never change. Morpheus: And some things do. Now let's haul ass. 8888888888 Vincent: ...and this card gets me into The Pilots Club, did you know I can take you up in a plane and make you throw up if I wanted to? Callie: You did that to me already with Top Gun. 8888888888 Int. Metro Train Night Callie and Annie hide behind the metal partitions, shivering in terror as Vincent gets closer and closer. Callie: (looks up at the sign) Hey, we're going to Long Beach! I've always wanted to see the Queen Mary... 8888888888 Callie and Annie huddle by the open doors to the waiting station. Vincent stands outside, gun poised and ready to fire. Callie tosses a red rubber ball into the platform. Vincent drops his gun and runs after it, barking. Callie: Works every time... Michael: CUT! 8888888888 Vincent: ...and this is my Vons Club card, this is my Trader Joe's card, and this is my Target card. I know I'm insanely rich, but you don't stay rich spending all your money. And I think...that's it. 8888888888 Int. AirportFinal Scene Vincent: Well, this is goodbye. Callie: After that kiss, now it's just goodbye? So I get left high and dry? Vincent: Yeah, well, you see, the Writer did fanfics before this one, and she's only let me end up with one girl. And if I don't go meet her pretty soon, she's gonna get really, really pissed. Callie: Another girl? You mean you flirted with me all this time and you're already with somebody else? Vincent: I am a criminal, what do you expect? Besides, this is Alternate Universe, that other girl was in the regular universe. Callie: Then why can't you stay? Since she's in the other universe and you're here. Vincent: I never thought of that. Hey, why can't I stay? Writer: Because you've got other fanfics you have to be in. Vincent: Like what? Writer: Well, Winged Seraph needs you for her fanfic \"Effigy,\" although I'm not sure that's a romance, and Sargonne needs you for her fanfic \"Vestige,\" and SYNB needs you to hustle your ass back to that club scene for her fanfic... This last bit is really for Winged Seraph, but if you're at all familiar with my Secret Widow fic, it'll make sense to you, too (Suddenly, Trent Cash appearsthe bag dropper from the first scene of \"Collateral\") Trent: I'm here to pick up Vincent. Writer: In a minute, you can have him. Why did Winged Seraph send you to get him and not Vanessa? Trent: Well, she knew both you and she had a thing for me, so she figured I needed to show up at least once in your fanfic. Writer: Oh, okay, you'll get no arguement from me. The more eye-candy in this fic the better... Trent: She also mentioned something about Bruce. Writer: Bruce? (blushes) Oh, that's nothing... Trent: It didn't sound like nothing. Writer: Listen, Handsome Rob, get lost or I'll Callie: Hey, I really hate airports, can we just finish this? Fine, Vincent, go to your other girlfriend, I don't care. Vincent: If my girlfriend is in another reality, why can't I be with Callie? Writer: What, you want to be with Callie, just like that? You kill people in front of her, traumatize her, threaten her, and now you want to get all sappy? Callie: This is a fanfic, you know. Writer: Not that kind of fanfic. Maybe in the sequel, but not today. Vincent, plane. Trent, door. And Callie, go comfort your hot brother. Vincent: I still say that's gross. Writer: See you all next time around, folks!

A/N: There was a moment at the beginning of the movie when Vincen"},{"Movie":"Collateral","Title":"Solace","Author":"SpadesJade","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2044562","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I don't own Vincent, Detective Fanning, Max, Annie, Pedrosa, Zee, or anybody from the movie Collateral. I do own Claudia, although no one else wants her, and I do own Victoria, although she isn't here right now. So leave a review at the beep! A/N: All right, I just couldn't wait to post the new story. So sue me. Actually, don't sue me, I have no money. So, this is the direct sequel to Soulless, so if you haven't read Soulless, you really want to becuase this won't make complete sense otherwise. Although if you're good at picking things up fast, you could probably give this first chapter a try. Anyway, without further ado.... Backtrack One did not just get up and walk away after an encounter like the one Max and Annie had had on that MTA. Sure, they walked for a while, but Annie, the solid voice of reason, spoke up. \"We have to go to the police.\" Max was uncomfortable with this idea. \"You know, they think I'm him.\" Annie gave him that look again. She'd given him that look two times more that evening, but they'd been in the process of running for their lives at the time, so she hadn't been able to pursue it. \"Okay, Max, you gotta tell me, now. Tell me everything.\" So he did. How Vincent got into his cab. About the poor fat guy who took a nose dive onto the roof of his taxi. How Vincent had forced him to help him put the dead guy into the trunk of the cab and drive him to the next stop. How he'd been nearly mugged in an attempt to attract attention, and Vincent had shown up, shot the perpetrators, and given him back his wallet. He told her about the jazz club and Daniel. He told her about going to see his mother, how he had stolen Vincent's briefcase and destroyed it by tossing it onto a busy street, where it was run over by a truck. How Vincent had made him go into a club to see Felix, and pretend that he was Vincent himself, to get the work-ups for the last two hits of the night, the very last being Annie. This was the part Annie was very interested in. \"How did you do it?\" she asked, incredulous. \"How did you convince those guys you were Vincent.\" Max was uncomfortable with this question. \"I just did it. I had to do it.\" \"But why didn't you walk away? Go for help? You had ten minutes, you could have -\" \"If I'd gone back to that car without the stuff he wanted, he would have shot me, and then shot my mother on the way out of town.\" Annie considered this. \"It doesn't make sense. Why would he keep you around for so long? I mean...especially that stuff you told me about how he stood up for you when your dispatcher was giving you hell, that is really strange.\" She rubbed the skin between her eyes. \"God, I need some sleep. Look,\" she said, her hand going into the air, \"we're going to the police, and that is that. I work for the Justice department, they'll listen to me. We'll clear this up.\" \"There was a cop who believed me,\" Max said softly. Annie whipped around, looked at him. \"Who is he? Do you know how to reach him?\" \"He's dead.\" Annie closed her mouth. \"Vincent shot him,\" Max continued. \"As we were coming out of Fever. Everybody else thought I was Vincent, but he believed me and was going to get me out. For it, he got two in the chest and one in the head.\" Annie nodded, drawing a shaky breath. \"What was his name?\" she asked. \"Fanning.\" She nodded again. \"Don't worry about it, Max. You saved me, now I'm going to save you. We'll work this out.\" She took his hand, squeezed it. \"Okay? His body is floating around on the MTA, they'll pick it up, your story will be confirmed by it. OUR story,\" she added, giving him another squeeze. \"Trust me, okay?\" He gave her a tired look, but he nodded. He would trust her. Right now, she was probably the only person in this world that he would ever trust again.[Chapter 2] Don't own Vincent. As you can see from the last chapter, NOBODY owns Vincent. Heh. A/N: Okay, I'm going to have a little rant here. If you're just here for the story, feel free to skip it. Or come back later. But I just got done watching \"Vanilla Sky.\" I haven't been so confused since \"Matrix Reloaded.\" I mean, what the hell was going on? Wierd thing is, I kinda liked it. But...man, it was way out there. Waaaay. Out. Anyway, I knew this would happen. One good movie and suddenly I'm obsessed with Tom Cruise. I hope it passes after I get this story done. Oh well. I guess there are worse things in the world. Anyway, on with the show... Drawbacks Mexico was a temporary stop that turned out to take longer than Vincent had anticipated. But it only made sense. His contact was extremely pissed off at him because Felix was pissed off that Annie Farrell wasn't dead. However, it had put the indictment on hold for an indefinite time, so there was a small cushion of space between him and Felix's rage. Not that Vincent was worried. Vincent didn't worry as a rule. He couldn't think of a single time in his life when he had ever worried. Not about anything. But there was the problem with his reputation. He did not like his reputation to be damaged. In the long run, however, he had more important things to worry about. Victoria knew that that meant her. Living with a sociopath was not the easiest or hardest thing in the world. It was simply a matter of adjusting to an environment that was restrictive in some ways and completely laid back in others. For instance: She knew where every single thing in the house was. There were no secrets, no stashes. She knew his catalogue of weapons and their hiding places, she knew his fast routes out, she knew who he knew and who he didn't know. She knew that the layout of the house was fine, whichever way she wanted it, as long as it didn't interfere with his ability to reach things easily. She was the queen of his castle. It was enough to make a girl blush with pride. But there were drawbacks. They had come here a month ago. The BMW they had stolen from Marcus Shakespeare's garage during their getaway had been sold upon their entry into Mexico, and the money was used to get a flight on a very small airplane that took them to what Victoria would only have described as a \"God-forsaken place.\" That was at first glance. A careful study revealed a village of types, a community of several important people who wished to stay hidden, and a scattering of commoners to kept the economy running. Victoria had been operating under a delusion, she knew that now. How easy it was, though, and she couldn't blame herself or Vincent for its creation. After all, how many girls in the world could credit themselves to be the sole object of the affections of a man like Vincent? He was polite, charming, friendly, and always cool, no matter what the circumstance. Except when he went psycho. She'd seen in a few times, and was careful not to press the trigger that would make it go off again. Of course, he was also a contract killer. Major drawback number one. Major drawback number two: why had she ever gotten it into her head that he'd brought her with him to make her a permanent part of his life? What had she been thinking, that they were going to get married in a little chapel in a Mexican city, St. Margaret of the Goats, whatever? Vincent didn't really live inside society. That was one of the major trademarks of a sociopath. He lived in his own world, by his own creed, and didn't understand why others couldn't accept it. Sure, he could blend. He was good at blending. He was good at making small talk, acting polite, being warm to a person he'd just met and making them feel relaxed. One didn't know when those things came from his true self or when they were just an act, but Victoria knew. She didn't know when she'd learned the difference, it was like a small alarm going on inside her head. When he was faking, when he was serious. Lucky for her, he was usually serious with her. So, here they were, in some little hideout in Mexico, and while Vincent's home was a veritable palace, she felt like it was her pretty little gilded cage, and she was his private whore. The religious person in her - the God-fearing person she had once told Vincent she was - said that it wasn't right, the way they lived. Her womanly instincts told her it was wrong, to just live off of him and have no serious commitment. But after the first conversation about it, Vincent made it clear: what was the use? They were together. They would stay together as long as they wanted. Why make ties over ties that were already there? So, no marriage. As time passed, she began to realize the wisdom of his decision, but not for the reasons he thought. She'd been crazy to think she could just abandon her life and never look back. As the days passed, turned into weeks, then into a month, she found herself looking back more and more. She began to question herself - even if she did have feelings for Vincent, were they enough? If everyone in the world just lived according to their feelings, it would be hell on earth. There had to be other things in a relationship this intense. Intense was an understatement. Drawback number three: she was not allowed to complain about his work. He'd had one call for a job since they'd gotten there, in spite of the fact that he had pissed off employers breathing down the line. He'd gone to do the job and come back, all within three days. She'd hated it for two reasons. First, what if he didn't come back? And second, he was going to kill someone. The moral person in her couldn't bear it. The guilt kept her awake for the entire seventy-two hours that he was gone. When he came back, they had a fight. It was the last time Victoria would dare bring it up. He had never hit her, never even threatened to. The time he'd fired a gun at her, missing deliberately by a mile, had been the last violence she'd ever experienced at his hands. But Vincent didn't need to touch her or say cruel things to her to hurt her. The bonfire of his rage was quite enough. She knew if she wanted any peace in this life, she should never say a word about it again. So instead, it just ate at her. Like a cancer. Drawback number four: Vincent was not like any other boyfriend, who could be manipulated or argued with, given the circumstances. It was a common fact that men and women played their little power games. There were no power games with Vincent. If he didn't like something, there wasn't any compromise. Victoria's only refuge was in the fact that there were few things he felt so strongly about. Mostly, she had her way. But there were times... At any rate, it wasn't a bad life, if you didn't examine it too closely. The house was beautiful, the weather was good at this time of year, and Vincent was a good lover. Considerate, thoughtful. She hesitated to make any moves on him, unsure as to what he wanted, but she rarely had to worry about it. By the end of the first month, she was nearly sure that things would work out somehow. That she would just get used to this life. That every family had secrets, difficulties, flaws. She had never expected perfection and knew she'd never get it, so she would take what happiness Vincent had to offer her and be done with it. Problem with this plan of attack was, the more you pushed down what you really felt, the heavier it felt inside. Victoria was shopping. There was a small market near the center of the makeshift village, lots of black market items that were only sold so openly there because the whole place was hidden from the mainstream. It was a busy enough of a place, but everyone was local. Tourists didn't come down here - if a white person was spotted, it meant only one thing: Money.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: Don't own the movie Collateral. Just borrowing for a while. I'll put everything back neatly when I'm done. Hunters Ray Fanning was beginning to wonder what he was doing. He had the time. Six weeks was only the start of his leave. He could take another six, if he wanted. Injured in the line of duty, and with his reputation. The department was willing to give him enough rope. And he was going to hang himself with it. What in the hell had he been thinking? How had that woman talked him into this? He replayed their conversation in that restaurant a million times in his head, and he couldn't pinpoint the moment when he'd given in. \"I'm not much of an artist,\" she had started, having identified herself as Claudia, \"but, that night that you were shot, did you happen to see this man?\" She held up a rough pencil sketch. It was the nose that clicked with him, aquiline and high. He was good with faces. \"Not at the club,\" he said, taking the picture, staring at it, waiting for the image to complete itself in his head. Gray suit, sunglasses, hair that looked nearly platinum blond in the harsh fluorescent lighting. \"In the elevator, at the hospital.\" He blinked. \"Max was in there too, behind me. God...I didn't remember that before.\" Claudia nodded. Her hair was as straight as he'd ever seen on a woman, falling down across her shoulders like a white silk sheet. She was constantly pushing it back over her shoulder. He wondered why she didn't tie it back, or braid it. Probably would have ruined the look. \"So you did see him. If you saw him in person, would you recognize him?\" \"Most likely,\" Fanning replied. \"Good. Would you like to help me catch him?\" Fanning looked at her as if she were crazy. \"I'm sorry, who do you work for again?\" \"Pedrosa,\" she said, her voice lowered. It had been what had made him come with her before. The familiarity. She was connected to the Feds, she had the smell of an undercover agent on her, someone buried so deep, raising her head even this high was a threat. She didn't carry credentials, but she had access to information that could only have come from a source as connected as the C.I.A. \"You want to call him?\" she offered. \"On your cel? Make sure?\" He shook his head, although he made a mental note to do it later. \"So what do you want with me?\" That was when she smiled. It was a tight, knowing smile, as she reached into the bag she had with her and pulled out a police file. She set it on the table and he picked it up, began to rummage through it. As he did, his eyes widened. \"You were associated with a Victoria Potter when you were in the illegal trafficking division,\" she said. \"You had something to do with her arrest?\" \"We had to drop the charges,\" he said softly. \"Not enough evidence. But I always had the feeling she'd been used.\" Claudia nodded. \"She was. You see, Potter, formerly a doctor, lost her medical license when she went up against the wrong people on a sexual molestation charge. She sort of disappeared into the woodwork after that. You were one of the few people who put her on the radar since that time. Did you get to know her at all?\" Fanning swallowed. \"I...uh...well...\" It wasn't like him to fluster, he shook himself, spitting it out. \"A few weeks after it was over, so as not to get involved with a suspect, I asked her out.\" \"And?\" \"We dated a bit. She wasn't really interested in me, though.\" \"Why not?\" Fanning looked at her, meeting those ice-blue eyes. \"What is this, twenty questions?\" Claudia didn't even blink. \"Detective Fanning, Victoria Potter has gone missing. There was an illegal office being run south of Alhambra about three weeks ago. Four dead bodies, all of them taken out by the same shooter who killed Sylvester Clark and your contact Ramone, along with every other witness killed that night, who was involved with a major indictment to be started the following day. The office was hers.\" She let the silence sit, let him take it in. Fanning leaned back in his seat, his fingers on the various papers in the file - photographs of the bodies, personal items found at the scene, things linking it definitively to Victoria. \"So you're saying that Victoria is somehow involved in all of this?\" \"More than involved, Detective,\" Claudia sighed. She sipped at the water the waitress had been so obliged to leave at their table. \"I was on an assignment to protect a patient of hers, Marcus Shakespeare.\" \"I heard about that,\" Fanning said, \"about his murder, anyway.\" Claudia flinched, her annoyance showing through for only a second. Then she calmed. \"Victoria Potter was there. That night. With Vincent.\" \"So,\" Fanning said slowly, \"you're saying she's involved with him.\" \"She's not just involved,\" Claudia said. \"She's an accomplice.\" Fanning laughed, pushing the file away. \"You're full of shit,\" he muttered. \"Am I?\" \"Yeah. Victoria was the victim of unfortunate circumstance. She didn't think through her actions before she did them and it cost her a lot, but it happens. She's not a criminal.\" \"She's been illegally practicing medicine for the last half-dozen years, and she's not a criminal?\" \"Well,\" Fanning said, \"you don't know Victoria. She's tenacious.\" \"So I gathered,\" Claudia said, brushing her nose, which had just recently lost a bandage - he could tell by the marks it had left on her skin. \"Besides, there wasn't anything else for her to do. She treated criminals, but she wasn't involved in their activities. I figured that out quick.\" Claudia shook her head, her hand slapping over the file as she drew it back to her. \"Well, Detective, whatever her past may be, she is officially a missing person. And I suspect she's still with Vincent.\" He narrowed his eyes. \"How do you know that?\" \"Where do you think I get all my information from?\" she asked. \"Newsweek? Star Magazine? I have more connections than just those in your superiors' offices. I've been tracking Vincent for about a week now. I think I know where he is, and I think Victoria is with him. And I don't say things like that to practical strangers lightly.\" \"So then where do you think he is?\" Fanning challenged. \"I mean, since you've been so open with me, tell me.\" She hesitated. \"Somewhere in Mexico.\" He almost laughed. \"Somewhere,\" he echoed, \"You know, Mexico is a pretty big place.\" She nodded. \"It'll be easier once I get there.\" \"So you're going to Mexico.\" Fanning did smile this time, almost ready to get up and leave. \"So what do you want with me, Claudia?\" She held his eyes for a moment, making him drop the smile. \"I want your help, Detective.\" \"My help?\" \"Sure. You know what Vincent looks like, you're familiar with him, possibly more than any other agent I could contact. You have lots of connections in Mexico-\" Fanning started. \"Hey, now wait-\" \"I wasn't judging,\" she said calmly. \"I was just stating a fact. And I know that you don't like to leave cases hanging open. You could be a big hero, or you could just be a good cop. Either way, you don't have much to lose.\" \"I don't have any...\" he faltered. \"I can't go to Mexico. My job, my authority is all here.\" \"I can take care of that,\" Claudia said with a slow, cat-like smile. \"Can you?\" \"Yes.\" She waited for a moment, in case he had any other objections. \"At the very least, Detective...don't you want to make sure your friend Victoria is okay?\" \"You don't seem to think she's in any danger,\" Fanning said, uncomfortable. \"Yeah, but you do, and I've been wrong before. Besides, I know Vincent. There isn't a such thing as being safe around him.\" \"You trying to scare me?\" \"No. I'm just stating the facts.\" \"You seem to like to do that.\" \"Hm.\" She smiled at him, respecting him. She probably met few enough people who could stand against her, toe to toe. \"So what do you say, Detective? You can take an extended leave, you can come with me, and you can come back a big hero.\" \"Or a good cop.\" \"Either way.\" \"Or I could lose my job and get arrested for vigilante activity.\" Claudia shrugged. \"I suppose. I guess, then, it isn't worth the risk to you. You can spend the rest of your life in peace with the fact that a man who tried to kill you in cold blood is living happy and free with a woman you had some pretty strong feelings about.\" \"What do you know about that?\" Fanning snapped, irritated that she would make such a statement about Victoria. \"Come on, Detective,\" Claudia said with a knowing look. \"You're a cop. You ask you a former suspect? You know what kind of trouble you could have gotten into. You obviously thought she was worth the risk.\" Fanning drew a slow breath. \"Yeah. I guess I did.\" There was a heavy silence as he weighed it all up in his head. \"All right,\" he had said quietly. \"I'm in.\" That was nearly six weeks ago. The hunt hadn't been an easy one. There were constant twists and turns, people covering, people lying, people dying. He'd knocked on every door he knew, talked to every single person he could manage, and only now, now, did they have a single lead that looked promising. Promising in a way the others hadn't, at least. They'd had leads before. Always dead ends, abandoned houses, wrong criminals. They'd been shot at a dozen times, their car had been stolen twice that, but Claudia was Miss Resourceful. Fanning didn't like to think about the things she did to stay above the water. This lead was different. A few days ago a woman in a small marketplace, out of the way from the mainstream, had recognized a picture of Victoria. She didn't know where the woman came from or where she was going, but she'd been here. Problem was, they couldn't just sit around and wait for her. Claudia picked up quickly that it was a tightly knit community, and that strangers never went unnoticed. So they had to pretend to leave, and then go camping in the jungle in full guerilla warfare gear. Those were two days he wished he could forget. But they paid off. The mornings were busy as soon as the sun cracked the sky. The long siesta during this time of the year took a lot of time out of the afternoon, so business had to be conducted as early as possible. A hummer pulled up, driven by a man who looked as ordinary as the rest of them. But a woman got out of the passenger side. Her hair had been lightened by the climate. She wore a sleeveless shirt and a sarong of some type tied tightly around her waist. Calf-length khakis protected her legs underneath, and high boots did the rest. Military style, but much more classy. She smelled like money, even from their distance. Claudia had climbed up some tree, Fanning didn't know where. His place was the ground, hers the sky. She seemed to be able to swing from branch to branch like a damn monkey. He hoped she was getting a better ID than he was. The woman turned. Her eyes were covered with sunglasses, but there was something familiar about her. Other than the fact that she was one of maybe four white women they saw around here. Blonds, redheads - no surprises there, as anybody who needed cover and whoever they wanted to bring along was welcome for the right price. Fanning narrowed his eyes. There was something familiar about the shape of those sunglasses. Narrow frames, only two black ovals protecting her eyes. She lifted them up, pushed them onto her head. It was Victoria. She had changed a bit. She had always had a decent figure, but there was a distinct swell to her breasts and curve to her hips that hadn't been there before. Fanning swallowed. Holy shit, it couldn't be... A seed plunked down onto his head. Fanning looked directly up. There was a flicker of light between the trees. Could have been natural, but it happened three times, calculated. Claudia had seen and ID'd her. That was Victoria Potter.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: Same as always.

Please review so I know you haven't given up on me! :) Secrets Victoria found herself wandering a bit aimlessly. She knew where to look, but couldn't quite get her feet to take her that way. She was pregnant. She knew she was pregnant. Dammit...she wanted to be happy about this. Having a baby was something she had been secretly longing for, for a while. Not so much having a husband or the big house and a normal life, but a child. It was a biological clock thing, she knew that. She was thirty-five. It had been ringing for at least three years now. This wasn't the way to do it. Not with Vincent. Sure, it was okay for the two of them. But a child? How could they make sure it stayed safe? How could they give it the education it needed? How could Vincent, who killed people for a living, possibly accept that he was responsible for a very delicate human life? Her rational voice told her that of course he could do it, he'd been taking care of her. But she was different, she replied. She was a grown adult who knew what she was getting into - even if she didn't, entirely. She could adapt, change. A baby made everything change around it. Vincent wasn't going to take getting up in the middle of the night to change diapers and hanging smelly baby poo all that well. Worse than that, she knew what kind of thread they lived by. There was always the chance someone would come around who was looking for some payback. It happened all the time. Vincent had failsafes in place, and they were good for the two of them. But a baby would become a serious liability. Not to mention, ill equipped to handle the stress of such a situation. Potentially, she was carrying Vincent's seed. Whatever made him indifferent to killing, what if that was passed on? How could she teach right and wrong when she herself had abandoned all pretext of it herself? Bad enough she had to live with that guilt. She couldn't do it to an innocent baby. She bumped a table. The corner knicked her hip, leaving a mark that was sure to become a bruise. But finally, her feet had done it. The Latino woman looked at her over the low counter, eyes going up and down. Victoria didn't quite know the Spanish for it, but she managed to get her point across. She was handed a blue box with a stick inside. At least she didn't have to pee into a cup, she thought with relief. She paid and wandered back into the marketplace, taking the stick and the instructions out of the box and throwing the box away. The stick and instructions promptly went into her bag, at the very bottom. She wandered around, bought a few more things - there were some fresh oranges, but she wasn't a big citrus fan, so she grabbed a few for Vincent and headed back to the humvee. \"What did you do?\" Fanning asked as he and Claudia met a good thirty feet from the proximity of the market, heavily covered in the bush. She had stealthily approached the humvee as it had returned to pick up Victoria, then come scurrying back. She pulled the hood off her head, revealing her white hair in the late morning sun.[Chapter 5] Warning: This chapter deals with some extremely delicate and disturbing issues. If you're sensitive to that kind of thing, read at your own risk. Standard Disclaimer Reactions He found her on the couch when he got home, sitting in the dark. He didn't think too much of it because they usually kept lights out whenever possible. She was probably pouting, he thought, and decided to just let it go, as she had enough sense not to say anything. \"Victoria?\" he said softly as he entered the living room, carrying a thick yellow envelope with him. Making sure she was awake. \"Yeah?\" she called back, her dark outline moving slightly to show that she had been curled up, and was straightening out for him. \"I brought you a gift.\" He came over to the coffee table and sat down in front of her. Instead of cool tile, it was warm underneath him. Most people didn't notice those kinds of things. Vincent registered it, but was anxious to give Victoria her gift. He would ask in a minute. \"What is it?\" she asked. He placed the packet in her hands. \"Your license came through today. It's all set up. You've been reinstated. No questions asked.\" She seemed startled, but her reaction was far less energetic than he had expected. \"Wow,\" she whispered. \"Thank you, Vincent.\" \"Well, maybe you can do a little better than that,\" he said, his tone turning sly as he leaned closer to her. He grasped her knees, and she jumped under his touch. It wasn't normal for her to react to him like this. \"Victoria? What is it?\" She shook her head, her face leaning closer to his. \"Nothing, Vincent,\" she said, but her smile wasn't completely natural. And her hair was hanging down, covering a part of her face. She pressed her lips to his, and Vincent would never have hesitated kissing her back, except for the fact that she was trembling, just slightly. Nervous. \"No, Victoria, tell me, what is it,\" he said, his voice a little lower. He reached out, his hands going to her arms, instinct telling him she was reacting from a kind of shock, that the first priority was to make sure no physical harm was done. She wiggled under his search, which only made the alarms sound louder. \"Nothing, really. I mean...I fell before. Hit my head. I think I tripped on Max...he's been getting underfoot lately.\" \"He's never gotten under my feet.\" \"Well, no, you're not his mommy,\" Victoria said with a light-hearted laugh. \"I was just trying to shake it off.\" \"Mm hmm.\" Vincent looked at her in the dark, then stood up and reached over for the lamp. He heard her sharp intake of breath as the bulb flicked on. He looked down. Her face was red and swollen, and on her right temple there was a ringed bruise. It looked like she'd been struck in a central place and the shockwaves had gone out in purple clots of blood under her skin. He sat down beside her this time, his hands cupped carefully around her face, looking at the bruise. \"Who in the hell did that to you?\" he asked. His eyes met hers, he held fast and wouldn't let go. \"Why have you been crying?\" \"Well, the stupid fall hurt,\" she tried. He shook his head. \"No, Victoria. Tell me the truth. You know better. What happened.\" \"Vincent, I don't -\" \"Victoria,\" and there was a clear warning bell in his voice now, \"I'm going to keep asking you until you tell me. So you can take all the time you want, but you will tell me. Who was here?\" She met his eyes, flinched, looked away. She pulled her face from his grasp, having to reach up and remove his hands by his wrists before she could get control over her own head again. She wanted to get up, move away from him. She needed distance so she could think, but Vincent would have caught her and forced her back down beside him if she'd tried to move. \"Claudia,\" Victoria managed after a significant pause. \"Claudia was here.\" Vincent didn't seem terribly surprised, but he did seem very pissed. There was a coldness in his face, it subtly froze over his features, turning his eyes into green ice. \"And what did she say?\" \"Terrible things,\" Victoria choked, feeling the horrid memories as fresh as if she were still sitting there, in front of her, black-gloved hands templed, long white hair blazing in the shadows, ice-blue eyes so cruel. \"Like what.\" \"Stupid woman things, Vincent,\" Victoria said, a bit louder, as if trying to shake it off. \"She talked about me and you.\" A bit of a reaction - he slightly raised one eyebrow. \"And she said?\" \"Stuff. About our relationship. About how...\" The lump clenched her throat shut, she almost coughed. \"How-\" \"How you and I...\" Victoria shook her head. \"She said a lot of painful things, Vincent. She was trying to upset me and she did. Do I really have to repeat them? You'll just think I'm being stupid, and I couldn't take that. They weren't stupid.\" \"But they weren't true.\" Her eyes opened, looked away from him. \"No. They were true things.\" Vincent leaned back. His face still held that cold menace, and she hoped that somewhere in his head he was imagining ways of making Claudia suffer. It only made it worse to think that look would soon be directed at her when she told him what came next. \"So she just came here to upset your womanly jealousies?\" he said, his tone with a substantial amount of bite. \"Knocked you out, but didn't do any other damage. She left you alive, which meant she wanted you to tell me she was here. What does she want from us?\" Victoria managed to look at him again. \"She wants...she wants you to return to the United States, to turn yourself into the F.B.I., and testify against Felix and the guys who hired you to kill those five witnesses that night you were shot, the night you met Max. In return, you'll probably be put in Witness Protection, and given a clean slate.\" She drew in her breath, amazed she'd been able to give all that information so calmly. \"And why should I do that?\" Anybody else would have laughed at the absurdity. Vincent didn't seem to find much to be laughable. \"Because she thinks if you don't, eventually your relationship with me is going to slow you down to the point where you're going to get yourself killed.\" Vincent nodded slowly. Victoria felt a distinct pang. She had hoped he would assure her that it wasn't true, that they were safe, that he would always keep them safe. The fact that he seemed to be taking Claudia's statement as truth really hurt. Even though it was already what Victoria had thought to herself a thousand times already. \"How does she think that testifying is going to solve that?\" Vincent said, almost to himself. \"Probably because Felix is most likely the guy to come after you,\" Victoria heard herself saying, numbly. \"Since you didn't finish your contract with him.\" Vincent nodded again. \"Well,\" he murmured, \"since Max offered a discount of 35 of my services, I had thought that Felix was content to let it go. But I know he isn't, none of them are. He's still going to be indicted because that District Prosecutor is still alive.\" Slowly, he stood up. His brain was in total work mode now, Victoria had seen it a few times since she'd been brought here. \"I could always go back to L.A.,\" he said, half to her, half to himself. \"Finish the job.\" Victoria shook her head. \"No,\" she said strongly. \"Well, what do you suggest? Turning myself in?\" Victoria shut her eyes. Now was the moment. Things were already bad. Maybe it would help clear something up. \"Vincent...I'm pregnant.\" He'd been looking down at her over his shoulder. At the news, he slowly walked away from her, went to the window, pressed his hands to the glass. Victoria sank back into the cushions of the couch, the tears threatening to soak her cheeks again. This shouldn't be happening, she told herself. They were going to have a baby together and he was treating it as if someone were going to die. Then the irony of the fact that he was a killer for hire hit her, and she would have actually laughed if her throat hadn't been so clenched. She had always imagined that the day she announced she was pregnant, considering how she and Allen had completely failed at the task, would be not just joyous, but triumphant. She could give life. She could have babies. A fusion of her and Vincent, proof that they had existed, evidence of their love. What a hopelessly romantic idea. Pathetic, really, considering her situation. He was turning back to her, calm as she expected, and not quite as angry. \"How far along?\" he asked. \"I have no idea.\" \"Well, it can't be more than two months,\" he said. \"That's still early. There are lots of options.\" \"Options?\" she echoed, suddenly getting an adrenaline surge. He looked at her, calmly. \"Victoria, we can't have a baby.\" \"Vincent, if you even say the word abortion-\" \"I won't say it, but still-\" \"First of all, hell no , never in a million years.\" The rising of her voice pushed the tears away, made her feel stronger, more sure of herself. Anger was always a great cure to depression, she thought sarcastically. \"And second, there is no way I'm going to some butcher with a wire hanger-\" \"Then we can go to one of the big cities, a clinic-\" She reached behind her, grasped the first thing her fingers clutched - a couch cushion. She hurled it at him. He caught it, easily. \"Victoria,\" he said, complacently. \"Shut UP!\" she howled, standing up with the words. \"You...you monster! You may be a murderer but I'm not!\" Vincent sighed, looked away. She was a fool to think he was defeated. \"Well, I guess there are other ways. This early, lots of things can happen. Vigorous activity, the wrong diet, all kinds of things could -\" She reached for something else to throw - a vase of flowers she had brought in a few days ago. The water splashed all down the front of his shirt and pants, soaking him. \"Stop talking, Vincent,\" she commanded, with an air of authority she'd never heard from her own voice before. \"Just. Stop.\" To her secret amazement, he did. \"It is not happening,\" she said, stone hard. \"So just don't even say anything about it, again.\" He regarded her coolly, turned, went into the bathroom. With the detachment of a mortician, he stripped off his clothes and put on fresh ones. Jeans and a light sweater. Deep, charcoal gray, went nice with his hair and complexion. He came a back out to find her sitting again, on the couch, perched on the edge, elbows in her lap, hands folded under her chin. He approached slowly, sat down beside her, gently brushed his fingers across the bruise on her temple. Gently, his lips followed, and she sighed, knowing he was making a truce. If she pushed past this point, he would more than likely go into psycho mode, so she had to tread carefully. It was amazing he hadn't done it already. \"What are we going to do, then, Victoria?\" he whispered, putting his arms around her shoulders, pulling her close to him. The warmth of his nearness was almost comforting. \"You tell me. But you know my limits.\" \"I know,\" she whispered back. \"You can't be a father. You can't even be a husband.\" She opened her eyes, stood up, gently detaching herself from his embrace. He let her go reluctantly, but she moved slowly enough to let him know she wasn't going to do anything rash. \"Vincent,\" she said, turning, looking down at him from across the coffee table. \"I'm...I'm going to leave.\" He blinked. Looked up at her. Blinked again. Not believing what he heard. \"As in?\" \"As in, I'm going to go back to the States.\" She drew a breath. \"These last two months... they've been...amazing. And I love you. I know you love me, even if you don't say it.\" \"Victoria,\" he started, but she shushed him. \"Please let me finish, Vincent. You see, you and I seem to have failed to come to an understanding about what we're doing here. You're content for the two of us to just be in a house together, forever. And that's wonderful. But I...I've got more than that now, and it isn't enough for me.\" \"I don't understand,\" he said, that familiar twitch in the corner of his mouth again. \"I don't see how what you want from this is any different than what I want. I mean, you want jewelry, I'll buy you jewelry. But what is marriage, if not two people living together for the rest of their lives?\" \"You and I are a lot different than a family, Vincent,\" she said softly, slowly. \"Just being here together...we don't have any purpose.\" \"Making each other happy isn't a purpose?\" \"It is. But what will make me happy and what will make you happy are two different things. I didn't want to face that for a while, and when I did, I thought I could just adjust, I could change, because I wanted to be with you.\" \"And you don't want to be with me anymore?\" \"I do want to be with you,\" she said smoothly. \"But not enough to give up every single part of who I am. That woman can't be who you want her to be, Vincent. If you want me, as I want you, you have to compromise, too.\" He sighed, barely restraining his impatience. \"But Victoria, you don't understand, I can't -\" \"I do understand. That's why I'm not mad at you. That's why I'm telling you that I still love you and I'll always love you. But I am going to leave.\" She drew a steadying breath. \"I think, if you think about it, long and hard, you'll realize that this was coming, Vincent. Neither one of us ever thought this through. It was good while it lasted, but I think we'd better call it a day while we can.\" He looked at her, as she spoke, and she saw him slowly pulling away from her, inside. She could only imagine what was going through his head. Someone like him, who had never loved anyone, who couldn't even say the words to the single person that he did love - to hear that he was losing her. She was leaving, going away. She couldn't imagine the damage she was doing. But it didn't stop it from being the right thing to do. \"Where are you going to go?\" he asked in a soft voice, after a much longer time had passed than either one of them realized. \"I don't know. Probably not L.A., that I think about it. Now that you've gotten me my license back, I can probably get a job somewhere East.\" \"And what are you going to do for money in the meantime?\" She hesitated. \"There's some left from what we...what you...took from Shakespeare. You always said I deserved it. I guess I'm ready to take it now.\" He chuckled. It was a bitter, hollow sound. \"So now that it's convenient, you want the rest of the blood money.\" \"Vincent, don't make this harder than it is.\" \"Oh, I can only imagine how hard it is for you,\" he said, his voice so low, so dripping with sarcasm and contempt that it was painful to hear. \"Poor you, you get to run away from your problems. Remind me to feel sorry for you.\" \"Vincent,\" she said, a little louder, \"do you really want this to be how we part ways?\" \"So what, you're going now, right this second? Is that what you thought about in the dark, after Claudia left, and you waited for me to come home?\" She shook her head. \"Not...really. A little. I guess.\" \"So, the rest of it came the second I suggested you get an abortion. The second I say something you don't like, you decide to run away.\" \"That isn't fair,\" she bit back, meeting him, burn for burn. \"I've always hated what you do. Always . But if you remember correctly, you made it very clear that what I thought was going to be utterly disregarded, and that I could persist upon it at my own peril.\" That seemed to slap him down, a little, if not much. He actually looked away for a moment. \"I would say,\" she added, for good measure, \"that I've been more than willing to overlook the flaws in this relationship. But everybody has their limit, Vincent.\" To her surprise, he let out a very small sigh. \"I guess they do.\" He kept looking away from her, out into the darkness beyond the circle of lamplight that enclosed them. Then he blinked, looked back at her. \"You do realize,\" he added, \"that Claudia is probably listening to everything we're saying.\" He stood up, approached her. His lips were so close to her ear they were tickling the fine hairs. \"Get what you want. We're leaving now.\" \"Vincent,\" she said, not quite as quiet, but struggling to match him, \"I meant what I said-\" \"Later,\" he said in the same breath-whisper. \"For now, we go together.\" She sighed, frustrated. The man was a fucking brick wall. But knowing she didn't really have a choice, and if Vincent thought they were in danger, it was the right thing to do. For the moment.[Chapter 6] Standard Disclaimer. Emily and Steve will be here all week, if anyone needs sharpshooting lessons, or to hitchhike across Mexico. Don't know where the hell they came from, but they're funny and they stay. Pursuit \"I don't think you've thought this through enough.\" They were in the big expensive car that Vincent had bought a few weeks ago, his \"emergency\" vehicle, the one that could drive over tree trunks if it had to. He tore through the jungle road, creating a wider path where it had only been narrow before. Victoria was strapped in across both sides, a big gray X across her chest, and then a lap belt. The ride was not smooth, even Vincent had the extra belt on. Although Victoria couldn't help but worry that he was hitting some bumps extra hard on purpose. It was late into the night, well past midnight, but the moon was full and the stars were out and brilliant, giving them more than enough light. The trees were thick around them, and there were noises of animals coming from all directions, but his headlights were scaring most of them away. It was insane to be out here at this hour, but obviously he thought it worth the risk. He was giving her his version of a lecture. It was usually very short, and to the point, and completely inarguable. \"We'll head farther south for a while,\" he went on. \"Just for a bit, until things blow over. You need time to give this plan of yours more consideration.\" Very matter of fact. She couldn't help but get the feeling that he simply wasn't going to let her go that easily. For the first time since she'd first been with him, she felt rather trapped. But no, it was Vincent. He wouldn't hurt her. It was just difficult for him to accept something like a person he cared about leaving him. It probably hadn't happened since he was very young. Thoughts like that were no good to her now. They weakened her resolve. \"I'm not going to change my mind, Vincent,\" she said softly, not caring if he heard her or not. But he did hear. She heard his restrained sigh, even over the cracks and smacks of the foliage on the windows of the car. \"I don't understand why you suddenly want leave me,\" he said in a low voice. She struggled with the remaining shreds of her patience. \"I told you. I want to be with you. But I can't anymore.\" \"Because of the baby.\" She dared a look at him. \"Because of a lot of things. But yeah, the baby, too.\" \"So I either have to be a dad, or you walk.\" \"You're a dad either way you look at it,\" she said with a sardonic curl of her lips, \"but that doesn't say much in today's day and age.\" He would have said something else, but apparently, there were other thoughts in his brain competing for dominance. He clenched his hands around the steering wheel, and she swore they were going faster than before. He didn't speak again, merely hurled them through the underbrush. A good half-hour later, they came out onto a main road, and he found a small, island-like truck stop, a hundred miles from nowhere. He pulled up, and she was mildly surprised to see that they weren't the only ones. There were a few other cars there, particularly one large motor-home with an older man and woman in it, a small pack of bikers, and some other random travelers. \"What are we doing here?\" she asked before he got out of the car. He looked at her, pinning her with his eyes for a moment. Then, slowly, he tilted his head to one side, indicating the small building that contained the cashier and, hopefully, the restrooms. Then he got out of the car, stood and looked at her for a moment, tilted his head again. She opened her mouth, but his finger pressed against his lips. Finally, she got it. The pregnancy hormones had to be making her daft. He thought they were still being spied on. He wanted absolute privacy. She got out of the vehicle and followed Vincent, two paces behind, one to the left, as he had taught her a long time ago. Or maybe it only seemed long. It was amazing that this place was open. There was just a glimmer of morning in the sky, the barest hint of dawn. The air was still cool and sweet from the night. The walk to the shack was nearly pleasant. She followed him behind, where he tried various doors until one opened. He gestured for her to come with him, and slipped inside to turn on a light. She had been in grotesque bathrooms during her life in L.A. This one was a hazardous waste facility. She almost held her breath as she followed him in, but Vincent pulled her close, his hands roving over her body. \"What are you-\" He gave her a very sharp glance as he stopped, silently ordering her to stay still. Then, he continued. She had to submit to his probe, and realized within a few seconds that it wasn't a sexual advance - although it had the intimacy of one. He handled her so roughly at one point that she bumped the wall, and her skin crawled at the thought of touching whatever was there. Finally, in her underwear, during the search of which she actually had to hold her breath, he found what he was looking for. She felt him yanking at the band where it thickened around her waist, and when he stood up, he was holding something small and silver. She could guess what it was. Claudia had bugged her. It wasn't enough to bug the house - they could leave. She could bug the car, but Vincent was too smart, he could just ditch it somewhere and steal another. But to bug one of them - and Victoria had been unconscious for a bit. She shuddered to think of that woman messing with her clothes and fiddling with her underwear. Vincent dropped the device into the sink drain. He didn't bother with the toilet - Victoria doubted that it even flushed anymore. He ran some brown water after it, sending it into the sewer system. \"We safe?\" she whispered. He considered her question for a moment. His hand rested lightly on the small of her back, and he gave her a quizzical frown. \"What?\" she asked. \"You're trembling.\" \"I am?\" Slowly, that hard look had the beginnings of a smile in one corner of his mouth. \"That search turn you on?\" She wanted to punch him. Instead she just turned around and threw open the door, stepping back out into the night. Quick as a flash, Vincent was pulling her back, toward the wall, before she could round the corner. He pressed her between him and the wall, but she realized after her balance returned that he wasn't looking down into her face, but out into the wide lot that surrounded the station. \"Don't trust it,\" he said, just loud enough for her to hear him. \"She bugged you, no doubt she bugged every car in the house just to be careful.\" \"How do you know?\" \"Because I would have,\" Vincent answered. \"That trick in your underwear was smart, but it also means we have to head back the other way. They'll think we're still going south, but we're going to go north.\" \"Vincent, we go far enough north, and we end up back in the states,\" she said quietly. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I'm going to the car, get what we need.\" He glanced down at her. \"You did bring the present I gave you, didn't you?\" \"It's in my bag,\" she answered. \"Stay here,\" he said, and stepped away from her to walk toward the car. The man was like a living shadow. He slithered across the lot, and she barely saw the car door open. She heard absolutely nothing, and after a brief few minutes, he was coming back, her bag in one hand, his in another. He didn't give it to her, though - he took it back into the bathroom and checked each and every item, just to be sure. Satisfied that there wasn't anything there, he packed everything back up and guided her toward the other end of the lot. \"What are we going to do?\" she asked quietly. \"Steal a car,\" he stated. \"I left our keys in the car, so it's really more like a trade.\" \"Unless the people whose car we steal doesn't know to take our car,\" she pointed out. \"Details. It's not my fault if people don't think. Besides, anything we're going to get here? Trust me, they're getting the better end of the deal. Come on.\" She didn't have much choice - it was either that or stay there and wait for Claudia to show up. While that didn't appeal, she did consider suggesting it to Vincent, thinking that maybe a good confrontation might end this entire mess. Vincent, however, would have thought of that himself if it had been a wise option. They were heading toward a newish-looking Volkswagon Bug when she grabbed his arm. He stopped, giving her a reprimanding look over his shoulder. \"We could take another chance,\" she said, pulling herself up to him, speaking as quietly as she could. \"We could ask that couple for a ride.\" She pointed to the motorhome. Mom and Pop were emptying out the trash, sweeping out the inside, and they were a rather spritely looking couple, with kind faces and the weight that came with age. \"What, you think those old farts are going to give a ride to a couple of hitchhikers like us?\" He looked incredulous. \"You know how unsafe it is to pick up strangers. They'll think we're psychos.\" She bit her tongue. Well, in your case, Vinnie, they would be right . \"But I have my doctor's license,\" she pressed. \"They might trust us. And why wouldn't they, we're not going to hurt them, are we?\" \"No,\" he said, actually beginning to consider. \"If they say no, we'll go to plan B,\" she said. \"Improvise, Darwin, E-Ching, shit happens.\" She leaned a little closer, pressing on his wrist. \"Come on, we don't have anything to lose.\" He shrugged. \"Fine. Worth a try, I guess.\" For someone who had once been quite insistent that he didn't lie, Vincent was very good at it. The couple, Emily and Steve, were as sweet as they came. They were out in Mexico, enjoying the environment and the beginnings of their retirement. They had always wanted to travel in wild places, and while they were keenly aware of the safety issues, neither one was worried. Turned out, both of them were marksman shooters, and they had been in the military at one point, which was where they'd met. After their service had ended, they'd been discharged, and gotten married. They had about a half-dozen kids, all of them involved in some kind of martial arts or another, one of them a blackbelt in something Victoria didn't recognize, but Vincent smiled and nodded to with the clear indication that he knew exactly what they were talking about. Either way you looked at it, Emily and Steve were two very tough cookies, and not worried about running into trouble. Vincent and Victoria sat on the large, curved couch in the motor-home's miniaturized dining room slash living room. Emily was chatting away like an old relative, while Steve had them back on the road. The sun had cleared the horizon about an hour ago, and they were already talking about making another stop at the first place they found for some breakfast. Vincent had introduced them by their real first names, Vincent and Victoria. Victoria was a doctor (true) and he was a private contractor (false) and they were married (very, very false) and spending some time in Mexico, looking into some places that could take them both on. Vincent knew too much about private contracting, though, when Steve started to ask some questions that Victoria found a little too detailed. Anyway, their car had broken down and they were stuck at the station. Mom and Pop, as Victoria saw them in her head, had saved their lives. She listened to them chatting, listened to the woman carry on, listened to Vincent smile and be gracious and polite and interested. For a while, it was almost enough to keep her awake. She had to keep herself from staring at Vincent. It wasn't often she got to see him in his social mode, but she knew it was there. As long as he didn't have to do all the talking, he was really great at it. A real listener, the kind of person who had you utterly convinced that he cared what you were saying, like an old friend. But soon, the lack of sleep and the heavy stress of the night and morning began to take its toll on her, and she felt her eyelids growing very heavy. Before she knew it, they had drooped shut, and Vincent, very discreetly, had slipped his arm about her, pulling her closer so that her head rested on his shoulder. \"Oh, goodness me,\" Emily said after laughing at some comment Vincent had made that Victoria didn't catch, \"listen to me, just going on and on. Your wife is drop dead tired. Would she like to lie down in the back? We have a queen size bed in this home, and it's a good quality mattress, too. Special ordered and installed. No camper beds for us.\" \"Yeah,\" Steve agreed. \"You've had a rough night, having to hike to that station in the middle of nowhere. We can pick you up some carry out, you can stay in the camper and get some rest.\" Victoria had opened her eyes. The thought of a bed was wonderful at the moment. She felt Vincent standing, felt him half-lift her with him. \"That would be great, Emily,\" he said, his voice all sweetness. \"I want to hear more about your niece and nephew at lunch, though.\" Emily chuckled, slapped her hand lightly across Vincent's shoulder. \"Never knew a man who loved jazz as much as my little Rickie. Maybe I can dig up one of his recordings of his sax if you want to hear it.\" \"Sounds perfect,\" Vincent said, although his full attention was on Victoria now, who felt like a zombie. They went through the back curtain, and she vaguely heard Emily slip the folding door shut, giving them total privacy. She slid down onto the bed. Vincent caught her before she went down completely. His hands found the edge of her shirt and he lifted it up, then let her slide back as he removed her shoes and jeans. Then he pulled the covers out from under her and put them over her. She shut her eyes; Emily had not been lying about the mattress. It had been slept in, but it had a nice, worn feeling. And the smell of the old people was not nearly so bad - the sheets were freshly washed, still carrying the fabric softener's scent. Then Vincent slipped in behind her. She could feel that he had removed his shirt, the way his hairless chest brushed against her back. But his pants were still on. While it was a habit with him to sleep fully dressed, he'd told her some time back, it wasn't healthy, especially not the shoes. Sleep floated above her head. She could feel the dark pulling her down, but Vincent was acting odd. Not a bad odd, but definitely odd. It was keeping the very last shred of unconsciousness away. His arm, which was slung over her hip, dangled down, and his finger, usually just nervously twitching, had a purpose. She realized, with a slow push of adrenaline, that his fingers were moving over her womb. She lay still, her breathing still long and steady, as she felt his hand. It was a tender touch. From that touch, he could almost imagine what he was thinking. He was aware of the baby, he was searching for physical signs of it. Not with the cold, determined precision that he had used to search her for a bug, but with the simple curiosity of a man who had just learned he was going to be a father. Vincent was going to be a father. She sighed, shut her eyes again. \"Why aren't you asleep?\" he asked, his mouth so close to the nape of her neck that his breath sent air over the fine hairs there, making her shiver. \"You're distracting me,\" she managed, although it was in a mumbled, slurred form, as her mouth was half-down into the pillow, and not all of her muscles had been touched by the adrenaline. She felt him smile. Then his lips came closer and he kissed her. She smiled back, settled herself, and expected to feel the adrenaline drift away and sleep to return, but he didn't stop there. The kiss that had started on her neck moved down, and soon, he was exploring the plane of her back. He'd done it before, although at the time he'd been heavily occupied with another task while he was behind her, one that didn't leave much concentration to the finer details of her skin. She remembered she had liked it. Especially when he gently scraped her with his teeth. He did so, on her shoulder-blades. Her muscles twitched in pleasure, and the adrenaline increased. \"Vincent,\" she half-whispered. \"You're waking me up.\" It didn't stop him. The hand that had been feeling the delicate swell of her belly had rested there, cupping it in the palm of his hand, but his mouth took its sweet time. She knew he knew every inch of her body well enough, but this was a different thing. It was tender, above and beyond anything he had ever done to her before. It was slow, taking its time, not seeking its own pleasure, but expressing a level of affection she hadn't known he was capable of. He had worked all the way down to the small of her back - she didn't know how long he'd been going, it felt like forever, no single inch of her back left untouched, her spine nearly on fire from the exquisite sensations. The beginnings of her cheeks were either going to be his next target, or he was going to turn her over, which would have consequences of its own. \"You sure you want to do this in a stranger's motor-home?\" she managed, realizing she had been struggling to say those words for quite a while, and simply hadn't had the focus. That seemed to give him pause. She felt a ticklish exhalation of breath right at the bridge of her backside, had to press her legs together to suppress the shudder it sent through her. She didn't succeed too well. The hand on her belly reached up, grasped her shoulder, pulling her toward him, onto her back. She looked up into his face, which hovered over her. He tenderly kissed the corner of her mouth. \"Probably not,\" he said, his mouth a millimeter away from hers. He smiled, a smile she hadn't seen in a while. His glowing smile. But then, just like that, it faded. He stared into her eyes, hard but not cold. Looking nearly desperate. She doubted anyone had ever seen him look as vulnerable as she was seeing him now. When his lips parted, she had no idea what to expect. \"Don't leave me, Victoria.\" Four little words...and the power of life and death. Her throat instantly closed, she could barely breathe. She pursed her lips, moistening them, attempting some vain semblance of control. His fingers had been idly combing through the strands of her hair, out across the pillows. She reached for it, pulling it into her hands, cradling it against her chest. Her fingers traced the scar - it was a thick line, going from between his middle and ring fingers, across his hand to the back of his thumb, with a star-burst pattern at the end that indicated it had once been much worse than it was now. The scar was old, so old it was starting to fade. It still had the faintest shiny quality of new skin. She hadn't noticed the scar for a while, not until they'd come to Mexico. He'd told her a brief story about how that had happened during his military days, when he got ambushed during a scuttling mission, and some kid had nearly taken off half of his hand with a hunter's knife before he'd gotten himself together enough to take care of business. He didn't finish the story. Didn't state the obvious. A kid had tried to kill him, and had been killed instead. She never asked what he meant by \"kid,\" and tried to imagine he meant it in a figurative sense - someone young, in their twenties. But not a child. He propped his head up on his other hand to look down at her. His eyes held curiosity, but he seemed content to let her do as she pleased, willing to see where she was going. She brought the hand to her mouth. Her lips lingered over the scar. For a moment, she swore she saw his eyelids flutter. Perhaps all of that business had been his roundabout way of attempting to express to her what he wanted from her. That he wanted her to reciprocate. While the idea was not unappealing, not by a long shot, the timing was horrible on two counts - she had told him she was leaving him, and to behave in that way now would just be wrong if she was still planning to do so. Although she didn't know, at that particular second, how strong her resolve was. And second, while he could get intimate in the oddest circumstances, she could not. So she gently put his hand back down, caressed his cheek, feeling the bristle between her fingers, making the skin tingle, and rolled back toward the window. \"I really, really need a little bit of sleep, Vincent.\" She felt him nod as he settled down beside her. \"Then sleep, Victoria,\" he whispered. She closed her eyes, and he didn't disturb her again. A/N: Geez, got more reviews for this than any other chapter. Guess it was pretty good then, huh? Well, I'll tell everyone the truth -- I have no idea wehre this is going to end up. I mean, I thought I had an idea, but the characters are resisting me, and that's usually a sign that it's not going to do what I plan for it to do, and instead it's going to go somewhere else. Although how, I've got no clue. I'd ask you guys to be patient, but you've all been so incredibly cool, I know you'll all stay with me. Par : Good, glad to hear you're okay. Especially after that last chapter. Now this one is all goooooey. Fluffy, fuzzy, whatever you want to call it. Sap. Sticky sweet. Damn it was fun after all that stress. Ha! Hope I didn't make you blush with the last part on the train, although I'll admit it was kind of tame and didn't go all the way. That would have just been too much, don't you think? No, of course you don't, you're for triple X. Well, this is as detailed as I get. Maybe. Heh. MMMM...Ham sandwich. Honeybaked Ham makes the best ham salad I've ever had. Think I need to go get some tomorrow, now that you've mentioned it. :) And I couldn't help but be intrigued by what you're reading. IN college I majored in English, but we never got to read some of the great Russian masters so after graduation I had to take matters into my own hands. I read \"Crime and Punishment,\" and also Soltzenitzen's \"Cancer Ward,\" which was really dark. Love those RUssian novelists, lots of plots, lots of characters, lots of headaches. I usually understand like one or two story lines and consider myself lucky. firegoddess164 : I guess this chapter has given you encouragement. Truth be told, I still don't know what Vincent is going to do. He hasn't told me yet. Byrony Cel : Thank you for your continued encouragement. I think I need to go see Collateral tomorrow, though, just so I can get back in touch with the character. I think I've been watching too many Tom Cruise movies lately and the characters are starting to bleed through. LunaGrrBack023 : You can say it as many times as you want, darling, I won't stop you. LOL. Yeah, I guess you have a point, but people like Vincnet don't ever really get out from under the shadow of their past. Kind of like the Borne Identity, it always comes back. Vincent would testify, but he would be sure that Felix's people would be coming to hunt him down, and he wouldn't want VIctoria around to get hurt, and she certainly wouldn't stay around if she had a baby to care for. So there are complications. But who knows, we'll see. SweetArwen : Hit them with a stick! LMAO!!! I just had an image. Sorry, that was just funny. Yes, I like to thicken the plot. Although if it gets too thick it won't go down, so I have to control my urges. Heh. I'm ready to fall asleep at the computer again, and it's only 10:30 on a Friday Night! My God, I don't have a life! mellow yellow : Didn't they fire the guy who called it mellow? Sorry, couldn't resist. Welcome to our little group here! Glad to hear you read the first one, hope you're enjoying the second. HOpefully there will be more chapters to come, and I shall be expecting other reviews of those chapters in the future. Hint wink nudge. Thanks! All right, goodnight my dahlings. Vincent is asleep, Victoria is asleep, and soon, I shall be asleep. Pleasant dreams, all! May visions of a naked Vincent dance in your head.[Chapter 7] Standard Disclaimer A/N: This is what is known as a filler chapter, when you have to move your characters along a timeline, but nothing incredibly important happens. Well, something does happen, and it's important...okay, I'm not giving anything away. Read on, and don't forget to REVIEW!!!!! Resolutions When she awoke, the motorhome was stopped, and she was alone. It was sunset - she could tell by the soft gold light that made its way through the filmy curtains. She sat up, remembering she was sleeping in Mom and Pop's bed, and that she wasn't wearing anything other than her bra and panties. She pulled herself to the foot of the bed and looked down to retrieve her clothes, only to find they had been replaced by new ones. Very new ones. She picked them up. There was a skort made of white cotton, soft to the touch, with a flouncy sort of look to it, almost like a cheerleader's skirt, only divided. And a shirt, bright orange, button down, with a tropical pattern across it. There was a murmuring sound coming from the front of the motorhome, and then clearer voices as people entered. She heard Vincent laughing, heard him chatting with Mom, couldn't make out any details but it was friendly. Very friendly. Then, he pushed open the folded divider. He looked very different - black shorts, and a blue and white shirt that was more subtle than her orange one, but in the same idea. \"Good, you're up,\" he said, his smile still lingering. \"Hungry?\" \"I could eat,\" she said. He nodded. \"Then get dressed. We're treating Emily and Steve, to thank them for all their help.\" She held up the clothes. \"Where did you get these?\" \"This afternoon, at lunch. You've been out for a while. Shortly after you fell asleep we stopped for breakfast and they brought you back a blueberry muffin but it was going stale so I ate it.\" He pulled the door shut behind him, made an almost anxious gesture toward her. \"Come on, you can listen and dress at the same time.\" He went on to tell her about lunch, he had been up by then, and the place they'd stopped at had been next to a tourist trap that happened to have a clothing section in the back. It was all very hokey stuff - he'd done his best to pick out things with taste. She was a little amazed that he would pick orange for her, but when she put it on, she realized he'd been right. The color complemented her skin tone. And the short...wow, they were short. Apparently Vincent wanted her to show off her legs more, even if she didn't think much of them. \"Here, grabbed you some hemp sandals, too,\" he said as she brushed her hair in with the brush from her bag. \"Thought they might be more comfortable than those walking shoes I made you wear before.\" She nodded, slipping them on. Hemp wasn't the softest material in the world, but it kept her feet cool. Vincent took her hand and pulled her with him through the length of the motorhome, out the front door, where Mom and Pop were waiting. \"Ah, there's the girl!\" Pop said, his face smiling. He reminded Victoria just a bit of her own father. She couldn't help but smile back, in spite of her initial crankiness that always happened after waking up. \"You sleep up an appetite?\" \"Yeah,\" she replied, and included Mom in her smile. \"You've been so nice, I really, really appreciate you letting me use your bed.\" \"No problem honey.\" She winked at her. \"Girl in your condition needs at the rest she can get.\" Victoria's smile faltered for just a second, and then brightened. \"Does it show?\" she whispered. \"Only to someone who knows what it looks like,\" Emily replied, putting a matronly arm around her back. The old woman smiled up at Vincent. \"Congratulations to you both!\" Vincent, who had been smiling pleasantly all the while, maintained his smile, but it left his eyes. \"Well, look, come on, Steve needs to take his medicine and I know Victoria hasn't eaten all day. Let's go inside.\" Everyone always said in Mexico to never drink the water. That ruled out iced tea, lemonade, and even coffee. So that meant Victoria was stuck drinking soda, and all they had was Coke and Sprite. She was so thirsty she downed at least three glasses of the sugary lemon-lime drink before their food showed up. She had a craving for steak, and man, was the steak good. She finished it, the salad, even ate the skin from the baked potato. Emily offered her a piece of her fried chicken, which she found herself taking gladly, and she was munching Vincent's French fries afterward, as he rarely ate them, referring to them as only garnish for the sandwich. The best part, though, was the vegetables that came on the side. Steamed and flavored with a variety of spices, they were sweet and spicy and salty all at once, and she could have ordered a heaping plate of just them for desert and not blinked. However, Steve had a sweet tooth, and he wanted apple pie alamode, which put the vision of a big chocolate brownie with ice cream on top into Victoria's head. \"You're going to get fat,\" Vincent teased as she scooped up the last of the ice cream and finished the rest of her Sprite. \"Oh, you better believe it!\" Emily said cheerfully, eyes glowing as she looked at the young couple across the table. \"Big and round in forty weeks. How far along are you, dear?\" \"I think eight,\" she replied, noting Vincent's distinct mood change again. \"Well, eat whenever you want, whatever you want. That's the key. And see a doctor. Have you seen a doctor yet, dear?\" \"She is a doctor,\" Vincent said in a low voice. \"Yes, but a physician can't heal thyself,\" Steve put in. \"You need a good obstetrician. Here in Mexico isn't any kind of place for that, you need to go back to the States. Vincent, didn't you say you were heading back their soon?\" \"Yeah, I did mention that,\" Vincent said, giving Victoria a sideways glance. \"Well, sooner rather than later,\" Steve said. \"If you're eight weeks along and you don't have a doctor yet, then you can't have been getting the right vitamins. The right pre-natal care makes all the difference.\" \"Well, where they're headed, dear,\" Emily put in, \"I think Vicki here could find someone who could take a quick look at her, make sure everything is going okay, get her started until she can get someone permanent. They aren't all butchers down here, you know.\" \"Yeah, true enough. That guy in Mexico City fixed you right up good, didn't he?\" Steve reminisced. Victoria was tempted to say something then and there, ask Vincent where they were going, but knew that was a bad idea. To show any lack of harmony between them while they were in the middle of an act would have only served to make Vincent more tense than he already was. Not that he had seemed tense before they'd started talking about her pregnancy. The thought soured her stomach. Suddenly all the food felt like a big lump of rock in her gut. More light conversation, and then a final ride in the motorhome, where Emily finally dug out her son's CD and played it for Vincent, who said that her son was terrific on the sax. An hour later, they were driving through fancier streets, and catching the sight of the ocean between the tall, white buildings. \"Well, there's your hotel,\" Steve said, pointing as they pulled into a parking lot. \"Sorry we can't get you closer, but they don't let motorhomes into those big round driveways. Victoria looked out the window. It was a very grand place, one of those resorts she saw only in movies and on postcards that beckoned the tourist industry to visit exotic Mexico. Vincent offered to pay Mom and Pop for gas, was refused, instead he got their address for when they returned to the States, and a friendly invitation to never hesitate to drop by and say hello. And then Victoria and Vincent were alone with their bags slung over their shoulders. He offered her his arm, which she took, and they went into the hotel. Vincent was on a roll that day. He'd gotten them the bridal suite, claiming he and his wife were on a second honeymoon. He gave them his credit card name (Albert Ricardo) and away they had gone into the most beautiful hotel room Victoria had ever seen. It was three rooms - a sitting room, a dining room/kitchen, and a bedroom with a larger bed in it than she could imagine sleeping in. The bathroom could have made four, with the gigantic round tub deep enough for the both of them to sit in. There were complimentary items everywhere, snacks in the fridge, flowers in the bedroom, thick white robes embossed with gold emblems, even some...personal items in the drawer beside the bed. And the best part was that it looked right out onto the resort's private beach, which was dark now, but faced east, where the sun would be rising in the morning. Victoria didn't know what to do. She just stood there, looking around, open-mouthed. If she'd been with anyone else, she would have thought it was a ploy to get her to stay with him. However, it was Vincent, and Vincent didn't resort to cheap ploys like that. Did he? \"Want a bath?\" he said, coming out of the room in question. \"I started running some hot water for you, and there's bubbles.\" \"Bubbles?\" she echoed. \"You hate bubbles.\" \"Yeah, but you don't.\" He gave her a distinct come-hither look. In his brightly colored clothes, and in the faint lights from outside, he looked much younger - the lines on his face softened. He reached out a hand to her. \"Come on...you're tense, you need to relax.\" \" I'm tense,\" she said, but took his hand. \"Hello, pot, I'm kettle.\" He chuckled. \"Come on...let's finish what we started before.\" It wasn't part of their natural routine to do things like that together. There had been a few times in the shower, but that had been in the beginning, when she could sense Vincent's amazement at having a woman so close at hand, someone he cared about and who cared about him. Their honeymoon - although it really should have lasted longer. Two months was the limit of their relationship, maybe two and a half. They didn't celebrate anniversaries, although Victoria was aware of them. They would never get a chance to ignore their three-month one. Although Vincent seemed hell-bent on making the best of what time he had left. She didn't think she'd be tired after sleeping all day, but she learned there was a delicious difference between being tired and being relaxed. Vincent was playful in the bathtub, tolerating the bubbles, even permitting her to put a heap of them on her head. After a short time, Victoria found herself getting lost in the romance of the moment, thinking briefly she was with a normal man, that they were celebrating their honeymoon, that they were new lovers, still friends, just getting to know each other and reveling in what they already did know. Vincent had to have been a masseuse in a previous life. She'd always known his hands were strong, and that he was gentle, but it was a different experience. He never touched her anywhere intimate - his fingers simply worked at all the muscles in her back, in her arms, her legs. He washed her hair, twisting the soapy locks up and looping them onto her head like a little boy playing with clay. When he was done, he let her reciprocate, which she did, trying to imitate what he'd done and finding that even if it wasn't a perfect replication, Vincent enjoyed it. When they were done, he was leaning against her, his back pressing against her breasts, his head resting on her shoulder, her chin against his temple. The smell of the shampoo was expensive - salty-sweet, like the ocean. It lingered about them, relaxing. She understood a few of the benefits of aromatherapy, but doubted it could be as satisfying as this. He was playing with a wet lock of her hair that had fallen forward and rested across his chest. \"Victoria,\" he whispered. \"Hmmm?\" It was a vibration through her chest into his back. \"I'm sorry I didn't let you touch me sooner.\" She had half-closed her eyes. They opened only a little. \"I never knew you were doing that.\" \"Not...not like that,\" he said, and she felt him shift his shoulders, attempting not to let himself get tense. She hadn't realized before then how relaxed he was, just in her arms, abandoning himself to her. \"Just...no one has ever touched me before.\" \"No one?\" she whispered. \"Not like you. Not...the way you do.\" He raised his eyes, looking at her. \"No one ever wanted to.\" \"I wouldn't be so sure,\" she said, smoothing the hair away from his face. It seemed much darker in its wet state, increasing the youth of his face. He chuckled. It rippled against her chest. \"Well...I do have a tendency to be modest.\" \"No,\" she teased. \"You don't. You just don't know.\" She ran her fingers through his hair, through the top, tips against his scalp, feeling the thickness of it. He was lucky - so many men had to worry about hair loss. \"What don't I know?\" She tightened her arms around him, and he settled further into her grasp. The warm water was still about them, rippling only with their movement. \"What it might have been like for you.\" She didn't need to say the rest. He'd thought about it before, on one of those rare nights when he wanted to talk, when he wanted her to know more about him than just facts and dates and favorite things. He thought about it, what his life would have been like if his mother hadn't died, if his father hadn't beat him up, if he'd been raised like a normal kid. He usually didn't get far, as his tendency was not to dwell on what-ifs and might-have-beens. Darwin, E-Ching, roll with it baby, it's life, it happens . \"I see...you would have been an actor,\" she whispered. He chuckled. \"An actor? Why?\" \"Because you're very good at pretending,\" she said in a light voice. \"And you would have made....\" \"T.V. shows? Like the Sopranos?\" \"No, movies. Big ones, lots of action, because you like being active. And you would have been famous, and girls would have been throwing themselves at you, and for a long time, maybe you'd let them.\" \"Sounds like a lot of emptiness to me,\" he murmured. \"Well, eventually, you would have met a woman,\" Victoria went on, as if seeing it in front of her, a movie behind her eyes. \"She would have been...a red-head.\" He smiled. \"And you would get married and have babies and be a father to them.\" \"Doesn't sound like me.\" \"No, you wouldn't be afraid of being a father because you would know what one is supposed to be like,\" she said, her tone still gentle, and secretly amazed that he was listening, that he wasn't getting upset, and that she actually had the guts to say what she was saying. \"What about you?\" he asked. \"Would I know you?\" \"Oh, I would definitely be a fan,\" she said, smiling down at him. \"I'd be one in a crowd of a thousand other girls wanting to shake your hand. You would be walking down a red carpet with your pretty red-head wife on your arm, looking gorgeous in a green silk dress that brought out her eyes, and you in a sleek tuxedo. Or maybe just a very expensive black silk Armani suit.\" \"I do like Armani.\" \"And maybe you'd see me, and I'd be lucky enough to get to shake your hand.\" He frowned. \"If I saw you...that's all I'd do? I'd shake your hand?\" She nodded. \"You'd be married, with the babies, you'd be happy with your life.\" His frown softened, but he still looked sad. \"I don't know. If I saw you, maybe I'd realize it was all a mistake.\" She shook her head. \"No, you wouldn't.\" \"Maybe I'd leave my wife to be with you.\" She laughed a bit loudly. \"No, you definitely wouldn't. Not for me, anyway. Maybe some hot Spanish babe with Audrey Hepburn hair and big soft red lips. But not me.\" \"Why not you?\" \"Because you're way out of my league,\" she sighed, resting her head back against the porcelain rim of the tub. He was quiet for a long moment. \"I think I like it better the way it is now.\" \"The only way I could see that is if the whole world suddenly hated you for leaving your gorgeous wife for a gorgeous girlfriend, and everybody took her side and the poor babies you left behind.\" He lifted up his head. \"The water is getting cold,\" he said. \"Come on...let's dry off.\" She watched him get up, enjoying the peep show while it lasted. When he was dry, he pulled her out of the tub and did the same for her, then wrapped her up in the big towel and carried her to the bed. \"What are you doing?\" she giggled when he set her down and straddled her, pinning her in the towel underneath him. He looked down into her face, smiling. \"I'm pretending you're that gorgeous red-headed wife you said I'd have. And maybe later on, you'll be that gorgeous Spanish girlfriend who looks like Audrey Hepburn.\" She giggled as his mouth descended onto her, stifling her. \"Ah,\" she said as she caught her breath. \"So there was something appealing about that little story I told.\" \"Only the part where you said I'd get to meet you,\" he said, pulling away the towel. He sighed, running his fingers through her wet hair. \"No one has ever let me touch them,\" he whispered, his voice returning to that deep, wistful melancholy from before, \"like you let me touch you. I don't know if anyone's ever wanted me to.\" \"Maybe you just never gave them a chance to find out,\" she replied. \"Hm.\" He threw the towel behind them onto the floor. \"Well...I guess I'm glad it worked out this way, then.\" Vincent slept that night. It was a rare thing, and usually done while she was asleep herself, so she rarely got to witness it. It was a light sleep, so she didn't move much. Just watched him, his chest rising and falling, the lines on his face melting. She imagined what he looked like when he was young. She imagined what he'd look like with dark hair, wondered if maybe he'd tried it himself once upon a time. The image was pleasing, but it wasn't her Vincent. It was the Vincent from the fantasy life she'd made up, where he was someone else. Someone who wasn't hers. She sighed, resting on her side, arms wrapped around her midsection, knees bent. Vincent was on his side, too, but he was straight, one arm jammed under his pillow, the other stretched out toward her, his knuckles just brushing her forearm. She didn't want to move. She knew the slightest movement would wake him. She couldn't imagine never being able to really sleep. Perhaps she liked her sleep too much. Vincent had once told her that the higher the life from, the less sleep was necessary. It was insane. She shouldn't love him this much. She shouldn't. It was wrong. He was a killer. He took money and he took lives. Cold blooded, calculating... She pressed her face down into her pillow. What if their baby was the same way? What if it was genetic? What if she was gestating a monster? She closed her eyes, tightly, pushing away the images. No. It wasn't true, she couldn't believe it. The argument of nature verses nurture had always come up even. Her baby would have the best life she could give him...or her. He would not grow up to be like that. She opened her eyes. Vincent was right. He wasn't father material. He didn't know how to be a dad - she'd said it herself. Her earlier thoughts returned, about how she was able to consciously walk around his eccentricities and adjust herself to his habits was possible only because she chose those things. A baby wouldn't be able to choose. It would be the center of its own universe, its own nature. And it would become a product of its environment. Especially if that environment contained a murderer. She was crazy to think that she could stay with him and have his child. She had to choose. Victoria drew a shuddering breath. It had really only been a matter of time. Gently, she pushed herself upright, making as little vibrations into the mattress as possible. She slipped off the bed and went to the closet, found herself a robe, and wrapped herself up in it. She was amazed that Vincent didn't wake up, especially with the low hum of the sliding door. She had to grin - apparently she'd worn him out, finally. It was about time. In the main room, there was a huge wall made of windows with a door in the middle. It let out to a private patio. She propped the door open, letting in the crisp morning breezes, and went to sit in a chair to watch the sun come up. It was a shame, how the peaceful moments made her so aware of how little peace her life really had. Yet, when Vincent had rejected the pretty picture she'd made for him, she had understood. In her heart of hearts, she couldn't help but feel that being with him, even for the short time, had been worth it. \"Wow, I really slept,\" Vincent said when he emerged from the opened door at about seven o'clock. The sun was already above the horizon line and starting its climb. He sat down in a chair beside hers, propped up his feet and slid on his sunglasses. \"How about you?\" \"A little...since I slept so much yesterday,\" she admitted. \"Yeah, yesterday was a trip.\" He looked around, found an old newspaper sitting on the small plastic table in front of them, pulled it toward him and browsed the main headlines. It was an American paper, even older than she'd thought at first, and slightly yellow around the edges. It had obviously been sitting there for a while. \"You ever do that before?\" she asked. \"Hitchhike with strangers?\" \"Never, actually.\" He tossed her a little smile. \"It was a stroke of brilliance, really. Claudia would never suspect it.\" \"I don't know,\" Victoria said slowly, shifting a little in her chair. \"Listen to the optimist,\" he quipped. \"I'm supposed to be the paranoid one, Victoria.\" She chuckled. \"Yes, but I'm the woman. It's my nature.\" \"Thank God,\" he murmured, then threw the paper down. \"This is shit. I'm going to go downstairs, see if I can't dig up something more recent.\" He stood up, bent down, kissed her lightly on the lips and went into the suite. \"I'll be back as soon as I can. You want anything?\" \"I'm going to order some coffee from room service,\" she said, raising her voice to call after him inside, \"if you think the water is safe enough.\" \"In a place like this, I'm sure it is,\" he answered from the bedroom as he dressed. \"Yeah, coffee sounds good, get some Danish, too. Something light. That supper yesterday is still sticking to my ribs.\" He picked up the hotel room key-card and left. It took him a little longer than he expected, as when he went downstairs, he found himself bombarded with more choices than he'd imagined. He wound up picking up about three more magazines than he'd intended, as well as a few bottles of water, before charging it all to the room and heading back upstairs. When he got there, Victoria was not on the patio. He walked into the bedroom, expecting to find her getting dressed. What he saw was Victoria, curled in a fetal position, her robe pulled up around her hips. Her lower legs and feet had been cut to bloody ribbons, and her hands were tied from wrist to elbow by the cord from the telephone. She was sobbing in a way that clearly showed she was desperately trying to stop. Vincent looked up. Immediately behind her, holding a very expensive looking handgun to Victoria's temple, was Claudia. \"Good morning, Vincent,\" she said. A/N: Well, this is what is known as a filler chapter with a good cliffhanger end. I had to use the last two chapters to get the characters from point A to point B and I confess I did go the long way, but it was fun anyway. It'll be a few days before another chapter is ready. I've started on the big showndown, but I don't know where it's going to go yet. And as you can tell, by the conversation Victoria and Vincent were having, I had watched WAAAAAAAY too many Tom Cruise movies this week. In the meantime... Par : Yeah, it was pretty stressy and angsty. Although this chapter started out very sappy and romantic, it went into stress really quick. Funny you should mention Fight Club, I read that last summer, and I really understood the movie much better, even though I loved the movie, period. I probably would have been a little disappointed with the movie if I'd read the book first. I've always said that any movie made based on a book is just a big advertisement for the book itself -- like the movie, love the book. I never got to read too many Latino writers in college, I did major world authors, major American authors, major British authors (and I really liked the professor for that class, I quote some of the things he said to this day) and Women in Literature, Science FIction, and my favorite, Pop CUlture, where we had to read the original book for \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" in which the rabbit actually DID kill the guy! And we read MAUS, the graphic novel about the holocaust, and let's see...it was just a great, interesting class. We learned what the word \"Haver\" means from the song \"500 Miles\" by the Proclaimers. Anyway, I am soooo rambling. You and I need to keep in touch after this fanfic is over, I have a feeling we have a lot more in common. Especially the bit about the screenplays. :) LunaGrrBack023 : I am totally a music person. In fact, I'm putting together a mixed CD for the story, and I already have the Collateral soundtrack, plus some other songs that really hit home with that story. My favorite two tracks on the Collateral soundtrack are \"Destino de Abril\" by the Green Car Motel, and Antoni Pinto's \"Requiem.\" I wouldn't be able to write at all without the music! LOL. Anyway, let me know what you think of the Radio Free Roscoe story...I get the reviews via email so even reviews from old stories get bounced to me. Marie : Welcome to the club! Yes, Victoria is rather patient, isn't she? I don't think so much of her as patient, as a person who has an incredible ability to adapt to her circumstances, considering what she's been through. She's been through such hell, losing her license to practice, and her life was in such a dark place, that being with Vincent is the only light she feels she has. But that's just my impression of her...everyone else is entitled to their own. :) Byrony Cel : It doesn't seem like something Vincent would do, huh? I can see that point. At the same time, I have to say that Vincent is a wizz at improvising. I love his little speech in the jazz club about how people go through the same routine every day, playing it safe. Where will you be ten years from now? You don't know where you'll be ten minutes from now. So I would never put anything past him. :) All right, see you guys again in a few days. REVIEW![Chapter 8] Interlude (In which the author discovers that she had completely forgotten about an important, even if not a major, character in the story.) Victoria: Where is Max? Me: Uh...with Annie, where he belongs. Victoria: No, I mean Max, my little puppy? The one Vincent bought for me? Me: (very embarrassed) Um...what puppy? Victoria: Oh come on! After all the deal you made? Heaping that stuff on me about feeling sympathy for the little guy? The one the guy was holding in his hand at Union Station? You remember the puppy. You remember Max. Me: Well, wasn't he at the house with you in Mexico? Victoria: He was...oh my gosh, we left him! (Vincent enters the room) Vincent: What are you two carrying on about? Me: Nothing. Victoria: My puppy! We have to go back for him! Vincent: You mean Max? That puppy I paid eight hundred and fifty dollars for? Me: Oh bloody hell. Vincent: What do you mean, we forgot him? Victoria: We left him at your house in Mexico. We have to go back. Vincent: We can't go back. You're tied up on a bed with a gun to your head. I'm about to open a can of whoop-ass. There isn't time. (Vincent turns and looks at me) Vincent: You forgot about the dog, didn't you? Me: What are you talking about? He's your dog. Yours and Victoria's. It's YOUR responsibility, not mine. Vincent: Don't give me that shit. You were in charge of keeping track of everybody. And you forgot all about the dog. Now look how upset Victoria is. Victoria: (sobbing) I want my puppy! Me: Oh crap in a hat...pull it together, woman, you got bigger problems. Vincent: Don't talk to her like that. Victoria: Don't talk to me like that! (Claudia enters) Claudia: What the hell is going on in here? Vincent: She forgot the puppy. Claudia: You forgot the puppy? Me: Victoria, stop crying! Vincent: I said, don't talk to her like that. You're the one who forgot her puppy. Claudia: You forgot the puppy. Man, that's cold. Even I wouldn't have forgotten the puppy. Me: Oh, great, now I'm getting hell from two murdering psychopaths. Vincent: Excuse me, not psychopaths, sociopaths . There is a difference. Me: Whatever. What am I supposed to do about it? Vincent: You're the author, think of something. Claudia: Man, poor little puppy, back in that big house, all by himself. Victoria: (sobbing harder) Poor little Max! Claudia: (to Vincent) You let her name the puppy Max? Vincent: Don't blame me, that's her fault again. Me: Bloody hell. You know, this would never have happened if I'd had an editor looking through my story before I published it. She would have gone, \"Hey, where's that puppy?\" and I would have put him in and all of this wouldn't have happened. Although I think SweetArwen did try to warn me... Vincent: Well, that's the price you pay for free publishing on the internet. Now, oh great and powerful author, you need to get your ass back to that house and get the puppy. We've got a bad situation here and you're the only one who can take care of it right now. Besides, it would look even more stupid than it already does if you made us go back to get the puppy. People would think WE were to blame or something, when it was just you. Me: (without a word, goes to the house in Mexico, trips over the coffee table by the couch, throws out the rotten oranges, searched through the dark for Max the puppy because the electricity has all been shut off because Vincent and Victoria didn't pay the bill. Finds the puppy, picks it up, puts it in its carrier.) Victoria: Max! Me: Yeah, yeah, here's Max. In his carrier. Vincent: About time. Me: Don't get all worked up. It won't do you any good where the next chapter is going. Claudia: Well, at least Victoria will shut up about it. (Vincent punches her. Victoria kicks her. Various reviewers throw rotten tomatoes at her) Claudia: Hey! (gets tomatoes out of her hair) What the hell? Me: Better you than me. Claudia: I didn't forget about the puppy! Me: No, you just tied up Victoria and keep torturing Vincent. Claudia: Oh please, like you don't like it when I torture Vincent. Me: I'd prefer not to comment with him standing right there. Vincent: Right. Well, shall we get on with this? Get back to the regular story? Me: Yeah, I just got to figure out how I'm going to explain Max sudden reappearing. (Victoria is too busy kissing Max to pay any more attention to the conversation) Claudia: Just slip it in. Nobody will notice. Vincent: That's what the girls always say to me...hey, that wasn't cool! Me: Sorry, couldn't resist. Okay, hope this solves our problem. See you in a few days with the continuing drama![Chapter 9] Standard Disclaimer Liabilities Fanning should have listened to those little voices inside him that said not to trust Claudia any farther than he could throw her. \"Okay, the one in the car is gone,\" Claudia had said, counting off the dots on the radar. \"And now he's found the one in her underwear.\" She shot Fanning a decidedly wicked look. \"Care to speculate how he managed that?\" Fanning just glared at her. She started up their vehicle, the engine nearly silent as it came to life. They followed. For hours they followed. Vincent was taking a very obscure route, and since they had a location on them at every minute, it was safer and easier to take a more mainstream route, just to let their quarry feel like they had lost their pursuers. They found the car at some desert island of a rest stop, with it empty and the engine still warm. \"I should have bugged the dog,\" Claudia said. Fanning shook his head. \"They would have either gotten rid of the collar, or if you'd taken the lesser route, that would have been lost the first time he took a shit.\" She winked at him. \"There are other ways.\" She showed him her arm, the soft underside where the blue veins could be seen through her pale skin. There was a dark smudge in the middle, easily mistaken for an old scar. Fanning looked closer and noticed the faintness of the rising ridges, almost like the lines on a scanning tag. \"You think they don't know where I am at all times?\" she asked. \"You think they let people like us just wander around, unchecked? They teach me how to be invisible, Ray darling. They have to have a way to watch me, somehow.\" Fanning rubbed his arm in sympathy. True, there were days when he felt like the L.A.P.D. thought they owned him, but he'd never been branded. It must be a strange feeling, that mark on her arm. \"So how do agents go rogue then, if they're tagged like that?\" he asked as they climbed back into the car. She looked down at her arm. \"The braver ones just use a knife. But they implant it very close to the major artery, so that cutting it out is a rather dangerous thing if not done properly. Then, if you have a lot of money, there are ways to sabotage it. But that hurts even worse than cutting it out.\" She turned the car back on, and focused on the radar screen. The last blimp, the very last bug she had planted on them, was still blinking. It headed in a steady northern direction. \"Think they're headed back to the states?\" Fanning asked hopefully. \"That was the plan,\" Claudia murmured, \"but somehow I think Vincent is going to hold off. Problem with chasing guys like him, they know all your tricks. Anybody else would have fled back to the states right now and that way we could have gotten him into legal custody without any more subterfuge, but Vincent will wait. Victoria, though...I don't know.\" Fanning considered her words. \"You think she'll leave him?\" \"That's what she said before, isn't it?\" \"You don't think that was just a reaction to what had happened? You don't think Vincent will talk her out of it?\" \"You know her better than me, Ray,\" Claudia said, looking for a moment like a very ordinary human being, as flawed as the rest of them. But there was a sharpness in her eyes that clearly told Fanning she was just trying to pick his brain instead of letting him pick hers. \"You think she'll stay?\" \"I think she'd be stupid to stay,\" Fanning said, \"but considering what she's done already, she might feel like she doesn't have another choice.\" \"The baby will drive her away,\" Claudia said confidently. \"Look at those tire tracks. Big, wide ones. A motor home passed through here. It's in the same general direction. I think Vinnie and his chickadee hitched a ride.\" \"Why will the baby drive her away?\" Fanning pressed. Claudia shook her head, talking casually as she drove, one arm hanging out the window. \"You still haven't picked that one up? Vincent is not going to be a father. It isn't part of his make-up. You know how fucked up his real father was? He doesn't have a single clue. No more than I do about how to be a mother. And she won't give the baby up. It's not in her make-up either. They've come to an impass and the only way out is to part ways.\" Claudia paused. \"Which does pose a slight problem for us.\" \"Like?\" \"Like now we're racing the clock. We have to corner them before Victoria can walk. If we don't, Vincent won't have any liabilities. He'll be a free agent and that will make him extremely dangerous.\" \"You're saying he isn't dangerous as long as Victoria is around?\" Claudia smirked. \"Let's just say, she dulls his teeth. Either she's going to leave him or he'll leave her. Although if he hasn't done it by now, it's only going to make things worse later.\" Fanning let the silence rest for a few minutes. It bugged him to no end that Claudia kept referring to Victoria as a \"liability.\" While Claudia had promised not to hurt her during the earlier interrogation, the bruise she had left had really pissed Fanning off. Claudia insisted that it was mostly harmless, completely superficial, and that it was absolutely necessary because if she hadn't, Victoria might have alerted a neighbor and spoiled Claudia's chance to talk to her. Not that there were a lot of neighbors around, Fanning noted, but couldn't help but agree with the effectiveness of her choices. He hadn't liked listening to the way Claudia preyed on all of Victoria's weaknesses and fears, but as a cop, he knew it was just good old fashioned interrogation. A part of the job. He'd done it himself once or twice. It wasn't personal, it was just business. Although he was sure that the bruise on her temple was just one little thing that was a prelude to the rest of the shit about to go down. He really should have listened to those little voices. In the trunk of the car, with his wrists and ankles tied so tightly he could feel his fingers and toes starting to lose circulation, Fanning struggled. He should never have taken his eyes off Claudia for a second. All that talk, all that sharing about her job, all that openness had just been a ruse, a distraction. The second they'd arrived at the resort, his little alarms had started to go off - the alarms that told him he was standing in the middle of a major crime scene, even though there was only broken glass, tire tracks, and spray patterns of blood. Claudia was too cool, too rational. They'd parked all the way on the other side of the resort's huge lot, where all the rich people had their expensive vehicles parked, and there were high black iron gates with security all around. She showed the man at the check-in window something that Fanning didn't see before he let her through, and also after she'd slipped him a hundred dollar bill. In a private corner, she'd gotten out, and called to Fanning to come over and help her with something on the other side. Not imagining what in the hell she would need help with, he'd come around the corner. No one saw her clobber him head-on in the face, right between the eyes. She hadn't broken his nose, but she had scrambled his brains long enough for her to knock his feet right out from under him and land him on his back, where his weight effectively knocked all the wind out of his lungs. As he struggled to breath, she had him flipped over and her knees in his kidneys, pinning him in place. She tied his wrists first, hard and tight, then his ankles. She had slid the back door open and pulled him inside, then opened some compartment from the back seat that led right to the trunk, which she shoved him through. \"What...what...what the fuck are you doing?\" he gasped, finally able to breath again. \"Sorry, Ray,\" she said, smoothing back the hair that had fallen into his face. \"You were a big help, but now I've got to do this on my own, and I know you're gonna be really pissed at me for doing what I have to do right now.\" \"What are you going to do?\" he croaked. She just shook her head. \"Trade secret, dear. Now you be good and wait here. Victoria is probably going to need you pretty badly when I'm done. It was a lot of fun working with you, while it lasted.\" She kissed his cheek. \"Bye.\" And she locked him in.[Chapter 10] Standard Disclaimer A/N: Sorry it took so long to update--I'm really only a day late, but I know I left two cliffhangars so I totally understand the impatience, it's actually flattering. Truth Claudia was normally very good at her job. But she had a serious flaw. At the worst times, she could make the simplest mistake. It was very much a matter of overconfidence. She was good at talking down to her prey, breaking them up inside, exposing their weaknesses, making them vulnerable. She would whittle them down to nearly nothing, and many times she conquered in this way. But occasionally, she met someone who did not cave when made to face the awful truth of their own humanity. Instead, this person would respond in exactly the opposite way. And if she wasn't aware of this fact, she could be caught off guard. Like turning away to talk into the phone. She should never have done that. Victoria wasn't the fastest cutter in the world, but the knife was sharp. Vincent's ankles were free and only one wrist remained bound by the time Claudia turned back, aimed and fired. Vincent stood up. Even though the chair was heavy, adrenaline and years of discipline made him extraordinarily strong and fast. He pulled the chair up by the arm he was still bound to, and swung it around. The heavy chair flew between them. The bullet hit the wood, right at the intersection of where the arm was attached to the back of the chair, shattering the connection. His wrist slipped free as gravity took hold of the wood. Claudia fired again. Vincent had caught the remains of the chair with his other hand, and hurled them at her. The bullet hit them, and a split-second later, the chair hit her, knocking the gun from her hand. Vincent's reflexes were like electric shocks jumping from neuron to neuron. He leapt at her, his hands out, going to her wrists before she could get to a hold-out pistol stored in her jacket. But Claudia was not one to go down lightly. Victoria watched as Vincent tackled Claudia, hurling her onto the bed. His fist made heavy contact with her jaw, but Claudia's fingers found Vincent's nose and eye and left three wide scratches, half-blinding him for a moment. Then her fist came right up and knocked his jaw up into his head, slamming his teeth together so hard Victoria was sure she heard a tooth crack. Vincent brought his hands together and rabbit punched her right in the gut, just as his head was being forced in the other direction. Even with her lack of hair, Claudia was able to get herself together enough to use Vincent's weight against him. She heaved up her legs, effectively tossing him right over her head and off the bed into a heap on the other side. Victoria saw the gun lying on the floor, almost under the bed. She had managed to forget the slashes in her legs for the minute it took to throw herself across the floor and pick it up. As Claudia spring-boarded upright, Victoria rolled onto her back, gun pointed up. The second Claudia's face came over the edge of the bed, searching for the gun, Victoria fired. She was a lousy shot, but she got a good squeal out of Claudia for her effort. She didn't see, but the bullet had torn her cheek, sending chunks of flesh flying across the bedspread. While not a serious wound, it was extremely ugly, and rather painful. Claudia reeled backwards, just in time for Vincent to get to his feet again and get her from behind by the scruff of her hair. He hauled her off the back of the bed and chopped her across his leg, his knee hitting her hard in the base of her spine. She crumpled into a heap at his feet. Without pausing, Vincent reached over and seized the lamp, yanking the cord out of the socket and the base. He flipped Claudia over and hog-tied her arms behind her back at an painful angle, then went for her feet. He tied off the cord to the corner of the heavy bed so she wouldn't be able to go anywhere. Victoria recognized the sound of Vincent's effort, and managed to pull herself up to the edge of the bed, gun still in hand. She watched as Vincent, looking nearly ugly in his rage, did his work. He seemed ready to stop after she was tied, but as he stared down at the woman, a cruel twist came to his features. He pulled her upright and let her fall back, pinning her shoulders to the ground under his knees. He searched Claudia's jacket and found the blade she had used to slice up Victoria's feet before. \"Victoria,\" he called, \"you want to come see this?\" Victoria whimpered. She looked down at her feet. All she really wanted at the moment was to go into the bathroom and clean herself off, see how bad the damage really was. But the thought of crossing the distance between the bed and the bathroom at that moment was temporarily unbearable. Plus, she really, really, really didn't like the tone in Vincent's voice. \"See what?\" she rasped back. \"What you did to Claudia's face.\" Victoria flinched. \"How bad?\" \"She'll never win another beauty contest, that's for sure.\" Claudia made a strange gargling noise, and Victoria caught the words, \"Fuck you.\" \"Still tough, even though the shoe is on the other foot?\" Vincent said, the tone getting worse. \"You think you can just come in here and fuck with me and then walk away? What were you thinking?\" Victoria heard the sound of the blade being flicked out. \"Don't,\" she said, her voice too weak to carry. But Vincent heard it. \"Why not?\" \"Just...don't.\" Max, who had been half-hiding under the bed during the scuffle, slowly stuck his tiny nose out and sniffed at Victoria's knee. Lifting up his head, he looked at his mistress and gave a tiny, worried squeak. Then he trotted around to her feet, sniffed at the blood, and gave her toe a single lick with his pink tongue. Victoria reached out for him and he came to her. She cuddled him into her arms and lay back on the floor, all the life drained out of her. After a minute, she heard the blade flick back inside its sheath. Vincent stood up and came around the bed. Without a word to her, he reached down and picked her up, one arm under her knees, the other around her back, and took her into the bathroom. He gently set her down on the toilet, reached for a washcloth and began to run the water. From the look on his face, he was somewhere else. Somewhere deep inside that he didn't go too often. She didn't speak to him. If she'd had the energy, she wouldn't have asked what was going through his head. She merely sucked in her breath and Vincent wiped at the cuts, gently washing off the clotted blood, exposing the stripes for what they were. Max rested his head in the crook of Victoria's neck, his cool nose and soft breath the only comfort she needed at the moment. When Vincent was done, and the bleeding had seemed to stop, he wrapped her feet in a clean towel, got up and left the bathroom. When he returned, he bore some white wrapping gauze, a pair of socks, and a small white card. He handed her the card. It took her a second of staring at it before she took it. Fanning's name was in clear black letters across the top. Gently, Vincent removed the towel and began to wrap the gauze around her feet. Then he slid the socks on to keep the gauze in place. When he was done, he finally met her eyes. \"You want to call him, or should I?\" he asked softly. Without thinking, she reached out. Her hand went to the back of Vincent's head, her fingers threading through his thick, silver-gray hair. She pulled him closer, and her lips pressed gently to his forehead. Vincent closed his eyes and sighed under her caress. She turned her face so her cheek rested where her kiss had been placed, her arm going to rest across his shoulders, holding him close. \"I love you, Victoria,\" Vincent whispered. She drew a deep, shuddering breath. Her eyes were still burning from her earlier tears, and they watered again in sweet relief. \"I love you, too,\" she said, never meaning the words more than at that moment. \"He's not answering.\" Vincent had been standing at the window, not looking at Claudia, who had gone uneasily quiet. Of course, the fact that she was bleeding into a widening pool on the carpet from her cheek didn't help her speaking skills. He turned and looked to Victoria, who was sitting by the phone in the remaining chair in the room. \"Well, maybe he's away.\" She shook her head. \"Vincent, I should probably tell you. I know Ray Fanning, a little, from a long time ago. One thing I learned in a fast time is that he's never away from his cel phone. It keeps ringing and ringing and then it goes to voice mail.\" \"Did you leave a message?\" She gave him a look. Vincent looked down at Claudia. \"Where is he?\" he asked her, his voice restrained. Claudia didn't answer. \"Something happened to him,\" Victoria said, almost to herself, from across the room. \"When she came to see me before...\" She rubbed her forehead, trying to access her memories through the haze of the last hour of her life. \"She said he was waiting to bring us in. Which meant he had to be with her, somewhere. Probably listening in. If he's not answering, she probably did something to him.\" \"You sure we can trust him, after this?\" Vincent asked, giving Victoria a look only she could decipher. \"He would never have gone along with this,\" Victoria said with surety. \"She did something to him, I know it.\" Vincent turned back to Claudia, stepped closer. \"Claudia,\" he said. She didn't answer, but he knew she could hear him. \"Claudia, what did you do with Fanning?\" No answer. Vincent bent down. He was half out of sight of Victoria, but shot her an uneasy look. She understood, and looked away. He knelt down, pulling out the knife from before, flicking it open. Victoria's face tightened. Fanning was starting to get woozy. Lack of air in the trunk, that was it. It was a new car, no holes at all in the body, no rust, nothing. His eyes kept sliding shut, and his chest was getting tighter. He heard the sound of feet in the gravel, close by. His eyes popped open, and he listened. No telling who it was. But he had nothing to lose. Summoning the last of his strength, he lifted up his feet and began to pound. It wasn't very hard, but it was something. The footsteps got closer, then farther away. He heard a popping sound coming from in front of him, a crack of light, a gust of air. He lifted up his head but he's been cramped for so long and his arms and legs had nearly lost all their blood. Then a hand came around, pulling up the lid of the trunk, and bright sun blazed down into his face. \"Good morning,\" came a voice he had heard before, only once, asking him, \"Having a good night?\" He was amazed that he remembered it. He couldn't see the face. The sun was too bright, blinding him, as he had been in the dark of the trunk for so long. Damn pupils weren't adjusting fast enough. It was painful, he was forced to close his eyes just to begin to recover. He was being untied. His hands were nearly numb, and the man was shaking them, getting blood back into them again. Then his feet, only with less gusto. Finally, he was being pulled upright, head and shoulders above the rim. The hood was high enough, he didn't bump his skull. \"Come on, you've got to try to stand up,\" the man said, pulling his feet out and swinging them over the edge. \"Come on.\" Fanning pushed himself away from the trunk and onto his feet. He nearly fell, but the man caught him, walked him a few feet. Fanning began to hop and jump, kick his legs, and the needles came. They came so sharp and so fast it hurt and made his eyes water. He blinked, blinked constantly, shaking his arms, knowing how it must feel now to be a mummy awakened from a thousand year sleep. No wonder they were always so cranky. \"Victoria's upstairs,\" the man said, handing Fanning a keycard. \"Room 217. Bridal suite.\" Fanning was finally able to focus. He'd seen that face before, it run through his memory. \"Vincent,\" he whispered. Blue-green eyes met his, indifferent on the surface, hiding something much more. \"She's waiting,\" he said. \"Where are you going?\" Fanning asked as Vincent let him go and started to walk away. \"Sorry, can't tell.\" Vincent walked toward the driver's door, pulled it open. He gave Fanning a look over his shoulder, similar to the one he'd given Max three months ago, after having helped him tell off his asshole-dispatcher. \"Watch out for her, okay?\" Fanning was unarmed, so there was nothing he could do except watch as Vincent started up the car and left as quietly as he had come. Looking down at the keycard, Fanning murmured to himself, \"Bridal suite. 217. Go figure.\" And he headed into the hotel. When he got there, he slid the key into the door and it opened. Victoria was sitting on the foot of the bed, dressed casually, jeans and a T-shirt. They looked old, had the wrinkled look of being in a garment bag for too long. She looked up at him as if she'd expected him. \"Hello, Ray,\" she said. \"It's been a long time.\" Fanning nodded, walking to sit down beside her, then catching the acrid smell of blood. He stopped, went around her to the other side of the bed and saw Claudia, hog-tied and her face half-bloodied, some of her teeth showing through the tear in her cheek. \"Wow,\" he muttered. \"She's a real bitch,\" Victoria said without much passion. \"Sliced up my feet pretty good. You may have to go request a wheelchair for me.\" Fanning looked at her, blinking. His eyes were still sort of fucked from the heavy switches in light. Everything looked like it had a lime green outline. \"What are we going to do with her?\" Victoria shrugged. \"It's up to you, really. We could take her with us, back to the states, but I doubt it will do any good. If she's a government operative they'll deny even knowing her, or anything about any of this. She won't pay for what she did.\" \"What did she do?\" Fanning whispered. \"I guess nothing that leaves visible scars,\" Victoria sighed. There was such a sorrow in her face, every line cut as if it had been made by a chisel in marble. \"To the normal eye, anyway. My feet will heal. Her cheek will scar, I hope it makes her look fucking ugly. She hog-tied you - that has to be some kind of crime, since you're a cop.\" \"Not down here, I'm not.\" \"Well, then maybe we should call the Mexican authorities,\" Victoria suggested. \"I mean, it would certainly make her disappear for a while. But then when she got out we'd have no idea where she was, if she was coming after us for revenge again.\" Victoria shrugged. Fanning looked down at her lap when she shifted her hands. He realized she was holding a gun. \"Vincent wanted to kill her, but I wouldn't let him. I probably should have. Maybe I should just do it myself.\" \"No,\" Fanning said. \"We can always hope the stereotype about Mexican prisons is true. I'm sure she won't get out anytime soon.\" Victoria sighed, nodded. \"Not much else we can do, huh? If we just leave her, people will thing she's the victim.\" Fanning walked over to the phone. \"Let me take care of it,\" he said. And he did. It was amazing, how good of a liar he could be when he had to be. It made him uncomfortable, but it was necessary. Claudia had fucked him, big time. It would do him no good to come clean. \"What do we do, now?\" Fanning asked her, some time later, when the matter had been settled with the police and with the hotel, who had to clean up the mess. Victoria paid extra for the damages in spite of the fact that the hotel didn't want her to, blaming themselves that she had been accosted in such a way on her honeymoon. The fact that Fanning was now at her side instead of the silver-haired man was a fact they chose to ignore, for whatever reason. Victoria had a feeling that Vincent had paid them to not ask on his way out. \"Go back to the States,\" Victoria sighed, her fingers through the wide bars of Max's carrier, stroking the soft velvet of his ears. \"We can buy a car.\" \"With what?\" \"I have money.\" \"Vincent's money?\" Victoria looked around the lobby. There was a blessed circle of emptiness around them, everyone was leaving them utterly alone. \"In a way,\" she murmured. \"It's mine now. It's all I've got.\" \"You come back to the States, I have to arrest you,\" Fanning said. She gave him a tired look. \"You going to arrest a pregnant woman?\" He looked away, swearing under his breath in several languages. \"Besides, you don't always do what you have to,\" she reminded him. \"Yeah, you're right. Guess that would be a lousy way to repay your boyfriend for saving me from suffocation. Although if it wasn't for him I would never have been in that trunk in the first place.\" \"No, you were in that trunk because Claudia is a fucking psycho,\" Victoria said, her voice a total monotone. \"That, too,\" Fanning agreed. \"So, you go back to the States. What do you do then? Start up another practice?\" \"I've got my license back,\" she said. \"Took a little bit, but Vincent knew people.\" \"I'll bet he did.\" Although Fanning couldn't help but admire the ability to get things done. \"Where you going to go?\" \"Not to L.A., that's for sure,\" Victoria sighed. \"Maybe New Orleans. Or Chicago.\" \"World of difference.\" \"Probably New Orleans. I'm not a big fan of cold weather.\" \"Lots of corrupt cops in New Orleans.\" \"That'll make life a lot easier for me then,\" she said with a smirk that was more bitter than sweet. Fanning looked at her. \"I've missed you, you know,\" he said. \"Talking to you.\" She nodded, smiled at him. \"It was always good, the things we'd talk about, wasn't it?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, I've got your card. I'll give you a call when we set up. We can talk again.\" \"Sounds good.\" \"Are you mad at me, Ray?\" \"No, not really. Disappointed, but...no, I'm not mad.\" \"We can start talking on our ride back home,\" she said, standing up, offering him her hand. \"Come on, let's go buy a car.\" A/N: Sorry, still no time for responses. \"Once Upon A Time In Mexico\" is on and I haven't seen it yet. I'm gonna run---you REVIEW! :)[Chapter 11] Standard Disclaimer: A/N: Once Upon...In Mexico was kind of a bust. I'll try to catch it again. Stupid movie channels that decide to put a whole bunch of good stuff on at the same time. American Splendor came on and I wound up playing channel hockey and nothing got done. Anyway, recent obsessions include finding out that \"The Last Samurai\" was really good, and old black-and-white Vincent Price movies. I saw \"House On Haunted Hill,\" the new one? And Price starred in the old one. The new one creeped me out, but the old one is the only movie I've watched in ten years that actually made me scream. O/ Sacrifice There wasn't anything to be said for the drive home. They did talk. Conversations that extended for hours. Victoria confided in Ray to a certain extent. She was not overly graphic. She didn't try to defend herself or Vincent. She simply explained. Ray asked questions, she answered. Neither one had much of a speaking voice by the time they reached Los Angeles, where Fanning insisted that they had to go, at least to close up a few matters. The drive lasted a little more than a day. They did not stop. They took turns at the wheel, and occasionally one of them would take a short nap. Victoria found that she was not nearly as tired as she expected to be. Rest stops were necessary to allow Max to do his business. \"Are you going to bring me in?\" Victoria asked. \"Take my statement, all of that?\" By now, they were on the 5, headed North. It was a matter of hours, maybe only a few. \"We'll see. I'm not sure where everything is going to be standing. Claudia was assigned to bring Vincent back, but she was the one with all the information.\" \"Are you going to get in trouble for her not coming with you?\" \"I doubt it. My own boss doesn't know what I was doing. And if she's as deep as they acted, they may come ask me what happened, they may not. I'm not worried.\" \"You seem pretty confident.\" \"After the last twenty-four hours?\" He gave her a look. \"You think it's confidence? You seem as calm as a rock considering you could end up in jail by the end of this night.\" Victoria just shook her head. Max, who was asleep on her lap, stirred slightly, in the middle of a dog-dream. 8888888888 She hadn't seen her apartment in almost three months. Amazingly, they hadn't evicted her yet. There was a serious notice on her door about late rent, and it was clear that someone had come in, searching for money. Victoria went to see the landlord, who lived two floors below her, and paid him in cash for three months rent, plus the month in advance. He didn't ask any questions. Fanning didn't want to leave her alone. He asked if it was okay if he slept on her couch, considering the apartment had been empty for a good while and stank of must, and she would probably need some help getting it to a livable condition again. Victoria agreed, simply because she did not wish to be alone. That night, she sat on her bed for the first time in what felt like much more than just three months, and looked around. Her room had been her place of memories - where she kept little items she'd collected over the years, her photo albums, her books, everything that connected her to her past. She felt the life inside her womb. This was a stranger's room, now. The only thing she valued in all the world was inside her...well, except the dog. She could never part with Max. She slept. She had bad dreams. She dreamed she was back at their house in Mexico, and that Claudia was in the house and was trying to kill Vincent. They ran from room to room but she was always behind her, and they couldn't stop to rest. Then, in the twisted realm of dream logic, she was in the car again, the car she and Fanning had driven back in, but it was Vincent at the wheel with her, telling her about the future, about how they were going to be free, he was going to stop working, they were going to have a family and it was all over, the nightmare was over. She woke up with tear tracks on her cheeks. 8888888888 Fanning decided to get in touch with Richard, ask him what he thought he should do. Richard was a bit high strung at times, but he was a good cop, and sometimes a good friend. Hell, the man had stood at his beside while he recovered from cracked ribs and a blast to the head, which was healing up very nicely. Head wounds always bled a lot, and could be dangerous, but if they weren't, they seemed to heal up quickly for him. \"Why don't we get in touch with Pedrosa?\" Richard suggested. \"Maybe they could use Dr. Potter in their investigation. Considering all their other witnesses were shot to hell.\" \"I don't trust Pedrosa,\" Fanning muttered. \"Guy's narrow-minded. No...I was thinking of Annie Farrell. If she hasn't gone into protective custody with all the crap about Felix.\" \"That might be hard. Although I don't think she went for that option. She's got a bodyguard while this thing is on, but her case is pretty weak. You know, now that I think about it, what can they really do with her? I mean, sure, maybe she knows about Vincent's activities, but that's second hand information. The court might throw it out.\" \"It might be worth a try...if she's even willing.\" \"If she's not, arrest her. What choice does she have?\" Fanning was silent for a long pause. Then he said, \"You know, you're a real dick sometimes.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" To his surprise, Richard almost sounded contrite. \"Well, either contact you need, I'll get both numbers for you. Get a few hours more sleep, you sound like you need it.\" Fanning looked out the dirty window of the apartment. The sun was starting to rise. He felt tired, but couldn't imagine sleeping. \"Yeah...call me back asap, okay?\" \"Okay.\" The other man hung up. Fanning closed his eyes, rubbing them. His hair was a disheveled mess, he realized as his hands went through it. It was usually nicely combed back, slick and smooth. Maybe it was time to change his look. He was aware, as he was just beginning to doze off from sheer exhaustion, that Victoria was moving around in her room. As he opened his eyes more widely, she entered, a throw blanket wrapped around her shoulders. \"You know,\" she said, leaning against the door jamb, \"I was looking through my stuff, thinking about what I want to take with me...and I don't want to take anything.\" \"You sure that's a good idea?\" Fanning asked. \"Maybe some pictures, or something. Of your parents? Of Allen?\" She blanched. \"You know Allen is dead, don't you?\" Fanning let out a low, hissing breath. \"No, I didn't,\" he said. \"How?\" \"Claudia.\" She said the word in a low voice, like a curse. \"You sure?\" \"Very.\" \"Damn.\" He rubbed his hair again. \"Look, is your shower working?\" \"Dunno, haven't tried it.\" \"Mind if I do? I'm filthy.\" \"Sure, be my guest.\" The pipes took a few minutes, but eventually he had hot water flowing from the showerhead. The curtain was slightly moldy, but useable. The towels and washcloth in the linen cabinet were starchy from being folded for too long, but they worked well enough. Her soap was dried up, but after some serious rubbing, he got some lather. All in all, it was a decent shower. When he came out, towel wrapped around his waist, she was sitting on the couch, just staring around the room. Max was nosing through various objects, exploring this new territory with interest. \"You been sitting there the whole time?\" \"There was a call on your cel phone,\" she said. \"I've been waiting for you to come out to find out who it was.\" He walked over to his phone, which he had dropped on the table with the car keys, and picked it up. The number was unknown but there was a message. When he heard it, he nearly dropped the phone. \"Victoria, I'm afraid your shower is going to have to wait,\" he said. \"We have to go, right now.\" 8888888888 \"Max, are you okay?\" Max looked up. For the last two months, Annie Farrell had been his best friend. Sure, before that night, when he'd first met her, he'd immediately seen her as something more. But there were obviously more important things in the world that making a move on a beautiful, smart woman. He could wait. He needed to wait. Annie stood in his apartment. She looked the same, striped suit, not too flashy, a nice muted shade of slate gray. It suited her. Pale pink shirt underneath, soft and feminine. She even wore the charm he'd bought for her a few weeks back, a little golden car that reminded him of a taxi cab, and she'd thought it was funny. But she was out of place here, dressed like that. Dressed for work. \"I came to tell you in person because I knew this would mess you up pretty good,\" she admitted. \"Come on, Max, you with me?\" \"Yeah,\" he said slowly, nodding his head. He shook himself inside. \"Yeah,\" he said again. \"I'm ready to go.\" \"You sure? You don't need a moment to sit down?\" \"I don't need to sit down,\" he said dryly. \"I sit all day. These guys -\"he gestured to the other men in the room, silent, like shadows, invisible and yet painfully present, \"they don't let me do a damn thing.\" Annie nodded, turning to a few of the shadows. \"Come on, we need to go now.\" He waited patiently, following her and the shadow men down to the waiting car. There had been no obvious attempts on his life, but he knew that he was in serious, big-time trouble for having to take the place of the men Vincent had killed. He'd met Felix, talked to him. It was only a matter of chance that he hadn't been shot at yet. Either that, or he was being protected better than he thought. Maybe there was something to all those movies that showed witnesses surviving after all. Truth be told, he didn't want to do this. He had nightmares on a regular basis. He quit his job, knowing he would never be able to give another man a ride in a taxi again. He gave up his Island Limo dream, at least starting it himself, knowing his chauffeur days were over. But, as Max had learned on that fateful night, shit happens. You have to roll with it. He would do what needed to be done. And now, he needed to confront Vincent. Not really confront, he thought to himself as the car took him to the police station, where the line-up would happen. He was going to identify. He was going to look through a two-way mirror and identify Vincent from a line-up of men. Annie was a rock. She slipped her hand into his as they got into the elevator, squeezing his hand. She had strong hands. Dry hands. She was calm, always calm. She'd even been relatively calm when Vincent had been standing over her, aiming at her chest with a security guard's gun. Sure, she'd looked away, unable to see the final shot coming. But she was never hysterical. Except when she cried before a trial. But he hadn't seen that yet. \"Thank you for coming, Max,\" said a man he recognized, a large man with a tuft of gray hair on his chin and white-gray hair on his head. A woman, slender and Latino, stood beside him, face like an iron mask. \"We know this hasn't been an easy time for you-\" \"Come on, let's just do this,\" Max said. His voice was low. His voice was always low, now. He didn't even raise it to his mother. He never told his mother what happened, knowing she would freak the holy hell out to learn that she'd been visited by a contract killer one night, with her son as his hostage. He'd never hear the end, and he didn't even want the beginning. The man, Pedrosa, and his partner, Zee, just nodded, and stepped aside. Max went into the room. Annie temporarily let go of his hand, having to stay outside the room herself for just a moment. When Max was done, she would be able to go inside and identify Vincent herself. Max went into the darkened room. Pedrosa followed, calling into a microphone for the men to enter the room. A door opened and there was a slight procession. He recognized him immediately. The man looked utterly out of place in a shirt that looked like it belonged on a tourist in Hawaii and a pair of shorts. But the hair was the same shade of gunmetal gray, the scruff still in place, the eyes still the same. Max felt his skin crawl as Vincent turned and looked at the mirror - looked right through it, into him. \"Number 4,\" he said. \"Number 4 is Vincent.\" \"Thank you, Max,\" Zee said, \"but we need to be sure, with a voice identification.\" Pedrosa pressed the intercom. \"Number 4, step forward and read the card.\" Vincent stepped forward. He had a car in his hand. \"Guy gets on the MTA, dies. You think anybody will notice?\" Max wanted to throw up. \"Yeah, that's him,\" he said, his voice strained. \"It's him.\" He turned and walked out of the room, to hell with anything else. Annie waited for him, her look compassionate. She handed him a cup of coffee which he took before letting her go past him into the room. She took a few more minutes, but when she came out, she muttered to him, \"Number 4, right?\" \"Yeah,\" Max said, his throat feeling better under the hot liquid. Then, he saw a ghost. Detective Fanning entered the room, a woman behind him. She was wearing and old T-shirt and jeans, her hair was black-brown and limp from a lack of washing. She was also mildly pregnant - his sister had had the same glow about her a few months after her wedding. It was unmistakable. Then Max blinked. Fanning? Here? Ray Fanning approached him with a big smile. He reached out to shake Max's limp hand, paralyzed with shock. \"Hey, Max, how are you?\" \"Me?\" Max stuttered. \"You look really good for a guy shot in the chest and head!\" \"Eh, Kevlar,\" Ray said nonchalantly. He looked past Max into the dark room. \"Pedrosa in there?\" \"Yeah,\" Annie said. From the expression on her face, she didn't seem to think much of Pedrosa. \"You need to send in your witness.\" Fanning turned to the brunette, walked her to the door. She seemed reluctant to go. Her face was puffy, heavily lined, tired. \"Do I have to?\" he heard her mutter to the cop. \"Yeah, you do.\" \"But I don't want to.\" Very simple and matter of fact, not petulant, like a child. Max found himself wondering who she was, what connection she had to all of this. She certainly didn't look familiar to him. \"I'm sorry, Victoria, but it's necessary.\" Although Fanning seemed to be putting up a solid front. He gave her a mild shove. \"Come on, in and out and it'll be over.\" The woman, Victoria, drew a breath and walked into the room. Fanning turned back to him. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"I would have called you, I'm sure none of these assholes bothered to tell you that I was alive.\" \"No,\" Max said, glancing into the dark room. He heard the faint echo of a sob. \"I'm sorry, but who is she?\" \"That? That's Dr. Victoria Potter. Vincent's hostage of the last three months.\" There was an edge to his voice that went with the front. Not the truth. Annie's face turned into stone. \"According to his story, anyway,\" she muttered. \"Hostage?\" Max echoed. \"For three months?\" No one said anything. Victoria came out of the room, her cheeks flaming, eyes brimming. She walked over to where they stood, gave them all a horrible look as if she blamed every bad thing in the world on them, and then turned right to Max. \"You know why he didn't shoot you?\" she said, her voice low. Max blinked. \"I'm sorry?\" \"Why Vincent didn't shoot you,\" she said, her voice patient where her expression was not. \"He didn't kill you that night, he could have, he should have.\" \"He ran out of bullets,\" Max said, numb. \"He let you go because he liked you.\" She said it very plainly, just like she had said that she didn't want to go into that dark room. She glanced at Annie. \"And you were in love with her. He saw something that mattered.\" She looked back at Max. \"If he had killed you, none of this would be happening. So I hope you appreciate the sacrifice.\" Max swallowed, no words able to get past the confused lump in his throat. Who in the hell was this woman? But she didn't give him time. She turned, glared at Fanning, and then left, charging across the wide office into the waiting room through the glass window, and planting herself in a seat, not giving them a single glance more. 8888888888 \"Max, why are you doing this?\" Annie asked him as they stood outside the closed door. \"Because,\" was all Max could reply. It didn't make sense to him, either, but in the hour he'd gone back and tried to calm down, he found that he couldn't. One single thought pressed in his mind. He had to talk to Vincent. The why was unclear. It was only because. Because he had questions. Because he wanted closure. Because, because, because, because, because ....stupid Wizard of Oz song. Fanning was there. He hadn't left the situation since Victoria had gone, partly because she was in selective custody at the moment, and partly because he wanted to make sure this situation settled correctly. The door opened and a man came out. Tall, widely built, the sort of lawyer that reminded others of Perry Mason, in his youth. Pedrosa came out after him, reminding others of Perry Mason when he was not in his youth, only a bit more slender. \"Ms. Farrell,\" the Attorney General said, giving her a respectful nod of his head, \"if your client wishes to speak to him, I'll permit it. Only because of this situation, and only because it's you. Although I have to admit, it's pretty foolish.\" Annie did not agree with him, but there was no denial in her expression. \"Thank you Mr. Lambert. I do assure you that my client has his reasons.\" Lambert shot Max a glance, then a small shrug. \"Go for it, then,\" he said, and strode away. \"Annie, I need you in my office first thing tomorrow.\" \"Yes, sir,\" she said, but she was already half-way through the door. It was creepy, Max decided as he entered the small room. The last time he'd seen Vincent, it had also been in a white-washed place, but it had been much closer and less confined at the same time. Vincent sat at the head of the small table, his hands handcuffed together, his eyes clear and meeting his as Max entered. \"Hey Max,\" he said, the same tone he'd always used, except now Max recognized it as being very clear, very calm. Before he'd been wheezing through a bullet hole against his lung. He seemed perfectly whole, except for the piece of his ear that was missing. \"Vincent,\" Max said, sitting down. Vincent's eyes went to Annie. \"Ms. Prosecutor.\" Annie did not answer. She simply gave him her total bitch look. \"I saw your lady friend,\" Max said, his voice low. \"They say she was your hostage. Is that true?\" Vincent raised his eyebrows. \"Why, Max, you sound like you actually give a shit about what I've been up to since you left me for dead. Not that I really care about that, it was just business, and I don't blame you.\" \"Her name is Victoria,\" Max went on, as if trying to trigger his memory. \"I know what her name is.\" The calm was gone, replaced by a distinct edge. Vincent looked away, toward the two-way mirror. \"She still here?\" Max shook his head. \"No, they took her away. Somewhere you won't find her.\" Vincent smirked. \"Good. She deserves it.\" Max scowled. \"She said something to me before she left. She said you let me go. Did you let me go?\" Vincent shrugged. \"Maybe. I had a bullet in my chest at the time. I didn't really have the energy to keep arguing with you, so I let you win. You complaining?\" Max shook his head. \"I just don't know why. Like I don't know why you didn't kill me after I crashed the car. Or why you didn't kill me a dozen times earlier that night. And don't give me that bullshit about me being good.\" Vincent just looked at him from across that table. \"Max, are you still driving a cab?\" \"I'm not doing anything right now because of all this shit you got me into.\" \"After, then,\" Vincent continued, nonplussed. \"You going to go back to it?\" \"No.\" \"Going into your limo company, then?\" \"No, ain't doing that either.\" Vincent glanced up at Annie. \"Well, I guess that's two things you have to thank me for. Two out of three isn't bad.\" He sighed, leaned back in the chair. His hands fell onto his lap. \"Why I let you go,\" he murmured, as if to himself. \"I don't know. I just did.\" \"Your friend Victoria seems to think it was for a more noble reason,\" Max said. Vincent gave that nervous half-shrug. \"Does it matter? You're alive, you're free-\" \"I'm no more free than you,\" Max spat. Annie, who had been quietly leaning against the wall, gave a slight start. my life.\" Slowly, Vincent smiled. \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Max,\" he said, \"my life's been ruined, too.\" \"Victoria wasn't your hostage, was she?\" Max asked after a long pause. \"I mean...why the hell are you here? You never had to come here. Why did you turn yourself in? Was it because of her?\" Vincent seemed mildly flustered, but he was holding it together. \"What do you want, Max, revenge? Pick me apart again like you did before? Call me institutionalized, ask me if anybody is home? I used to think there wasn't, and that was fine with me. But thanks a fucking lot, now there is.\" Max nodded, slowly, cast a glance at Annie. \"I don't know why I even fucking care,\" he muttered. \"That woman wasn't your hostage. She was something else.\" \"You can imagine a guy like me having something else with a woman like that?\" Vincent said, but he was looking away, toward the mirror. \"Go ahead, lie,\" Max muttered. \"I'd expect it from someone as low as you.\" Vincent's eyes darted back to him, sharp and diamond bright. Then he blinked and the deadly rage was gone. He turned paler ones to Annie. \"Ms. Farrell?\" \"Yes?\" Annie said, not moving from where she stood. \"You know as well as I do that whatever Victoria says, her testimony in the trial against Felix is worthless, right?\" An uncomfortable pause. \"Not completely, Vincent, but if we have you, we don't need to worry about that.\" Vincent nodded. \"I guess not. But are you going to hang her out to dry?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, she needs to be placed in Witness Protection,\" Vincent said. \"Just to be safe.\" Annie seemed surprised. She and Max exchanged looks, but Max appeared to see through the entire situation. \"I'll testify only if you give your word she'll be placed in Witness Protection,\" Vincent said. \"If you don't testify,\" Annie countered, \"you'll die of a lethal injection after I get done hanging you out to dry.\" \"True enough. But then you'll have to rely on her testimony and put her into witness protection anyway. So I figured you could save the taxpayers a few dollars and get a better witness in the deal. What do you think?\" Annie pushed away from the wall. \"I'll talk to the Attorney General about it.\" \"When will I know?\" \"Within twenty-four hours. Max, anything else?\" she said, turning to him. \"No,\" Max said, standing up. \"I think I've got all my questions answered.\" Vincent raised his hand and wiggled his fingers. \"Enjoy your life, Max. And don't fuck it up this time.\" Don't worry...there are still a few more chapters coming. :) Just a few quick notes: SweetArwen: You know what really sucks? They killed off Salma Hayek's character, didn't they? That so totally turned me off so quick. But anyway, this isn't a thing about Once Upon A Time, it's about Solace. ANyway, yes, those three little words. Like how I did that? I knew he had to say it, once, and it had to really mean something big. BIG. So as for where he went...now you know. Please don't kill me. :) PAR: You should know better than to do that! SIGH What am I going to do with you? Byrony Cel: You know you reviewed chapter 10 twice? Or was that you? Is someone masquerading as you? Or were you trying to get me off my butt and get chapter 11 loaded? Because with 5 reviews I decided to do it tonight instead of waiting until tomorrow and a few more reviews. Maybe. :) LunaGrrBack023: You know, I don't know about the N'Orleans thing. I mean, the cops there are really corrupt, and Chicago is no good because of the mob. Plus I really only like to write about places where I've been, so I can see first-hand what they feel like. I like writing about the feel of cities. Chicago is my favorite place but I just can't have Victoria going there. So we'll see what I decided in the next chapter. Sorry 'bout that. :) Okay, see you guys in 48 (hours)![Chapter 12] Standard Disclaimer Freedom They had put her up in some hotel, not a complete shithole, but certainly nothing of real comfort. Not that Victoria really cared. She was too damn depressed to care, and made even moreso by the fact that she couldn't be alone. Unless she locked herself in the bathroom, and that idea was not appealing. There were three men there, each one in a suit, all seeming to mind their business. One close to the window, one close to the door, the third a floater, manning the phone, mostly, which, if it ever rang, was always for one of them. They were as good as invisible, for all the comfort their presence afforded. In the small room, it was a tight fit. She stuck to the bed, but that just didn't seem...proper. Finally, as soon as the sun had set, she told them all she was going to bed, and turned off as many lights in the room as she could reach. A few moments later, they were turned on again for various reasons - magazines, cel-phones, whatever. There was a knock at the door. Something to do with the last phone call, she was sure, as the reply had been, \"Sure, go ahead.\" The floater answered it with the door-man at an angle of his shoulder, just in case. The woman from the station came in. Small in stature, slender, long straight black hair, medium-tone African American. Victoria sat up in the bed, showing her impatience. \"I'm sorry, did I wake you?\" the woman asked as she crossed to the foot of the bed. \"No, it's only nine, who's asleep now?\" Victoria shot a glare around the room. \"I just didn't have anything else to do.\" The woman gave her a half-grin. \"Don't worry, you'll be out of here, soon. Vincent is going to testify. We don't need to hold you.\" Victoria looked up at her. \"I'm sorry, who are you again?\" \"Annie Farrell. I'm working the Felix case, district prosecutor.\" Annie would have extended a hand if a bed hadn't been between them. She glanced around. \"Can we talk over here?\" She jerked her head toward the two chairs and the table between them. Shooting a good glare at the floater who had just taken a seat, she got him to move, and motioned for Victoria to take the other. Throwing back the comforter and sliding out, having to use sweatpants for pajamas, as it was the only thing the tiny little store downstairs had, Victoria joined her, albeit reluctantly. \"Victoria Potter...you used to be a doctor, once upon a time.\" Not a good way to start the conversation. Instantly the hackles on the back of Victoria's neck rose. \"Yeah, what about it?\" \"I know how you lost your license. What happened was a travesty, and I'm going to do what I can to correct it.\" Victoria gave her a distinctive look. \"And why would you do that for me?\" Annie gave a half-shrug. \"I hate to see a good doctor go to waste. My sense of justice. Take your pick.\" \"Well, considering-\"And then she stopped. What was she going to say? \"Considering the father of my baby tried to murder you, I wouldn't be offended if you didn't try to help me.\" No, that was a mistake. So far she'd managed to hide her pregnancy and didn't want to take the chance of it backfiring in her face. And she sure as hell couldn't use the word \"boyfriend\" when it came to Vincent. He was certainly not that. \"Considering?\" Annie asked, waiting. \"Nothing. I just think you have the wrong idea about Vincent and me. He told me I was his hostage...I wasn't.\" \"I know.\" Victoria blinked. \"That obvious?\" \"He wants you put into Witness Protection as part of his deal for testifying against Felix,\" Annie said. \"He's concerned about your safety. Kidnappers don't do that.\" Victoria considered these words for a long moment, letting herself soak them up. When it came to Vincent, her memory pretty much ended in the bathroom, when he'd told her he loved her. It was like he'd died after that moment...there simply wasn't anywhere else to go that could ever be as good, as important, as special. \"Why do I need Witness Protection?\" she asked, finally. \"Well, Felix is very well connected. I mean, he managed to get information on all the other witnesses before we went to trial, and no doubt he'll do it again. But you, on the other hand, are a pressure point - if Felix wants to get to Vincent, he might try using you.\" \"Wonderful,\" Victoria muttered. Annie smirked. Obviously she wasn't saying what she was thinking. \"So we want you to disappear. We'll take care of everything. Until your medical license comes back, how about Medical Technology? They pull down a decent salary.\" \"Where?\" Victoria asked. \"I mean, do I get a choice?\" \"Not really. We can put you in Indianapolis, Indiana. There's a big hospital there, St. Vincent's,\" Annie struggled not to smile at the irony, \"and we can get you in without a problem. The rest is up to you.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Victoria said, leaning forward. \"That's it? I just...vanish? I don't have to do anything? I don't get it...what's the catch?\" \"Vincent's paying the catch,\" Annie said, an edge to her voice. \"He's lucky he's only doing that.\" Victoria shook her head. She wanted to ask why, but she knew why. Vincent loved her. He'd told her he loved her. He was doing this to protect her. He was sacrificing himself for her freedom. The thought squeezed her throat so hard her eyes watered. She put a trembling hand up to her mouth, pressing her lips against the back. \"You okay, Victoria?\" Annie asked in a soft voice. \"Why do you care?\" Victoria whispered. Annie gave a very gentle shrug. \"I don't know. I guess you and I have something in common. We both stumbled into very unconventional relationships and we're just trying to survive through them. Or in them.\" She looked away, uncomfortable. Victoria felt like she was going to explode. The kind of eruption that comes from battery acid eating through its case. She grasped the chest of her shirt, as if somehow that might make the terrible, horrible ache that suddenly gripped her less painful. She wished, so much, that Vincent was there...just for a moment. She wished she could speak to him once more. But no...that would undo everything. He hadn't told her what he was planning because he knew she'd never go for it. He knew she was going to leave him, so he let her, and then did the rest on his own. She hadn't known he had it in him. It just didn't seem like the kind of thing Vincent would do. The depth of the nobility, the selflessness...she gasped a dry, heaving sob, her lungs rattling painfully. She'd wanted to be angry at him for letting her leave him. She'd wanted, somewhere inside, for him to fight for her, for him to give in about the baby, to do anything she wanted as long as she didn't leave him. But no, Vincent loved her even more than that. \"Victoria?\" Annie whispered. Pressing her fingers against the corners of her eyes, she looked to Annie. \"When...when do I leave?\" 8888888888 Vincent sat in his cell, legs propped up, back resting against the uncomfortable, straight stone walls. At least, they felt like stone. Probably concrete, the way people could carve into them so easily. He'd already amused himself, reading all the sayings, and then making up little stories for them in his head. It wasn't a free ride that he was getting. The Attorney General was not happy about giving a man who had murdered seven people, possibly more, in cold blood, a free walk. Especially a man who seemed to be quite able to do it again. Vincent really didn't intend that. If he lived past this whole thing - which he didn't really expect, as there were many very adept contract killers out there who could probably get to him, even as guarded as he was - he wasn't going to go back to killing. The most obvious reason being, his reputation was completely ruined. He'd have to change his face and his name if he ever wanted to work again, and then he'd have to start at the bottom, as he would lose any credibility he'd had previously. That didn't appeal to him. Plus, he'd just lost his taste for it. Maybe it had something to do with Victoria being pregnant. He tried to tell himself that was a ridiculous thought. Many times he succeeded, but it always crept back to him, in an unguarded moment, few as they were. It beat the other thoughts that paraded through his head. It beat the incessant voice asking him, again and again, how in the hell he'd ever allowed this to go this far. The night he'd met Victoria, he didn't understand how he could be so impressed by someone he'd met once. People didn't stay with him long, but she lingered. He found himself looking forward to meeting her again. That night on the train when he'd been shot by Max, the renegade cabbie, his only thought had been, Now I get to go see Victoria. How incredibly stupid. It started out so simple. He needed fixing. The bullet was gone, he was healing, he could have done the rest on his own. But no, stupid him, he'd stuck around, enjoying her company, relishing his excuse to be in her presence. He should have left. He should have walked out the next morning, gotten a new flight and disappeared back into the cracks from whence he came. It was dark and lonely there, but safe. He knew it, he understood it. He could navigate that life with his eyes closed. It was everything to him. Stupid, stupid bullet hole. Sometimes he still scratched at the scar. It ticked vaguely, mostly when he thought about Victoria. As if she'd put the wound there, making herself a permanent part of him. If he'd left when he should have, they would have killed her, those men who were looking for Marcus Shakespeare. Or Claudia would have caught up with her and killed her, or maybe not, maybe she would have been safe, been paid a lot of money by Shakespeare to disappear, keep his secrets. No, those men definitely would have killed her, he decided. And the thought of her being dead...it was too painful to even entertain for more than a second. He pushed it away. Victoria was smart. Smart enough to know, at first, not to get involved with him. But then her ex-husband had gotten killed and she fell apart, and he couldn't bear to see her suffer like that. So he'd comforted her. That was probably the big mistake. It had all fallen apart from there. He tried to tell himself, for the longest time, that he'd simply taken advantage of a situation, that he'd let his own weakness and hers get the best of them. Then he tried to convince himself that she was using him. But no one ever used him, not even her. Then, when it was all over, and he was going to leave, to finally leave and get on with his life, satisfied that she was going to be safe and everything could return to normal, he'd open his big mouth, which he never, ever, as a rule, did, and told her the truth. One big mistake could be compensated for. Two was the point of no return. He put the walls up high at first, thinking she would get the message, that she would come to her senses and realize she was so in the wrong place, with the wrong man. He didn't give a single inch for her, but amazingly enough, she bent. She accepted. She rolled. And slowly, like an iceberg, he'd begun to move. So subconsciously that sometimes even he didn't see it. Only at night, when he was lying awake, as he always did, with her sleeping warm and soft beside him, did he see how she was changing him. Three mistakes was a Greek tragedy. Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Rwanda. His world was exploding around him and he couldn't do a damn thing to stop it. She was pregnant. Vincent tried to break off his thoughts, temporarily allowing himself to be distracted by the television that the guard was watching. Some old Vincent Price movie...he watched for a few minutes, seeing if he could identify it. The bright color of red was sort of a giveaway, it was an Edgar Allen Poe flick. Price was always so fond of Poe. This one was The Mask of the Red Death . Price's prince was in the middle of attempting to educate a young woman in the ways of the world - they'd never outwardly say the word \"sex\" in these movies, but they dripped of it, the perversion like a smell in the air. He remembered this one. The girl would break down, slowly, little by little, eaten up by despair, by the corruption around her, and give in, only to have Price, at the very last minute, send her away, to go meet with her good and noble peasant boyfriend and run away from the town, which was completely inflected with a plague that was killing everyone. He would be on the verge of consuming her innocence, and then let go, finding some spark of goodness in himself that knew love, that knew how to sacrifice. Vincent looked away. He didn't know what made people like their names. He knew he was a Vincent, but Price was also very much a Vincent, and he had never been able to see anything alike between them before. Unless, of course, he was that prince, who at the last moment had let the innocent maiden run from his evil. He had to smile. Victoria was many things, but innocent wasn't one of them. Not anymore. He'd been too late with her, she'd already been tainted by the cruelties of the world. Yet she still managed to keep her nobility. She wanted that baby. He could see it in her eyes, how happy she was, way deep down, that she was going to give birth, she was going to be a mother, and that it was of his child. He couldn't take that away from her. So he let her go, knowing it was the only way out. Dammit, he was that evil prince. Well, at this moment. He'd drift off for about an hour, wake up refreshed, and get on some other line of thought. He'd always be so fond of mocking people who played it so safe, doing everything the same, ten years, twenty, thirty, then life is over. He had always been fond of realizing that he never knew where he'd be in even ten minutes from that moment. And maybe it was because for him, of all God's creatures, it was actually true. At least he could live with knowing that he practiced what he preached. There was something redeeming, almost comforting, in that. 8888888888 It would take a lot more than time to fix things. Within a week, Victoria was handed a whole new life. She was given a new name - Sarah Lancing. She didn't care too much for it. She didn't think she looked like a Sarah. But it was all right, as she wasn't planning on responding much to the name, anyway. Within a month, she was in Indianapolis, getting ready to start her new job. Medical Technologist. The person who handles all the testing, takes the blood, carries the cups of urine. It wasn't a glamorous job, but it was something. She missed the idea of working with patients, she missed being able to talk to the people whose lives passed through her hands, but it was enough. She wasn't feeling particularly social. She found a doctor within six weeks of her agreement with Annie. The baby was a good three and a half months along - fourteen weeks, to be exact. She had twenty-six to go. And a boy. A boy. She wondered what she would name him. There just weren't enough good boy names in the world. Sure, there were the standard, romantic ones - Michael, Nicholas, Gabriel...She considered Louis, briefly, but didn't like how Louis Lancing sounded. It did flutter through her mind to name the baby Vincent. But she couldn't. Something wouldn't allow it. Finally, the name that stuck with her was Charles. Charles Lancing. She'd call him Charlie, maybe his friends would call him Chuck. It personally didn't appeal to her, that last nick name, but boys were funny. And Charles Lancing did have such a nice ring. A sophisticated name for a boy to grow into and be a man. But not like his father. There was a terrible mixture of anticipation and dread as she moved through her pregnancy. Being alone caused difficulties to arise. What would she do after maternity leave? The thought of a daycare raising her child appalled her. She didn't want to part from the only thing in her life that she loved. Then came the good moments - the baby's first kick, the weird cravings, the gallons of milk and apple juice that filled the fridge, picking out baby clothes... Money would never be a problem, though - she never told anyone about the money Vincent had left her. She kept it hidden, sifting it through her monthly pay to take care of any loose ends. It would be a while, but soon, she would get at least half of it into some kind of trust fund for Charles, so that when he grew up, he could go to any college he wanted, start a good life, want for nothing. The other half she would use to raise him, keep him happy, healthy, and most of all, wise. There were nights she couldn't sleep, she missed Vincent so badly. It was amazing to think that someone who had passed through her life in only a matter of months had made such a dent that his absence was like a wound. To comfort herself, she would sometimes bring her CD player to bed and play the only Miles Davis CD she could find. Sometimes she'd put the headphones on herself. Sometimes she would put them on her belly for the baby. Charles would kick lightly, stimulated by the sounds. It helped sometimes. Sometimes, though, it only made her hurt worse, and she had to push it all away, and lie on her side, her arms wrapped around her swelling belly, concentrating on the only good thing in the world - her son. Watching the news and reading the newspapers only made her depression worse. His testimony was headlines for weeks on end. Sixty minutes did a huge piece on him. Barbara Walters wanted to interview him. It churned her stomach...they just didn't know. He was a dead man walking. Every time she saw his face, it was painful. He was growing thinner, not eating right. He tried to hide it, set his face in stone, but she could tell that he was miserable and bored. She could only imagine where he was staying - he was far too dangerous to go to a regular safe house, they had to keep him locked up, most likely in a wide, comfortable cage, but a cage nonetheless. She found herself wondering if they were letting him listen to his jazz. He'd had such a collection - she doubted anyone could run out and buy half of those CD's. The doctor chastised her on a continuous basis - make sure she slept enough, ate enough. Don't let yourself wallow, get out and walk around. She did all these things, but felt like a robot obeying a program. She didn't gain a lot of weight. The doctor told her to eat more, gave her a special diet. She never, in her whole life, would have thought she'd be chastised for being too thin. She had casual friends through the hospital, caring people who wanted to make sure she had enough support, being a single mom. She told everyone she was a widow. Her husband had died only a few weeks before she'd come to Indianapolis. She was grieving and gestating a new life - not an easy combination. It won her a lot of sympathy that more than made up for the lack of real friendship ties. The doctor chastised her again, warning her that grieving and being pregnant were not a winning combination - she would have to choose. She always chose Charles, above everything. In the end, she quit her job at the hospital, claiming she'd been saving most of her salary. She opened the trust fund for Charles, kept the rest of the money in a safe in her apartment and lived quietly. She had plenty to keep herself afloat for the next few years. And Annie Farrell seemed to be as good as her word. Within three months of her moving to Indianapolis, her medical license was reissued to her under the name of Sarah Lancing. She never told anyone at the hospital, not even after Charles was born. He came, safe and whole, all ten fingers and toes, a thick full head of black hair, green eyes, her nose and mouth. Charles was her life now. Everything else was secondary. He was a quiet baby, mostly. He didn't know how to sleep. She couldn't help but wonder if that was genetic. He would get tired and fuss and cry, but didn't know how to go to sleep. She had to rock him, continuously, until he just...passed...out. One time she had him perched on her thigh, which continuously moved up and down, the classic \"shakey-leg syndrome.\" He suddenly slumped forward, unconscious. He was simply asleep. She wondered if he would ever sleep on his own. Being a single mother wasn't easy, but for the first time since being with Vincent, she was happy. And there wasn't any guilt mingled with her joy over Charles. She was a mother. It was her right to take joy in her son. Especially when it was the only joy to be had. 8888888888 A/N: No, this isn't the end of the story. But I've got a dilemma. I'm not sure if I have enough story to do a trilogy, but there is a big time gap that starts right here. So I was thinking of doing a third story, but as I said, I don't have enough plot. Unless I really want to torture everyone by keeping Vincent and Victoria apart for a very long time. I had an idea, but it was really, really angsty, and I don't know if all of you could take that, or if I could even handle writing it. So give me a few days, keep reviewing, and I'll see what I come up with. Share any opinions you might have in the meantime. :) LunaGrrrBack023: To answer your question, Claudia is currently rotting in a Mexican prison with half her face blown off. As to what's next for her? I really don't know, it just seems too cliche for her come back a third time. But who knows? Heh heh heh... firegoddess164: Oh, yes, you are a romantic. :) But that's okay. And I hope you're satisfied with the name and gender of the baby. Warm Mittens and SweetTreats: You know, I really wondered what the hell had happened to you two! But knowing you're together makes me shudder. THe crazy factor has got to be overwhelming. LOL. Now, you think you can just come back and give me one big long review and it's all better? There are ten other chapters to review, kiddies. Get to work! LOL. As to whether the story will be a happy ending? Well, you'll just have to breathe, make SweetTreats take her medication, and wait and see. And as for what Vincent did to Claudia? It was too graphic for me to describe. But he got her to talk and tell them where Ray was. Don't ask how. SweetArwen: Hope that song finally left your head! I hate that song but it totally fit. And I hate it when songs get stuck in your head. Don't worry, no lethal injection for Vincent, but as for what the future holds...I'm still trying to figure it out. Hopefully I'll post again this weekend. Until then, take care![Chapter 13] Standard Disclaimer A/N: So instead of starting a new story completely, I'm just going to pick the plot back up. It won't be terribly long, maybe three or four chapters, give or take. You'll probably really like this chapter--we get nearly all Vincent's POV. Time Vincent didn't hate hospitals. Everyone else did, but he didn't. He found the cold, white sterile surroundings to have a detached comfort to them. The booths that littered the halls, filled with flowers and gifts, bright spots of color. He knew a lot about hospitals, their routines, their ins and outs. They were generally alike, especially in their procedures. All medical places had a standard they had to live up to. All he ever had to do was foot-mark the place and he had it made. Hospitals were not as easy to infiltrate as all of that, however. On more than one occasion, when he'd had to step in and finish a mistake another contractor had made, he'd nearly been caught. He found that having information on the nurses' rounds was very helpful to avoid that situation. Plus there was the fact that each and every room was about the size of a large closet, and if there was even so much as a single guard posted at the door, entry was nearly impossible. Distractions had become a necessary art. He was glad when he was able to go into business for himself, and he didn't have to take the stupid hospital jobs anymore. But that wasn't why he was here. It was a busy night in this place. There had been an overturned bus about six blocks away and this emergency room was filled with the wounded. Many were minor, but there were a few serious, and they got first priority. He could hear the medical jargon all around him, understanding a little, not caring about the rest. His ears were set for a name. He knew it was a foolish thing, but he didn't know what else to listen for. His information wasn't as good anymore. He missed his old employers simply for the fact that they were extremely well connected. They could have told him her name now. Because it certainly wasn't Victoria Potter anymore. He sat down in the waiting room, finding a single empty spot in a linoleum chair that had three holes in the seat and a big crack along the back. He found that he blended in rather well. There were a few other men there wearing their hooded sweatshirts up tonight, on account of the light spit of rain that was covering the city. He'd never considered Indianapolis a beautiful city, but in the haze of the rain and with the approach of winter in the air, he could see the appeal he'd been missing. Still, if forced to choose, he would take Chicago any day. He'd picked a very non-discriminate color - sweatshirt gray, nothing on the front, not even a college emblem. Thick jeans that were slightly too big, a wide belt to keep them in place. Hands stuffed in the slinging pockets in front to keep them warm, but mostly because he didn't want her to recognize him. If she was even here. It wasn't entirely out of his imagination that he'd been sold a dud. It happened. If it had happened now, he knew how to take care of it. It was just more time lost. Vincent watched the world pass by him. A woman came in with a baby, the baby looked an off-shade of blue. A nurse started her on paperwork, and then another woman approached, wearing the long white coat of a doctor, like in a television program. Brown hair, having been streaked to take away the black. Contacts in her eyes, altering the color slightly. But her profile was still the same. \"Dr. Lancing,\" the nurse said, \"room seven is open.\" Dr. Lancing...so Victoria had a new last name. He wondered if she had friends here, people who would call her by her new first name so he could hear it. The two disappeared into a small room with a seven outside the door. He didn't see her again for a while. When she came out, she was pushing back her hair from her face, which clung to it in sweaty strands. She disappeared a second time around a corner, and Vincent waited. Gradually, the chaos around him calmed. The people thinned out, the sounds lowered. The entire room seemed to cool. \"Dr. Lancing\" came out of the maze behind her as a woman entered pushing a large carriage. The woman with the carriage was obviously not a patient. She didn't have the strained, scared look on her face that the other mother had. Plus, Victoria's eyes lit up when she saw her, and she quickened her pace to approach her. \"Cindy,\" Victoria said in greeting. \"Hello, Sarah,\" Cindy replied, pulling back the hood on the carriage. \"We thought we'd stop by and say hello.\" \"I'm so glad you did,\" Victoria said, bending down into the carriage. Her hands went in, unbuckling something, and then they came out holding a baby. A baby boy, with thick, dark hair on his head and cooing happily to see his mommy. Victoria. That was her baby. Their baby. And he'd caught her new first name...\"Sarah.\" He wasn't sure what he thought of it. He didn't think she looked like a Sarah. Or maybe it was the highlights, the highlights did help make her look more like a Sarah. Victoria cuddled the baby close to her, kissing him repeatedly. In her arms, he wiggled his own little fat ones, kicked his feet playfully, and she pressed her finger against his lips, moving up and down rapidly so he could make a noise that vibrated with the movement of her finger. \"I can't believe you taught him that!\" Victoria laughed. Vincent looked up a little more as she laughed. He couldn't recall too many times he'd heard her laugh. There hadn't been a lot of laughing moments in their relationship. He could remember throaty chuckles, sarcastic throwaways caused by a bad situation, and the nights they spent together in Mexico, her soft giggles when he was in a particular mood... He blinked. He was losing his touch, to let himself get distracted like that. He watched her play with her son, watched the motherhood wash over her, change her, bring out all those things in her he thought only he had ever seen. He felt himself smiling to see her like this. He was glad she was happy. She looked happy. She looked content. She looked like she was getting her life back in order, getting it to be the way she had tried to make it before, but had failed at miserably. He wondered how exactly she was able to practice medicine again, but had a suspicion that Prosecutor Farrell had probably had a hand in it. That woman couldn't live without seeing justice served, to everyone. Except maybe him. She didn't like him. He could still remember the guarded hatred in her eyes every time she looked at him. No, she never showed it. But it was there. He didn't blame her at all. After all, he had tried to kill her. Fair was fair. \"Something funny happened this evening,\" Cindy said, as the playing calmed a bit and the baby boy became fascinated with his surroundings, which were new, compared to his mother, which wasn't. \"What?\" Victoria asked. \"Well, I was getting ready to take Charles out--\" Charles, she'd picked Charles... interesting name, he sort of liked it-\"and this woman was at the speaker to the apartment. She was asking for a Dr. Potter.\" Victoria stopped. Vincent saw the color begin to fade from her flushed cheeks. \"Potter?\" she echoed. \"Yeah, really weird. I asked her if she meant Dr. Lancing, but she said no, she wanted Dr. Potter. I told her she had the wrong apartment. She was pretty insistent about having the right place, though-\" \"Did you get her name?\" Victoria asked. \"No, she wouldn't give it, which was just rude, if you ask me. I saw her on the security cameras. I hate those things, they use the night-vision green? Made her hair look completely white.\" Vincent took a sharp breath. So his information had been correct. He'd been hoping it was wrong, that he'd come here and find everyone all right and calm, and he could slip back to his new life - not that there was much to go to - and let Victoria alone. Maybe he could still do that. \"Anyway, I waited a bit before leaving, just to make sure she was gone,\" Cindy said. \"Just seemed really weird. If she shows up again, you want me to call the police?\" \"Probably a good idea,\" Victoria said. \"Although I wouldn't trust Marion County Cops with handling a parking ticket.\" Cindy chuckled. \"Well, I'm sure it was nothing, really. But I'll call them if it happens again, anyway.\" Victoria reluctantly gave the baby back to the woman, Cindy, and there was a sadness in her face. Yes, it had been there before, but it was more clear now. It hung over her, a shadow. But she pushed it back, as surely as she did the stray strands of her hair, waved goodbye to the woman, kissed her son one more time, and went back to work. Vincent didn't see her again that night. The woman, Cindy, however, took a few minutes getting out. The wheels on the carriage, although it was obviously top-quality and brand new, were being stubborn. As she pushed the carriage out the sliding doors, she stopped at the curb and wrestled with the hood to get it to cover the baby again. Vincent walked past them. He slowed down as he neared the front of the carriage, and the baby, Charles, was sitting up, pushed away from the back of the carriage, looking up and around, and Vincent saw his own eyes staring back at him in a wide-eyed wonder. 8888888888 Time passes. Time always passes. Whether liked or not, it was an inevitable fact. The seconds became minutes, into hours, days, weeks, months. Six of them. Three of them were spent in the safety of her home. Taking care of Charles. Finding herself again. Rediscovering who she was, finding out the new person she had become. She went back to church. She took a priest into confidence and confessed her life. And at night, she still thought of Vincent. As much as she tried not to, she knew she still loved him. She'd been working at the hospital for three months. Night shifts, usually, and in the ER. It was the easiest position to fill, the place where she was least noticed, and the best hours. During the day she could be home with Charles, and go to work in the evening, and there was a wonderful woman, her name was Cindy, who was a nanny, and she liked the nights. She was very much a night person, and it was a good relationship. Cindy watched Charles from about eight in the evening to eight in the morning, a twelve hour shift that Dr. Sarah Lancing could afford, considering she used her pay for little else. Plus there were Cindy's meals, all taken care of, and the benefits of short naps if she needed them while Charles slept. He usually didn't sleep until a few hours after his mother had gone to work, around ten, woke up around four, was awake until eight and then went to sleep again when his mommy did, a not-so-small blessing, for at least another two hours. His mother didn't sleep much, anymore. The hospital was a good place to work, especially at night. Sure, it could be crazy at times, but it was rarely so. The bus overturning was a rare accident, and there had been mostly lacerations and bruised bones, only a few seriously injuries which were easily fixable. Most nights, however, it was quiet. Cindy would stop in, if she could, if the weather permitted and the hospital wasn't too busy, and Dr. Lancing could say hello to her baby boy. But then came the story about the woman looking for Dr. Potter. And she was suddenly Victoria again, feeling more alone and scared than ever. Still, it was entirely possible that it was a coincidence. Just because the security cameras showed the woman as having white hair didn't mean it was Claudia. They did use the green-tint night vision, which made everything look white or green. By the end of her shift, she was almost sure it was nothing, and she wasn't going to worry about it. 8888888888 Victoria was living in a nice place, Vincent decided. A condo, a bit yuppie, but it seemed to have a certain kind of elegance to it that suited her. How she afforded such a place was a bit beyond him, although when he thought hard about it, he was sure there had been at least two million dollars left of what they'd gotten from Shakespeare. It impressed him that she would spend it. Then again, what choice did she have? Be a single working mother, slaving away, all her money going to pay for a nanny and the other bills? Never a time to rest? No savings for her son? No, that wasn't Victoria. She was practical. And after everything, she probably felt there was enough distance between her and the money's source to justify it. Especially since she wasn't using it for herself, but for her son. It didn't take long to spot a figure lurking a block away, within view of the complex, but not close enough to be alarming. Vincent's trained eye recognized the techniques immediately. And the figure. He waited, hidden, for the figure to disappear inside a building that looked like a brownstone, slightly older than the rest. He watched patiently, and then saw a dim light come on in the foremost corner. There was a window, blinds drawn tightly over it, and there was something protruding from between the overlaying panels, something round. Surveillance equipment. Softly, he slipped into the building, after having counted the floor and memorized the location. He moved through the hallways, careful not to make any sound. There were enough sounds around him to cover his steps, but not from her. She would probably sense him. She had probably tuned all her senses for him, expecting him at any moment. He wouldn't do anything stupid like break in on her. He would just find her door, check out the security she had on it. It was a plain, wooden door, the numbers 23F on the front. He pressed against the wooden panel, feeling for the metal of the locks, finding two of them and a chain. There was a peep hole, which he quickly covered with a spot of glue. Then, he slipped out, knowing she was inside, and determined himself to wait, even if it rained all freaking night, to see if she went anywhere, did anything, talked to anyone. If this was a trap, he needed to know all the ins and outs. He walked across the street, planting himself at a bus stop, very much alone at two in the morning. Victoria had been at work for a while now, and the neighborhood was silent. This wasn't Los Angeles, he noted dryly, or even Chicago. It did sleep, or take heavy, long naps. It was comforting, though, knowing their was normalcy somewhere, that these people probably knew each other, that at the same time in the morning they got up, drank their coffee, kissed each other goodbye and went off to work in the normal world. And his Victoria was the opposite. It was fitting. As he waited, the back of his head went over the details again. He'd gotten wind of this from a highly unlikely source, if his deductive skills were still intact. Somehow, Annie had managed to inform him of it. Why the Prosecutor would be interested, or how she would even be able to do such a thing, it was beyond him. He figured it was partly on account of the fact that with his testimony, she had effectively buried Felix for the rest of his life. Say what you will, the woman didn't hold a grudge once someone had done her a good turn. Not that that was ever his intention, it was just a matter of convenience. There was movement. Upstairs. She was adjusting the telescope - no, she was removing it. And it was being replaced by something thinner. He realized with a shock that there must have been a hole cut through the glass, because the new scope was sliding right through, out into the open air. He heard a pop, then something shatter. He looked toward the condos, saw Victoria's bedroom window became a glass spider web. He looked back toward the scope, now what he knew to be the barrel of a sniper's rifle, and it had withdrawn. The blinds flapped as the air passed through, rattling them slightly. The dim light faded, and Vincent felt his feet begin to surge toward the door, determined to go after her. Then, he stopped. What had Claudia been shooting at? The nanny, of course. As a message to Victoria. Victoria would come home and find her nanny dead and her son screaming his head off from fear and neglect, and it would totally demolish her. Plus, God knew what could happen to little Charles now. His feet seemed to begin to argue with him. He didn't have a fatherly instinct in his body, but when it came to Victoria, the thought of her good seemed to suddenly overrun everything else. He should chase Claudia, catch her. But no doubt she had a good escape route planned, and if he failed to catch her, how much time would he waste chasing after her? Besides, if shooting the nanny was a warning, she was going to be back. His feet turned. He ran toward the condo. He pressed the buzzer wildly until someone let him in, just to make him stop. He ran up the stairs and when he reached the condo of the shattered window, he had to gather all his wits about him to get the door open. He never went anywhere without the ability to pick a lock, be it professional tools or the simple matter of a few sharp metal objects. The woman was on the floor, in the bedroom, in a pool of blood. The bullet had hit her shoulder, but she was alive. Alive and writhing in agony. Vincent knew what that wound felt like, he'd had it himself. Claudia hadn't been aiming to kill, just to really, really make a painful mess. Vincent picked up the phone. The nanny - Cindy - was making strange rattling noises in her chest. The bullet had shattered bone and sent some of it into her lungs. She could barely breath, let alone move. From the next room, Charles began to howl. He dialed 911. 8888888888 When they brought her in, Victoria was currently the only doctor in the emergency room. It was nearly two-thirty in the morning, she was enjoying a quick break with a cup of coffee. The paramedics came in, with Cindy strapped to the table. One of them walked directly up to her, holding Charles in his carrier in one hand, and a note in the other. \"Dr. Lancing?\" he said. Victoria looked down at her son, not quite registering what was going on. \"Dr. Lancing!\" came a shout, \"major bleeding, we got to get her prepped now!\" \"This note was left for you. This is your son?\" the paramedic said quickly, handing her the note. She took it. It read: To whom it may concern, this woman is the nanny for Charles Lancing, son of Dr. Sarah Lancing. Please deliver him to his mother in the ER at St. Margaret's Hospital . \"Yes, yes,\" Victoria said, clutching for her son. A nurse she knew very well, Tonya, came up beside her, taking the baby. \"Go to work, Doctor,\" she said. \"I'll watch your son.\" So Victoria did. A/N: First of all, I'd like to thank everyone whose ever sent in a review. That is so important and it's been the main reason I've kept writing this story, even though I seem to be moving out of my Tom Cruise obsession. But a good story and loyal readers are very important. So thank you, really, from the bottom of my heart. That being said, I've written more chapters for Solace than for Soulless, and Soulless has more reviews! What gives? I guess Warm Mittens and Sweet Treats not kicking in really did some damage. So you hear that girls? You'd better get to reviewing! :) I'm really kidding. Well, half-way, anyway.[Chapter 14] Vincent The bullet had completely passed through Cindy's body. Her right shoulder was shattered, clavicle damaged to the point where she would need reconstructive surgery and a few metal pins to keep everything in place. The tricky part, however, had been the shards of bone in her organs, especially in her lungs. It had taken a while to fish them all out and close up the holes. By the time the whole thing was done, in about two and a half hours, she was resting as comfortable as she could be, heavily dosed and on breathing support until her lungs healed. Victoria stumbled out of the operating room and peeled off her bloody gloves, the mask, the blue cap of her hair. She even ripped off the blue gown and tossed it into the trash, not thinking. Dazed and confused, and also recovering from the intensity of the previous situation, she could do little else other than stumble over to the desk. Tonya had put Charles safely behind the counter, keeping a careful eye on him while she handled all the various pieces of paper that came across her desk. When Victoria approached, she stood up and handed the woman a very cold bottle of Aquafina, which Victoria took, opened and swallowed heavily. \"Where's my baby?\" she said, recovering. Tonya pointed, and Victoria stepped up behind the raised desk and bent down, disappearing to see to her son. \"I already checked him over, and the paramedics assured me that he was fine,\" Tonya said. Victoria pulled the baby out of his holder and cuddled him. His cheeks were slightly sticky from the tears he'd shed. Poor thing had probably been scared out of his mind. \"Dr. Lancing?\" Tonya said, holding the note. \"Who could have written this?\" Victoria took the paper. She read it again, as if she didn't remember reading it before. \"I...I don't know. Definitely a man's writing. Cindy didn't have a boyfriend, as far as I knew.\" \"Seems unlikely that the shooter would go through the trouble. There must have been someone else in your apartment.\" Victoria shook her head. \"Best leave the detective work to the police, yeah?\" she said, sitting down in the empty chair and cradling Charles. She stared down at the note. She had always had a singular knack with handwriting, but had never gone anywhere with it. She could easily tell the difference between a woman's hand and a man's, and this was definitely masculine. She looked down. There was a scribble before the abbreviation for doctor. She squinted, pulled the paper closer. Under the ink, an uppercase V had been scratched out. Whoever had started to write this note had started to write the name Victoria. She paled, her grip on Charles going a little slack. The baby started to wiggle uncomfortably, she adjusted him on her lap. \"Dr. Lancing?\" Tonya said. \"Did you hear me?\" \"I'm sorry?\" Victoria said, looking up. Two policemen stood at the counter. \"Dr. Sarah Lancing?\" the first one, older and blond, asked. \"I'm Officer Toats, this is Officer Manning. We've been sent to bring you to the station. Your home has become the scene of a crime, and we'll need to ask you some questions.\" Victoria stood up, Charles in her hands. She looked around, as if unsure. \"Right now? I'm currently the only doctor on shift.\" \"I'll take care of it, Dr. Lancing,\" Tonya said. \"This is important, Dr. Lancing,\" Officer Manning said. \"Your nanny was shot by a sniper rifle at a considerably distance. Do you have any enemies that might have done this?\" Victoria just shrugged. She had no idea what to say. So she did the only thing she could think to do. She went with them, and requested to call a friend of hers, who happened to be Detective Ray Fanning. 8888888888 \"Victoria, what are you doing?\" \"I'm sorry, Ray,\" she said, her voice low. It was a small, quiet room, ensuring her absolute privacy. In the age of cellular phones, the novelty of a phone booth was almost alien, but this was a small room, with a table and a chair, a place for her to be relatively comfortable. As if that could possibly exist at the moment. \"I've got a really big problem.\" \"Talk.\" \"Someone shot my nanny with a sniper rifle. You know anyone who would want to do that? Anyone capable?\" \"Wait a second. Where are you?\" \"I'm at a police station in Indianapolis...I didn't catch the precinct number. They brought me in for questioning because they want to know if I have any enemies. Do I have enemies, Ray?\" The tone of her voice was nearly sarcastic, but he understood. \"Okay, you sit tight, I'm going to make a few calls. You need to ask for a lawyer.\" \"But I'm not under suspicion. They just want to know if I have any idea who did this.\" \"Most people would have just lied.\" \"I'm not most people. Plus...\" she hesitated. Nanny . He had to have figured it out by now. \"Ray, I have a baby.\" \"I figured.\" \"I don't want him to be in danger. This is too much.\" \"I know, I understand. Look, I'm already on the other line contacting some people. I'll come myself if I have to. You need to ask specifically where you are. I have to know.\" \"Okay.\" She sighed, feeling slightly comforted...slightly. At least someone was behind her this time, someone on the right side of the law. Although she couldn't help but think that if Vincent were here, this mess would be half over, rather than just started. \"So what do I tell them in the meantime?\" \"Ask for the lawyer. Don't answer any questions until they give you one. I don't care if they hold you all night-\" \"Ray, my nanny was shot. I have to get back to my baby.\" \"Where is he now?\" \"He's...at work, under the care of a friend.\" \"You're going to just have to call your friend and make sure she or he or whoever can watch the baby a little while longer.\" Victoria sighed, deeply. \"All right,\" she murmured. \"Victoria, don't worry,\" Ray said, his voice low. \"We're going to take care of this.\" She flinched. \"It's Claudia, isn't it?\" \"You're pretty quick to start naming suspects,\" Ray muttered. \"How do you know it isn't a certain ex-contract killer?\" Victoria felt her teeth press together involuntarily. \"He's never do that,\" she said. \"You so sure?\" \"Yessss.\" Real anger now. If he pushed any farther she was going to slam down the phone and to hell with whatever happened next. But, her reason chided her, she had to think of Charles. Charles above all things, even her pride, most especially her heart. \"Okay, fine. I'll be in touch.\" And he hung up. 8888888888 At about four thirty in the morning, there was a county defender passing through who agreed to talk to Victoria in confidence. Once it was explained that Victoria was in Witness Protection, everything changed. She was released unconditionally as the woman, her name was Rebecca Gates, gave her her number and told her they would contact the right people. In return, Victoria gave them Ray's contact number, and went back to the hospital. Victoria entered the room where Cindy was resting. Charles was asleep in his carrier, safe and sound under the care of Tonya and another nurse who had just come on duty and instantly fallen in love with the little baby. She did the precursory check of all of Cindy's vitals, saw that she was still stable, and breathed a soft sigh. It wasn't fair. It just wasn't fair. A part of her wanted to scream, to carry on, to force God to call a time out. It wasn't right that after all this, it still wasn't over. Claudia still dogged her steps. She thought about Vincent. Thought about in so intently that she let out a small, longing moan. She covered her face with her hands, rubbing away the exhaustion. Where was he now? Was he safe? Or had Claudia taken care of him first before coming after her? The thought was unbearable. And yet it was equally unbearable to think that she was in such danger, and absolutely alone. She never fully realized the benefits of being with Vincent - he had always kept her safe, always rescued her, always done whatever it took to ensure her safety. But he wasn't here. She wished to God he was here. \"Victoria?\" She closed her eyes. No, she had imagined it. She had just been a victim of wishful thinking. Intense emotions were capable of causing the mind to play tricks on itself. He wasn't there, in the room, behind her. He wasn't standing behind her, in the darkened corner. He wasn't there . She heard a footstep. \"Victoria,\" he said again, and he knew she was aware of him, he could read her so easily, but no, she told herself, he wasn't there, she was imagining him. She told herself this, so that when she turned around and saw nothing, her heart wouldn't break from the disappointment. Slowly, so slowly, she turned around, wanting to go faster, wanting to show her eyes and her stupid brain that her heart was wrong, wrong, wrong...but there he was, the profile of his face in the shadow, that nose she would recognize anywhere, the familiar build, even his height, all familiar. As he stepped closer, he pushed back the hood of the sweatshirt he was wearing. His hair was no longer gray, but long and brown, hanging around the nape of his neck. His facial hair that thickened into nearly a beard, balancing out the years the color change added to his features. But his eyes, they were no different. They were still the same bright bluish-green orbs she remembered, staring at her so hard they pinned her in place, held her tighter than any fists ever could. She whimpered; the strain was too much. He stepped even closer, one hand going out, finding her arm, fingers sliding across it, as if he, too, wanted to be sure of her existence. But no, he'd known she was here. He had come for her, like he always did. \"How?\" she whispered, realizing she was on the verge of tears. \"Don't ask,\" he said, almost with a smile. His face was so sad, much sadder than she remembered. He'd always seemed lonely, but there was a loss there now that was starting to lift, the longer he looked at her. Dear God, he missed her as much as she missed him. Maybe more. His fingers tightened around her arm, and he pulled her closer to him, so close his breath was on her face. Warm and sweet...he still brushed his teeth twice a day. He didn't drink, didn't smoke. She leaned into it, wondering what his beard felt like now that it was thicker, wondering if it scratched as well as his old, thinner one. She noticed that even his beard was vacant of his gray hairs, and she felt a strange kind of disappointment. She had so liked the scratchiness of his graying beard. Slowly, he bent his head, and she was sure he was going to kiss her. She closed her eyes for a second, remembering how it felt to kiss him. She had imagined, in childish fantasies, when her guard was down and she was lonely, how she would kiss him if she ever saw him again. She imagined the passionate kissing of long lost lovers, mouths open, tongues entwined, hands groping, unable to press their bodies together hard enough. Wanting to touch everything at once, to swallow each other so they could never be separated again. Her hands went up. She took a step back. No, she had to resist. It wasn't a good sign, him being here. Claudia was out there, that was why he was in here. That was why her Nanny was shot and lying in a hospital bed, fighting for her life. \"You were the one who wrote that note,\" she said, looking away. \"I did.\" \"Thank you for getting Charles to me.\" \"I just gave the instructions. They're the ones who did it.\" She grunted, looked up at him. She'd almost forgotten his adversity to fatherhood. She wondered, when he'd been in her apartment, if he'd bothered to look at Charles, if he'd walked up to the crib, if he'd touched him, looked into his face and saw what she did, every day - Vincent's own eyes, and the same brown hair that was on Vincent's head this moment. \"We need to talk, Victoria,\" Vincent said, bringing her back to him. \"What about?\" \"Claudia.\" \"I know about Claudia,\" she said. \"Ray Fanning is on his way-\" \"Ray Fanning can't do diddly-shit,\" Vincent said in a very low voice. \"I have to take care of this.\" \"You mean, you have to kill her.\" \"It's her, or she'll kill us. It's not murder, it's self-defense.\" \"Your definition of it, anyway.\" She stepped away, wrapping her arms around herself. \"Vincent, when will this all be over?\" \"When Claudia is dead, it will be,\" Vincent assured her. \"So...more killing.\" \"One more. I haven't killed anyone since I last saw you. I haven't cut my hair, either.\" He lifted one hand to push back some of the soft brown locks behind his ear. He gave her a tiny smile, hoping for a drop of levity. \"Explains that,\" she said, looking up. \"You like it?\" She wanted to say something...yes, no, that she could get used to it. Instead, she just looked at him. \"And you and me, Vincent...when will we be over?\" That seemed to hurt him. He visibly flinched. \"I take it, then, you're not happy to see me.\" The word No was on her lips, but she stifled it. It wasn't the truth. She was happy to see him. It seemed to relieve a tension she hadn't known she was feeling. \"I just wish it were on a happy occasion,\" she said softly. \"Me, too.\" He reached for her again, innocently, not expecting her to move away. She found herself unable to reject him a second time, and was in his arms. \"I missed you, so much. I 't stay away from you.\" She rested her head against his chest, listening to his heartbeat. She closed her eyes, felt him so close to her. Dammit, it felt so good to be near him. \"So you saw your son,\" she whispered. He hesitated to answer. \"I did.\" \"You know that you're a father now.\" Her voice had turned hard, almost against her will. She looked up at him, into his face. He looked down at her, listening. \"I know,\" he whispered. \"What did you think of him?\" she asked, nearly a challenge. \"He looks like you, you know.\" \"But he's beautiful like you,\" Vincent replied. \"I saw you yesterday with him. I saw how happy he makes you. I wish I could make you happy like that.\" She closed her eyes and gently extracted herself from his embrace. \"Vincent, this really isn't a good place for ...this,\" she whispered. \"I know.\" Suddenly he was all business, hardening because of her inadvertent rejection. \"You can't go back to your condo, Claudia knows that you're there.\" \"Then where do I go?\" \"A hotel, the closest one.\" He paused. \"You could come stay with me. I have a room at the Sheraton.\" \"And Charles?\" Vincent hitched. \"Of course, him too.\" She shook her head. \"No, thanks. I'll get my own room.\" \"God, Victoria...I'm not allergic to him.\" She grinned up at him, but it was humorless. \"Yes you are. You want to talk to me again, leave me your number at the Sheraton. But I think you'd better go.\" He stared at her for a long moment, absorbing what she'd said. \"Fine,\" he whispered. He walked over to the small table by the bed, scribbled something on the hospital pad there, ripped it off, handed it to her. Then he left the room without so much as a backwards glance.[Chapter 15] Standard Disclaimer A/N: Okay, I'm sorry I took so long getting this chapter up. It's been a tough week and I got sick. So I'm sorry if this doesn't meet expectations, I did it all in one night when I should have been doing stuff for school and then going to bed early. BUT...tomorrow is Friday, and I shall have the weekend, and hopefully, by Monday, we will reach the conclusion of this tale. So...enjoy! Brawl Six Months Ago : Claudia walked into the holding area. They had Felix in a wide open space, where they could watch him. They weren't bars as much as they were thick metal screens. He had a bed in the middle, and his private things, out for whoever came to see him to view, sat on a table, neatly aligned in a row. He was currently sitting on his bed, a glorified army cot that it was, reading a book. He looked up at her. \"Yes?\" he said. She loved a man with an accent. \"You asked for me, Mr. Felix,\" she replied. Felix uncurled his long legs and stood up, setting down the book. \"You are she? The White Witch?\" \"Politically incorrect, but true.\" Claudia smiled. \"Although many would say the White Bitch.\" Felix regarded her. \"What happened to your face?\" It was almost a rude question, but Claudia did hardly more than flinch. \"That's sort of the reason why I'm taking this job,\" she said with a heavy sigh. The scar on her cheek had tightened, but most of the damage was confined to the thickness of the line down the side of her face. As for what else Vincent had done to her...those hadn't been to her face. \"I'm a fast healer though,\" she said, almost brightly. \"Only took me about three months to really get patched up and in working condition again.\" Felix grunted. \"You are a government issue,\" he muttered. \"I'm a private contractor,\" she said. \"The government just had first dibs on me for a while. But after what happened, I'm not planning on doing another job for them for a good long time. Until they pay my workman's comp, anyway.\" Felix gave a little smile, nodded. \"So, you can find him?\" \"I can always find him. What I don't quite understand, Mr. Felix, is why. I mean, it's a bit late. You're already done.\" Felix nodded. \"True. But even inside this world, I still have power outside. And it will make a statement. Considering your situation, I thought you were ideal to handle it.\" \"I am. I will enjoy it.\" \"I'm sure. I shall tell the proper people to send the payment. As soon as you receive it, I wish to hear regular reports of your progress. Telegrams, if you must. Be as cryptic as you like, I'm fond of puzzles.\" She nodded, smiled. Too bad he was inside. She could probably grow to like him. 8888888888 NOW : Vincent entered the building, being extra careful. He didn't know exactly where Claudia was, but it made little difference at the moment, except for the possibility that she could turn a corner at any second. If he was so fortunate. He had his knife at the ready for such a possibility. The problem with most people in his situation was that he could, quite possibly, let his anger get the best of him. This would cause two problems, both of which Vincent had examined carefully in the silent hours while he waited for Victoria to return from the police station. One, if he was too angry, he could let his passion get the better of him and make a mistake. Two, passion often lead to the desire to cause maximum pain. While this seemed to be a reasonable option, it allowed the receiver too much time to live and therefore the possibility of escape. A quick death was best in these cases. He'd always believed in a quick death. Torture was good only for information. If torture happened to kill - well, there were always possibilities. But he needed no information from Claudia. He already knew what was going on. Felix was ordered this hit, and with her being twice thwarted by him and Victoria, Claudia was the most likely candidate. But if Vincent made her death ugly and public enough, even if it was post-mortem, Felix would get the hint and give up. No sense wasting perfectly good assassins. And Felix had seemed like a reasonable man. He found his way up the stairs and into the apartment. It was empty, and dark. Not a good sign. He always kept his lights on. Shadows were never an option when it came to your own place. Too many places for others to hide. If Claudia had the lights off, she was most likely there, and possibly waiting for him. He stepped inside. His gun was at the ready in its holder, fully loaded, extra clip in his pocket. He had a knife up his sleeve, and another closer to his fingertips in case of a sudden charge. And he had cut his hair. Hair was just too easy to grasp in the middle of a fight. He didn't want to give Claudia any chances he didn't have to. \"This is really too predictable,\" he said in a conversational voice, echoing slightly in the dark. \"I mean, it's like a bad movie.\" \"Not that bad of a movie,\" came her answering voice. \"I thought it was appropriate, though. Considering.\" \"Considering what?\" \"I don't know. Just considering.\" He heard a soft click. She had a gun as well. So this was going to be even uglier than he'd anticipated. Of course she was prepared. But she always made a mistake at the wrong time. It was her flaw. Her Achilles heel. \"Come on, Claudia,\" he said, \"Let's do this.\" \"I'm already wet for you, baby,\" she said, and she opened fire. He dove backwards. The room was extremely sparse, only the barest minimum of furniture, giving him practically no cover. He grabbed for the door, pulled it close against him, and a few of the bullets went through it, the others going for the wall. One landed an inch from his head. \"You're not even aiming,\" he accused. \"You think you can do better?\" she mocked. He cocked and fired. Carefully. Three tentative shots, together, in the direction of her voice. He heard the last one lodge into something covered in skin and muscle. \"Fucker. That was my funny bone.\" The returning bullet caught him right in the gut. He raised and fired again, adjusting his aim. His insides were exploding but he pushed it aside. He could not back down, he couldn't give for even a second. He would fight until he was dead, or Claudia was dead, or both. There was a splattering noise. He'd hit her again, but it was a surface wound - probably a bullet had taken a chunk out of a thigh or something, making a mess but causing little real damage. Bitch of it was, he'd fired too many times, letting the pain make him a little groggy, and his clip was empty. He let it slide out and reached inside his jacket for the second one. That was when she lunged. The door that had been protecting him was suddenly yanked back and then thrust at him again, the doorknob hitting him directly in the left temple. He heard the clip he was loading fall to the floor, felt his gun slide from his grip. She moved to kick him, but he caught himself just in time, getting his hand around her ankle, twisting it, fingers pressing on the smaller bones. He was rewarded with a snap. Her response was to bring her fist right down into the bullet wound in his gut. She pulled it out, thick with his blood, but the spasm of pain had only made his hold on her leg tighter. He yanked, bringing her flat onto her back, rolled and got his elbow directly up into the lower bone of her chin. He heard her teeth snap together painfully, heard her gargle in her throat. It was difficult to tell what happened next. They were all hands and feet, all pointed elbows and fingernails and heels slamming into vulnerable places. Vincent found himself on automatic, desiring nothing more thank to keep her down long enough to get the knife out of his sleeve, but she was fast, so fast, slinking around him, the light from outside briefly glimmering on her white hair as she moved, the only sign of her in the dark. The wound in his gut seemed to be widening. He briefly wondered if it was possible for him to continue to fight if one of his vital organs happened to slide out, like it stomach or his colon. He wondered what it would take to get her gut opened up, where exactly he should slam his knife when he finally got it free. Finally, after a terrible bout with her heel slamming into his crotch, they got away from each other, across the room, and he was able to access his sleeve. One of his knives was gone. \"I hope you brought two,\" Claudia said, her knife clicking open. It was a loud snap in the dark room, filled only with the sound of their heavy panting. \"I'm going to kill you, Claudia,\" he said, very calm. \"I figured one day you would.\" She sounded so calm, so nonchalant about it. \"But really, I'm not worried.\" She came charging at him, and he could barely move fast enough to avoid the slash of the knife. The whipping sound through the air was like a crack against his eardrums. \"Gut wound making you woozy?\" she asked. \"How many teeth you got left?\" he returned. \"I don't have any of my real teeth,\" she admitted. \"Lost them about two years ago, bomb in my face. Also took out my knee, the one you thought you broke. Amazing what kind of things they can replace these days, if you know the right people.\" He returned the slash, catching her just against her rib cage, a surface knick. She clucked her tongue. \"You know, if we were normal people, this would be sad,\" she said. \"How so?\" \"You and I. We have history, you know. Once upon a time, we were at each other's backs, not each other's throats.\" \"Don't tell me you're getting sentimental.\" More slashing. They ducked, weaved, knicked, backed into corners, bleeding and thinking fast. \"I'm not,\" she said. \"Okay, maybe I am. A little. You were a good fuck.\" \"Thank you.\" He made a heavy sweeping motion, and was rewarded with catching something on the side of her head. By the kind of throttled scream she gave, he could tell it was her ear. It made a wet sound as it hit the ground. Severed ears always looked like they were made of wax. She clutched the wound, her breath going in and out, steadily. She was attempting to block the pain, he had to act fast. He dove again, but she was more ready, managing to duck anything serious. Instead the tip of his knife scratched over the scar on her cheek. To his surprise, she laughed. \"As I was saying,\" she said, her tone the same, even though her voice was a bit thicker, \"a long time ago, Vincent, you and I were all the other had in the world.\" \"Times change,\" he said coldly. She grunted. \"Don't get me wrong. I left you, I know. I guess I just expected you to be bitter about it. Most men are.\" \"I'm not most men.\" \"I know. But you are still a man.\" She paused. \"So how's your little baby? He didn't get hurt because of his nanny, did he?\" \"Why did you shoot her?\" Vincent asked, no accusation in his voice. \"To make you mad,\" she replied. \"Why didn't you just go straight for Victoria then?\" Vincent asked. \"Because I wanted to make a point,\" Claudia said. She swung, caught Vincent right above the knee, tearing a chunk out of his thigh above it. He stumbled backward, knife out, to keep her from advancing. \"And that point was?\" \"You're a not a father.\" \"No shit,\" Vincent said. She snorted. \"Please. No macho show for me. I told you before Victoria was a liability. When I'd heard you'd split, I thought you were actually growing a brain. And yet, I threaten her just a little bit, my name happens to come up in the wrong conversation, and here you are, tooth and nail, to protect her.\" \"I asked for your point,\" Vincent said, leveling his knife at her. \"My point is, you are totally fucked. Which is why, no matter how hard you fight, you're going to die.\" She attacked. It was a series of kicks and swings, which he countered, but it took its toll. \"I'm going to kill you, and then I'm going to kill her, and then I'm going to kill your baby,\" Claudia said. \"And now you're going to get really, really pissed, take a wild swing at me, and I'm going to stab you-\"She lunged, exactly as she had predicted, her knife lodging into his rib cage. \"Like that.\" He looked down at her. He felt the blade. It was lodged right into his old scar, where the bullet Max had put into him once rested. He reached up. His hand closed around hers. He pulled it away, taking the knife with it. Claudia looked up at him in shock. \"Two more inches to the left, and you would have been right,\" Vincent said. \"That's what I mean about you, Claudia. You always make a stupid mistake at exactly the wrong time.\" And he attacked. 8888888888 Victoria stood at the nurse's station, holding Charles in her arms. She wasn't really tired - it was getting on to five in the morning, about an hour away from the end of her shift. She'd been cleared to leave, but since she didn't know exactly where to go, she found herself at the hospital, reluctant to leave. She should check into a hotel. Scratch that, she should leave town. Cindy's family was here, watching over her. They didn't want her around, they blamed her for this mess. Victoria would not forget the look on Cindy's mother's face. A mother's love was a powerful thing. She went into the lounge, which was deserted at this hour. The interns would be coming in soon, the morning doctors, the nurses. The hospital's quiet hours would be ending soon. She made herself comfortable on the couch, Charles still asleep in his carrier. She laid down, stretching out to lay one hand inside the carrier, on top of Charles' softly rising chest. He was so lucky...obliviously currently to the pains of life. She briefly wondered if Vincent hadn't been right. If it would have been better not to bring him into the world. Her hand tightened on one of Charles' small legs. She could feel his little toes flexing against her wrist. No, such thoughts were utter nonsense. She wouldn't have anything in the world right now without him. She would have had to leave Vincent eventually... staying with him had been an impossibility that was bound to reveal itself in time... She had drifted off for about ten minutes when she heard the noise. The ambulances pulling up. She lifted herself up, the cheap plastic covering sticking to her arm and leaving an impression on her cheek. A tingle went all the way down her spine. She moved, causing a horrible squeaking sound that made Charles wake up. He looked up at her, let out a little squeak, and she picked him up, wishing like hell she had a bottle at that moment. Standing, she went to the door and opened it. The commotion let her down the hallway, into the emergency room. There were two people being brought in on gurneys, both of them cut up so badly she could see the wounds from where she stood. And she saw a thick head of white hair. She closed in. Claudia. \"Doctor, we need you,\" Tonya said, taking Charles. \"His carrier?\" \"In the lounge. How bad is it?\" Victoria asked, going into doctor mode. \"Critical. Please.\" So Victoria did what a doctor does. She moved to get to work. And then she saw who was on the other gurney. Vincent. She stopped, beginning to tremble. There were two doctor's working on him. His wounds were more clean-cut, one in the gut, one in the chest. They had the situation under control. Claudia was dying. Victoria stopped. Should she save her? A few more minutes, she would lose so much blood, she would die. She'd been sliced to ribbons, her arms and legs a mass of lacerations, her throat sliced open, but the jugular hadn't been cut, only exposed. All it would take was a simple mistake and that exposed jugular was going to go, and it was over. It would be over. She shook herself. That wasn't her job. She wasn't a killer. She had to help. But Vincent did this , a little voice said to her. He did it to protect you. If you save Claudia, he could die for nothing. Vincent isn't going to die , Victoria told that voice, glancing over at him. \"Doctor Lancing!\" Dr. Gregg called out, and Victoria stepped up. Her hands closed over a thick piece of gauze, pressing down on a particularly nasty wound. \"An artery in her thigh has been damaged,\" Gregg explained. \"We need to get her into surgery.\" \"Do they know what happened?\" she asked as she worked, pulling the mask on over her face, the gloves onto her hands. \"Police found them like this. Neighbors reported fighting, heard funny noises. These two must have been real professionals not to have been screaming and hollering the whole way.\" The gurney was moving now, into the operating room. Claudia had already been put down. Her vital signs were weak. \"We need pints,\" Gregg told the nurse. \"Stat.\" Victoria did not look at Claudia's face. She looked down at the body, at the wounds. She had a job to do. It was...it was...who she was. Her hands trembled slightly the entire time. 8888888888 It took three hours to get the bleeding to stop, get the blood to clot, get enough blood into Claudia to give her a chance to live. Why in the hell she'd done it, though, she didn't know. Tonya was getting ready to go off shift. Somewhere she had gotten a bottle of formula delivered, and to Victoria's amazement, Charles had taken it. She'd even managed to produce a diaper and change him. She made arrangements with a nurse in the maternity ward, and Charles was in the best of care - against regulations, but Victoria was too relieved to worry at the moment. She stepped into the recovery room, her white coat shed and only her civies on underneath. A T-shirt and jeans were the most comfortable for that time of night. She walked up to the bed. \"Vincent?\" she whispered. He'd cut his hair and shaved off his beard. It was a bit of a shock at first, but it was closer to the man she remembered than the long-haired one who had surprised her only hours ago. Had this all happened in one night? It didn't seem possible. He stirred, only slightly. Then, at the repeated whisper of his name, his eyes slowly opened into slits. \"Vic?\" he managed through a dehydrated throat. \"Don't try to talk,\" she said calmly. \"You're at the hospital. They brought you in.\" \"Cl...aud...\" He was asking about Claudia. She didn't know what the hell to tell him. Currently, Claudia was alive...how long she would stay that way was anyone's guess. She didn't have high chances, but she was a very tough bitch. \"Don't worry about that. You're going to be okay. Hell, Vincent...you're almost lucky Max shot you. All that scar tissue might be what saved you from a worse wound. It was the gunshot in your gut that was really a mess, but luckily they managed to patch you up. There wasn't too much damage to anything vital.\" As she spoke his eyes opened a little bit more, a little bit more. Soon, she was staring down into them, deep beautiful green pools, looking up at her with an expression she could barely fathom. \"You?\" he whispered. \"You...okay?\" \"I'm fine,\" she said. There was a humming in her pocket. Her phone. That might be Ray, calling to let her know when he would be coming. \"You rest. I just wanted you to know ...I'm here.\" He gave her the faintest of smiles. He moistened his lips, cleared his throat. He was determined to say something, and she began to wonder what it was that was so urgent. \"I...love...you...Vic.\" She drew a deep breath. \"The last time you told me that,\" she said, with almost a smile, \"you left me. You're not going anywhere for a little bit.\" He let out a small burst of air. It was a pathetic excuse for a chuckle, but it passed. \"Yes...ma'am.\" A/N: I only have time for a few shout outs...I promise I'll get to the rest of you at the end of the next chapter! OMG firegoddess164! I'm so sorry...I think your review came in on chapter 13 and I was responding to the ones from 12. And then Warm Mittens bombarded me with reviews (wink) and after that it all went to hell. To answer your question: Vincent didn't go to jail. He was allowed to walk and then relocated through Witness Protection because of his help with putting Felix in jail. Where he got relocated, though, I never went into that, didn't think it was important since we all wanted him to go catch up with Victoria, anyway. :) SweetArwen: Actually, I like that idea...killing off the main character and then bringing her back. That is a FUN plotline. Another one I like is the two main characters, lovers, totally breaking up in the end because they realize they were just not meant to be. Not that I would ever do that myself...well, maybe, someday...if I could take the hate mail. I'll have to think about it. Maybe change my screenname. Heh. :) PAR? Par? You out there? You sure? You mad at me? Please don't be! Please review! I will email you this weekend, I promise! :)[Chapter 16] Strength Detective Ray Fanning arrived in Indianapolis on a flight straight out of LAX, a red-eye flight that arrived at approximately 8:15 a.m. local time, which was three hours ahead of his Pacific time clock. He rented a car and headed straight for the hospital. He'd called Victoria as soon as his flight had landed, gotten a rather half-dead answer to his question about where she was, and wondered what in the hell he was going to find when he got there. What he saw didn't really surprise him. Claudia was fighting. She wasn't letting go, even though all her vital signs were showing she didn't have much of a chance. Victoria met him in the waiting room, eyes totally bloodshot, looking as if she'd slept upright for maybe a few hours, maybe less. Her hair, which she'd streaked with a lighter, cinnamon brown, taking out the darker undertones, was mussed beyond repair. \"What are we going to do?\" she asked as he sat down beside her in one of the cheap green chairs. \"You're alone here?\" \"Vincent's here. I'm not going to tell you where. I've managed to bribe a nurse in the maternity ward to take care of...my baby.\" Didn't want to say his name. \"This isn't going to work if you don't trust me.\" \"I trust you, Ray, with my own life. But not Vincent's.\" \"I'm not here for Vincent. Vincent had a clean slate. Claudia took up a contract on his life.\" \"Looks like she got more than she bargained for,\" Victoria said over a yawn. \"You don't seem too shocked by all this.\" \"Shock left the building about two hours ago. I'm uncomfortably numb right now.\" \"So I'll go talk to this lawyer of yours. We'll get things straightened out. Or have you already called her?\" Victoria's eyes were drifting shut. \"I didn't,\" she muttered. \"Figured...you'd do it.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Ray?\" she asked, her voice just a touch clearer than before. \"What?\" \"Why are you here? I mean, why didn't you just refer me off to the Fed who should be here...what's his name? Pedrosa?\" \"Because I think Claudia worked for Pedrosa,\" Ray said, nonchalant. \"Didn't want to risk it. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. This whole thing will be over with soon.\" \"That's what worries me,\" Victoria said, struggling to her feet. \"Where will we all be when it is?\" \"Like I said, I'm not here for Vincent. Unless he committed a crime. And if Claudia attacked you or him, then it was self-defense and no crime was committed. You're both clear.\" \"I don't know what the fuck is going on. Only that I helped assist in saving Claudia's life and I have no fucking idea what I was thinking.\" Ray smiled up at her. \"You're a good person. That's what you were thinking.\" \"Lot of good it will do me if she lives. She's a ghost. Nothing will stick to her. She'll come at us again.\" \"You're exhausted. You need to sleep,\" Ray said, changing the subject. Victoria's reply was to give him a look that was supposed to be scathing but really came across as someone staring at a person through a half-dead haze, then turned around and disappeared down the hallway. 8888888888 Vincent's vitals weren't good. He'd been okay when she'd left him, steady but weak. It had deteriorated. Victoria entered the room as the morning sun streamed through the windows which faced east. She considering pulling the blinds, but there were a few trees blocking the way and they provided enough shade to keep it from being blinding. She pulled the chair closer to his bedside, noticed that in the few hours he'd been here, his hair had already started to cover his chin, coming back in a dull gray, darkened a little by the dye, but still distinct, still as she remembered it. She ran the insides of her fingers against the stubble, and smiled to herself. So many times she had felt that roughness, in places she would still blush to remember. He stirred. His head turned to her a little, his eyes opened. As long as he was awake, it was good. But he was drifting in and out, and it was bad. \"Hey,\" he said, a little more clearly than before. She ran her fingers gently through his hair and smiled down at him. A small dread began to eat at her gut, telling her that he was going to ask about Claudia, want to know if she was dead, and if she wasn't, he was going to want to know why not, and she would tell him, because his compulsive honesty was infectious, especially the way he was looking at her now, so adoringly. She'd only caught glimpses of the way he gazed at her at this moment, stolen from the past when she looked at him too fast or caught him off his guard. Which wasn't often. She'd always known he'd loved her. Hearing him say it, what was it, a year ago? Maybe a little more? And then again, from this very bed... \"You know,\" she said, her voice a husky murmur, \"it's really not fair.\" \"What's not fair?\" he whispered. \"You being such an irresistible sick person. How can I be pissed at you when you look so pathetic?\" He gave that breathy chuckle again. It wasn't much stronger than before. \"Florence... Nightengale.\" \"I don't think so. You're not my patient.\" \"Then...what am I?\" She gazed down at him. \"I don't know.\" He looked back up at her, and then, to her surprise, he lifted his arm. \"Come here.\" \"What?\" she asked, backing away as his arm lifted higher. \"On the bed. Lie with me.\" Victoria looked at his chest, at the bandages. She looked over her shoulder at the passing staff. What he wanted...it was ridiculous. \"You're not strong enough, Vincent,\" she protested. \"Come on. Humor me.\" She stood up, knowing it was stupid, what he wanted. She could step on a tube, she could press to hard on a stitch, cause bleeding. She went to the door, pushed it closed, and then came back to the bed. He had lowered his arm, unable to hold it up. Then, with a strength that astounded her, he shifted over, giving her room on the bed. \"Are you nuts?\" she hissed, reaching out to make him hold still. \"Come on,\" he said, tugging at her shirt. \"Please.\" Gently, so gently, holding herself half-off the bed, she lay down beside him. His arm, the one he was using to bring her closer, seemed to be where all his strength resided, as it was the least damaged part of his body, with only a few slash marks down the back. He got it around her shoulders and pulled her head close to his chest, resting five inches above where Claudia had stabbed him. He pressed his face into her hair, resting there, practically pinning her in place just as effectively as handcuffs and rope. She didn't dare move for fear of hurting him. His lips pressed against her forehead. A few locks of her hair had fallen against his nose and he inhaled as deeply as he could. \"I need a shower,\" she muttered, slightly embarrassed. \"You...smell fine.\" His strength was gone. \"I love you.\" That was the second time he'd said it in twenty four hours. It was starting to alarm her. \"Vincent, you realize you've told me that twice as many times in the few hours we've seen each other than in the three months we spent together?\" \"Mistake,\" he said. \"I love you...so much.\" Her heart wrenched. \"Vincent...stop talking like you're dying.\" \"I am dying.\" The words stopped her heart. \"You're not. You're going to be fine.\" \"No. I'll never...be fine. I haven't been...fine...since we met.\" She frowned. \"Not fair to blame me,\" she muttered, hating herself for it. \"Not blaming,\" he said, and she felt him smile against her skin. \"Thanking.\" \"Vincent,\" she said, her voice a bit louder. \"Stop it.\" \"Can't.\" His fingers weakly squeezed her shoulder. \"Want you to know. I'm so...happy. When I'm with you.\" She lifted her head, unable to worry about how the movement might jar him. He was looking at her, his eyes so large, so set. She looked down into his face, searching for something, anything she could grasp. \"Then stay with me,\" she said. \"Stay?\" \"With me. Don't die. Stay with me. Be my husband. Be a father to our child.\" She gripped the edge of the shirt that covered him, applying only the slightest pressure, but he felt it. \"If you love me, you won't die.\" \"You realize...you're better off...without me.\" \"Oh, yeah, I'm like a lottery winner,\" she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"You can't die, Vincent. I'll never forgive you if you die.\" \"Not being fair,\" he said, closing his eyes. \"You're...trying to...manipulate me.\" \"I'm a woman. That's my nature.\" \"And mine...isn't...\" \"It is, if you let it. You protected us both, you brought Charles to me. You could learn. You know, my father always said that the best thing a father could ever do for his children is love their mother. You say you love me. You can be a father to my baby.\" He flinched, turned his head away. She worried it was an emotional reaction for a second, and then remembered the terrible strain this conversation was probably causing. She pushed herself up, touching as little of him as possible. \"Vincent,\" she said, leaning down close to his ear, \"please...don't leave. I love you too, don't you know that? Haven't I ever said it?\" \"You've...said it...very clearly.\" \"Not with words.\" \"No. Better.\" He turned to her, and lifted his head, pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth. She responded, closing her eyes, giving him access to the fullness of her lips, but his strength was gone, and he lay back down, unconscious again. She extracted herself from beside him. It was time to go check on Charles. 8888888888 Fanning was only human. He remembered clearly how she'd used him and then betrayed him, left him to rot in the trunk of that car. On more rational occasions, he knew that she would have had to come back for him eventually, but what in the hell she'd been planning for that, he couldn't fathom. What did you do with a man you'd hogtied and imprisoned? You certainly didn't just cut him loose and expect everything to go on as normal. When his anger rose up like this, he found himself thinking of how he could avenge himself and his wounded pride. But those times were few and far between. Unfortunately, standing over her death bed, watching the monitors tell him how hard she was fighting to stay alive, he found himself having one right at that moment. It would be easy to kill her, he thought as he looked at her. Just pull out a tube, the one bringing air to her lungs. But then, if she didn't die fast enough, the hospital would be alerted, there would be attempts to revive her, and then he could possibly get caught, and his ass was already too close to getting fired. He wasn't even supposed to be here, really. He'd jumped the chain of command. Why in the hell had he done that? Was it for Victoria? Or was it for Vincent? Somehow, he couldn't help but admire the man. In a sick, twisted, backward way, there was really something to admire. He was always in control of any situation, no matter how crazy. He'd managed to evade everything and everyone - even on his meat-eating rampage through Los Angeles, he'd kept people from even realizing he existed. He was a walking, talking ghost. It had to take a remarkable person to be like that. And then there was Victoria. Ray had tried to date her, but it hadn't worked. She was too wounded, too emotionally unavailable. That she would do what she had done with her life for this man...there had to be something there. There had to be. Victoria wasn't a stupid person. She was very smart, although in her youth she had been careless. She wasn't careless anymore. Fanning watched the beep, beep, beep. He detected, or maybe just hoped, that it was getting weaker, fewer and farther between. Maybe by lunch, she wouldn't be pushing as hard to live. The human body could only take so much, and Vincent had shattered her. Ribs puncturing her lungs, all the bones in her hands and feed broken, a fracture in her skull they'd barely managed to keep from killing her, and then there was the damage done to her organs - methodical damage, penetrating just deep enough to be... He blinked. Vincent had wanted her to die slow. He'd known what he was doing. Sure, she would fight. But the damage would get her in the end. It was a slow, painful death. Ray shuddered. There was something to admire. But he was still a scary son of a bitch. 8888888888 People in stages of anxiety and distress have strange dreams. Dreams, if you're a Freudian, have significance, and if you aren't, they still have significance. They don't interpret the future or tell you your past. They simply give you what is inside your own head. Charles was awake when she reached him, and she took him in his carrier down to Vincent's room. She didn't have to be on shift for a solid eight hours, maybe more, considering the circumstances, and she wasn't going to leave Vincent's bedside until she was sure he was going to live. Her brain replayed her conversation with him as she watched the monitors beep out his vitals. She'd told him that if he loved her, he would live. Why had she done that? It wasn't that she wanted him to die, the thought of his death was actually unbearable. But she wanted, more than anything in the world, to keep her conscience clean. This last year, she'd managed to accomplish it. She'd never realized how dark her life had been before she'd done it, but now she couldn't bear to give up the light. She was back, doing what she was born to do. Like her instinct to help Claudia, in spite of the fact that the woman had shot her nanny and tried to kill Vincent, probably in an attempt to kill her. She just didn't want to go back to running and hiding, be outside the law. It was a bleak country she didn't wish to revisit. And if Vincent lived, if he stayed with her, if he married her and was a father to Charles...would he be able to do it? In the beginning, right around the time Charles was born, she would have a reoccurring dream about him. He would come to her home, wherever she was living, and tell her that he was back, that they could be together. And every time, she told him to go away. It was usually in a kitchen. She was preparing dinner, doing domesticated things. The house was decorated sometimes, like Christmas, Thanksgiving...dreams were fragmented, surrealistic things. And she dreamed in color. She heard that some people dreamed in black and white, but she always dreamed in color. \"I love you, Victoria,\" he would say. \"I want to be with you. I want us to start over.\" And she would say, \"How? How are we supposed to start over, Vincent? Things aren't like they used to be. I have a baby now.\" Sometimes Charles would be there in the room, sometimes he was in his own room, sometimes he was crying in the background, adding tension to the dream because she knew she had to go to him, but couldn't, because she second she left the room, she knew Vincent would disappear, and she was compelled, irresistibly, to tell him the whole truth. \"I love that boy more than anything in the world,\" she would say, sometimes with him in her face, sometimes with his back to her, across the room. \"I won't do anything to hurt him. There isn't anything in the world I would choose before him. He means more than you, more than us.\" Vincent reacted the same each time. With the sort of stunned indifference that she imagined came upon his face after he killed someone. Or maybe it was the look he'd had on his face that day with Max, when Max had called him out, made him face uncomfortable truths he didn't want to see. \"Can you accept him, Vincent? Can you be a father to him? Can you put him first? Because if you can't, you need to leave, and don't come back. Don't ever come back.\" She would always wake up from that dream with her heart racing and her eyes aching, as if she wanted to cry, but lacked the real tears. It was true, she knew, as she sat there beside Vincent's bed, blinds now drawn to keep out the afternoon sky, which was simply too bright blue and cheerful for her present mood. Charles was everything - the sun and the moon, the stars, life, breath, everything. She would do nothing, absolutely nothing, without putting him first. The fierceness of her love forced some adrenaline through her body, causing her fingers to clench the sides of the chair. Charles seemed to sense her change, and started to fuss. She pulled him out of his carrier and into her lap, where he played with tufts of her hair, the collar of her shirt, the buttons that sparkled at him. He smiled at her when she made fake sneezed into his face, loving the \"choo!\" sound. She held him close, watched Vincent's breathing as it grew stronger, steadier in his bed. His sleep was less fitful, the constant shifting from consciousness to waking finally passing. He was getting stronger. He was going to live. 8888888888 Dreams were such funny things. She always dreamed in two perspectives - she was in her dreams, and she was watching them from outside. With Charles in his carrier, chewing happily on his teething rings, she had drifted off. She was in a house. It was a huge, beautiful, grand house. It reminded her of an extremely fancy restaurant, in a way - one of those elegant old mansions that was converted for public service. It would switch, back and forth. It was round, and furnished entirely in deep cherry wood, and some kind of yellow cloth. Everything was covered in the yellow cloth, which had some kind of writing on it - it looked like Chinese writing, Kanji. It was a beautiful, golden yellow, on a material that was strong and smooth, yet soft. All the furniture was upholstered with it, and the floor was either carpeted in an identical color, or paved with it. Even the walls were papered with it. The dark cherry and golden yellow together struck her as very elegant, very tasteful, although as she moved from room to room, she found it more and more odd that the same theme should run through the entire house. She knew that most people liked to vary things from room to room. The rooms seemed to surround a huge staircase, which led up to a bright place she couldn't see. She didn't ever find the bottom of the staircase, because as she came around the curve, back to where she had started, it was a restaurant again, filled with people, eating high piles of rich Italian food. She was aware that she was supposed to meet someone here. As she walked past tables, memories flashed by her like scenes from a familiar movie, and she couldn't place them. She was supposed to meet someone, and she was late. Now she was watching herself - her dream version of herself - run through the front door and into the restaurant, going to meet whoever she was late to meet. The guy had his back to her, his arms stretched out and around two women, both beautiful, loose, cheap. As she walked closer, something wizzed past her - a guy on a scooter? - and reached the man first. He said something to him. The guy lifted his head. It was Vincent. Or at least, it looked like Vincent, but he was much younger, and his hair was long, like it had been when she'd seen him for the first time in a year. Long and brown. Immediately, she understood what was going on. In dreams, there is a set of knowledge you enter with, the rules, the plot. She was late for a date with this man. And he, in despair, had given up her arriving, and decided to throw himself to whoever would have him. Being charming, being handsome, naturally he had many takers. But now, seeing her, he extracted himself as if he'd never wanted to touch them, and came up to her. She didn't understand why he wanted her. She was so plain. The women he'd been with were glamorous, beautiful. But sure enough, he was with her, and she was apologizing for being late, and he looked guilty and relieved at the same time. He'd wanted her to come. He had wanted her there so much. He'd gone through all this trouble, and had been so upset when he thought he'd been stood up. She had no heart to be jealous of those women, or even remotely angry at him. So they sat down, and started to talk. She heard murmuring. Victoria lifted up her head, her eyes opening. Vincent was propped up slightly in his bed, his color better, his good arm moving. A nurse had come in, and had taken Charles from his carrier, sitting him on the bed beside his father, holding him up. \"He's adorable,\" the nurse was saying in a soft voice, her hand smoothing the wispy dark hair on his head. Charles was cooing contentedly, giggling as Vincent's fingers slipped in and out of his grasp. Vincent was looking at Charles with a sort of guarded wonder, but there was something in his face, a pleasure she'd never seen before. Vincent looked over at her, and he smiled. A/N: Okay, what's going on? Only 4 reviews for CHapter 15? But that was a majorly important chapter! (SIGHS HEAVILY) Okay, I understand, you have lives. I know. But come on guys, before you know it, this will all be over! I have one, MAYBE two chapters left to go before we leave Vincent and Victoria to whatever fate fanfiction leaves them. However, there are those of you who've been loyal and constant. And even if you haven't reviewed Ch. 15 yet I know you will when you can, so in the meantime: Warm Mittens: Yeah, I did the math, too, it's like 6.5 reviews for each chapter. Although Sweet Treats reviews are getting us up there. Sweet Treats: Although, ST, you need to review the STORY. Go back and READ. Heh. I'm just playing with you. But what I can say, you're 14. Man, I remember when I was 14. Or are you 15? I can't remember. Guess I'm really getting old. I'm like twice your age. I was only beginning to write when I was 14, just starting to play with the whole idea and realizing that I liked it. I wrote stories about magical horses. Seriously. THat's what kind of a dweeb I was. LunaGrrrBack023: Dont' worry, I know you're out there. And as for Claudia being brought to justice...well, depends on your definition of justice, doesn't it? Heh heh... Byrony Cel: I love your reviews: Good job, next chapter please! That is so direct. I love it. Although I loved your review for Ch. 14, about how you'd wait if those were the results. That's really nice of you to say, considering I plunked out that chapter in one night, until a very late time, and was tardy for school the next day. Actually, I wasn't tardy, I was about 10 minutes later than my usual time, but I'm such an anal wench sometimes...but it was worth it. As you saw from this chapter, Claudia really got her ass handed to her. Wicked, wicked Vincent... SweetArwen: How about this? Stop me if you've heard this one...one character is in love with another character, and they get together temporarily, but the first character realizes that the second character doesn't really love her, and that she must leave, and then the second character either chases after the first one and convinced her that he does love her, OR the first character tells the second one to go take a flying leap, or the second character just sort of goes on, and the first character is left to deal with the angst and broken heart alone, but manages. I love melancholy stuff like that. I love a story that can super depress me in just the right way. I'm so funny that way. You see Jerry McGuire? If you haven't, stop reading now, but if you have, if I had been Renee Zelweggers character, I would not have taken Tom Cruise back. Throughout the entire movie, I'm thinkig, yeah, she loves you, totally, but not only do you not love her Cruise, but you don't even deserve her. I totally didn't buy them getting back together in the end. He really needed to \"earn\" her back. It was just too neat for me. GIVE ME MORE ANGST! LOL... firegoddess164: Actually, I must say in Claudia's defense, that she didn't actually make any attempt on Charles, not directly. Sure, she shot the nanny, but she never harmed Charles himself. Sure, Vincent was there, but knowing Claudia, she probably knew Vincent would take care of things. Besides, I really don't think Claudai was trying to kill Cindy (the nanny) because if she had been trying to kill her, she would have killed her. She was just trying to screw her up. Anyway, that's okay, you go ahead and get mad, that means the story is affecting you. As you saw from my little note to SweetArwen above, I love stories that make people emotional, even me. Angry, sad, depressed, happy, all is one when it comes to being moved by a story. Okay, is that all? Let me know if I missed anything. See you guys sometime this week with the final installments! AND REMEMBER TO REVIEW!!![Chapter 17] Closure \"I've never taken any responsibility.\" They sat together, the nurse having gone. Charles was still on the bed, but Victoria had him now, sitting just in front of her, letting him explore the strange, white desert of the hospital sheets. He toyed with Vincent's fingers, and Vincent didn't withdraw them. He continued to watch his son, his face covered with that blankness she'd known a long time ago, the night he'd first wandered into her life for a very long stay. \"I still...don't feel any.\" He seemed uncomfortable with that confession. As if something inside him had woken up and told him that he should. Victoria smoothed the wrinkles out of the shirt that Charles had been wearing for the last forty-eight hours. Thankfully, his diapers were fresh. Charles turned and looked up at his mother. He gave her a little smile as she wiggled her nose at him. Whenever he looked at her, she couldn't resist making a silly face - anything to get him to smile. He didn't smile too much, although he was a quiet baby, happy, even. Occasionally, she could make him laugh. \"He has my eyes,\" Vincent muttered.\" \"Yes.\" \"When I was little, my hair was dark like that.\" \"When did it go gray?\" \"I don't remember. I think I was a teenager.\" Victoria looked at Vincent again. Her heart wrenched in her chest. She drew a breath - there wasn't any time like the present to just say it - He stopped her. Not with words. His hand reached out and landed lightly on hers. Charles' attention had switched to his teething ring again, and he was sucking away on it happily. Then, gently, his fingers curled around hers, taking her in a warm grip. \"I've missed you. This last year.\" Victoria said nothing, just waited. Vincent needed time to say what he wanted to say. Although she sensed what it was, already, she didn't want to stop him. He needed to say it himself. \"Have you missed me?\" he whispered. \"Yeah.\" It was the truth. Although she didn't understand it at times. Sure, she was in love with him. But she also knew what he was. It was a strange paradox, but love was like that. It didn't have reasons. \"I don't want to be my father,\" he said. \"Then don't.\" \"It's not that easy.\" He sighed, looked away. \"I've...I'm not...it's not me. I'm indifferent. I've always been. I like it that way.\" \"So, what have you been doing for the last year?\" Victoria said softly, eyebrow raised in just a touch of a challenge. \"Touché,\" he said. \"Not that. I've...lost my taste for it.\" She said nothing. \"I don't think it's possible for me to change,\" he said. \"But I guess I've changed anyway.\" His bright eyes met hers - no, not bright, but dark and deep, liquidly green pools. Sometimes the way he looked at her was more intense than his deepest kiss, than any intimate act he could possibly perform. She looked back, taking him in. \"I felt responsible for you,\" he said. \"I've never done that before.\" She almost chuckled. \"Well, I sort of figured that one out already,\" she said, keeping her voice low. At her chuckle, Charles turned to her, his hands reaching for her mouth. She pulled him closer, kissing his soft cheek. \"He's a part of both of us, isn't he?\" Vincent whispered. \"Yes. I think that's the reason I love him the most.\" \"You do?\" His voice got even quieter. \"Yes. Vincent, you may be indifferent, but I'm not. You do have some redeeming qualities.\" \"Some. Like.\" \"You're always honest.\" She turned her hand in his, palms meeting. \"You....\" She stopped. \"I can't put it into words, you know,\" she said. \"But you have this ability to talk to people. To charm them.\" \"Superficial.\" \"And inside,\" she went on, \"you're...real. You have compassion, you have love. They're all there...you just never knew what to do with them.\" \"I gave them to you.\" \"And Charles will, too. To everyone. Because he's loved. I love him enough for both of us.\" Vincent's eyes drifted to his son. He seemed perplexed. \"When I knew that Claudia was coming here,\" he whispered, \"all I could think of was protecting you, and him.\" He looked back at her, his face like that of a child who has just discovered something and is totally unsure of its reality. \"Is...that love?\" \"Sounds pretty good to me,\" she said, almost relieved. \"So I do love him.\" He seemed even more perplexed. \"I don't...understand that.\" \"I do.\" She squeezed his hand. \"Vincent, I love you. I love you completely and totally. But the truth is, there are things I couldn't live with.\" \"I know,\" he sighed. \"I know what they were, too.\" \"Do you...remember? Last night?\" she asked, tentatively. \"You mean nearly dying? I have a few vague memories.\" \"Do you remember what I said to you?\" \"A little.\" He looked away. \"Something about me not dying. Although it would probably have solved a lot of problems.\" \"Don't say that.\" She blinked, feeling her throat start to close. \"Don't ever say that.\" \"I was just kidding,\" he said, still deadpan. \"Sometimes that sense of humor of yours...\" \"I know.\" A pause. \"Can I tell you something?\" \"Anything.\" \"Claudia,\" he began, and then stopped. \"Is she alive?\" Victoria let out a low, hissing breath. \"Yeah, last time I checked.\" \"How?\" \"What do you mean, how? You didn't kill her.\" \"I sure as hell tried. She should have died. You must have some impressive doctors here.\" He looked at her closely as he read her face, as he could always do. \"I helped,\" she said. \"Why?\" \"Because it was the right thing to do.\" He smiled at her, his first smile throughout the entire conversation. \"You're also good enough for both of us,\" he said. \"But I still think you're nuts.\" She almost pulled her hand back, but he wouldn't let go. \"So is she going to live?\" Vincent asked. Victoria shrugged. \"She sure as hell seems to want to.\" She gave him a rather reproachful look. \"You really...really...fucked her up.\" \"I know.\" He was indifferent to it, factual. \"She deserved it.\" \"Why do I get the feeling that what she deserves doesn't have entirely to do with what she's done to me?\" Vincent looked surprised. \"You doubt my protectiveness towards you?\" She wondered if he was being facetious, but then detected the real offense just under the skin. For a man who took no responsibility for anyone, that he would do so for her was more than a compliment. \"I just remember what you told me. That you two had a past.\" \"She left me.\" \"And all either one of you have ever said about it is that she did it because she felt like it.\" Victoria hitched, almost afraid to ask. \"Did you love her?\" \"Didn't you ask me this before?\" \"Refresh my memory.\" He looked away. \"I was so young,\" he whispered. \"There were so many other things going on...we had sex. She wasn't my first, but she was the first one who stuck around. We were...friends. We understood each other, watched out for each other. I don't know, maybe in some way, I did love her. It feels so strange to say that. She's such a cold-hearted bitch.\" \"Maybe that's it, then,\" Victoria said. \"Maybe you were angry at her for dumping you.\" \"At the time, I really didn't care.\" He looked back at her. \"I guess...maybe I thought that that was how relationships were supposed to be. I know I didn't like it. I wasn't with anyone since. I mean, I was with other women, picked them up in bars, it's easy.\" He shrugged. \"But no one serious. No one who stayed with me.\" He released her hand, to reach up and gently lay his fingers against her cheek. \"You were just so different from any of them, you know? I told myself for the longest time that that was just it, you were different, of course I found you interesting. I don't know exactly when I started to love you.\" \"No one ever does know,\" she told him. \"So you don't know when you fell in love with me?\" \"Not really. Although you fascinated me, too.\" His hand went back to her, and he pulled her a little closer. \"Victoria,\" he said, \"when I leave here, what's going to happen?\" \"That's up to you,\" she said, a bit self-consciously. \"What if we left here and started over again?\" \"You mean like Mexico?\" The barely concealed dislike in her voice caught his attention. \"No, not like that. Not playing house. For real, this time. Starting over.\" \"Where?\" \"I've been living in New Mexico for a while,\" he said. \"It's beautiful out there...there's this place called Star Hill Inn, they have cabins with all the modern conveniences, except for televisions and stereos. At night you can take tours of the sky using their huge telescopes.\" She seemed bemused. \"However do you live without your jazz?\" \"That's what headphones are for,\" he said. \"But it's peaceful there.\" He hesitated. \"A good place for a honeymoon.\" \"If you're going to propose to me, Vincent,\" she said, lightly, \"you're really going to have to do better than that.\" \"I'm serious.\" \"So am I.\" \"Fine. Will you marry me, Victoria?\" He gave in too easily. She wasn't expecting it. The tiny smile in the corner of her mouth froze, then melted, as she stared at him. \"Are you crazy?\" \"According to my last psychological evaluation, yes.\" \"That's not -\" \"I'm serious, Victoria. I want to try. I want this to work.\" \"And if it doesn't?\" she asked, squirming in his grip. \"Vincent, that's a huge risk.\" \"Isn't any relationship?\" His gaze grew more intense. \"Victoria, you know one thing. You can always trust me to be honest with you.\" \"I can trust your honesty, but if we're going to do this, I want to know everything. No more bloody secrets. And no more contracts .\" \"Fair enough. But you're going to have to move to New Mexico.\" \"Doesn't bother me. I rather like the desert.\" Charles rested his head against his mother's chest, letting out a small, bored sigh. He really was a remarkably quiet child. \"So this is it?\" she said after a pause. \"Happy ever after?\" \"That only happens in the movies.\" He leaned closer to her, just a little. \"I just want to be with you. And I want to do it right this time.\" \"And you think it's going to be that easy?\" Her skepticism was pounding against her heart, fighting the hope that rose within her. \"What about Claudia? What about-\" \"Claudia,\" came a voice from the hallway, \"is no longer with us.\" Both of them looked to the intruder, to find a rather disheveled Ray Fanning standing in the doorway. \"Hey, Ray,\" Victoria said. \"How long-?\" \"Not that long,\" he said, nearly apologetically. \"But I wanted you two to know.\" \"She's...dead?\" Victoria whispered. Fanning and Vincent met eyes. \"Yeah,\" Fanning said. \"And how, exactly?\" Vincent asked. \"What do you mean? You would know better than me,\" Ray said. Victoria turned on him, scowling. \"Ray, please, tell me you didn't -\" \"Oh, I wanted to, trust me,\" Ray said. \"I thought about it. But it seems that God beat me to it.\" Vincent nearly smirked. \"Funny, I never believed in God.\" \"Well, He seems to believe in you,\" Ray said. Victoria was still looking at him, doubtful. \"I swear it, Vic. Honest to God. I didn't touch a thing.\" Slowly, she relented. \"All right, Ray. If you say so.\" \"I do. Well, I'm going to go talk to your lawyer. You two are going to have enough trouble on your hands in a few minutes.\" \"What do you mean?\" Victoria asked. \"He,\" Ray said, pointing at Vincent, \"doesn't have any insurance, does he?\" Victoria looked at Vincent. \"Do you?\" \"I was getting to it. Legitimate life just has too many details.\" \"Oh hell.\" She pulled Charles off the bed and set him snugly into his carrier. \"Well, I have some money we can use -\" \"Most likely they're going to have to discharge him the second he's safe from dying,\" Ray said. \"Looks like he's going to need a place to stay.\" \"Victoria,\" Vincent said, \"do you still have Max?\" \"Yeah, he's at home, though. God, I hope he's okay.\" \"And you're the mother of my child? God, woman...\" \"Maybe you should continue this conversation later,\" Ray said, looking down the hall. \"Here come your persecutors.\" And with a quick wink, he disappeared. 8888888888 They did continue the conversation, many times, over the next several years. But Vincent's stunted sense of responsibility and Victoria's skepticism over having a truly \"normal\" life were not enough to stop them from being happy. Because, in the end, they loved each other. And they trusted each other. Love was not enough by itself, neither one was naive enough to believe that. But as the old saying went, don't marry someone you can live with---marry someone you can't live without. Anti-climactic as it seemed, Claudia died in the hospital, from her wounds. They were simply too much, and her body gave out, as much as her spirit seemed willing to fight. Neither shed a tear for her, but both made damn sure that she was dead and buried in the ground. Victoria checked the body herself. Vincent was discharged from the hospital as soon as the wound in his gut allowed it. That was where the real damage had been done, as it made the most simple movements incredibly painful, if not impossible. He spent many weeks in Victoria's bed, not doing as he would have liked, but instead being coddled and nursed until he was ready to go insane. But in that time, he was allowed to get to know her again, and even more, to get to know Charles. Victoria turned in her resignation at the hospital. There was a big stink over her using the maternity ward as a daycare, so there wasn't much complaint, although her co-workers claimed they would miss her terribly. She wondered if any of them would even remember her first name in five years. Of course, now it was Sarah. The first night they made love, Vincent practically scared Victoria to death, as he exerted himself entirely too much for her concerns over his healed wounds. But she'd forgotten how fast he healed, and soon forgot all ability to think as the sun started to creep into their room. About a week later, the two of them packed up everything Victoria wanted in a small U-Haul (most of it was Charles' baby stuff) and left for New Mexico. Within two days, they were there, greeting the wide plain of the desert as the sun rose across it. The scary part was, it worked. They knew, somewhere deep down, that perhaps neither of them deserved the happy ending. And as it was life and not a story, there was no real \"ending,\" but there was a sense of closure with their past. It didn't hang over them, didn't shadow their days or haunt their nights. Each made their separate peace with it, although Victoria still worried, during certain times of the month, of someone from Vincent's past returning for unpleasant reasons. He had to have enemies - but none of them seemed to find them. It was a beautiful place to live. They moved into a brand new complex of homes being built - where it was, was difficult to describe because the place stretched out so wide it was hard to tell where it began and ended. Plus, there were so many smaller places that were hours apart from each other, places to go and hide, places to disappear. They lived in the complex, made of the modernized casa-style brown clay that gave the homes a prefabricated sense, and yet an elegant beauty in their high ceilings, balconies, and sweeping fans that kept the air constantly moving. After a few years, they moved farther away from the bigger city, although close enough to enjoy it when necessary. It was even tempting to move to Roswell, although Vincent really didn't want to because of the town's strange reputation. He wasn't really into the idea of aliens. Charles grew up, as happy and well-adjusted as any child. Victoria began to work for a local hospital, and gradually rose up the ranks to become the Chief Resident. Vincent took a job in security - it was something for which he was ideally suited, as the man had eyes for every crack and flaw that could be conceived. He made sure the various businesses with valuable goods to protect were well-protected. As with the fate of many in the medical profession, Victoria's time was consumed by work on various occasions throughout her life, but Vincent was a good father and a good husband, being patient with her, and cautious with his son, deferring more to Victoria's judgment until he had a more secure handle on the concept of right and wrong. Money was rarely a problem. Vincent's most expensive item was his stereo system, and Victoria made a hefty sum at the hospital, in addition to what she and Vincent already had from their \"previous life.\" It was a peaceful, rather uneventful life. Which was fine, as both of them had had quite enough excitement and adventure to last them forever. A/N: We have one more chapter to go...basically an epilogue. Because I just can't leave well enough alone.[Chapter 18] Epilogue Victoria lay spread eagle in the middle of her bed, drenched in sweat. She stared up at the ceiling, at the fans that spun around and around and around, watching with her eyes. It wasn't enough, she was hot and dripping and felt like she could have fried an egg on her stomach at that moment. Vincent came back into the room - he'd only been half-out it, and she was too exhausted to watch as he returned, naked as the day he was born. \"I think you killed me.\" He slipped back under the sheet beside her, which just barely covered her waist. He pulled it up higher, sliding it over her breasts, nipples still erect. She had turned her head to one side, exposing the curve of her neck, and he returned to it, picking up the path of gentle kisses he'd been leaving before he'd gone to turn the air conditioner up. She could feel him smiling. \"If I'd killed you, you'd know it, not just think it.\" \"Okay, I know you killed me,\" she sighed with a laugh. Her legs shifted, the ache deep between them intensifying for a second, then passing. \"My God...what got into you?\" \"I think the correct question is, what got into you ?\" She shuffled her shoulder, temporarily knocking him off his path. He chuckled, deep and dark in the back of his throat. \"You're wicked,\" she said, trying hard now not to smile. \"Absolutely wicked.\" \"Would you love me any other way?\" She brought her arm down, encircling it around his head, the soft tufts of his gray hair ticking the soft underside. She ran her fingertips against his scalp in a scratching motion. \"We'll never know, will we?\" \"Thank God.\" His hand slipped under the sheets, roaming across the plain of her stomach. \"So what was the occasion?\" she sighed, looking at him. \"What, there has to be an occasion?\" Her eye caught the slight red mark around her wrist, matched by the one on her other wrist, she was sure. She gave him a mock-stern raise of her eyebrow. \"If you did that to me all the time, I'd never be able to walk again. And neither would you.\" \"I probably would. I have amazing stamina.\" \"Tell me about it.\" She smiled at him. \"But seriously...you've been...unusually...frisky this weekend. And don't tell me it's because we're alone. It never stops you when Charles is here.\" \"That's because I lock him up in the basement.\" She let out a squawk and punched him in the chest, nearly rolling away. He laughed, heartily, and caught her, pulling her closer, slick limbs sliding against each other. \"Seriously, you don't know?\" he asked when she'd stopped struggling, too tired to even pretend. \"Well, it can't be out anniversary, because it's still two months away. And it's only nine, the big ten in next year.\" \"Today is the tenth anniversary of the first time we made love,\" he said softly, into her ear. She perked up. \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" \"How do you know that?\" \"I keep track.\" \"Wow. You're good. And I must say I mean that in more than one way.\" \"Hmm...how many ways, exactly?\" \"Don't push it, Mr. Whitman.\" \"Ah, but it's so fun, Mrs. Whitman.\" \"That's Dr. Whitman,\" she corrected. Then she sighed. \"I have to be there early tonight, though.\" He let out a soft groan. \"I hate it when you have to cover the evening shift.\" \"I know, but it doesn't happen often. Few times a year at the most.\" \"This is the third time this year.\" \"You have a head like a digital calendar.\" \"Hmm.\" He resumed kissing her neck. She lost herself in it for a few minutes, relishing the smell of him, the feel of him, wanting for a moment to rub him all over her, but exhaustion prevented it. \"Ten years,\" she whispered. \"That's amazing.\" \"It'll be even more amazing when it's twenty.\" \"You plan on sticking around that long?\" He stopped kissing her, gently turned her face so their eyes met. \"Absolutely.\" \"I must really be something, to make you change your ways.\" \"You are.\" He kissed her on the mouth, gave her another wicked look. \"Up for one more round?\" \"Oh hell, Vincent, I won't be able to walk.\" But she was laughing as she collapsed back onto the bed. \"I was actually kidding,\" he said. \"You and your bizarre sense of humor.\" She rolled over, reaching for the clock, which was temporarily covered by a thrown piece of clothing. She noticed with some embarrassment that it was her underwear. A pair of soft, pink lacy things Vincent had bought her a few years ago for Christmas. The clock blazed \"4:00 P.M.\" \"I have to shower,\" she sighed, slowly pulling herself upright. \"Sounds fun. I'll join you.\" 8888888888 They had talked, on various occasions, about the change. It wasn't that Vincent had become a different person - his name was different, his occupation was different, sure, all of that was different, but inside, he was still Vincent. Even though, in mixed company, Victoria called him \"Richard\" and he called her \"Sarah,\" it was only a name. Eventually, it would be explained to Charles, but that could wait. Max hadn't been the first person to hear Vincent's speech about \"ten years from now, ten minutes from now.\" Playing it safe wasn't in his vocabulary, and it still wasn't. Sure, he was extremely careful for Victoria and Charles' sake, but knowing that at any time, something could come around the corner...that he always had to keep one eye out... maybe that would have driven other people nuts. It kept Vincent sane. Wrapped in his robe, he kissed her goodbye and watched her get into her car. It was a little bit of a drive to the hospital and she had to leave before the sun went too far down. Of course, it was going to be a full moon that night, and there would be plenty of light. With the wide open stretches of desert, there wasn't much to see, but it could get very, very dark on moonless nights. It made looking at the stars easier. Vincent hadn't realized what an affinity he had for gazing at the stars. He'd bought a telescope and installed it on the balcony of their bedroom a few years ago, after finally doing all the research and discovering what was the best quality for the best price, as well as easy enough for someone like him to use. That's us. Lost in space . A car pulled up in the driveway just as the horizon had turned golden and pink from the last rays of the sun. Vincent had showered and dressed in a simple white T-shirt and jeans, and came to the front door to welcome his son home. Charles was looking more and more like his father every day, with dark hair instead of gray, and a considerably smaller nose. He also had Victoria's chin, which offset his smile, with was all his father. Vincent made a mental note to get the boy braces before his teeth could become off-center like his dad's. He'd thank him later, Vincent was sure. \"Dad!\" the nine year old called as Vincent opened the door. He was waving a giant hand with one finger extended. The overnight trip had been to go see a baseball game, Vincent had a terrible head for the names of teams anymore, except when it came to hockey. He had yet to take Charles to a hockey game. It was a difficult concept for a desert-grown boy to grasp, but that would probably only make it all the more fascinating. \"They won!\" Charles was saying, his cheeks glowing. \"They won!\" \"That's great!\" Vincent politely waved to the family that was pulling away. Jamie, that was the name of the boy Charles hung out with quite a bit. The family was big into sports, and the father, Roy, had all kinds of connections to get tickets. Charles was going to turn into a sports nut soon. Vincent made another mental note to start reading the sports section of the newspaper. The boy hugged him. Being a father had taken some getting used to. Victoria had patiently taken care of the messier duties, like diapers, but a boy needed a role model. While Vincent hesitated, he found that letting his polite nature take front seat and not pulling it back was not entirely effective. He had to get personal, like he got personal with Victoria. Not an easy thing. But he was lucky with Charles. He was precocious and sensitive, incredibly bright, the kind of child every parent dreams of having. Vincent credited it all to Victoria and her brilliance, as well as her patient nature, but discovered his own little quirks showing up in the boy's mannerisms. The twitch when he was uncomfortable. The precision with which he could throw a ball, as if shooting at a target. His respect for people who could play music, even his interest in listening to his father's jazz CD's, and remembering the names. He was even starting to develop an ear, and every now and again Vincent would offer him a five or ten spot to correctly name the artist. Victoria disapproved, but Charles was careful to put his money away. \"What are we going to do for dinner?\" Vincent asked as he took Charles' bag and starting throwing the laundry into the hamper. One responsibility of domestic life he didn't quite appreciate was laundry, but with Victoria's schedule, which was a little more erratic than his, it was his job, nine weeks out of ten. There were a few books a the bottom, and a sheet of math problems, none of them done. \"What's this?\" \"Oh, crap,\" Charles muttered. He grabbed the sheet and climbed up onto one of the kitchen stools by the lunch counter. He grabbed a pencil and got to work. \"Sorry, Dad. I think I forgot.\" \"No, you did forget.\" Vincent hung up the bag on a hook - he hated the smell of backpacks, there was such a mustiness to them, like old moldy crayons. He grabbed a can of Lysol and sprayed the inside. \"It's cool, Dad, I know all the multiplications. I'll be done in a sec.\" He scribbled across the page, his numbers not quite neat, but correct. \"Guess I'll have to make the mac and cheese alone then,\" Vincent said, reaching up into the counter. \"We had mac and cheese last night,\" Charles said. \"Didn't Mom buy one of those dinners in a box thing?\" Vincent dug a little deeper into the cabinet. Victoria was good with the shopping, that was sure - there was a Betty Crocker Cheesy Ham and Potato Bake, everything inside the box. \"Here we go.\" \"Let's go with that.\" \"It's still cheese,\" Vincent pointed out. \"Yeah, but it's potatoes and ham,\" Charles said. He finished a row of problems, then chewed on the pencil. \"Where's Mom?\" \"She had to work this evening.\" \"I thought she was the Chief or something.\" \"She's the Chief Resident,\" Vincent corrected, suppressing a chuckle. \"That doesn't mean she doesn't get the crap shift every now and again.\" Vincent put the dinner together quickly, not too thrilled with the oozy consistency of the cheese sauce in which the ham resided, and put it into the oven. It would take a half hour to bake. \"So what do we do in the meantime?\" he said. \"Could we shoot some baskets?\" Charles asked, finishing with the math sheet. \"Baskets?\" Vincent vaguely remembered Charles talking them into installing that thing above the garage. He hadn't played basketball himself since he was Charles' age. \"I don't know, it's been a while for me.\" \"That's okay, Dad, it'll be fair. You're taller than me.\" \"I don't know, your jump is pretty scary when you're reaching for the chips on the top of the fridge.\" Vincent set the kitchen timer and turned on the outside lights, while Charles went to his room to get his basketball. 8888888888 Victoria pulled into her assigned space, grabbed her dinner, which was a sandwich she'd picked up on the way there, and headed inside the hospital. She was greeted by various nurses, most of whom gave her respectful nods as they passed her in the halls. She took the elevator and arrived at her office in time to field a few questions from the interns, then went down to talk to the newly arriving medical students, who were getting ready to finish their last years in school. She would have her pick of the crop - she was rather excited, as it was her first time. The shift passed without event. Life was nice and quiet out in the desert. The most she ever really had to deal with was car accidents, which could be quite ugly, and during fire season, it was a circus. There were times, however, that they would be shipped patients for various reasons. Victoria took a certain amount of pride in the fact that Dr. Sarah Lancing Whitman's hospital was rather well known for its keen surgeons. She finished at about three in the morning, managing to escape a half-hour early because the graveyard shift doctor had come in early and repaid her earlier kindness of covering for him a few weeks back. She considered getting a burger on her way back home, but knew that she wasn't getting any younger. Sure, she was forty-five, but she had to take better care of herself if she wanted her future years to be of high quality. It was a shame that whatever it was in life that made you want to keep living it, you had to give up in order to do that living right. Then she remembered the afternoon with Vincent and she smiled. She was pretty lucky. He was dozing lightly when she came in. He slept longer and longer over the years. Whenever she worried that she was taming him, he was quick to show her that she was wrong. He was already talking about taking Charles down to a shooting range and starting to show him how to take care of a gun. She was sure she was going to be as gray as him by the time she turned fifty. Then again, his job in security was a bit more than he let on, sometimes. There were occasions when even the local police requested their help in certain matters. Vincent had related to her that he wasn't the only ex-military, special-ops, retired assassin that was working in his office. In a wide open place like New Mexico, where government secrets were buried everywhere you stepped, security was not a job for rent-a-cops. But all in all, it was nine to five. Which gave him a chance to practice his fathering skills. Victoria knew he'd been abused. She had worried, for a long time, that the cycle would continue. To her amazement and relief, Vincent seemed to put effort into going into the opposite direction. In fact, he deferred most matters of discipline to her. He rarely had to step in, and if he did, Charles was very quick to discover the error of his ways. The mere fact that he had never faced his father's wrath seemed to be enough to scare him away from ever wanting to see it. Victoria had seen it. Charles was a smart kid. So Vincent, for the most part, got to be the fun parent. That was ironic, if thought about long enough. Oh well...Victoria was all right with that. It seemed to work. Charles loved her, doted on her all the more because he was keenly aware of how much his father did the same. She shrugged off her clothes in the walk-in closet, taking care not to wake Vincent, even though it was practically inevitable. Her nightgown, a pale blue thing that Vincent had bought during their first years out here, a personal favorite of hers that showed its ten years of wear, hung on its hook. Sometimes she wondered if Vincent had enough to do...he seemed to be rather meticulous about keeping the house neat. She glided through the dark, the bright moon casing shadows of the cactus plants on the lawn outside the window, and made her way over to her side of the bed. She didn't bother with the cover - she was too tired. As soon as her head hit the pillow, she was asleep. She was awoken by the soft shaking of her arm, and looked up to see Charles gazing down at her. \"Mommy, I'm leaving for school. Jamie's dad is here to pick me up.\" Victoria lazily stretched out her arms to encircle her son. Maybe she should have been a little more insistent about having another baby...but why push her luck? \"Did you have a good time this weekend, sweetie?\" \"Yeah, lots.\" He smiled at her. \"You gonna be home tonight?\" \"Yeah, baby, I don't go back to work until tomorrow morning.\" \"Good.\" He kissed her, the dutiful son's kiss on the lips, and she ruffled his hair. \"Mo-om!\" Charles said, \"Dad just gelled it!\" Victoria pulled her hand away, slightly sticky. \"Sorry, baby,\" she said, rolling over onto her back. \"Get your comb and I'll fix it before you go.\" He raced to get the comb, and Victoria pulled herself upright. He returned, attempting to right the damage himself, but she quickly put the spiky locks back into their upright positions. She kissed his cheek and slapped the comb down on her beside table. \"Okay, see you after school.\" As Charles ran out, she heard him exchange his goodbye with Vincent, and the front door closed a few minutes later. Vincent came into the bedroom, in a white button down shirt and a pair of black slacks. \"Going to work?\" she asked, rolling the covers over her legs. \"In a bit.\" He sat down on the foot of the bed, facing her. He handed her a warm mug, filled with coffee. She sipped it, nodding her head appreciatively. \"It's that Illo stuff from California, isn't it?\" she said. \"Something like that.\" \"Only coffee I can drink with only one sugar and a spoonful of cream.\" \"Last night go okay?\" \"Yeah, it was quiet. Makes me dread the heavy times, though.\" \"Please, you live for that stuff.\" \"I don't live for people getting hurt,\" she correct him. \"I live to help people.\" He smiled at her. \"Well, you helped me.\" She gazed at him. \"I'm wondering, Mr. Whitman,\" she said, \"if you know how lucky you really are.\" He chuckled, starting his wide smile. \"Luckier than I deserve,\" he admitted. \"So you repent of your former life?\" \"How can I?\" he said. \"Without it, I would never have met you.\" She leaned back, setting her coffee aside. \"I'm still tired,\" she muttered, wiping her eyes. He moved up closer to her, one arm around her shoulders. She rested her head against his chest, and her wedding ring caught the light. She was lucky, too, she knew. Few people in the world ever truly found solace. And from there, they could go wherever they wanted. As any man, woman and child, they had their own choices to make, their own paths to follow. But the important part is, they were given the chance to choose those paths. Which was really more than either of them had ever expected from their lives, in the end. A/N: So, here I was, all set to end this duology and let Vincent and Victoria go on their merry little ways...and then last night I had a very intense dream about Collateral, and had to go see the movie today. Which is now playing at the cheap theaters, so I only paid three bucks to get in, ching! LOL...anyway, so I'm sitting there, and thoughts start going through my head. Thoughts like.... What if Vincent had jumped on the wrong train? Remember, he had two trains to choose from. What if he'd jumped on the wrong one? And what if Victoria was a passenger on the wrong train? Or...what if, in this story-theme, Max and Annie went on a vacation to New Mexico and broke down in the middle of the desert, and it was Vincent and Victoria who wound up coming to the rescue? Don't worry, I don't plan to go on forever with this. You just may be seeing a few one-shots from me in the future. :) Take care, everyone!

The music had gone silent and she'd already turned off the lights. She preferred it when it was a little darker; it allowed her eyes some rest. The buzz from the evening's customers still rang in her ears and she enjoyed the silence; it was bliss. The neon lights from the street played in purple and blue across her face. Only a small lamp was shining at the counter, and to her left a ray of light fell in through the crack between the kitchen door and its frame, where the door was left a little open. Sarah was counting the register before closing up. The night had been busy, and she was dying to get back home to her bed, to sink down into white, cool sheets with a beer and a little TV before sleep. It was already eleven p.m. and she still had some cleaning up to do. Just as she pushed at the door to the kitchen, she heard the entrance door open, the small crack as its hinges moved, the slight rush of air and the increased noise from the traffic outside. Sarah froze, realizing she hadn't locked the door yet. But, to be honest, there were still a couple of minutes left before closing time. Sighing, she turned around to face her last customer. The put-on smile on her face became somewhat strained as she looked at the man who approached her. He appeared to be in his fifties or sixties, with his silver-grey beard and hair, but his controlled and exact moves betrayed him, he could be no older than forty at most. Sarah felt a shiver run down her spine. She couldn't tell why, but his presence in the room didn't feel good. And he hadn't even looked at her yet! Instead, his eyes were constantly roaming the room. She cleared her throat. \"May I help you?\" Please say no, please say no. Just ask for directions and be on your way. You don't need a coffee. Right? - Denny's Coffee House, just before eleven p.m. He looked at the watch and then up and down the street again. No one was in sight. No one would see him enter. The target was in place. Three clean shots; two in the sternum, one in the head, then work would be done for tonight. After, he'd find a decent hotel close to the airport. There were no more flights out that night, but he planned to spend an hour in the hotel bar, and then enjoy a good night's sleep. He checked the watch on his wrist again and began to cross the street. Two minutes before closing time. No customers. Perfect. His mind cleared of stray thoughts. His eyes focused on the target; he could see the shape of it moving inside, behind the bar. The lights inside were down. How very convenient . A small noise from a nearby alley caught his attention, and his arm froze midway as he listened, trying to locate its source. He relaxed when he saw a cat exit the alley and run off in the opposite direction. Pushing at the heavy glass door, he entered. He already knew where the target was located. He didn't need to look at it. Instead he looked around the room, noticed where the back door was, how the chairs and tables were arranged, listened for any sound that could indicate the presence of another person. All the time he kept track of the target in the corner of his eye. Everything was as it should be. He was ready. - His head snapped in her direction at the sound of her voice, and she inhaled sharply as she met his eyes, the intensity with which he studied her was breathtaking. The moment ended and he smiled. It was a small smile that never reached his eyes. He licked his lower lip with the tip of his tongue, looked once more back at the entrance and approached her. Sarah's feelings of uneasiness intensified. She moved a little closer to the kitchen door, stretching out a hand to let the tips of her fingers touch it. She wasn't sure what it was, but there was something about this man, something dangerous and, at the same time something vaguely familiar. She couldn't put the pieces together. As his eyes locked with hers all the alarms in her body went off, and the only thing she wanted to do was run. Just run until she couldn't get further, until she was safe. \"Matter of fact you can.\" Then everything happened fast. Within a blink of the eye, the man had produced a gun, pointed the barrel at her face and a 'poff' was heard. Sarah had dropped behind the counter at the same time as he'd moved and now she dove through the half open door to the left of her and threw herself at it from the other side. Frantically she fumbled with the locking mechanism, her shaking hands unwilling to obey at first. The shockwave from the shot reverberated through her body, as she scrambled as far away from the door as she could. Flinching when the door's handle was pressed down, she squeezed her eyes shut and prayed. Go away, go away, OhGodPleasegoaway! Hot tears burned on the inside of her eyelids, and she swallowed, trying to get her breathing back under control. Hiding under the bench in the corner, where she had pushed the garbage bin aside, she hugged her knees and tried to make herself disappear into the wall. There was nowhere she could go; the tiny kitchen didn't have any other exit as the emergency exit had been temporarily blocked a couple of weeks before due to a construction site in the adjacent building. \"Open the door.\" His voice sounded calm and controlled, like he had all the time in the world. There was something about his voice; it was smooth and mild, just a little raspy, almost likeable. \"No fucking way! I've called the cops. You're not getting anything, they'll be here any minute!\" she shouted back at the door, praying that he'd leave. \"No phone in there, Sarah.\" She froze, suddenly feeling an urge to throw up. This was not just a robbery attempt. He knows my name! How does he know that? I'm not wearing a name badge! What the fuck was going on? And it was true that she didn't have a phone in the small space where they prepared the little food, mainly sandwiches and salads, they served. Sarah's whole body went numb with fear, as she began to realize he had come… for me… Suddenly, two muffled bangs sounded and the wood around the lock flew through the room. Sarah crawled further into the corner where she was hiding. The door flew open, and the man came into her vision once more. He held his stance almost like a dancer, quickly searching the room and immediately finding her huddled in the corner. With the gun aimed steadily at her, he slowly advanced, eyebrows raised and a hint of a smile playing at the corner of his mouth. \"Playing a little hide and seek, are we?\" She could see his finger about to squeeze the trigger and suddenly it struck her. \"V-Vincent…?\" He froze, the barrel of the gun still directed at her. His intense eyes focused on her, narrowing, like he was reading her. \"How do you know my name?\" Sarah swallowed. Unexpectedly, she had gained some time. Let's see what she could make out of it. \"I'm Sa-\" Her voice hitched in her throat, \"Sarah James. You-you already know my name…\" He frowned slightly and nodded. \"We grew up on the same street. I'm Simon's little sister.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Coffee For Two The gun swayed slightly, but he didn't lower it. Instead he stepped closer, nailing her with his gaze. \"Don't know any Simon.\" Her heart sank. She was running out of time. Her eyes were glued to his finger, which never left the trigger. All it would take was a twitch of that finger. \"Yes, you do!\" She talked fast, with a feeling that if she didn't say this quick enough, her moment would be gone. \"You two hung out when you lived in our street. You know. You were seventeen, I think... Simon...\" Her voice had a slight begging undertone now. \"Tall, dark hair, thin, you were always together…\" Please? \"S-\" He shook his head, barely visible. \"Simon?\" It was more of a statement than a question. \"You're Sarah?\" He cocked his head and lowered his gun, letting it hang by his side. \"I remember you. Skinny little girl.\" Sarah really didn't want to get into the past. Skinny! Well, there was more than that to remember. Skinny… huh! He hadn't been a sight for Gods either. Well, he had. Not at first… but later. \"Why are you here? With a gun? Pointed at me?\" \"It's not pointed at you.\" \"Well, you know what I mean!\" \"Hired for a job.\" \"A what?!\" Sarah felt the blood rush from her head, making it spin, and her cheeks paled significantly. \"A job? What job? This is insane. What are you?\" she breathed. Her nostrils flared with the effort to draw in enough air to support her brain functions and prevent her from passing out. \"Well, obviously you pissed off the wrong people at some point in your life, Sarah.\" He offered her his hand to help her up from the floor. Sarah took it, and couldn't help but notice that it was warm, dry and strong. As she got on her feet, she quickly pulled her hand out of his grip and brushed off some invisible dirt from her black skirt. Sarah bit her lower lip and looked up at him. He crowded her in the small space, making her feel cornered. Intimidated. \"Are you going to kill me?\" she asked, still trembling visibly, wishing he would take a step back so she could breathe, or get on with it and put her out of this misery. She felt lightheaded, not knowing how long she could last, standing like this. Vincent noticed her hyperventilating. \"You feel stressed?\" \"St-stressed?\" she stuttered, almost breaking out into a nervous giggle. \"Yes, I am stressed. I'm scared to death!\" \"Good, might not have to use this then,\" Vincent said and waved the gun. Sarah just kept looking wild-eyed at him, almost hypnotized by the big gun in his hand. \"Come on,\" he said, and laid one hand on her shoulder for support. \"Just breathe. In and out, in and out, relax.\" She tried to obey and took long slow shaky breaths, trying to gain some control over her body. His hand lay heavy on her shoulder, and the warmth from it radiated through her thin white blouse. \"Please, Vincent, please don't kill me!\" Hot tears started to trickle down her cheeks and her voice became thick with emotion. \"I don't even understand why you're here. There can't be anyone who'd want to hurt me!\" Vincent lifted his hand from her shoulder to her face, and caught one of her tears with the back of his crooked index finger. The trail from his touch left a burning mark on her skin. He rolled his index finger against his thumb, as if touching the tear. \"I'd say there is, Sarah. People don't hire me to baby-sit.\" In spite of her fear and the absurdity of the situation, she had to smile. \"I can believe that!\" He sighed and tucked the gun away somewhere by his waist, under the dark grey suit jacket. \"Make us some coffee?\" She nodded. Sure, she could definitely use some herself. Or preferably, something stronger. Hell, wish I had some… NO, left that behind! Not going down that road again. Sarah's hands trembled as she prepared the coffee machine, putting coffee in the holder and skimming some milk for two lattes. She had been doing the same throughout the entire evening. It was a simple thing, to continue what she was so used to; no need to think. Still, she almost missed when the steam pressure rose, and just barely remembered to turn the tap to ´on´ so the water could flow. She carefully avoided any thoughts on her current situation. Pictures of the gun, pointed at her face, flashed before her mind, but pushing them out of her head, she concentrated hard on making coffee instead. He had let her go, finally, and retreated out to the bigger room. Seemingly not paying her any attention, he wandered around, checking out the photos in black and white on the walls. He also read some of the short notes the customers were allowed to write to each other or to no one in particular, and that were stuck on the walls here and there. While filling two large glasses with the caramel-brown liquid, she kept an eye on Vincent. He seemed to be constantly checking out his surroundings, glancing out the windows at the front, checking back at the rear entrance, and the door to the toilets. Sarah lifted the glasses but had to set them back down again, before the scalding hot content spilled all over her hands. She still shook too much. Inhaling deep and then exhaling slowly, she gave it another try and noticed to her satisfaction that she managed it better this time. - Sarah. Yeah, he remembered her. She had been a kid last time he saw her. Eight, nine, maybe ten years old. Skinny little thing, short blonde hair, haunted eyes. She'd always wanted to hang with him and her brother. He couldn't remember, but thinking back on it, he didn't really recall any little girlfriends of hers. Well, if she'd been lonely it hadn't been his problem. He snorted silently as he thought of the little street with the small, white, wooden houses, their little white fences, and all the little white people. Happy Street in Pleasantville. Or whatever the fuck it had been. The family there had been nice, not that it mattered; he had been out of reach even before he got there the first time. He was used to hell, expected hell. Kindness wasn't an option, couldn't count on it to last. So he didn't bother. He and Simon had had some good times, though. They'd had the same outlook on life. Grand plans. How to get the fuck out of there. Goals. How to make money. Big money. Wonder what happened to him? His thoughts strayed back to the present situation. Sarah. Still skinny. Still scared. Same haunted eyes. Did anything ever change? - Vincent spun around when she came closer, almost scaring her into dropping the glasses again. Trembling out of control, she was burned as the hot liquid spilled over her hands, and sat the glasses down harder on the table than she had intended. \"Ow, shit!\" she burst out. \"No-one would believe you get paid to do this,\" Vincent snickered. Blowing at her fingers, she snapped back before thinking. \"Well, my customers normally don't wave a gun in my face.\" She immediately regretted her words, scared they'd make him angry. But he seemed indifferent. They stood at each side of the small table and stared at each other. Sarah was struck by how good looking he was. He was prematurely grey, but his features were well preserved. He gave the impression of someone who was at ease with himself. And with that suit that looked like it had been poured on him… he looked flawless. She thought of her own appearance and was reminded she hadn't been as lucky. How can he be so calm? That scared her, almost more than the gun. \"Sit down, Sarah.\" Slowly, she pulled out the chair and sat on the edge of the seat. Not wanting to relax, not able to relax. Vincent also sat and took a sip of his hot coffee, his eyes never leaving hers. \"Vincent… what happened?\" No, that came out wrong! Why are you here? Can I please go now? I don't want you to be here. Or maybe I would have wanted that… But not now, not knowing that the next time I got to see you would be when you came to kill me! \"What do you mean?\" He looked coolly at her, not showing any emotion or any compassion. Sarah's fear came rolling back; her mouth suddenly got very dry, and she felt like she was being suffocated. She had never liked narrow spaces and this situation was beginning to feel claustrophobic. Her inner turmoil turned into a suppressed panic. \"I need to get out of here,\" she whispered. \"Can I please go now? Can I-…\" \"No. You cannot.\" His voice left no room for misunderstanding. Her heart felt like it was going to burst out through her chest. It was beating wildly as she tried to assess her options. He is going to kill me. He could have let me go. But he can't. What game is he playing? Why are we having coffee? Remembering the front door was still unlocked, she tried to count the steps from the chair to the door. Seven normal, perhaps. Three leaps. She could do it. She could make a run for it. Out on the street it would only be a few meters before she would reach the boulevard. There she'd be safe with the people around; someone would have to help her. Vincent asked something, but she didn't hear it. Sarah jumped in her seat when he leaned over and gripped her wrist, not painfully tight, just enough to get her attention. \"… happened to your brother?\" She looked at him like he had just arrived from outer space. Here he was, threatening her very existence in one moment, and in the next he wanted to chit-chat! She cleared her throat and slowly released her arm from his burning grip. \"He-e…\" Raising so sudden her chair tipped over, she jumped for the door. In the corner of her eye, she saw Vincent as a blur of movement, and then heard a crash as the table flew to the side, sending the glasses to the floor. Not until she reached the door did she realize it opened inwards, and that she didn't have enough time. With panicky movements, she tried to pull the door open, but was interrupted by a hard body that flew through the air and came crashing into her, smashing her against the door. Her head and shoulder took the greater impact before she fell to the floor with Vincent on top of her. He grabbed her by the collar of her blouse and shook her. She could feel the cold, hard metal from his gun, pressing at her temple. Squeezing her eyes shut, she didn't dare to open them. He was no doubt furious, and she would now die. \"Very stupid move, Sarah James.\" Her eyes flew open with surprise. He sounded so calm! With the lights from the street playing across his face, she could now see his intense green eyes staring down at her. Measuring her. His upper lips curled, baring his teeth, and his eyes narrowed. At that very moment, a brief flash of insanity seemed to pour through his gaze, then it turned back to its normal cold stare. \"Do something like that again, and you will be dead. Don't try me.\" The last thing said between clenched teeth. What does it matter? You'll kill me anyway! That's what you came to do. Why do you want to talk? But all that came out was a nod. And a sigh of relief as his gun was tucked away. Vincent stood and gave her his hand to help her up. Sarah didn't take it, though. Shuffling her limbs together, she pushed her aching body up from the floor. Touching her tender forehead, she realized there'd be a bruise. As Vincent's hand came up to touch her face, she flinched but tried to stay still. With the tip of his right index finger, he traced the outline of the ugly scar that was forever etched there, where the whole world could see it. His finger, surprisingly gently, caressed it from her forehead, past her right eyebrow, just brushing her eyelashes, which made her blink involuntarily, and then down along her cheek until it ended right above her jaw line. Sarah's heart pounded. She felt uneasy, undergoing this examination. The urge to turn her head away was strong, but she didn't dare. \"Life has not been good to you,\" he concluded. The unexpected gentleness of his voice made her heart crumble, and she burst into tears. \"Shh, shh,\" he hushed, and lay his arms around her. She stiffened and didn't move at first. The awkwardness with which he held her made it obvious this was an unusual position for him as well. Hesitantly, Sarah laid her cheek to rest at his muscular shoulder. Even through the shoulder pad of his suit jacket she could tell he was a well built man, and she chastised herself for even noticing. They just stood there, unmoving, for a few moments and then he let go. Looking over his shoulder at the mess in the room behind them, then back at her, he uttered probably the last words she would have expected to hear in that moment. \"Do you like jazz?\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Inquiries \"What?\" She almost laughed, but stopped herself. She didn't want to provoke him. \"Can't stay here, can we? And you look like you could use something stronger than coffee anyway.\" Read my mind… \"Yes.\" She cleared her throat. \"As a matter of fact I do like jazz.\" She was rewarded with the most beautiful smile. This time it reached his eyes and his whole face transformed. The fine lines around his eyes turned into wrinkles from a life of laughter. She couldn't believe what she saw. Suddenly, a good memory came back, and with it the long forgotten butterflies in her stomach. - She'd been nine and he'd been seventeen, one year older than her brother, and they'd both adored him. This was the second time he'd lived with the Parsons, two houses down from theirs. First time around had been two years earlier. He had been more of a child then. They'd been building secret tree houses in the woods, playing hide and seek and carving messages into the trees. Vincent had shown them how to catch rabbits and, to her despair… how to kill them. They'd had one everlasting summer of fun before school had started that fall, and he'd gone back to his family again; at least that was what she'd known at the time. Later she'd learned it had been only him and his father. At fifteen his face had been full of acne and he'd been shy and a bit clumsy. When he'd come back at seventeen, he'd been devastatingly handsome and had transformed into a man, a much darker version of his previous self; his appearance less playful, but more intense, and exciting. And Sarah had fallen hopelessly in love. He'd been kind with her and given her sweets on occasions. Sometimes he would lift her up and tickle her, and she would get feelings she hadn't yet had the vocabulary to describe. Most of the time though, he and Simon would disappear and be gone for hours and hours. Sometimes they hadn't come back until the next morning. She hadn't known what they'd been doing, but judging from her parents' reactions, it couldn't be good. And oh, how she wished she had been older and accepted as one of them. One night, she'd awoken to the sound of their voices in the garden. In her pajamas, she'd climbed out her window, over the roof and down along the fire escape. The last few feet however, had no steps and she hadn't dared to jump. Vincent had discovered her, and instead of getting angry with her for sneaking up on them, he'd taken her in his arms and lifted her to the ground. She'd already been shivering from the cold night air, so he'd offered her his leather jacket, pilot style, and wrapped it tightly around her. Sarah had been sitting there in the night, with her legs pulled up underneath her, surrounded by the warm scent of Vincent. She'd tried to listen to what they were talking about, but the late night hour soon caught the better of her, and she'd fallen asleep, trustingly leaning against his shoulder. A year later he'd turned eighteen, and had been gone, just as suddenly as he had appeared in their lives. She'd never seen him again. Until tonight. - \"I know a good place a few blocks from here. We can even walk there. But Sarah…\" He turned serious again, \"Don't pull any stunts. Don't try to get away, and don't attract anybody's attention. Not out in the street and not in the club. I'm sure you don't want innocent people's lives on your conscience.\" Once more, her heart sank and turned into a lump of granite. Would this rollercoaster of pain never end? Just as she thought they were on friendly terms, he again transformed into the cold killer. With her face blank, she nodded obediently. \"I won't.\" Vincent looked around the room, at the fallen chairs and table, the shattered glass and the coffee on the floor, then over at the holes in the kitchen door. \"We need to clean this place up before we leave. Can't leave it like this. There will be people here tomorrow again, right?\" I'll be here tomorrow, to open it up. Or won't I, Vincent? She blinked rapidly, trying not to show the tears that threatened to form in her eyes. \"Yes,\" she said numbly. \"Start with this room. I'll take care of the door.\" While Sarah mopped the floor and restored the order in the small café, Vincent unhinged the heavy door to the kitchen and placed it next to the front door. After they were done, he inspected their work. Sarah looked around too; apart from the missing kitchen door, there was no trace of the horror, the fighting, and the tears. It looked just like any other night after closing time. Deceptively normal. They left and Sarah locked up. Vincent carried the damaged door with him, and dumped it in a trash bin in a nearby alley. It was bliss to be out in the fresh air. She couldn't get enough of the freedom. She didn't think she could ever set foot in the coffee shop again. The feeling only lasted for a couple of minutes though; then Vincent put his arm around her waist. \"Relax,\" he whispered in her ear. \"Behave, and you'll be fine.\" \"Liar,\" she whispered to herself. She hadn't intended it to be heard, but he chuckled low at her response. \"You think I am, little Sarah?\" \"I'm not little!\" He squeezed her waist harder. \"No, you aren't, are you?\" His grip made her skin tingle and her breath hitch in her chest; she didn't want to feel that! She didn't want to remember the young Vincent, the man she'd had such a hopeless crush on when she was a mere child. This wasn't him! And she sure wasn't that girl any more! Still, he smelled the same, sounded the same, and she could even sense a hint of that dry humor of his. Sarah licked her lips and tried to get a grip. Here she was, walking to some jazz club with a man she didn't know any longer… a man who had threatened her with a gun less than an hour ago. This is not good! Who is he and what does he want with me? Why did he come to kill me to begin with? \"Vincent-\" She hesitated. \"Why did you come to the coffee shop?\" \"You know why.\" She shook her head repeatedly. \"No! I don't! I haven't done anything to you, or to anyone else. Why do you want me dead? Surely there must be a mistake?\" \"Don't want you dead'\" \"Who does then?\" She had raised her voice in frustration. \"Keep your voice down, Sarah,\" Vincent replied coolly. \"Who does?\" she moaned. She was losing it. They were out on the street, a boulevard, with people, trees, and cars. Still she felt trapped, as if she was still caught in that small kitchen space with him towering her. \"I never meet my clients and I never ask questions. Once the contract is on, it's unstoppable. Risk management.\" \"What?\" she whined, \"What are you, Vincent? What has become of you? Are you some kind of hitman?\" \"You wanna call it that – sure. People pay me lots of money to get rid of their problems.\" \"Problems…\" she whispered. \"How did this happen? I remember you, you were so nice.\" Vincent looked somewhat irritated. \"I think your remembrance is colored by your emotions from that time.\" Sarah felt like he had hit her. \"What?!\" He looked at her with an unreadable expression on his face. His dark green eyes flashed. \"As I recall, you blushed every time I got near, and you always seemed to be at my feet whenever I looked down.\" She hated him at that moment. Hated how he, in a few words, had turned a beautiful memory into something filthy. Yanking, she tried to free herself from his grip, with the only result being that he held her tighter. His fingers dug deep and painfully in the skin of her waist. Their actions had made her blouse slide out of the lining of her skirt, and his fingers now burned into her bare skin. \"Don't!\" he snarled, looking up and down the street. \"We're almost there. Get yourself in order, you look like shit.\" \"Well, thank you very much,\" she sneered. With unsteady hands, Sarah combed her fingers through her hair, and almost jumped out of her skin as Vincent tucked some strands of hair behind her ear. She gently rubbed underneath her eyes to remove possible residues of mascara and tucked her blouse back into the skirt. When she was done, he looked her up and down, and then nodded approvingly. Not until now had she bothered to think of where he had brought her. When she looked up, they stood in front of the \"M.D\". So, the bastard has good taste in clubs! She hadn't been here herself, but she had heard it was a real watering hole for jazz lovers. Great artists. All the East coast's greatest were supposed to have played there. Vincent laid his hand on her lower back as they approached the doorman. She had a feeling the gesture was not only to be a gentleman, or appear to be one, it was a warning: I'm right here, don't mess up. -[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 And All That Jazz \"Oh, wow!\" It slipped out of her before she could stop herself. The pulse of the loud music tore through her body, her heart immediately assuming its beat. It was beautiful. The club was a lot smaller than she had expected. Smoke from numerous cigarettes lay heavy in the air. There were more people than she'd have expected on a Thursday night. Didn't people have jobs and school and stuff? This crowd seemed to live by its own rules; dancing and drinking like there were no tomorrow. She already loved the place. Pity she was here with him. Thanks to him. - He didn't have a solid plan. For the first time in probably twenty years, he didn't have a plan. So - he hadn't killed her. He never questioned a contract. It was all just flesh anyway; everyone dies in the end. What did it matter on the whole, that he helped a few people meet their destiny a little in advance? It wasn't really her, he realized. It was him. He had turned old early, leaving childhood probably at the age of ten. It had taken a few more years out of necessity, but after that he hadn't looked back once. And now they were all dead, for one reason or another. No one to ask, no one to blame. But here she is. She had known him then, before. Before he had turned cold. Psychologists back at the agency had called him a psychopath – well, whatever made them happy. He was indifferent. They'd had good use for him though. He was the best at his line of work. Then. Now. It was just work. I haven't killed her. He hadn't recognized her at first. Not until she'd said his name. She didn't look anything like that trusting little child he remembered. She appeared worn out. Beaten. And someone had put a contract on her. What had she been through? - Vincent nodded at the woman behind the bar and guided them both to a table in the rear of the main room. Back against the wall, she noticed. She sat down and realized she hadn't brought her bag. It was still back at the café. A beautiful, tall blonde came to take their orders. \"You look like you're thirsty, honey,\" she said, addressing Vincent and smiling flirtatiously. For a moment, Sarah could see Vincent through the other woman's eyes and felt an unexpected surge of jealousy. Ridiculous ! She waved it off. \"Just a club soda, thanks,\" he said and fired off one of his rare smiles. The blonde looked at Sarah. \"Whiskey,\" she muttered. \"Make it a double.\" \"Sure, hon.\" The waitress glanced once more in Vincent's direction and was gone. Vincent seemed to be in a trance, already absorbed by the pulsating, irregular music from the stage up front. \"It's behind the notes, in the spaces,\" he said, still intent on the musicians. Then he turned to look at her, and her breath caught in her chest. It felt like he looked into the depths of her soul, as if she didn't have to try to be someone she wasn't. Not like she always did when she was out on dates... Snap out of it! This isn't a date you stupid little bitch! You're his prey! Their drinks came and he never took his eyes off her. Sarah reached for her whiskey and gulped it down with a couple of burning-hot swallows. Her face turned red for a moment, and her eyes filled with tears from the effort of not choking, then she stared challengingly back at him. Say something then, reprimand me! He didn't, instead he raised one eyebrow, waved for the waitress and gestured to the glass: one more. They sat silent for a few minutes; Vincent's foot was tapping restlessly with the rhythm of the music. \"Let's dance.\" He rose and offered her his hand. Sarah was already beginning to feel the effects of the alcohol and didn't object. Well, if my life's gonna go to hell, it might as well do it with a dance! He slid his arm around her from behind and maneuvered her to the dance floor. She could feel his hard chest pressing at her back, and the arm around her waist held her tight. Sarah stiffened, but having already felt his strength earlier she was wise enough not to resist him. He did what he wanted, took what he wanted. She was glad she wasn't dead; a little dancing wasn't that bad. To be honest, she couldn't remember the last time a man had wanted to dance with her. The band's horn section came into a mad crescendo, competing with each other on who could play louder and harder. The crowd around them got wilder and everybody glistened with perspiration. Vincent however, didn't follow. He spun her around and pressed her gently against his chest, beginning a slow dance, moving at half the speed the musicians and everybody else kept. Almost in slow motion, he guided her over the dance floor, sliding elegantly between the dancing couples. The music almost put her in a trance, and everything that had happened suddenly seemed unreal. Sarah closed her eyes and began, in spite of herself, to relax. Vincent was even more beautiful than she remembered; he had aged with grace and had a very impressive physique. Here she was, in a position she had dreamed of achieving all those years ago: tightly pressed to the man of her dreams and having his full attention. Her mind reeled at that thought: what kind of attention was it? She couldn't allow herself to fall for the deceptive normality of his behavior – the dancing, and his smooth manners - these last minutes. He came to kill me! If she allowed though, for only one moment, the little girl in her to come through; to just indulge... A bit shaky, she inhaled his scent; at the nape of his neck there was a masculine air she vaguely recognized. Without knowing it, she pressed harder against him, finding comfort in the closeness of another human being. Of course he had to ruin it. \"What happened to your brother, Sarah?\" Oh no! Oh fuck! Why did he have to bring that up? Couldn't he have forgotten about that? - Simon had left home at eighteen. Sarah had been eleven, and she had never felt so betrayed. Simon had been her everything. He'd taken care of her, looked after her, cared for her. He'd been the only one that ever did. After being gone for four years, he'd suddenly showed up one night, looking miserable. The scars on his arms and face evidence enough of what kind of life he lived. He had snuck in that night through her bedroom window. They'd talked for hours and hours, until dawn. \"You've grown,\" he'd said, then given her a hug and swung his long skinny legs up on her bed. Sarah had pulled the blanket around her body, distancing herself a little. \"Well, you've been gone for a while.\" \"I have, haven't I?\" He'd laughed softly and then smothered a cough. He hadn't seemed well. Sarah hadn't asked. \"Why the fuck did you come back? Mom and Dad'll go nuts if they see you around.\" \"I just had to get some rest, Sar,\" he'd sighed, and coughed some more. \"Just some rest.\" \"Well you can't have it here. You left,\" she'd whispered hoarsely. The accusation had hung almost palpable in the air between them. \"Had to, you know. Just had to. If I hadn't, I would have killed him…\" Simon had looked tormented; the pain and self -loathing obvious in his eyes. She'd nodded. They'd had a lot in common, too much for anyone to bear. \"Yeah… I know.\" That was all that had needed to be said. They'd talked the rest of the night. Old memories. About Sarah's school. Possible boyfriends. Friends. They hadn't said anything about Simon's previous whereabouts. He hadn't mentioned it and Sarah had never asked. Probably neither had wanted to break the fragile peace between them. At dawn the next morning, cops had stormed their house and arrested her older brother. - Sarah closed her eyes and tried to avoid his gaze. It was clear, though, that Vincent wasn't going to let it pass. He stopped dancing and held up her chin. \"Look at me.\" She did. \"Answer the question.\" \"What question?\" she said, trying to play dumb. His grip at her chin hardened. \"Sarah,\" he said with a warning flash in his eyes. \"He's dead, Vincent!\" Her voice cracked. \"He's dead.\" She looked away with pain evident on her face. Vincent considered her, biting slightly at his lower lip before he spoke. \"And you haven't mourned him a day since?\" Sarah didn't see the brief look of sympathy that flew past his face. She went rigid and tried to pull away, with the only result that his grip around her back hardened. \"Do not attract attention,\" he warned calmly. \"Well, don't be such an asshole then!\" she spat. \"What the hell's the matter with you? How can you be so cold? Do you have human emotions in there? Is there anybody home?\" She tried to knock at his head with her fist, but he caught it in a vice grip in mid air. \"Sarah, I was being ironic, OK? Relax; don't fight wars you can't win.\" He leaned over and whispered in her ear. \"I am the one with the gun.\" \"Vinc-\" She couldn't continue. Her head was spinning. Vincent led her off the dance floor, back to their table where a glass of beautiful golden Irish whiskey awaited her. Sarah lifted it with trembling hands and drank the liquid with a couple of big gulps. The glass rattled against the table's polished surface as she sat it back down. She flinched when Vincent took her hands in his and held them tight. Her first instinct was to pull away, but suddenly she got tired of fighting. And he was right, he did have the gun. Why did she even bother? Leaning over the table, Vincent locked his eyes with hers. At first he didn't say anything, just kept studying her, and she found herself mesmerized by his intense dark green pools. He squeezed her hands before letting them go. \"Talk.\" That was all he said, but she knew - somehow she knew - it was for her. He wasn't really that curious. And she told him. She told him everything that had happened during those years. How Simon had disappeared and they hadn't heard a single word from him. Their parents had said the most horrible things; he was this and he was that. She hadn't wanted to listen. He had been her idol, her hero, her brother . Slowly that picture had faded though, replaced by anger and hate, which is just the other side of the coin. When a little sister gets betrayed by someone she looks up to so much, that love can easily turn into hatred. Then he'd reappeared just a suddenly as he had disappeared. Turned out though, he hadn't been coming home. He hadn't come to see her. He'd just been running from the police. The police had come all right. Simon had been charged with drug dealing. He'd just been a small time dealer and had been offered a deal; a shortened time in jail if he gave away the bigger fish. And he had. He'd sold everybody out. Simon was never really that smart. They'd found his battered body in the showers one morning, two years later, just three days before he had served his time. He had been beaten so badly, not a single bone in his body had been whole. Sarah's guilt had been overwhelming. She had been so angry with him after the arrest; she hadn't spoken to him since. And now it was too late. Everything was too late. Tears were rolling down her cheeks as she spoke, gathering in a pool under her chin, and one big drop after the other fell on her hands, which were tightly clenched in her lap. When she stopped speaking, he offered her his napkin and her drink. She wiped her nose and drank the rest of the clear, golden liquid, enjoying how it burned her throat. It made her feel alive. She had no clue how much time had passed, but as she looked up she could see there were fewer people in the club now. And the music had softened. A single trumpet was playing a sad tune; then it was joined by the quiet rhythmic beat of percussions; the bass followed and fell away. The music came in waves, in an almost random, but still perfect, pattern. Vincent noticed her attention on the music and something glittered in his eyes. With a soft smile, he took her hand. \"Dance?\" She nodded. This dance was much different from their last. Vincent didn't hold her like he thought she was going to run away any second. His gentle support at her lower back was perfectly balanced as he led and she followed. How does he do this? He was a good dancer, making her own stumbling footing seem almost experienced and not as clumsy as it normally was. Exhausted, she relaxed in his arms, allowing him to take over. Her body felt heavy and almost numb, but he maneuvered her in a dance so slow they barely moved at all. It was almost a sensual feeling, the stubble at her cheek, his scent. She loved his scent; it was as if it had always surrounded her like it did now. The hand at her back slowly slid higher and his hold tightened. All nerve endings in her body came to life, sending impulses constantly from where his hand was. With his arm now all the way around her back, he held his hand just below the swell of her breast. She could barely breathe any more from all the intense sensations that coursed through her body; pain, relief, the remains of fear, all the memories, good and bad, closeness, his intoxicating scent, his touch... When the music stopped, he let her go abruptly and just looked at her for an endless moment. Then he turned all business like again. \"We need to get moving.\" Oh God! Her fear was back.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Remembrance of an Angel \"Please, Vincent, you don't have to do this! It was – interesting to meet you and all, but we can go our separate ways now!\" She spoke fast as he, seemingly gentle but in reality unyielding, maneuvered her out of the club. Vincent nodded at the bouncer at the door. Sarah almost got the impression they knew each other. He was smiling; but as they got back out on the street, his smile faded. \"That is not an option.\" No, NO! This can't be happening! He really is going to – do this… \"Where do you live? You do live alone, right?\" \"Y- yes, why?\" Then it dawned on her: \"Oh, NO, I'm NOT taking you to my place!\" \"Yes, you are,\" he answered coolly. \"Why?\" Everything inside of her screamed with fear. Because he's going to kill you there! \"Because I say so.\" \"Vincent, please, I don't want to do this, you're scaring me.\" Sarah pleaded with him. \"Can I please just go? I'll disappear; no one will know you didn't… fulfill your contract…\" \"Out of options, Sarah. You don't have a choice. Just roll with it.\" He took a firm but not painful grip on her arm. \"You better come now, before people take notice and I'll have to start shooting.\" Sarah whimpered but did as she was told. They walked in silence for a block or two. There wasn't a lot of traffic; even the cabs seemed to have shut down business for the night. Sarah's mind was frantically working on a way out. Could she just run? No, he'd shoot her in the back… And where would she go? Most likely, he already knew where she lived, or could find out easily. And perhaps there would be others – later. Someone wanted her dead, had put a price on her head… She laughed bitterly to herself. Doesn't that sound melodramatic? - He'd have to kill her. Of course he'd have to kill her. In his line of work, there simply was no room for failure. Letting her go wasn't an option. Vincent cursed. He fucking liked her! She reminded him of – him. Himself. She made him remember things, good things he'd forgotten about. Vincent sucked some air through his teeth and sighed. Well, he'd liked Daniel Baker too. The talented jazz musician in LA that night, two years ago. He'd played the trumpet so beautifully it still gave Vincent chills, remembering it. Hadn't stopped him. Damn nearly did, though. That had been the first time he'd ever hesitated to kill. He never let anything personal interfere. It was easy enough when one didn't have personal connections. No attachments. There had been a woman once. Way back, long before he'd begun working in the private sector. Must have been fifteen years ago. She'd been special to him. It'd actually hurt when he'd learnt she was the enemy. She'd never seen him coming. After that he never got involved. It wasn't worth it. Everything, everyone. Would just die. Betray you. Or both. He'd grant Sarah the same treatment, though. He could do that for old time's sake – spare her the fear at her last moments – not letting her know when it happened. - Suddenly, as they passed an alleyway, two dark figures stepped out in front of them. Sarah staggered backwards as she saw the guns in their hands. Vincent didn't flinch; he just looked casually up and down the street they were on. The two guys – not much more than kids, she realized as the streetlights illuminated their faces - waved with the guns for Vincent and Sarah to step into the dark alley. \"Gimme your wallets, assholes!\" one of them barked in a harsh tone, trying to sound like a badass. They both looked like junkies; one had a constant twitch in his scrawny face, and the other really could've used a shower. Just two pathetic kids. In spite of the situation, Sarah felt sorry for them. Vincent held out both his hands calmly, palms down, as if reassuringly saying OK, OK, and made a slow move towards the side of his body with his right hand. Sarah, naively believing he went for his wallet, never saw it coming. At an almost unreal speed, he disarmed the first guy and shot him in the chest. While he was still falling to the ground, looking surprised, Vincent shot the other guy with two in the chest and one in the head. All three hit before the man had even begun falling. Sarah yelped in shock. As Vincent walked calmly towards the first guy, who lay writhing in pain, she bolted. Sarah ran, faster than she'd ever run before in her life, through the long, dark alley towards the light at the other end. Her lungs already burned from lack of oxygen. This was her only chance, or she would face the same destiny as those men. She couldn't even begin to guess why he hadn't killed her yet, but she knew it was going to happen. Him shooting… totally cold-blooded… The way he killed them… without hesitation… Her legs almost gave out as she heard a noise behind her. Stumbling, she turned her head and saw Vincent coming at her with the gun. Running like a machine, his legs and arms pumping, he approached fast. Too fast! A whimper escaped her throat as she willed her feet to keep moving. All of a sudden, her legs were kicked out from underneath her and she tumbled to the ground, almost producing a full roll before her body hit the asphalt, face down. Vincent was on her in an instant. Grabbing her shoulder, he turned her over on her back. He stood above her, one leg at each side of her torso and the gun pointed at her face once more. \"No, no, no, no,\" Sarah moaned, and tried to squirm out from underneath him. Vincent crouched and took a firm grip around the back of her neck with one of his strong hands, and the gun disappeared. \"Red light, Sarah,\" Vincent grated. \"You killed them, you killed them,\" she cried. \"They had guns pointed at us, remember?\" \"They were just kids…\" she sniffled. \"I shouldn't kill someone who is threatening me with a weapon because he's a kid? Is there a certain age above which I'd be allowed to kill people?\" He was mocking her. \"No…\" \"They were criminals, Sarah. Living a continuous criminal life, stealing, threatening… probably would've killed someone any day now. I did the world a favor.\" \"So that's the reason you killed them?\" she hiccupped, trying desperately to grasp some twisted sense in what he was saying. \"No. That's the why. There's no reason. There are no good reasons to live or to die. We are granted the gift of life and look what we make of it. We spit in the face of our maker! They had it coming, Sarah. They all do.\" Sarah was speechless. He actually believed he was doing the right thing! How could she fight him verbally? He was a psychopath. And she was lost. Numbly, she closed her eyes and let her body go limp in his hands. He could just go ahead and kill her. He was right! She had also spit in the face of her maker, making the choices she had, living an unworthy life. There was no way she could plead with him. A single tear slipped past her eyelid and made its way down her cheek. - Vincent watched in fascination how he affected her. It had been a long time since he had spoken as much to anyone. He realized that his words had an impact on her, beyond just the death threat she was so obviously aware of. His curiosity began to overtake his recent decision just to get it over with. She seemed to have a past that darkened her soul, colored her every thought, every action, and how she interpreted everything he said to her. The fuck why? He was sure she had lived on Cheer Street in Hilariousville, just like his temporary foster parents had. The little white fences with the little white mail boxes… Christmases in green and white, and everybody always so fucking polite and kindhearted. Haunted eyes. She'd had those scared, tormented eyes. And yet he remembered laughter. She had seemed relaxed with him, and with Simon. At fifteen he had affectionately played rather simple and sweet games with her and her older brother, and it hadn't been just to be nice. She'd been just seven then, but way too old for her age. And he'd been way too mature for his age, but at the same time he'd lacked experience from innocent childhood games, the stuff a normal kid would've done when he was seven, or ten, or twelve…. He could see now, in a moment of clarity, how their friendship had made up for that; at least a small part of it. She had been a little angel, a little piece of heaven in the hell that had surrounded him. At seventeen things had been different. He had, however, secretly enjoyed her crush on him. Found bliss in knowing he was special to someone, even if it had been just a little kid. Her presence in his life had affected him then… and it still does! He was suddenly aware of how she felt in his hands, soft and warm, and vulnerable. He let go so abruptly he dropped her to the ground, as if he had burnt his hands. - Sarah hit the ground with the back of her head. She only fell a couple of inches though; it didn't hurt. Surprised, she looked up and met Vincent's confused gaze. He was staring at her as if she just arrived from outer space. She almost wanted to have a mirror, to see what he was seeing. A heavy sensation spread from her stomach, and all throughout her body, as they kept studying each other. He looked so lost at that moment. She wanted to touch him, to hug him, to plead with him, to let him in, to shut him out. All at once. Taking control of her inner turmoil, she sat up, forcing Vincent to take a step back. As she stood, she took a step forward, facing him and laid a small hand on his arm. \"Come on. I'll take you home.\" -[Chapter 6] Chaptern6 Dead End Sarah'sngut feeling told her he wasn't going to kill her. He'd intendednto, she was pretty sure of that, but something was off. Shenlooked up at his inscrutable face as she opened the heavy wooden doornto her apartment, and wondered for the zillionth time what she hadngotten herself into. Asnshe let Vincent inside, she realized this was the last stop. Whatevernwas to happen between them, it would take place here. If she wasnwrong, and he did intend to kill her, then she had just given him thenbest of opportunities. Sarahntried to look at her apartment, or rather, small studio, throughnVincent's eyes. It wasn't spacious, but it was hers. They stoodnin the living room that also contained the kitchen over to the right,nseparated from it only by a bench. Her bedroom and unmade bed couldnbe seen through the open door on the other side of the room. Finallynto the left of them there were two doors, one to a little bathroomnand one to the only closet. The only window in the apartment was onnthe far side of the bedroom. The walls in this room were paintedndimly yellow, and the walls in her bedroom had a warm red tone. A fewnphotos in black and white of old Hollywood stars hung on the wallnbehind the sofa. She had decorated everything herself when she hadnmoved in four years ago, painting, finding some old furniture at ansecondhand market, and overall fixing the place up. It had marked annew era in her life. She wasn't going to be owned any more, wasn'tngoing to be pushed around. Mynplace! My life! Suddenlynaware that her mind had drifted, Sarah looked up at Vincent and triednto imagine what he was thinking, but it was impossible. He seemed tonevaluate the apartment, maybe counting places to hide, looking fornescape routes... She shuddered and realized she didn't want tonknow. \"CannI get you anything?\" she asked. Vincentnseemed to snap out of his scanning mode and looked at her. Suddenly anrelaxed smile lightened his features, and he pulled his fingersnthrough his hair. \"What've you got?\" \"Ehm,nwater… tea.\" She went over to the fridge. \"Orange juice, ifnyou're not afraid of food poisoning.\" She laughed and shook thenhalf empty juice bottle, which looked like it was about to explodenfrom the obviously too old content. Sarah threw it in the sink andnopened a cupboard. \"Whiskey, gin, vodka…\" She grinnednsheepishly. \"Nothing to mix with, though…\" Vincentnshook his head and walked over to her. He leaned casually against thenbench, raised one eyebrow and snickered. \"You do like strongnalcohol…\" He gave her a meaningful sideways glance. Sarah begannto protest. \"Whiskey will be fine,\" he interrupted, and his grinnwidened into a more genuine smile, making her heart skip a beat. Inlike him. I'm insane! I wish he was a nice person… I wish he wasnhere on a date… Sarahnshook her head inwardly. Where did that come from? Theynsettled in her green, L-shaped sofa, that had seen its better days ancouple of decades earlier. Each with one glass of the amber coloredndrink. Vincent had removed his jacket and thrown it over the bar'sncounter. Sarah shuddered as she caught a glimpse of his holster bynthe back of his belt as he sat down. Annuneasy silence settled between them. Vincent swirled the contents ofnhis glass, drank the scotch in one swallow, and reached for thenbottle to refill. Sarahnwatched in fascination as he gulped down his second glass andnrefilled. \"Vincent-\" Henlooked up from wherever he'd had his focus. His eyes werenunreadable, but they had an intensity that never seemed to dull. Shenswallowed. \"Whyncouldn't you let me go?\" Hennodded, like he'd been expecting the question to come up. Sarahnwatched him intensely while her heartbeat sped up and felt like itnmust have been audible in the small room. Vincentnfrowned and stared forward, seeing nothing. He seemed to consider thenquestion. \"I – hesitate…\" Iwasright!OhGodIwasright! \"Innever hesitate. Up until the alley, it was pretty clear to me. Then…\"nHe finished his third glass. Sarah'snhead was spinning. She needed more to drink! This was too much fornher. She had a chance, she was right, she actually had a chance! \"Whatnhappened in the alley, Vincent?\" Pushing on, she needed desperatelynto break this deadlock, to get some reassurance, to breathe. She hadnno idea whether it would be dangerous to push him, or if she couldnbenefit from it; she just did what came naturally. \"Whyndo you have that scar on your face, Sarah?\" Suddenly he looked backnup at her. Sarahnflinched. \"I don't wanna talk about it.\" \"Well,nI do.\" \"Well,nfuck you!\" she spat. Her heart pounded alarmingly hard as thenmemories pushed their way to the surface, like worms of decay from ancorpse, long since buried but never forgotten. - Marknhad been her first real boyfriend. Sarah had been nineteen and verynshy. Two years had passed since her brother had died, and Sarah hadnstill been very vulnerable and had trust issues. Mark had been a realncharmer, and a real psychopath – but she didn't learn that untilnlater. He'd taken her out, showed her places, taught her to drinknand smoke. They'd danced and laughed, and he'd stolen her heartnaway completely. Afternsome time, maybe a few weeks or a couple of months, the memory wasnrather blurred; he'd introduced her to some new friends of his.nShe'd thought they were a little creepy, but wanting to pleasenMark, she'd hung out with them. The guys had used to pinch her, andngrope her a little here and there, 'just for fun'. Sarah hadn'tnfound it that much fun and had tried to get them off of her the bestnshe could. Nervously, she would look to Mark for reassurance, but henwould just smile and tell her \"It's all right, baby\". That hadnbeen all he ever said, \"It's all right, baby\". GOD,nhow I hated those words! Onenlate night, after hours of heavy drinking, they'd been back atnMark's apartment. One of the guys, she thought his name was Steve,nhad hauled up some white powder in a small plastic bag. Sarah hadnwatched with fascination as he handled the powder as if it was purengold, placing some in a spoon, melting it into fluid and sucked itninto a syringe. She'd known what they were doing; Heroin, she'dnheard about it. She'd never encountered it before though. They'dnall injected it; Mark's four friends had gone first. Then, beforenMark had taken his shot, he'd helped her to her virgin dance withnthe white devil. Shendidn't remember much of how it started; she'd sunk down onto thensofa in a haze. When she'd come to her senses, she was being raped.nAt first she hadn't gotten it, thinking it was Mark on top of her.nThen, as she'd realized it was one of the other guys, she'dnpanicked and started to yell and beat at him, trying to get him offnof her. The guy had laughed and Mark had suddenly appeared, holdingnher arms down as he'd caressed her face and toldnher \"It's all right, baby\". They'd all taken turns with hernthat night. Sarah had fallen in and out of consciousness as theneffects of her first heroin shot had lasted for hours. Afterwards,nMark had been so sorry and had said it was the drugs, it hadn'tnbeen him. He would never hurt her, she knew he loved her. Blah,nblah ... Shenknew now he'd been just full of shit. He'd never loved her; she'dnsimply been an easy girl to have some fun with. But back then… He'dnthrown out the other guys and comforted her, promising her that he'dnmake it up to her. Sarah had wanted so desperately to believe him, tonbelong somewhere, to have her own family. Itnhadn't ended there, though. Sarah and Mark had begun shootingnheroin together. She'd loved the calm it brought her speeding mind,nthe blissful haze; it had been a way to forget about her past, and tonstop thinking about her brother. Soon enough she'd become addicted.nMark, who'd already been an addict even when they met, had begun tonget mean. He'd started saying she'd have to pay for it, that thenstuff was expensive, and that he couldn't keep buying her rationsnunless she did something to help him pay for it. Itnhadn't been that far-fetched anyway, she'd never owned her ownnbody; she'd been reminded of that throughout her whole existence.nSo she had done it. Reluctantly at first, but after her firstncustomer it had become easier and easier. Sarahnhad lived, or existed, as a junkie and a prostitute – a whore –nfor seven years after that. Even way after Mark had been out of thenpicture. It had been a miserable, meaningless, throw-away-your-lifenexistence. Sonclose to take my life, so many times… Thenscar had been the forever 'sweet' memory of a violent customer.nThere had been so many of them, and she had long since stopped caringnabout who did what to her and why, just as long as she could get hernnext spike. She had been a very skinny thing who ate almost nothing,nand had coughed constantly from a poorly treated asthma. Thisnparticular customer had a fit when he saw her bony body and her uglynarms, scarred from numerous needles. Sonhe'd beaten her. It had seemed to last forever. In the end he hadnproduced a knife, saying she was the 'ugliest motherfucking whore'nhe'd ever seen and that she deserved to die. She remembered thenknife, but she didn't really remember the cut. Obviously someonenhad finally heard her screams and called the cops. Thatnhad saved her life. But what life?! Sarahnhad spent a couple of weeks in hospital; healing from the cut, a fewnbroken ribs, and a liver laceration. Those wounds were the easy onesnto heal... During the stay, she'd had an awful withdrawalnexperience, going 'cold turkey' after the first night. They'dndone what they could to relieve her of her agony, but they hadn'tngiven her what she wanted. When the stay ended she was, for the firstntime in years, free from drugs, and could think clearly… She'dnbeen sentenced to two months in prison and had ended up in anlow-security ward. There she'd attended the group therapy sessionsnled by a young and very enthusiastic psychologist. The break from thenheroin had been her chance of a clean start. And she'd taken it;nshe'd needed it if she was ever going to have a life. Herntwenty-eighth birthday had been only a few weeks away; that had beennfour years ago, but still she wore the scars. They were for life,nsome visible and some not… Yeah,nshe surely had spat in the face of her maker. How could she ever tellnthis man? - \"Nonfucking way I'm telling you, Vincent.\" Hendidn't look angry. He simply looked like there was no option; likenhe knew he would win this battle no matter what. That made hernfurious. Who the fuck was he? Forcing himself into her life, and nownwanting her to tell him the fucking story of it! Fucknhim! This is MY place, MY life. NO ONE pushes me around any more! Shenstood to get off the sofa, to get some breathing space, and he was onnher in an instant, slamming his glass down on the table so hard thatnthe contents spilled all over his hand. At the same time his othernhand flew out and gripped her forearm, forcing her to sit back downnso it wouldn't hurt. \"Youndon't get to call the shots here, Sarah. I do!\" he hissed. Sarahndidn't become afraid this time, just angrier. Her cheeks flushed asnshe tried to pry his fingers off of her arm. \"Get the fuck off me!\"nshe yelled. Shenswung her free arm to try to hit him in the head, but Vincent wasnfaster and wrestled her down on the couch. As he battled her flailingnarm, he sank down on top of her. Sarah twisted and screamed as shenfought him. Vincent had straddled her hips and lay heavily on her,nusing merely his weight to hold her still. Pressing his forearmnagainst her throat, he forced her to calm down to gulp for air.nSarah, however, took one deep breath and slammed her head into hisnface, hit his nose and made it bleed a little. Vincent immediatelyncaught her hair in a painful grip and bent her neck backwards. Sarah'sneyes flew wide open as she saw the madness, almost on the verge ofninsanity, in his eyes as he shook her. He spat as he yelled, his facenbare inches away from hers: \"DOnYOU WANT TO DIE?!\" \"InDON'T KNOW!\" she screamed back at him. -[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Will There Be a Tomorrow? The silence that followed roared in their ears. Panting heavily, they stared at each other. Their chests heaved synchronously from the effort of the fight, and their bodies were so tightly pressed together that they could feel the other's heartbeat. Vincent moved first. Out of necessity. He sat back, smoothened out his clothes and pulled his fingers through his hair, in an attempt to get himself back in order. He looked bothered though, flushed, and his usual calm was gone. Raising his hand, he wiped some blood off from his upper lip, and glanced in her direction with a slight twitch in his face. Sarah didn't move. She watched his movements with a blank face; her head was spinning. What did I say? I didn't mean it! Of course I didn't mean it! Slowly, she sat back up, not bothering with her clothes the way Vincent had. She was tired, feeling a little sick all of a sudden. Looking down at her trembling hands, turned palm-up, she inspected the fine lines there. One of them was supposed to be the life line. Wonder which one, wonder where it ends… She pressed the heels of her hands hard against her eyes, inhaled deeply and then exhaled slowly. \"Why do you want to know?\" she asked finally, removing her hands and looking up at Vincent. Her hands shook as she poured herself another drink. She raised the bottle questioningly at Vincent, who nodded. The neck of the bottle rattled against the glass, and Vincent placed a steady, warm hand over hers to help her out. - He sighed. Why does she have to be so difficult? \"Someone wants you dead. Somewhere along the line of your life, you made choices leading up to the point where we are today.\" Led me to you. \"This is not a coincidence, Sarah. You have to tell me.\" Sarah chewed on her lower lip, seemingly processing this information. \"So, you're not just plain curious then?\" His lips twitched slightly. So bold all of a sudden? \"I'll tell you if you tell me something first.\" Sarah straightened herself and drank some. \"Give and take.\" Vincent considered this for a moment; then he nodded. \"Fair enough. What do you want to know?\" \"How did you become a hitman?\" He laughed. \"A hitman? Well, there was this ad…\" Sarah laughed, she actually laughed. Vincent felt slightly pleased to see that; he found it amazing how her mood had been switching throughout the night; fear – anger – lust – joy – fear – lust … That's how real people act… What do you feel now, Sarah? She fell silent and nodded, 'go on'. \"After high school I joined the army, didn't have anywhere else to go. Accepted me there, didn't ask questions. Discipline. Good life.\" He paused as his thoughts strayed back twenty years. \"They sent me off to countries with names I couldn't even spell. Had me kill people there, lots of people, in the name of causes I never knew existed, in wars that no one's ever heard of...\" He looked her straight in the eye and gave a barely visible shrug. \"And I didn't care. I was cold.\" He laughed shortly, and poured some more of the scotch. \"They discovered I had a talent. Got some special training… and the privilege to kill off more of US's enemies, both abroad and here, at home.\" Yeah… at home too… Vincent raised his glass and saluted before he drank a little. He knew he was beginning to look worn out. He felt like shit, if he was honest, with a whisper of a headache and a nagging feeling of some unknown loss… The whole evening he had kept his usual cool, stayed untouchable. Now he must appear… human… weak - everything he despised...But Sarah was pretty drunk; she shouldn't pay that much attention. Vincent felt far from sober too; he'd kept up the pace with her or, rather, exceeded it since they got here. \"Who are 'they'?\" Sarah whispered, clearly taken aback by what he'd told. \"Really can't tell you. I'd have to kill you.\" His eyes narrowed menacingly as he looked at her, challenging her with his gaze. Sarah burst out laughing. She laughed out loud and then it turned into a giggle. Falling back on the couch, she held her stomach and laughed until she cried. Vincent didn't say a word, and he didn't move a muscle, he carefully hid the little twitch in his cheek that wanted to join in. Finally she turned quiet, and all that was left were the tears on her cheeks. - \"No, seriously, who?\" Sarah wiped away some of the wetness on her cheeks with the back of her hand. He's so damn funny! \"You ever vote?\" \"Yeah…\" \"There's your answer.\" He said it simply, like it was the most trivial thing to tell. The implications were huge… Jesus, where am I in all this? \"Fuck! Are you telling me the GOVERNMENT sent you to kill me?\" Her eyes were round and large, and just a little out of focus, as she stared at him. Sarah flinched as he started laughing. At first she felt embarrassed because he laughed at her, but he was such a beautiful sight, and his chuckling was so contagious, that soon she joined in as well. Vincent finally turned quiet and looked, almost affectionately, at her. \"Been in the private sector eight years now. Government wants nothing from you, little Sarah. They'd love to wipe ME off the map, though.\" \"But then…?\" She frowned and tried to understand, she was not thinking straight any more. This was all too much. \"Private contractors,\" he said. \"Oh.\" She looked pleadingly at him. \"But…\" Vincent shook his head, barely visible. She nodded, she knew the answer; he'd already told her on the way to the jazz club. \"…you don't know who.\" He smiled and stretched out a hand. Sarah leaned into the touch, as he slowly stroked her left cheek with the back of his hand. She had noticed before that he had callused palms, and now she felt that the rest of his hand was used to labor as well, with those rough knuckles. Yeah… some labor! She shivered as she realized what he could do with those hands, and pulled back a little. Vincent immediately retreated and sat back. He considered her for a moment. \"My turn,\" he said and smiled sardonically. Sarah took a deep breath, and braced herself for what was to come. She had promised to tell him the story of the scar… \"A man,\" she whispered. \"A man? Your man?\" He focused completely on her, as though absorbed by what she was about to reveal. \"No…\" She shook her head repeatedly. \"Some guy I was with…\" \"Why were you with him?\" Damn! He can't let anything pass, can he!? \"He-e… we were supposed to…\" Her heart beat faster now, and her mouth was turning dry. She really didn't want to tell him, knowing all too well what was going to happen. He'll be mad. He'll be really, really mad…he'll kill me for wasting my life, for not deserving it! \"We were going to… have sex…\" She stared at her hands resting in her lap. \"And he cut your face?\" Vincent raised his eyebrows as if in disbelief. \"Sounds like an odd thing to do. Why?\" \"Didn't like the way I looked,\" Sarah whispered. Vincent's eyes narrowed as her considered her. \"Sarah!\" Her hands flew up to hide her face. \"He was a customer…\" She didn't dare to breathe. Keeping her eyes closed and her palms tightly pressed against her face, she awaited death… or at least some amount of pain. Sarah jolted as she felt his fingers carefully removing first one hand and placing it in her lap, and then the other. \"Why did you think it'd bother me that much?\" he asked gently, frowning as if he really didn't understand and needed her to clarify it. Opening her eyes, she glanced at him. \"I thought…. you'd… disapprove…\" she mumbled, not daring to remind him of what he'd said before: 'We are granted the gift of life and look what we make of it. We spit in the face of our maker! They had it coming, Sarah. They all do.' Jesus, I'm tired now. Leaning her head back, she relaxed against the couch, feeling her body go limp as all the tension left her. It felt like the worst part was done now. The worst part of the telling… - Surprisingly enough, Vincent had been a good listener as she'd told him what she'd been up to in the long, sad years between her twenties and thirties. He hadn't said much, and her story had been interrupted by long breaks, especially when she'd told him the more painful parts; Mark, the gang rape, the cutting… She'd fled to the bathroom a couple of times to calm herself, splash some water onto her face and wipe her nose before continuing, and Vincent had stayed patient with her all the time. Afterwards, Sarah had cried some and Vincent had refilled her glass. He'd showed no signs of being angry, and he hadn't raised his voice. Not until she proudly explained how she'd lived her life the last four years… - \"…so, you see, I have this steady job now, and a place of my own.\" She made a gesture with her hands, as if showing her apartment. \"I'm even trying to save some money for college, I want to become someone one day, do something important…\" \"But what do you do?\" Sarah frowned, she didn't understand the question. \"What do you mean? I work. I don't do drugs any more, and I'm off the streets. I'd say that's quite an achievement!\" Vincent leaned forward, slightly agitated and with just a hint of slurring evident as he spoke. \"Are you tellin' me you do nothing but work and… what!?\" \"But… but…?\" Sarah was totally confused now. Vincent leaned back and said with arrogance evident in his voice: \"Why did you dodge that bullet? She rose suddenly, in anger. Her cheeks had little red spots on them as she spat at him. \"I wanted to live!\" \"What the hell have you got to live for?\" he asked coldly. Vincent drank the last of the scotch and set the thick glass down hard on the table before standing up, face to face with her. \"You wake up, go to work, go home, eat your pathetic little microwave dinner, watch TV and go to bed. Every day the fucking same.\" He nailed her with his gaze. \"Give me one fucking reason why I shouldn't just do my job, finish this contract and get out of here, and on with my life!\" \"I was happy!\" she cried. He'd hurt her. He'd hit a nerve and he knew it. \"Like hell you were, Sarah!\" he spat. \"Like hell you were\" he muttered, and stretched out for the bottle to pour some more scotch into his glass before sitting back onto the couch. Sarah remained standing, too upset to even think about what she was saying. \"Why don't you just kill yourself instead, if life is as meaningless as you rant about all the time? Why take it out on me?\" She pulled the bottle out of his grip after he was finished and filled her own glass to the rim. \"You're so full of it,\" she snarled and sat back down, swaying a little as she did. Sarah screamed, as he grabbed her arm and held it tightly \"I'm so full of what?\" he asked, leaning forward, so close to her that she could feel his hot, scotch drenched breath on her lips, his eyes flashing dangerously dark. Her heart pounded wildly, and she had a whooshing noise in her ears. She was afraid again. But it wasn't only fear this time; other feelings intermingled as well. There was something so appealing to this situation. Three or four years ago, she knew she wouldn't have tried to avoid the bullet. She would have welcomed it! She had never had the courage to take her own life, to end her pain, and here he was, offering her the opportunity. Maybe it'd even be quick, painless? A part of her played with the thought of asking him to do it, to finish his contract. She was pulled towards him, more and more, and she knew it. He was like a dark sun that had entered her universe – her gravitating towards him – or perhaps he was more like a black hole… Her biggest fear at the moment was that he would know it too. Sarah didn't think. Whether it was the heavy drinking, or the long-lost feelings of her childhood, she didn't know; but something made her move. She leaned forward and let her lips brush against his. Then she jerked back, astounded by her own actions. Vincent looked shocked. The fact that she could surprise him like that made Sarah giggle out loud. \"You're drunk!\" he concluded as he regained his composure. \"Give me one good reason why I shouldn't be,\" she replied. \"No. Go ahead. Drink yourself into a stupor, if it makes it easier for you.\" Vincent shrugged indifferently and leaned back onto the sofa. His eyes lingered a little longer on her lips than he had intended, though. That last part sobered Sarah slightly. She really didn't want to die. And yes, she was drinking, trying to avoid the facts of the situation. Maybe if she was unconscious she wouldn't have to suffer the humiliation of begging for her life. -[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 As Painful As Truth Vincent looked at his watch, and Sarah followed his gaze. Jesus Christ! Six a.m.! \"We need to sleep,\" he said. Meaning…? You'll let me live? \"Yes, I really need to!\" she sighed. Her head spun as she rose. She was a lot drunker than she had realized. Stumbling, she hit her knee on the corner of the small table, which made her swear and hop on one leg. Then her shoulder had a close and painful encounter with the door frame, before Sarah more or less dove into her bedroom and wrapped herself in the cool sheets in her bed. Finally! She stretched and made herself comfortable as she dozed off. He could sleep wherever he wanted, or preferably just leave, go somewhere else. Her eyes, which were almost closed, flew open as Vincent too came into the room and went over to the window. He'd turned off the lights in the living room, and now he was gazing for a moment at the clear blue morning sky. Squinting, Sarah watched his silhouette. Suddenly, he pulled the strap that kept her curtain up, momentarily turning the room dusky. Vincent undid his tie and threw it over a chair as he surveyed the room. The same routine everywhere he went, she'd noticed. Sarah gasped as he bent towards her bed and shoved it a couple of feet, so that the length of it was along the wall. \"What're you doin' to my bed?\" she slurred. \"Practicalities. Wouldn't want you to run away in the middle of the night…\" \"Night's over,\" she replied sourly. He smirked. \"Indeed. Move.\" \"Why?\" \"I need a lot more space than that,\" he said, nodding at the narrow rim of bed that was left on his side. \"But…\" \"Yes, Sarah,\" he said, as if speaking to a small child. \"I am going to sleep here. I need sleep too, and the couch just won't do. Can't make sure you don't leave if I sleep there.\" He glanced in her direction with a grin and a meaningful gaze. \"Don't worry, I won't touch you.\" He sat down on the side of the bed as he removed his shoes and started to unbutton the shirt. Sarah felt a cramp in her belly; a hint of fear mixed with humiliation. This man… This , this… Vincent, was actually going to sleep in the same bed as her. And he won't touch me… She didn't know whether she should laugh or cry. It was so sad. She had been so lonely for so long… Jesus, of course he won't touch me, he knows what I've been. She pulled up the blanket further. It's for the best anyway… Her breath hitched in her throat as he swiftly removed his shirt and she could, for the first time, see his beautiful, muscular torso. The one she had felt before, like a packet of dynamite hidden under the expensive suit. Between his right scapula and the spine, there was a rather ugly scar, looked almost like a bullet wound… She wasn't sure. He also had several less obvious long scars across his back. Whipped? Has he been whipped? Vincent rose and stepped out of his pants which he laid, neatly folded, over a chair next to the bed. Finally he placed his gun under the bed, close to where his head would be. Not under the pillow, though, where it would have been possible for her to try to reach it, she noticed. These last actions pulled Sarah out of her trance and she shrank back in the bed, away from him. Lifting the blanket to get under it, he looked at her. \"You gonna sleep in all those clothes?\" \"Mmm, I'm too tired anyway…\" It was a little lie, but it could pass. She wasn't sure why she felt so shy all of a sudden. Shit! With her background she should've been able to get up and jump naked in front of him, without feeling the least bothered. It just… feels dangerous … \"All right.\" He shrugged and lay down beside her. The old bed shifted and protested as his heavier frame forced it to sink down more on his side. Sarah struggled to stay in her place and not fall onto him. They settled, after a few uncomfortable moments, into an arrangement where they didn't lie immediately touching each other. A minute passed, then Sarah felt an urgent need to pee. She changed position and tried to forget about it, but her bladder kept reminding her. \"Vincent.\" \"Yeah?\" He sounded completely awake. \"I need to use the bathroom.\" He nodded. \"Go.\" Sarah crawled out of bed, avoiding the closest route over Vincent's body, and stumbled through the dusky living room. The lights in the bathroom blinded her and she turned them back off. Sitting in the dark, she listened to her own breathing. Why the hell am I still alive? What happens tomorrow? When will he leave? What if he stays…? Her head felt heavy and finally she just blanked all thoughts. She had been the master of that… in her previous life… Well… always. When she was done, she looked up and realized her nightgown was hanging on a hook just in front of her. After quickly switching from her work outfit, the small skirt and blouse, she sighed with relief from the feeling of the cool, soft fabric on her skin. Taking just a few more seconds alone, she ran the toothbrush around her mouth, and splashed some water on her face. Hesitantly, Sarah tiptoed back to bed, and jumped when she saw that Vincent was looking at her, just two dark eyes in a pale face, and with that grey hair almost invisible on the white pillow. \"Felt good?\" Sarah nodded. \"Mmm, gotta go too.\" He rose and went for his suit jacket, still slumped over the kitchen bench in the living room, digging in the pocket for something. Sarah figured it had to be something he needed for the bathroom, and was surprised when he came back to her. \"Sit back, or lie down.\" She frowned, not understanding his request, but lay back down on her side of the bed without asking any questions. She gasped a little as he towered her, and took her wrist in his hand. Threading something through the radiator, he then wrapped a narrow plastic strip around her wrist and secured it to the radiator. She heard the small snapping sounds as the strip was tightened. \"Can't trust you not to run away… can I?\" He smiled, rose, and left for the bathroom. No you can't, Vincent…Damnit! She tugged at her wrist, but the bond didn't budge. \"Vincent, you moron!\" she shouted when he returned, a few minutes later. Vincent just grinned at her and flipped open a switchblade in his right hand. Before Sarah even got to understand what he was doing, he'd already cut her loose. She quickly pulled her arm back from him and pouted. \"Sleep? Or stay angry?\" he teased as he lay down again, pulling the blanket over him. \"Sleep… I guess.\" Sarah made herself as comfortable as she could on her side of the bed. Considering that a few inches from her lay the most attractive and charismatic man she'd ever been this close to. … he kills people for money! Somehow that didn't feel as worrying any more as it probably should… For some strange reason she could almost see his motives - not for killing people - but for how he'd ended up like this. Maybe because of their history together… Maybe because all the alcohol had dulled her senses and made her reckless… Maybe because I'm a lot more like him than he knows… She shifted, and suddenly her naked thigh brushed against his, and her heart jumped up her throat when she felt the coarse hair on his legs against her softer skin. Immediately moving her leg away, her cheeks blushed with embarrassment. Lying on her back, she tried to regain control over her heart when, in the corner of her eye, she saw that Vincent was looking at her. She stole a quick glance in his direction, and then looked back up at the ceiling. - Vincent had propped his head up on one of his hands. Now he just quietly studied her, making her nervous; he was aware of that. It was quite funny. He knew he had an impact on women in general; that he was thought of as good looking. Well, 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder', and he didn't give it much consideration. But he wouldn't be himself if he didn't take advantage of just about anything he could use. He wasn't completely sure why he was still around – and why she was still alive. Her sudden reappearance in his life had been… interesting and, even if he wasn't completely willing to admit it to himself yet, he wanted more out of her. For at least a short while, he wanted to dwell in the sensation of some kind of belonging. He still had time. Biting his lower lip, his gaze traveled up and down her face, and down to the outline of her body under the blanket. I promised not to touch her… Well, never been a man of my word. He leaned in a bit closer, and stifled a smile as he heard the ragged breathing coming from the woman next to him. Little upset, are you, Sarah? It had been an amazing evening. He hadn't spoken so much in years. Hell, maybe since he was in his teens and hanging with the only friends he'd ever known; Simon and little Sarah… Not so little any more… He had opened up some to her questions, and she had revealed awful things from her earlier years. Good for her that they were over. Fucking twisted though, how she, who had always sought adventure, and had seemed to really want to live, now had settled into some low-class-American-waste-of-life style. Her being a prostitute and a junkie, that was just the facts of life; happened to some people. Sometimes even to some of the good people. Especially those who wanted a little more out of life than the others; the sensitive ones. Most of the time a life like that was never made by choice. But NOW, this was different. This life she had chosen on her own, and it reeked of loneliness, misery… not so much depravity any more as depression. That had finally made him angry. That shook him. He, who never cared about other people… Well, he COULD care, when he chose to. No one ever saw that side of him, though… Sarah wasn't the most beautiful woman he'd ever been around. She was way too skinny for his preferences, and she was … plain. Didn't look after herself; just pulled the hair back into a ponytail and wore little or no make up. He looked at her, fascinated by how she refused to look back. He smiled a little inwardly. Well, she IS soft and warm… and caring… - \"Sarah\" he said, his raspy, soft voice slightly deeper than normal. \"Are you cold?\" She shook her head, just a little too quickly. \"Hurt?\" She shook her head again. \"Sad?\" There was a slight hesitation, before she denied that too. Sarah jolted when a big, warm hand came up to stroke her face. Then she let herself sink back into the pillow, as his ministrations were so tender, and made her feel so heavy. Sleepy. Vincent kept caressing her face, slowly, sensually, and a whimper wanted to escape from her lips. She needed so desperately for someone to just hold her, to tell her everything was going to be all right... Turning over, she looked at him; he had a hint of a smile on his lips. \"Please…\" It slipped from her mouth before she could stop it. \"Please what?\" he asked in a soft voice. She hesitated. \"…please, hold me…\" He engulfed her in his strong arms and held her tight. \"The night's been tough on you,\" he whispered. She pressed her face against his neck and inhaled deeply before letting out a sigh, reveling in the warmth he radiated. It didn't feel like she'd expected though. The embrace didn't make her calm. With the whole length of her body pressed against his she was, on the contrary, beginning to feel more excited… aroused… Oh no! She tried to free herself from his hold, but he didn't let her go. - \"Stay, Sarah,\" he whispered. Slowly threading his fingers through the fine hair at the back of her neck, he caressed the soft skin there and could feel the goosebumps he created. Her breathing was getting ragged and through the thin fabric of her gown, her hardening nipples teased the skin of his chest. Knowing that she was aroused by his presence, he lowered his head and leveled his lips with hers, placing one hand gently at her shoulder. He waited, she'd come to him, he needed her to come to him. - Sarah moaned low and parted her lips slightly. Oh God! She wanted him to kiss her; she could feel the heat from his lips as they came even closer. Finally she couldn't stand the torture any more and raised her head to meet his lips. They tasted each other, hesitant at first, almost shyly. Soft lips meeting, exploring, then the tip of one tongue met with the other. Dancing. Intertwining. Soft sighs of contentment. Sarah lost herself completely in his taste, his scent, and in the feel of his body pressed against hers. She became acutely aware of his hand, however, when it began to wander from her waist to where her night gown had slipped. His warm, strong hand slowly caressed its way up the side of her body, under the fabric, meeting with her bare skin, making it tingle. Moaning into his mouth, she squirmed and tried to push his hand away. He resisted at first, unwilling to leave that silky soft piece of her. Finally, she broke the kiss and pushed herself forcefully away from him. \"I can't,\" she whispered. She was scared again, but this time it was more herself she was afraid of than him. Her fear of losing control… I shouldn't drink! I should never, ever drink! FUCK! Vincent didn't let her go; he gave her some breathing space, but kept his arms around her. His right hand was held loosely over her hip and his thumb kept stroking her, over and over again, which sent jolts of longing and expectation through her. \"What's wrong, Sarah?\" \"I – I just can't, Vincent.\" A painful expression came over her features. \"I'm too tired – and drunk – I just need to sleep. No offense.\" - \"None taken.\" Her agony didn't pass by him unnoticed, though. His hands had proceeded to massaging her back, kneading the tensed muscles there. They told him everything; they were wound up like piano strings now, unlike a few moments ago when she had been like clay in his arms. Warm, willing and excited… \"I don't buy it, Sarah.\" He pressed himself harder against her, just a little, to mold her. He didn't want to intimidate her, not now, but he wanted her to feel his need, to feel what he wanted. I want her! A few moments ago, it had been just a little game; to see how far he could go. But during that long, soft – and trusting – kiss he had felt her whole body adjust to his, melting into him… And it felt too good. He couldn't stop here, not now. He'd never get to sleep. \"Why? I've been face to face with someone's gun – twice – no, more… tonight, and it's late, and I've been swallowing like a bottle of scotch or so… and I have a headache.\" She blushed, probably embarrassed from the all-too-common lie, smiled weakly and made an attempt to look exhausted. The quick pulse beating at the base of her throat and her erratic breathing gave her away, though. He knew their closeness affected her just as much as it did him. Is she still afraid? \"Are you scared?\" He pushed a strand of hair away from her face, trying to go slow and without any sudden moves that would worsen whatever it was she was feeling. - Sarah's head was spinning and she felt almost sick; it was so unfair. There was no cure, no going back. Why had she dodged that bullet back at the café? It could've been over by now and she wouldn't be in this situation. No pain, no more fear, and no loneliness… Still, in the actual face of death, her survival instincts had kicked in with an unexpected strength. Vincent's hot, hard body was pressed against hers. She could feel that he wanted her, and her body had responded in kind. 'Are you scared' he'd asked… how ironic… Yes, I'm scared… She'd have to tell him, wanted to tell him. At least then he'd leave her alone… \"I have a disease. It's… we can't. I can't ever…\" The words came slowly, with an effort, as if she was forcing them out of her mouth, mumbling into the nape of his neck. \"How? Are you sick?\" He frowned. \"Tell me.\" Suddenly, she regretted her decision and her mind panicked; she hadn't told anyone so far. \"It's so filthy… I don't want to.\" \"Yes, you do.\" She processed that statement for a moment. It's true, I do! \"It's called… I have AIDS. Or, no, HIV. It's not AIDS… not yet, it isn't. So you see why we can't…\" - Vincent was stunned. He was far from a stranger to death. It was a calculated risk in his line of work. But to slowly rot away… to live year after year with the knowledge that you would eventually get deformed from numerous tumors, weak from multiple infections and, to top it off; demented before you die… \"Say something,\" she pleaded. \"Are you afraid?\" She was quiet for a moment and closed her eyes before she answered; a single tear fell on each of her cheeks. \"Not so much now. I was when I first knew… Thought I'd die any day…\" \"How long have you known? When did you get it?\" Sarah looked at him like he was an idiot. \"Ehh, from… work… They found out when I was at the hospital, after the assault.\" Vincent had realized, immediately after asking, what the answer would be. He tightened his arms around her and held her rigid body to his. She fought him a little in the beginning, not wanting his pity, but he didn't let her go. Eventually she accepted his embrace. \"Don't be afraid,\" he whispered. That was the last thing said before sleep finally claimed them both. -[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 Day Two, Friday, Six p.m. The second time she woke, she was alone. Somewhere in the building someone was flushing a toilet. The whining sounds from the water pipes, normally an annoying disturbance, was comforting, a proof that the world was still the same. Outside. Her world had changed. Vincent… - He'd tied her up before he left a couple of hours ago. The strips were rather tight, and she was going to have bruises. If she allowed herself to interpret the look on his face, though, he had seemed sorry about it. She'd slept the whole day. At ten he'd made her call in sick. She'd told them she had the flu, and that she'd probably be in bed for a few days. How many days will it be? It hadn't been such an effort to sound ill; after the phone call she'd immediately rushed to the bathroom and thrown up. She had a hangover that would've killed an elephant. Even Vincent had looked rather disheveled. At two he'd woken her again, he'd found some bread in her kitchen and had made them tea. She'd just taken a bite out of the bread, but had been thankful for the tea. Didn't tell me where he was going – or when he'll be back… What if he doesn't return? That was a new and paralyzing thought. Maybe he'd just left her here to starve to death? No… No he wouldn't! That's not his style – I think… Her panic had come and gone several times as she fell in and out of sleep. She'd processed the previous night several times. Every action, every word, and every look… touch… dance… The final talk… and how she'd fallen asleep in his arms. I felt safe! How truly fucked up is that? She had an excruciating headache, always had when she'd been drinking. Yesterday she'd gulped down alcohol as if she wouldn't live to see the break of dawn. Well… she had. Even before she went to sleep, and now she regretted every single drop. The fact was that she wanted him to come back. His appearance in her life was so totally unexpected, and it made her feel alive. She'd even told him about her… disease, and he'd accepted it. No one had ever known before; not her mother, not the girls at work, and not the few friends she still had left. The truth had been such a burden to carry alone, and the reliefs of having its weight taken off her shoulders made her feel like she could rise. - Vincent had been making some phone calls. He'd had some ideas on where to start. From there it had been relatively easy. She'd been a prostitute and a junkie. Her brother had been a small time dealer. Then there had been the beating… and a sentence – jail for a number of years… four perhaps? Revenge? Possibly. Related to Simon? Less likely. Retaliation for being sent to prison… A man, thinking too highly of himself, put down by a whore? More probable… He couldn't exclude the other possibilities yet, though… He'd have to pull some strings, but it'd be worth it. She deserved it. Little Sarah… always so trusting…She's still the same – I want her to stay that way… It felt good yesterday, laughing with someone… her touch… His contact in Nevada, Frank, had set up a safe line via satellite transmission and then he'd called Vincent back. \"V? It's Frank. What's up?\" The man at the other end of the line sounded slightly surprised. \"We're gonna ask the Corellis that favor.\" - The Corelli cartel was the only real player on the east coast. They were involved with drugs, gambling, smuggling and prostitutes. They had officers on payroll, lawyers and from what the rumor said, even a judge… you name it - they owned it all. There was nothing going on that they weren't involved with, nothing that counted. They were good businessmen, ruthless and professional. Vincent had done jobs for them several times. Once though, they had messed up with the arrangements, and had forgotten to check one small detail. The rear exit from a building, the escape route Vincent had been supposed to take, hadn't existed any more. In order not to get caught, Vincent had to shoot his way out, making a mess, killing probably ten people before he had gotten away. Nearly got himself killed... Ever since, he always checked every aspect of the hit himself; entrances, exits, guards, key cards… The Corelli brothers, said to be brothers, but no one really knew if they were even related, had apologized and taken the full blame. Vincent had completed the job to their complete satisfaction and they'd said that if he ever needed a favor… - \"Fuck V! What's going on? Where are you? Have you done the job yet?\" The man at the other end of the line sounded disturbed. Vincent was like a machine. You could count on him to do the job, no matter what. He never let anything interfere. The rumor had it that he'd even killed his own parents. He was the perfect hitman: thorough, cold, precise, and lacking anything even remotely close to a heart. Frank had expected to hear from Vincent this morning, to have his confirmation that he was on his way to Las Vegas as planned. Instead there had been nothing the whole day. Not that he was responsible for Vincent, not at all. Vincent was his own. But Frank had worked for him the last six years. Vincent had picked him up the day he left the prison, after serving two years for assault; a little dispute that had cost him his honorable discharge from the military and left him with nothing. Vincent had offered him a job, to be his right hand man, his \"office\", and it had worked flawlessly. Until now. - \"Frank, don't ever question me!\" Vincent's voice over the line was harsh. Frank got his instructions and was all business again. Good for him. He'd heard the hesitation and the hint of accusation in Frank's voice, and it had left him wondering what the hell he was doing. Allowing Sarah to live had seemed like the right thing to do late last night; after the surprise of finding someone he knew so long ago, after all the dancing, the drinking, and the confidences. Even this morning, when he was still in Sarah's apartment, it had appeared reasonable, doable. But now, after sobering up with fresh air and lots of strong black coffee, the night with Sarah seemed more and more surreal. He'd spent a couple of hours at his hotel room, sleeping some and thinking some. Finally he'd gathered his things and checked out. He wouldn't return. Looking at the whole situation now, pulled out into broad daylight, he realized it might weaken him, make him a liability. Bad for business… - Sarah heard the key rattle in the lock, and her heart jolted. When the door swung open though, the first spark of joy was replaced by a little nervous tickle in her belly. He looked… not the same. She couldn't tell at first what it was. Vincent hadn't looked straight at her yet, even though he could very well see her from the door. Instead, he was watching her apartment again, turning his head and glancing in different directions as he slowly and silently closed the door behind him. As the locking mechanism clicked with a sharp sound, almost like a gun shot heard from a distance, she flinched and her heartbeat sped up. Vincent took a quick look at her with an unreadable expression on his face, like acknowledging her presence. Then he went for the bathroom and was gone for a few minutes. She could hear him stir in there, then the flushing of the toilet and the water in the basin. She had a growing feeling of unease that she couldn't shake off. He seemed different, less like this morning and more like... earlier last night! Her mouth suddenly went dry as the horrible implication grew on her. He's changed his mind! When the door abruptly opened, it interrupted her train of thoughts and she stared paralyzed at him as he came out and shut the door behind him. \"Vinc...\" she began to say, but her voice trailed off as he slowly walked towards her, his eyes shadowed and almost hypnotizing her with their darkness. A feeling of sadness crept upon her; she mourned her life – to be losing it this way. So, this is it... When he unbuttoned his suit jacket, one button after the other until all three of them were done, she turned her head away from him and took one last, long look at the still blue sky outside. A bird flew by in the distance. Then she closed her eyes. Not gonna fight it this time. - As he approached the bed, he prepared himself. It'd be fast. Three in the head, like Daniel Baker... Still he felt remorse, like then, only this time he felt it in advance. He knew he didn't want to do this, but he couldn't see any other real solution. He watched Sarah turn her head away and close her eyes, without a word. Brave little Sarah... she already knows. Sliding closer until he was right by the bed, he quietly pulled the gun out of its holster. Then the cell phone rang in his pocket. -[Chapter 10] Disclaimer: Ahh, you know… I don't own anything and make no money! Thank you very much, Emptyvoices. (Fascinating name btw!) Yeah, the poor girl has enemies… OK, here's the next chapter. Read and enjoy, and tell me what you think. - - Chapter 10 Loose Ends Cursing silently to himself, Vincent holstered the gun and grabbed the phone. Flipping it open as he turned away from the bed, he growled, \"Yeah!\" The man in the other end of the line was enthusiastic. \"V! Got some info. Was easier than I thought!\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Turned out you were right. Our contact at the Corelli's checked with their source at the phone company, and then with some cop-dude of theirs. The guy who put up the contract IS in fact the same guy that were charged with the assault on that mark you're supposed to do. And tell you what: he's supposedly running some security business over there, on and off the record, so to speak. Seems he's trying to get his share of the market. Protection and shit like that, you know. Corellis ain't too happy about that... they've kept an eye on this guy for the last six months, or so. Johnny told me to tell you, that if you had some unfinished business with him, they wouldn't be in your way. Said they wouldn't hold it against you...\" Really? That last remark didn't pass Vincent unnoticed. He filed it away for now, though. \"Good job, Frank. Send me the info on him.\" \"Seem to me they want rid of him, don't you think?\" \"Frank!\" \"All right, I'll send it.\" \"I'll contact you later.\" \"But, V...\" Vincent hung up and curled his upper lip into an expression of slight disgust. Same old Frank: reliable, lacking most of what people would call a conscience, perfectionist when it came to gathering information, hacking computers, security systems, and other useful skills. The man was, however, annoyingly chatty from time to time. They were opposites really, but both were highly professional and overall they didn't see that much of each other, so it was bearable. Interesting… - - Sarah's heart had almost stopped when the buzzing sound of the phone went off, just a few inches from her ear. It took her several seconds to realize she was still alive. Yet she found herself unable to open her eyes again. She'd said her farewells to the world a few moments ago, and now she existed in limbo, listening to Vincent's short growls on the phone and the chatter from the person at the other end of the line. When he was done there was silence for several moments, and then her bed sank as he sat down at the edge of it. When she felt his hand on her shoulder, she couldn't hold back any more and burst into tears. Her whole body shook and she curled into a fetal position as she almost cramped in pain, fear, and relief. Vincent hung heavy on her for a moment, and then her hands were suddenly free from their bonds. Taking her wrists in his hands, he rubbed them, trying to get some circulation back. Sarah made no effort to pull out of his grip. \"Sarah,\" he whispered. She didn't move, and her eyes were still closed. The tip of her nose was so cold, as if something had sucked the warmth out of her body. \"Sarah,\" he said again. Still unable to respond, she lay frozen. \"That won't happen again,\" he stated in a low voice that sounded a bit shaken. He cleared his throat. \"Ever.\" Then he got up and left her alone. Sarah remained on the bed, in the same position, for a few more minutes. Then she staggered up and rushed past a startled Vincent in the living room. He flung himself after her, but stopped flat when he realized she was heading for the bathroom. Sarah slammed the door shut, and bent over the toilet, throwing up in cascades all the contents of her stomach. After she was done, she was all sweaty and messy. The bathroom reeked of vomit, and her hair hung around her face, strands of it plastered against her forehead. Trembling, she rested her cheek against the cool china of the basin. This is the worst fucking day of my life! Just finishing that thought, she knew it was wrong - she'd had much worse… She didn't feel strong enough yet to go out and face him. 'That won't happen again… ever…' What wouldn't happen? The little hope she'd had of getting out alive had been lost those few moments ago, and the swirling vortex of hopelessness within her grew wider and wider. He really meant to kill me! If it hadn't been for that phone call, I'd be dead by now… In slow-motion, Sarah sank down on the thick, red rug and hugged her knees with her arms, slowly rocking back and forth, comforting herself when no one else would. - - Vincent watched her flee past him and then listened to the sounds of her throwing up in the bathroom. He sank down again on the couch and brought his hands up to his face, rubbing the palms against his eyes and then his cheeks. Frustrated with his own indecisiveness, he reflexively smoothened out some imagined wrinkles on his pants and corrected his tie. As if a flawless exterior somehow made up for a flawed interior. Didn't want to kill her. Already knew that…Would've though, easy way out. And now it's OK not to… He stood abruptly, and paced the living room in utter annoyance, the depths of his dark eyes mirroring the agony he felt. Spineless! Make your own fucking decisions, Vincent. Improvise… Snorting, Vincent finally made up his mind and confirmed what he'd already known. Sarah would live. The client had to go. - - After quite a while, probably about an hour, Sarah cautiously opened the bathroom door and peeked out. She hadn't heard a sound from outside since she'd slammed the door shut behind her. Hoping intensely he'd be gone, she almost had a heart attack when she found him sitting coolly in her couch. \"Can't you just leave?\" she said in a broken voice. \"Please?\" \"You want me to?\" Vincent replied. She couldn't believe he even asked. \"Yes!\" \"Can't do that, Sarah, not yet.\" Something burst inside of Sarah at that final comment. There wouldn't be any end. If he couldn't leave, didn't it mean he was just toying with her and that he would eventually kill her? Out of the blue, Sarah suddenly threw herself at the front door. It opened! Already halfway down the staircase, he caught her by the hair. She howled with pain as he pulled her in, and he quickly changed his grip. Covering her mouth instead, he reached past her and slammed the door shut, locking it this time. Squirming in his grip and attempting to bite him, Sarah fought to get free. \"Shhh, shhh.\" Vincent pressed her body against his and tried to calm her, as they sank to the floor. \"Mummmnnguumng!\" Her long tirade under his hand only turned into muffled sounds, impossible to understand. \"If I take my hand away, Sarah, you have to promise not to scream.\" He spoke calmly, soothingly. She hesitated, and then nodded. When his hand was gone Sarah inhaled deeply, as if taking her first breath ever, then she sobbed, \"Just get it over with, Vincent! I can't stand it any more!\" I want OUT! At that moment, she really wanted to die. Her mind screamed at him to do it, to finish it, to release her. \"Sarah.\" She didn't seem to hear, and was completely avoiding his gaze. \"Sarah!\" he said with more force, turning her head towards him with a hand gently gripping her chin. \"I'm not going to kill you, Sarah.\" Sarah flinched. He hadn't said it out loud before. He hadn't given her any promises until now, just that ray of hope late last night. The thought of that previous trust she'd carried made her angry. He's just playing me ! It's just a trick! He just fucking tried to kill me a few minutes ago! \"You're so full of shit, Vincent!\" she snarled. - - \"I'm full of shit?\" He couldn't believe she was being this hostile. He'd just given her the most generous gift he'd ever offered to anyone in his entire life. \"Sarah, you're a monument of it!\" Her eyes narrowed. \"I? YOU have no heart, no soul...You're just a… - a breathing mass of flesh!\" she yelled. \"They won't even welcome you in hell; they'll have to build a special one, just for you!\" Working herself up, red spots appeared on her cheeks and her eyes flashed with anger. She struggled to get free, and he let her go, following her up until they were standing, face to face. \"Get out of my LIFE!\" She shoved at his unyielding chest as she screamed the last word. \"Life…\" he snorted. He didn't like being treated this way. I'm trying to be nice for fuck's sake! \"What life? 'Someday. Someday my dream will come true´,\" he taunted. \"Well someday you'll wake up and realize it never came. Never happened. That day is here. Wake the fuck up, Sarah!\" He had grabbed her shoulders with both hands, and shook her as he sneered at her. Vincent knew he was hurting her, pushing her where it would hurt the most, but something about her seemed to bring out both the best and the worst in him. She was like a band-aid, ripped off from a still not healed cut; tearing the flesh and making it bleed again. Fresh blood can be a good thing; it means the wound is cleaner. The downside is that it's painful. Sarah almost jumped in anger as she screamed at him, \"What do you care? What's it to you? You could just leave and go on with whatever makes your own life so fucking special. But you know what? I think you can't. I think your life is just as empty as mine. Killing me would mean killing yourself and that little remnant of a soul in you!\" With uncontrolled, angry movements, she wiped away the tears that had formed in her eyes. Vincent opened his mouth to retaliate, but closed it again. She's right… I do remember - another man… … a boy… He staggered backwards a couple of steps, until his back hit the kitchen bench. Confused, he looked behind him and then back at her. It fucking hurts![Chapter 11] Lee: I'm glad to have you with me and that you are amused... ;D Where it goes from here? Well... um... No, you'll have to be patient with me. What I wanna know is where \"Not The Type\" is going! Emptyvoices: It's great that you are excited, and thank you for the compliment, that the characters feels real. I hope you'll enjoy the next chapter now. /Nic. Chapter 11 Stranger Within Staring at Vincent who looked like he'd lost something valuable - like his brain! - she suddenly got profoundly tired. Tired of him, and this whole situation. She had a headache and an awful taste in her mouth, she smelled of old sweat and booze, and really, really needed to eat. Walking past him, she opened a cupboard, reached for a big glass, filled it to the rim with fresh, cold water and drank it greedily. Somewhere, where are they? She pulled out one drawer after another. Finally, finding some painkillers, she poured a couple into her palm and swallowed them with the last of the water. She hesitated, but then held out the small box of pills towards him, he did look like he could need some too. I don't have to be an asshole just because he's one. Vincent looked up at her with a new tiredness in his eyes that she hadn't seen before, and then down at her hand. Sighing, he nodded, and accepted the offer. Reaching past her, he took the glass she'd been using and poured some water for himself, slipping two pills in his mouth before draining it. Well, fuck me, he's human! The interactions seemed to revive him a little. Obviously back to normal, he straightened himself and gazed at her with a slight grin on his lips, sniffed demonstratively in the air and squinted. \"You know, you could use a bath…\" \"Didn't think I'd need one,\" she answered quickly, cockily, beyond caring any more about being cautious. She still didn't trust him not to suddenly change his mind again and decide that he should kill her. Who needs a shower if they are going to die! He gave a short laugh. \"Well, guess what? Change of plans. Now you do.\" \"Don't like smelly corpses?\" she replied like a smart-ass. In a way, she was trying to be funny, but at the same time there was nothing even remotely resembling a smile on her lips. On the contrary: if she felt anything it was bitterness at how her life had turned out and at how it would end. I'll probably smell BETTER than I do now once I start to decompose . He shrugged nonchalantly. \"They all smell, sooner or later… I do mind smelly women, though.\" \"Why should that bother me?\" Jerk! \"It'd ruin the dinner…\" That rendered her speechless for a moment. Dinner? The thought of food made her stomach give out a high gurgling sound. She tried to ignore it, wanting to push the bastard just a little further. \"I don't see any candles.\" \"Because we're going out…\" He looked at her as if he'd just given her a big surprise. She didn't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing he had, so she just clammed up. \"Guess I do need a bath then,\" she muttered. Brushing past him with her head held high, she went back to the bedroom and collected a robe and a clean towel. We're going OUT? She didn't get to see the amused look on Vincent's face. - - Vincent had treated himself to a drink and was sitting on her bed, watching some talk show on the TV. Sarah's words had driven a nail through his mind. He didn't feel entirely well. He didn't want to remember. Beaten. Letterman was interviewing a young starlet. Laughter. Nightmares. Music, a band he hadn't heard of before. Blood. A redneck was singing with a goat, and being ridiculed on national TV. Abandoned. The humid air from the bathroom, enriched with scents of fresh soap and shampoo, filled the room as she walked through it, breaking the spell. She had covered herself in a washed-out red bathrobe, and her wet hair had been brushed back and lay plastered against her scalp. She looked fresh and innocent, and for the first time since they met, he found her attractive. I like her scent… Or perhaps it was that she looked sweeter, more vulnerable… more like the Sarah he'd known a long time ago? At this very moment, with that clean, smooth face, it was impossible to believe she'd been through all that shit in her life. She could've been so much more… Sarah didn't speak to him, or even look in his direction. It was obvious that she was still wary in his company, and probably rather pissed… After their last argument, a quiet peace, or more like a non-war, had settled between them. It was nice for a change; he hoped it would last. Sarah rummaged around in her wardrobe, holding up one dress after the other, clearly unable to make up her mind. Vincent decided it was about time he did what he did the best: took control. Quietly stepping up behind the unsuspecting Sarah, he said in a low voice, \"Go for the black one.\" - - Sarah jerked around, she hadn't heard him coming. \"FUCK! You scared me!\" \"Isn't that getting old?\" \"Well, stop sneaking up on me then!\" \"OK,\" he said lightly. \"The black one.\" Sarah pressed her lips together, took the dress from its hanger and went back to the bathroom. The shower had made her feel new, and had washed away some of their arguing and the remnants of fear that had still lingered in her pores. She still didn't trust him completely - he had yet to give her some kind of explanation - but she was looking forward to leave the apartment for a while, and was overall in an increasingly good mood. After putting on fresh underwear and a pair of stockings, she pulled the dress over her head. It was an amazing dress and she'd never used it, she'd worn it only once before, in the store in front of the saleswoman. Annoyingly enough, she couldn't reach the zipper in her back, and after trying it out in different angles she had to give up. \"Vincent!\" He showed up in the bathroom doorway a moment later, leaned casually against the door frame and looked her up and down. \"Zipper,\" she muttered, and turned her back to him. Instead of just pulling it up there, he stepped into the small room and placed himself behind her, the mirror reflecting both of them. Holding the edges of the zipper at her lower neck with one warm, steady hand, he went for the zipper with the other and slowly pulled it up. Then he looked back up at the slightly flushed reflection of her face, and they stared at each other in silence for a moment. Still watching her in the mirror, he pulled the hair away from her face and gathered it at the back of her neck. \"Look at yourself,\" he said softly. She tried to bend her head away. \"Cut it out, I don't want to.\" \"Please.\" Please! Surprised, she looked up at his refection in the mirror. That was the first time EVER she'd heard him ask her politely, and not the usual ordering her around. He straightened her head in front of the mirror and placed a finger under her chin, lifting it slightly. \"You should be proud of yourself, Sarah. Do something about your hair; if you pull it back like this; look what it does to your face.\" Are you for real? She tried to squirm out of his grip, but he still held her hair in his fist at the back of her head. \"And use some color in your face.\" \"I do!\" she hissed. Sarah was increasingly annoyed to be examined like this. It was none of his business. He went on, unmoved by the slight irritation in her voice. \"…and straighten your shoulders. Stop hiding.\" \"I'm not hi… Stop doing this, Vincent! Why are you making fun of me? \"I'm not. I just think you deserve better.\" Better than what? \"You don't know me! You haven't seen me before yesterday, when you came and messed up my life - and my appearance!\" He smiled. \"Yes, I have, I do research on all my jobs. I know your schedule… where you live. I knew you were alone that night...\" Sarah's face dropped. \"Oh.\" How come you didn't know who I was then? Regaining her composure, she snarled, \"What do you know about women anyway!\" Smiling more broadly, he mocked, \"A great deal, I'd say.\" \"'Bout hair and make-up, I meant,\" she answered quickly, turning slightly pink with embarrassment. Suddenly she was very aware of his body close to hers in the small bathroom. \"I know what looks good on a woman,\" he replied calmly, with a hint of tease in his voice. \"Fine,\" she muttered in defeat. Of course he was right, there was no denying that. It was just that she hadn't felt like there was any reason to try to look good recently. For whom would she do that? There hadn't been anyone's attention she had wanted to catch lately. On the contrary: she had been happy to just melt into the walls, to be left alone. ' You are what you feel. Other people treat you by what you express to them. Embrace the world and it will hug you back.' One cliché after the other flipped through her brain, as she was once again left alone in the bathroom. Still, they held some truth. She leaned her forehead against the mirror and closed her eyes. I didn't ask for this. I just wanted to be left alone. Vincent's words, however, had set a little ball rolling, planted a seed. He had seen her. He had taken the time to look right at her, to look behind her mask, and not just see the scar, or her background. I have never been important to anyone. Maybe to Simon once, but he's dead. I've never been important even to me. I've known it in a way; I've just never straightened up and really looked at it. I feel… like somebody…like I am somebody… He sees me. He makes ME see me… Fuck.[Chapter 12] Disclaimer: Do I have to keep doing this at every chapter? Yeah, yeah, I don't own Vincent! Feedback: It makes me SO happy if you let me know what you think about this story. SirGecko , thank you very much for your review. I'm looking forward to see what you think once it's over... In the mean time: enjoy. - Chapter 12 Inflicting Pain… About half an hour later, Sarah had dried her hair and put on some make up. It really was a good looking dress, and she felt elegant and quite classy as she left the bathroom. Full of expectation, she looked forward to see Vincent's reaction. He was lying on his back on her bed, resting his head against the pillow and was glancing at the TV. His suit jacket laid over the arm rest of her sofa and he looked relaxed in his shirt and dark grey suit pants. She only saw his profile, as he seemed absorbed by the TV. When she entered the bedroom, he looked up at her. \"Did you know that the global warming will eventually kill every living thing on this earth? Due to unstable weather with heat, blizzards, tornados and floods. All the inhabitable land will be under water.\" \"What?\" What's he talking about? \"That's what we humans do to ourselves.\" \"Eh… yeah.\" Sarah only managed to look confused. She wasn't really updated on the global warming issues, or any other political stuff for that matter. She wouldn't have thought he was, either. Rising from the bed, he went over to the doorway, where she'd stopped. Without a word, he took a T-shirt that lay over a chair next to him, and started to gently wipe her eyelids, removing most of the green eyeshadow she had so carefully put on. Sarah started to chew on her lower lip in order not to start crying. Her eyes went blank and she swallowed hard, her nostrils flared with the effort of trying to stay calm. She failed. She backed away from him. \"Get the FUCK out of my face, Vincent! What's with you!\" \"As in?\" he replied, seemingly untouched by her outburst. \"As in first you tell me to wear make up and now you wipe it away… And I fucking HATE myself for even putting it on for you in the first place! Fu -\" Sarah stopped right there. Looking at her feet, she bit back a whole lot of mean things she wanted to say to him at that moment He frowned. \"Don't do it for me. Do it for you.\" He removed some residues beside her left eye with his thumb. \"When I told you to wear some make up, I didn't mean you should look like a clown. We're going to a nice restaurant, and you need to look appropriate.\" Sarah's shoulders hung heavy from the burden of the humiliation. \"I'm not going anywhere with you,\" she muttered. Turning around to leave, she was interrupted by a firm hand on her shoulder. Vincent leaned forward and said softly in her ear, \"Yes, you are.\" Spinning around, she slapped his hand away. \"Make me!\" Raising one eyebrow, he met her challenging stare. \"Is this really wise, Sarah?\" \"You said you wouldn't hurt me!\" \"Wrong. I said I'm not gonna kill you. Hurt is not really my business, too many random factors involved… But I know a few ways if you force me…\" Starting to regret that she'd pushed him this far, she still found it impossible to back out. Stubbornly, she said, \"Yeah? Like what?\" \"Like if you don't come with me now; I'll head for a nice restaurant all by myself, boring as it may be, and on my way back here, I'll pass by Peter Millard's place and execute him.\" He said it as if it was the easiest thing in the world, like he was going to buy some milk, and not talking about killing people. The mentioning of her employer's name sent chills through Sarah's spine. … and his kids! Backing away from Vincent, she numbly nodded, immediately resting her case. Her insides clenched and tore at her conscience in an impossible calculation; can't go with him - can't let him go without me … He really is just a murderer! He's not the man I thought he was… would be… Whatever! I've been so wrong! - - They took a taxi to a restaurant in the southern suburbs, the Italian quarter. Sarah sat frozen next to Vincent in the back seat, trying to stay as far away from him as possible. Street lights played across her face, the sun had just set and it was a beautiful, slightly chilly evening. People were walking on the streets, dressed up for Friday night, laughing, standing in line outside the most fashionable restaurants downtown. The city was full of life and Sarah didn't see it. All the way, she stared out the window with empty eyes, freezing cold, tormented by thoughts about bullets ripping through flesh, screams of agony, bodies going limp as life was leaving them… It was as if she was seeing life in a parallel world. Vincent's world. - - The restaurant was small, with only enough room for about ten tables. She wondered how Vincent knew about it, even more so when he saluted the man, apparently the owner, who came to meet them as if they knew each other. They were seated in a secluded corner in the back of the room. Vincent sat with his back against the wall. Sarah put down her numb limbs at the chair opposite him. Staring into the wall. - - Vincent noticed that Sarah wasn't really there. He was in a fairly good mood, though, and didn't pay it that much attention to begin with. He'd decided to do something decent for the first time in a very long time in his life. To improvise… adapt… It felt – different. It felt good in a new way. Not the satisfaction of a job well done. Nor was it the satisfaction of having had his needs fulfilled, whether it came to sex, food or wine, music, or a day on the boat or at his hacienda. No, this was obviously how it felt to do good deeds; to sacrifice something for another human. Selflessness. Max would have laughed... Well, Max isn't around any more, is he? Pushing the thought of the ill-fated cabdriver from that LA mission two years ago deep down where it belonged, he concentrated on the present. Sarah looked like she had swallowed a lemon, and was staring emptily at the menu that lay on the table in front of her. \"Hey.\" He reached out his hand to touch hers. Sarah shrank away and looked up at him with a fearful expression on her face. What the fuck? \"What's wrong? Can't find anything you like?\" \"I'm not hungry.\" \"Of course you're hungry. Try any of their pastas, may look simple but they are the best you'll ever have eaten.\" She shrugged and looked helpless. \"Pick any then. I don't know what to choose.\" Vincent's eyes narrowed briefly before he looked back down at his own menu and chose two main courses, pasta Carbonara for Sarah, and pasta with beef, onion and mushroom in cream for himself. Searching carefully through the wine list, he selected an exquisite Rioja to go with the food. Salvatore, the owner of the restaurant and a close friend of Johnny Corelli, came by, took their orders and gave them a Dry Martini each, at his own expense. Sighing contentedly, Vincent leaned back and sipped at the - perfectly dry - Dry Martini. He studied Sarah again; she hadn't said a word since… since back at her place. What's wrong? Sarah looked elegant in the black dress that hugged her body, giving her curves where she didn't have any. Having done something with her hair, and obviously taking him up on his advice; her neck appeared longer, which became her. The make up was subtle now, after he'd removed some excess color, but it still made her eyes glow. Overall, she looked good. Is that it? Was she still pissed because he'd interfered with her make up choice? Women! \"Do we have a problem?\" She flinched and looked at him, frowned and licked her lips. \"N-,\" she cleared her throat, \"no.\" What's the quiet thing about then?\" \"Nothing,\" she whispered, staring down at the table. \"Do I look stupid to you?\" His eyes narrowed in annoyance over her stubbornness. Sarah looked back up at him, a tear threatened to spill over her lashes. \"You said you'd kill him!\" Her voice, still kept low, was full of accusation. Who! \"Who?\" \"You're fucking unbelievable!\" she snarled a little louder. \"Keep your voice down,\" he said in a low voice, giving her a warning glance. \"Peter. You said you'd kill him if I didn't come with you…\" A tear trickled down her cheek. \"Don't you even remember?\" Vincent looked stunned. Did I? Their waiter chose that moment to appear with their food. Proudly, he presented their dishes and placed them before Sarah and Vincent respectively. Pouring some red wine into their glasses, he then wished them 'buono appetito' and retired discreetly. Vincent actually realized he'd fucked up. He had wanted her to come to this restaurant with him, and his habit of taking what he wants at any cost surely had taken its toll on this situation. Seeing what he'd said through her eyes, as she put it now, made the whole thing look… unfavorable. Smart move, Vincent. Brilliant! He closed his eyes and took a deep breath Suck it up and apologize, Vincent, only chance of mending this. \"I'm sorry, Sarah,\" he said in a low voice. - - Sarah was in such acute inner pain that she could barely breathe. Nothing mattered to her any more. She would prefer it if he killed her, instead of threatening other people – people that she cared about – and keeping her in suspense like he'd done these last twenty-two hours. Their dinner had arrived, but Sarah was unable to eat. Glancing up at Vincent, she saw that he wasn't eating either. She frowned; he looked different all of a sudden. What is it now? He'd had a disgustingly satisfied look on his face the last hour; looking untouchable and pleased with himself. Now he appeared… almost sad… It can't be… \"Sarah, I didn't mean... fuck, I...\" Normally, a rather well-spoken man, he now stumbled on his words, which made Sarah peek curiously at him and squint doubtfully, slowly shaking her head. \"If you didn't mean it, why would you say it? Are you so used to threatening people that you don't care how it sounds?\" \"I said I'm sorry,\" he repeated. His eyes had darkened a shade, and he held her eyes captured with his gaze, almost as if willing her to forgive him. They sucked Sarah in and pulled her reluctantly towards him. Why does he have to be so…him? Wanting desperately to believe his apologies, she gradually became aware of how much she depended upon him. He had become her whole world since yesterday, her caretaker. He fed her and dressed her; he had talked to her… and caressed her. She hadn't felt so much in the center for anybody's attention since… well, never. \"Tell me you're not gonna kill Peter... Please.\" He laughed shortly. \"Can't promise you such a thing. It all depends...\" \"Depends on what? And why are you dragging me around anyway? You promised me not to kill me… can't you just let me go now? Please, Vincent.\" \"Look, I -\" He licked his lips and considered her for a moment, then he opened his mouth to speak but closed it again. Finally, he drew a breath, glanced around the room in his unique way and turned back to her. \"I intend to free you of the contract. I can't let you go just yet... there would be others...\" What! She was stunned. That was the last thing she would have expected from him. Sarah became silent for a moment and let the new information settle in her mind. \"Why are you doing this, Vincent?\" \"Doing what?\" \"Saving me…or… not killing me.\" He didn't answer at first, as if not really knowing himself. Then he nodded, apparently coming to a conclusion. \"You gave me something, Sarah...\" \"What?\" \"Your trust.\" She snorted. \"Well, yeah, it was worth shit.\" \"No, it wasn't.\" He gazed at her for a few more moments, then he seemed to lighten up a little and hit the table with the palms of his hands, making her jump. \"Come on. Eat your dinner. They have great food here.\" \"How do you know?\" \"Long story.\" He started eating, and it was obvious she wasn't going to get more out of him. Jesus! \"Just don't kill Pete, Vincent,\" she whispered. \"Pete who?\" Vincent replied with a glint in his eyes. Sarah closed her eyes and nodded. He never even meant to… She wasn't sure whether she should feel relieved for having her employer out of danger, or worried about herself still being in the company of this man. Just don't kill anyone, Vincent. Just don't kill anyone. -[Chapter 13] Thanks to all who is reading my little piece. Enjoy the next chapter of Vincent and Sarah's painful relation... And, oh, yeah, the disclaimer: I don't own Vincent. - Chapter 13 …And Easing It Vincent had been right, the food was great. The wine soon made her a little light-headed, and the company was - different, enthralling. He was such an enigma; dangerous, sometimes mean and cruel, and yet such a charmer, almost sweet - when he wanted. Sarah reluctantly began to feel the little butterflies inhabit her belly again. She wanted to keep her guard up, but as he smoothly maneuvered them from one interesting topic to another, she began to melt. They talked about shared things from their past: about Simon and why he'd ended up the way he did, teachers they'd both had at school, what had happened to the other kids in Vincent's class after he'd left, and so on. It was bliss to be able to finally talk to someone about Simon; it had plagued Sarah for years, and she'd never talked about it. Just buried it. Deep. Vincent entertained her with exciting stories from his years in the service. Well, at least the things he could tell without having to kill her, as he so nicely put it. He asked about Sarah's parents once, and she replied that her mother still lived back at the house. Upon a comment on the fact that she never mentioned her father, she instantly turned serious. Finally, staring down at the table, she mumbled that he'd died of a heart attack eight years ago, and left it at that. It was clearly a sensitive topic. As if by unspoken agreement, Vincent's parents were never mentioned. - - On the way back to her apartment, the taxi stopped a couple of blocks before her address. \"Road block up ahead.\" The driver nodded forward and looked at them in the rear mirror. \"Car accident or something. I can't get through. Can try to find an alternative way, though, but your stop seem to be in the middle of it all. Wanna walk or want me to try?\" Looking briefly at each other, and without even speaking, they immediately chose to walk. Vincent paid the fare, and they set off. The sky was heavy, and after a few steps it started pouring down, soaking them. Sarah shivered from the cold rain, and Vincent played the good gentleman and gave her his jacket. She couldn't help but noticing that he didn't seem to have brought his gun. \"Thanks.\" Vincent just smiled, obviously still in a good mood. After walking quickly along the sidewalk side by side for a block, they turned the next corner and stopped, amazed by the mess in front of them. A truck had fallen on its side, obviously crushing a couple of cars as it fell. There were ambulances, police cars and fire trucks. Men in uniforms hurried around. They were lit by bright white lights and the blue and red, casting their irregular shadows on the surroundings houses as well as the watching vultures at the side of the scene; making it look all the more unreal in the dusky early night. Sarah stole a quick glance at Vincent as they snuck by. She wondered if he would react in any way to the cops so close by, if he would try to stop her from running to them and begging them to help her. At that exact moment, she realized that she didn't feel any need to ask for help. She knew they weren't done with each other yet, and that she was still in a very real danger. Just not from him… OH, SHIT! A woman was still stuck in one of the cars. They accidentally happened to see her just before a cop covered her with a blanket, while stressfully glancing up at them as they hurried by. Her eyes stared into eternity, and there was something odd about the angle of her neck... Sarah turned pale and wanted to throw up; the poor woman was half way decapitated, and very much dead. Whimpering and quickly looking away, increasing her pace, she noticed that Vincent had seen the woman too, and that he didn't appear the least bothered. Just a few more steps down the street and they entered the relative calm of her staircase. The noise from the street quieting as the door slammed shut, shutting themselves inside their own twisted world. Sarah rushed inside her kitchen and poured a big glass of water, which she drank greedily with trembling hands. \"Shit!\" She wished she hadn't seen that. \"You don't feel well?\" \"No, yeah, no, it's that woman… It can be over so quickly… Life.\" \"Yes.\" \"It scares me.\" \"Why?\" \"Why? Because… I don't know. Aren't you ever afraid?\" \"No.\" \"Not even of dying… alone?\" Her worst fear - and the only thing in life she was certain of that she would have to experience – to die alone and forgotten, with no one there to hold her, and to cry over her. She shuddered, knowing she didn't have enough time. Time for what, Sarah? Bury yourself in work, mourning the life you can never have? - - \"Everybody dies alone. Doesn't bother me... Just deal with it.\" No, he wasn't afraid. But he never questioned his path. She did. She made him do it. He almost hated her for it from time to time – the things she made him remember. But it didn't make him want to kill her. He'd never killed out of personal emotions. Except once… He'd always prided himself of not having any… Liar… Vincent carried on. \"People live pathetic, lonely lives and die alone, in fear, knowing they never accomplished a thing.\" \"No, Vincent!\" she burst out, despair visible in her eyes. \"You have the wrong take on life. Nobody showed you any compassion, so you can't show it to anybody else.\" Grabbing hold of his hands, she squeezed them as she continued. \"No one cared enough to let you stay, so you think all people live lonely lives. But you're wrong! People do live with love, and company, and have children they don't abandon.\" \"Who's talking, Sarah? Who's talking? You live with scars inside and out. Who ever showed you they cared? Except for taking your body?\" \"You did,\" she answered quietly and let go of his hands. Looking down at her feet, she avoided his gaze. Ouch. \"Come here,\" he whispered. - - Sarah stepped into the offered embrace, melting into him. She needed him so much that it almost scared her. Wrapping her arms around his waist, she reveled in the sensation of having him this close, of having his attention, to know that she meant something to him too. At least that's how it feels. God help me if I'm wrong! \"Will you kill me, Vincent?\" she whispered into his chest. She felt him twitch slightly. \"Now?\" Her heart skipped a beat at the casualness with which he said it. It frightened her. \"No, not exactly now.\" \"That would save me some trouble, though…\" He made a move as if searching for his gun. \"Not NOW!\" She let go of him and rubbed her eyes with the palms of her hands. \"Later…\" This was so difficult to express. How is it possible to know now how I'll feel tomorrow, or in a year from now… or some years…? When I get ill. When I get weak. When it's time… \"When I need you to,\" she said in a low voice, as if the request was too large to be spoken aloud. Vincent raised a hand and caressed her hair. He let the pins that held it up fall to the floor, one by one, until they were all gone and he could thread his fingers through it. He liked doing that. \"You got my word.\" - - When he kissed her, it was surprisingly sweet and undemanding. The stubble on his cheeks tickled her and she inhaled his scent, allowing her buzzing mind to rest in the moment. His hands seemed to be everywhere, touching, caressing. Slowly. Carefully. Finally he lifted her and carried her to bed. As he sank down on her, Sarah froze. For a brief moment she had lost herself in her own traitorous emotions. \"Vincent, no,\" she mumbled into his mouth. \"I got it,\" he mumbled back. \"No, you don't understand, I can't.\" \"Sarah, I got protection, don't worry about it.\" \"But… but… it's not safe enough…\" Her face began to crumple with despair. Vincent let her go and lay down next to her, turned towards her. He traced the outline of her face, followed it along her jaw line and down her throat. Sarah swallowed hard under his finger. Vincent smiled. \"Billions of stars in the galaxy, Sarah… One speck on one of them for a moment, then it's over. That's us, lost in space. Do you really believe it bothers me?\" She frowned. \"It bothers me.\" \"Roll with it, Sarah. Enjoy the moment, that's all you'll ever have. No one can tell what'll happen tomorrow. You think you're gonna die from AIDS. You don't know that. You could get run over next time you cross the street. BAM!\" He clapped his hands, making her jump. \"You're gone.\" She looked at him, processing what he was saying. \"I've never looked at it that way…\" Pinning her with his intense green eyes that seemed to flash with heat, he let his finger continue along her collar bone. Tracing the lining of the dress, and then slowly, slowly down the curve of her breast, he gave her time to adjust, time to long for more. Then he carefully hauled her in again. This time there was no turning back. They clung to each other like survivors to a broken life-boat. Knowing there was no one out there to rescue them. And their pain went away. For a while. Sarah cried afterwards. Content. - - \"No, dad.\" Vincent woke, confused. \"Daddy, no, daddy.\" Sarah was squirming in bed. Her forehead was shining with sweat. \"Daddy, no.\" She had a childish tone to her voice that almost freaked Vincent out. He shook her. \"Wake up.\" \"Daddy,\" she cried. \"I'll be good.\" She moved her hands in front of her, as if trying to push something away. \"WAKE UP!\" He shook her harder and she opened her eyes and sat straight up in bed, unseeing. For a moment she was still in another world, another time, then she looked at Vincent with big, scared eyes. Haunted eyes… \"Shit,\" she whispered. Vincent pressed his lips together and clenched his fists, rage building inside. \"I'm sorry… I haven't had those dreams in years…\" her voice trailed off as she looked at him. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" he asked, finally able to form words again. She snorted, slowly coming back to herself again: \"What could you've done?\" He stared at her as the pain built inside. Putting the lid back on, he hissed, \"More than you think. More than you think…\" I should've known.[Chapter 14] Disclaimer: I do not own Vincent, I'm just borrowing him for the fun of it! Feedback: Please? ;) - Chapter 14 Blissful Moments of Peace At ten the next morning, the door bell rang. First once. Then a second time, with an annoyingly persistent sound. Sarah mumbled something incoherent and turned in her sheets, not wanting to wake up, but Vincent was immediately alerted and out of bed. When she noticed his activities, she opened one eye and was wide awake the next moment when she realized he'd not only gotten dressed, but also had the gun in his hand. \"Who is it?\" he whispered. \"I don't know. Should I open?\" she whispered back. \"You have to. You're at home because you're sick. Remember?\" \"Jesus. OK.\" She dragged herself out of bed and pulled an old t-shirt over her head, not noticing it had green stains on its back. The bell rang again. \"I'm coming,\" she shouted and found a pair of soft pants to wear. Sarah didn't get nervous until Vincent placed himself out of sight from the doorway, with the gun ready. What's he doing? \"Who is it?\" she called through the door, her voice still rough from the sleep and adding to the illusion of being sick. \"It's Mia.\" Mia! \"Just a moment, I'm getting dressed,\" she shouted. Then she mouthed to Vincent: \"What do I do?\" He gestured for her to come closer. \"You open, see what she wants. Act normal, remember you're ill. Don't make her suspicious. Who is she?\" \"I work with her.\" \"OK, maybe she wants to check on you. Go.\" He ushered her away. Sarah unlocked the door and opened it a crack. Outside was a well known sight: Mia, a sweet twenty year old with whom she had worked for the last year. What's she doing here? She belonged to Sarah's other life, her previous life. No, my real life… Sarah corrected herself; not really knowing what was real any more. \"Hi, Mia,\" she greeted with a broken voice, trying to get a grip of the situation. \"Oh, you poor thing! You look terrible, Sarah. I'm so sorry to disturb you, but I came with this.\" She held up Sarah's bag, the one she'd left at work, and completely forgotten about since. \"Figured you'd need it.\" She fired off a friendly smile. All the time, Sarah could see Vincent in the corner of her eye, standing absolutely still with the gun in one hand by the bench in the kitchen. \"Thanks, Mia.\" She stretched out a hand to get the bag. \"I didn't feel well when I left, I had completely forgotten about it.\" \"You're welcome. By the way… do you know anything about the door… you know, to the kitchen?\" Sarah felt her knees weaken. Oh my God! She cast a brief glance at Vincent, who didn't move a muscle. He didn't need to; his intentions were as clear as they could be. Making up the lie as she spoke, she mumbled, \"Door? It was gone when I came, I just assumed it was broken or something…\" \"Maybe…\" Mia looked doubtful, or at least that's how Sarah's wound-up brain interpreted it, then she shrugged. \"OK,\" she said lightly. \"I won't bother you any more. Take care - and Pete wants you to call when you get better.\" \"I will… I'm sorry I have to get back to bed now…\" Sarah made an effort to appear exhausted. \"I can see that! See you, sweetie. Bye\" \"Bye,\" she whispered and closed the door before she sank to the floor, trembling. \"You did well.\" Vincent walked up to her and helped her on her feet. He didn't let her go immediately, and as they looked at each other, Vincent's serious features lightened into a smile, at first friendly, then slowly transforming into a slightly predatory grin. His grip around her waist tightened, which caused her skin to tingle. He felt her sudden intake of air as he held her. Pressing her firmly to his chest, he let his hands wander, igniting the fire all over again. - - Later they ate. - - There seemed to be no rush. As the beams from the sun, shining through her bedroom window, slowly wandered across the walls of the apartment, time stood almost still. For a moment in eternity, two people were content with just being. At ease. Sarah fell asleep in Vincent's arms, as they sat in her sofa in the early afternoon of their second day together. She felt safe and happy for the first time in years. - - When she woke, she was tied up again, and she almost panicked this time. No-no-no-no! I can't breathe, I can't – breathe… The impact of the mistrust and the betrayal of their growing friendship hurt more - much more - than the fact that she was physically attached to the sofa. He hadn't said a word about leaving before she fell asleep. Why had he left? Why was she bound? Didn't he trust her? Sarah felt degraded, treated like a dog, like a victim. Like the victim you are. Shut up! She tugged at the strips, helplessly fighting for her freedom and sanity and almost dislocated her shoulder in the struggle, but they didn't budge. What if he doesn't come back? Exhausted, she cried some, and then finally curled up and fell asleep again. - - The door clicked shut, and Sarah jolted out of her sleep. She tried to stand up, but fell back onto the sofa, pulled by the tied-up wrist. \"Get me the fuck out of this!\" she yelled as soon as she saw him. \"Relax, relax,\" he soothed. \"Had to leave for a while.\" He flipped open his switchblade and cut her loose. Sarah glanced at her watch; he'd been gone for nearly two hours. \"Don't you trust me not to leave? You could've just told me you'd be gone for a while. I would've been here.\" \"No, Sarah. It doesn't work that way.\" \"I trust you with my life, for Christ's sake!\" she burst out. \"Can't you trust me not to run away?\" \"Well… you don't have a choice. Do you, Sarah?\" he grinned. No… Sarah massaged her aching wrists and was startled as Vincent caught her arm in his hand. \"What have you done?\" he asked sharply and frowned. Looking down at the bruised wrist that had indentations after the strip along with some dried blood, she slowly pulled her arm out of his grip and responded in a low voice, \"I – tried…\" \"Don't.\" He shook his head. \"We don't need to have this discussion. I've got things to do. I came with this.\" He held up a bag from a Chinese take-away. Sarah pouted, but had to admit she was hungry. The aroma from the bag made her stomach roar. They ate in silence. Meals generally seemed to bring out the worst in them. No, not true, breakfast this morning was magic. Sarah smiled inwardly at the memory. When they were done, Sarah tucked away the leftovers. As she turned around she found that Vincent stood impassively, watching her. - - Work's waiting. \"Gotta go,\" he said just a bit wary, as if expecting her to have a fit. She did. \"OK,\" she said between clenched teeth, and turned away from him. He sighed. \"Unless you prefer to stand for a few hours, I suggest you go sit on the couch.\" \"You're not tying me up again,\" she almost growled, turning to look wild-eyed at him. Unbelievable! Vincent walked up to her, clearly irritated. \"I don't have time for this bullshit.\" He gripped for her arm, but she jumped away. Cornered, however, in the small kitchen, he easily caught her and dragged her towards the sofa. Sarah dug her heels into the carpet and threw herself backwards, out of his grip. \"Don't,\" she gasped. \"I can't stand it, don't! Please!\" Vincent dropped her, as she slipped out of his grip from the unexpected force with which she fought him. As she fell on her hands and knees by his feet, it was obvious who would win this battle. \"Sarah!\" he hissed warningly. \"You're pissing me off!\" He pulled her to her feet, and his grip was much harder this time, bruisingly hard. He was in working mode now, and there was no time for begging, no room for patience. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she squealed and pleaded with him not to tie her up again. Vincent's nostrils flared with anger and his eyes burned with an inner rage as he held her face to face with him. He wanted to crush her at that moment; his hands around her thin upper arms ached to break her. I don't have time for this SHIT! Sarah opened her mouth to say something, but sensed the danger and snapped it shut again. He bared his teeth and considered her for some endless moments, then he shoved her towards the door instead. Suit yourself! \"Get your shoes. We're going out.\" -[Chapter 15] Disclaimer: Don't own, please don't sue. Author'snnote/Feedback: Yes, Please. I love the feedback.

Love/Nicolina. - Chaptern15 Survival Strategies Theynsat in silence as the taxi sped through the dense late afternoonntraffic. Sarah was nervous and fiddled with the hem of her shirt. Shendidn't know what to expect. All the time, she kept glancingnat the man sitting next to her. Thenstranger. Vincentnhad, rather harshly, pulled her with him out on the street, hailed ancab and pushed her inside before he jumped in himself. He'd broughtnhis bag, and had been assembling a weapon quietly in his lap, out ofnsight for the driver. Now he held the gun loosely with one hand andnrummaged around for clips with the other, stuffing several in hisnpockets. He checked something on a small computer before stuffing itnback into the bag. Finallynhe went still, the gun with the attached silencer resting on hisnthigh. He sat straight and looked out the front without moving anmuscle. Yet he seemed tensed, ready for action. Fascinatednand full of dread, she had followed his silent and thoroughnpreparations. Sarah shuddered; she had begun to recognize thenpattern. Before he'd strike, he always seemed to calm down, tonfocus; not wasting energy on unnecessary talking or movements. Lookingnat his watch, and then out at the street, he turned to her. \"Whennwe get there, you do what I tell you and when I tell you. Stay a fewnpaces behind me and out of my way.\" Sarahnswallowed hard and nodded. \"I will.\" Shenrealized he had brought her to the showdown. ' Inintend to free you of the contract.' Shaking with fear, shenknew instinctively what was about to happen. Her consciousness justnhadn't caught up yet. There was no way she could grasp that theynwere on their way to find the person, or persons, that had signednVincent up to kill her. She still had no clue what so ever to whynsomeone wanted her dead. I'mnalready fucking dying any way! - - One of thenmain reasons why Vincent was such a successful assassin was that hennever hesitated. He never wanted to talk, explain or brag, there werenno chances of bribing or flirting or in any other way try to squirmnout of sight from his barrel. Most ofnhis victims never even saw the gun, and were dead before their bodiesnhit the ground. Anothernreason was of course that he was a perfect gun-man, one with hisnweapon; his bullets always hit exactly were he aimed. Whichnbrought him to the fact that he HAD missed Sarah… She'd had thentime to dodge. That…nnever happens… The onlynexplanation he could think of was that he HAD recognized her,nsubconsciously, and that he DID hesitate that little fragment of ansecond she'd needed to dodge and hide. Hencouldn't help wondering where he would've been now if she hadn'tndodged. That wasn't a difficult question. He'd be - probably thisnvery evening - meeting with his next set of hits… Well,nI'm not, and this is much more fun! Thenadrenaline surged through his body, his senses heightened. He feltnalive. Expandingnhis lungs with a deep breath and letting it out again, he cleared hisnmind and focused on his task. This wasnwhat he did the best. - - Whennthe taxi finally stopped in front of a warehouse down at the harbor,nSarah's nervousness peaked. Feeling like she needed to perform annimpossible task, without even knowing what was expected from her, shenstumbled in Vincent's footsteps as he determinedly strode forwards.nHe had tucked the gun in under his jacket, taken his bag and paid offnthe taxi driver. Theynrounded a corner and stood in front of an anonymous entrance in whatnlooked like an abandoned building. Vincent pulled out his gun andnunsecured it as he kept walking, she heard the little click. Sarah'snknees felt like jelly, but she stayed a few steps behind, just likenhe'd said. He seemed to know exactly where he was going. He'snbeen here before! That's what he was doing when he was gone: he'snbeen checking this place up. Somewherenin the distance a blow from a ships horn was heard and a seagull wasnsaluting in the sky. Vincentnopened the door and shot the guard inside with three shots. Poff-poff. Poff. Sarahnjerked from the shock and covered her mouth, preventing the screamnthat wanted to escape. Vincent had already moved forward. Droppingnhis bag in a corner of the foyer as he went, she still had to keep upnher pace to stay in his tracks. In thenstairs to the second floor, they met another man. He began fumblingnwith his pockets - p off-poff-poff - his lifeless body hit the floor before he even had a fair chance. Sarah hadnto press herself to the wall to avoid him as he came rolling pastnher. Her eyes filled with tears, and she needed to throw up. Halfnblind, she almost bumped into the back of Vincent, as he had stoppednby a corner. He gave her an irritated glance and turned away again.nThe look in his eyes made her shiver; he didn't need his gun, justnthat look from him would be sufficient. Deadly. Vincentnsunk down on one knee, gun ready, and peeked around the corner. Thennhe continued through the length of the corridor. Sarahnsnuck behind him on shaky legs, three - four paces, like he'd said. Therenwere voices coming from a room further down the hallway, Vincent wasnquietly testing out each door they passed as they advanced. Most werenlocked, one opened, and he silently pushed it open all the waynwith a raised gun, but the room was black and apparently empty. Intellectually,nSarah knew what was happening, but emotionally she was unable tongrasp the situation. She lacked the experience to handle it, notnknowing where she'd stash the information her brain received as shensaw Vincent kill those two men. He frightened her to no end. She hadnthought he had changed somehow, because he'd told her he wouldn'tnkill her. Now she had to accept that she really didn't know him atnall, that this was probably the \"true\" Vincent. Ifnthere is such a thing. Hernheart sped up alarmingly as they stood outside the closed door.nVincent was still for a moment, seemingly listening, calculating.nSarah didn't move a muscle. Beforenany of them could move, the door suddenly flung open and a tall,nlaughing man exited. As he saw Vincent, his mouth formed an \"O\",nbefore he sunk to the floor. Poff. Poff-poff. Vincent threw himself through the open doornand to the left. Sarahnlost sight of him and had no intention of looking. She heard mennscreaming and gunfire. Scrambling on her hands and knees over thenfloor, she lay down and covered her head with her hands, just on thenother side of the wall, trembling, unable to move, or to evennbreathe. Every gunshot reverberated violently through her body. Shencouldn't hear Vincent firing at all; the only thing that was heardnwas the loud bangs from other weapons. Whatnam I doing here? Why did I insist? Shenregretted the last thing terribly now. All was lost. Realizingnit had gone quiet; she slowly lifted her head, but saw only the dirtynwindow at the end of the corridor. Thennshe heard voices. Calmnvoices. He'sndead! I'm dea- \"SARAH!\"nHis voice was frighteningly sharp and with a dangerous edge shenhadn't heard before. It made her immediately stand up, as if onncommand. There was no way she wasn't going to obey. Afraidnof what would meet her, and even afraid of that voice, she carefullyntook two steps forward, willing her feet to move. Stumbling throughnthe open door, she gasped and put her hand over her mouth in shock.nFirst she saw the bodies; there were three of them, splayed innvarious positions on the floor. Then she saw the blood, somensplattered over the walls and the widening pools by the bodies. Itnlooked like butchery. Vincentnwas standing at the far end of the room, holding his gun to the headnof a fat man who sat by a desk. Sarah recognized him vaguely, but wasnunable to put two and two together at the moment, being in a state ofnshock over the turn of events as she was. This was not her reality.nThings like this didn't happen. Notnto her. O,nbut they do... a small, mean voice in the back of her head kept saying. Younbring them on, Sarah; you bring misery and death in your tracks. \"Sarah,\"nVincent said through clenched teeth. \"Meet Joe Angelo.\" -[Chapter 16] Author's note: This is getting close to the end now. Two chapters remain after this. Sarah has an unexpected encounter. Vincent stays – himself… Good read. /Nic. - Chapter 16 From Hell \"Who?\" she breathed as she hesitantly approached on legs that felt like they would give in any second. The fat man looked at her with an angry expression in his eyes, his nostrils flared and beads of sweat had formed on his upper lip and forehead. He was dressed in a black shirt with several buttons open at the top. A thick gold chain hung around his neck. When Sarah saw his hands with the many rings on chubby fingers, her own hand flew up to her mouth as if she'd been hit. Her eyes darted up to his face again. Oh, God! \"You,\" she croaked. Making an attempt to get up, he quickly sat back down as Vincent shoved the gun closer to his temple. Seemingly processing something, his mouth opened and closed a couple of times. A look of furious enlightenment flew over his features and he stood once more, enraged. \"You're… you're… that BITCH! BITCH!\" Vincent slammed a fist into his face and a cracking noise was heard. He fell back into his chair with blood streaming from his nose. Holding it and moaning, he looked up at Vincent. \"Who the fuck ARE you? She's supposed to be dead!\" He turned to Sarah and pointed a trembling, bloodied finger at her. \"You're DEAD, bitch. DEAD!\" A close encounter with Vincent's fist a second time calmed him somewhat. Sarah glanced at Vincent after the second blow, and the look on his face made her physically ill. He looked merciless, absolutely terrifying cruel and ruthless. She began to realize that this was Vincent working, and that maybe he was two persons, one that was capable of caring and a – fairly - normal interaction with another human, and then this – machine. Killing machine. \"It's him, Vincent,\" she whispered. \"It's the john who cut me. How did you know?\" \"He's the one who put a contract on you,\" Vincent answered dispassionately. Sarah's mind reeled. Why? \"Why?\" She looked at Vincent and then straight at the man. Joe. \"I haven't done anything to you.\" \"You should be dead you filthy little whore!\" Smack. Vincent slapped him in the face. \"Watch your language, asshole.\" Sarah felt a brief gratitude towards Vincent for protecting her. But as she looked up at him, she realized it was all just a power game – a way to make sure he had the man pinned in place by the mere threat. Not only from the gun, but also from attitude and superiority. \"Why do you hate me so much?\" Sarah wanted to cry. What had she done to earn such a dangerous enemy? Joe Angelo was a living picture of hate and anger at that moment. \"Thirty-six months and eleven days,\" he spat. \"That's the time I spent behind bars, thinking about what I wanted to do with you when I got out. You should have just died you fucking bitch!\" Sarah was beginning to get a little annoyed with being called bitch all the time. She really didn't deserve it, and if he hadn't tried to kill her in the first place, he wouldn't have had to spend one single day in jail. She wasn't the least sorry about having had him put away for what he did \"Well,\" she replied angrily. \"You were fucking inefficient at that, and that's probably not the only thing you couldn't handle!\" In the corner of her eye she thought she saw Vincent grin. With a roar Joe stood once more. Poff. He stumbled backwards with a stupefied expression before he fell, screaming and holding his thigh, blood pouring between his fingers. \"Vincent,\" she breathed. \"Please…\" It didn't matter what he had done, she just couldn't bare the fact that Vincent would hurt him - kill him - because of her. \"Please what?\" he asked coldly. \"Don't kill him, he's no-one. He's had his warning.\" \"Sarah, it was never your choice.\" Vincent looked at her with a slightly curled upper lip, as in disgust. \"Please,\" came a broken, sniveling voice from behind the desk. \"I'm… she's right… I've been warned. I won't touch her. Come on, man, don't shoot.\" Poff-poff-poff. Sarah let out a long hoarse wail before she stumbled backwards and turned to run. Tears were streaming down her face. She felt like she was quickly descending to hell; the walls were leaning towards her and the ceiling seemed to fall down. Like in a dream, she couldn't get her feet to move fast enough. She wished she would pass out, but that just don't seem to happen when you need it to. She didn't get far. A firm arm gripped around her waist and she hit the floor. She tried to get up to continue on her hands and knees and managed a couple of steps with Vincent hanging on to her. Exhausted and crying, she fell forward and was unable to get up again. I. Have. To. Go… Sarah wailed in agony and tried to crawl forward and away from him, but Vincent's body lay heavily on her. Getawayfrommegetawayfromme! \"You're OK, Sarah, you're OK. You're safe now. I saved you.\" That made Sarah squirm once more to try to shake him off her. Safe! Hahahahahahaha! \"You killed him! You killed him!\" she moaned. Then she screamed, twisting and turning under his body to try to break free. Vincent held her down, pinning her to the floor. Sarah could see his gun, still in his hand as he held her arm. He shook her angrily, \"I off one fat guy and you throw a hissyfit!\" \"Six,\" she whispered. Vincent leaned closer, \"What?\" \"Six... you killed six!\" \"So?\" \"They're dead.\" \"Yes, they are.\" A new set of sobs wrecked Sarah's body, and she hid her face, not wanting to see him. She gasped and let out a whimper as Vincent grabbed her by the collar and pulled her up from her prone position. Still holding her shirt, he pushed her back forcefully into the wall. His face was a frightening picture of both raging heat and ice cold stone. \"I save you from an asshole that put a contract on you, and all you do is whine? What the fuck's the matter with you?\" he snarled. Sarah stifled a sob and didn't dare to look at him. - - He was about to shake her again, but something stopped him. Looking at her tear-drenched frightened eyes - staring at him in dread - and her pale face, he began to realize that she didn't feel all that well. Perhaps this had been a bit too much for her. His working mode was wearing off, and he slowly began to see things differently. Fuck. \"Shouldn't have brought you,\" he mumbled and abruptly let her loose. Sarah stood and swayed, looking like she would faint any second. Vincent took her arm in a firm grip and pulled her with him. \"We need to get out of here. This is not the place to linger.\" She nodded. Good. Something seemed to get through to her then. Walking calmly through the echoing corridor, they left the mayhem behind. As they stepped over the last body at the entrance Sarah almost stumbled, but Vincent's steady hand held her. He collected his bag and they left - twenty-three minutes after they had entered. Then they simply never stopped walking. Leaving the warehouse, they set off in the direction of the wind. Towards the harbor, where the seagulls flew high in the sky, shrieking in joy over their freedom. Ships were being loaded with goods that would see the shores of distant nations within a few weeks. Ordinary life - so distant from theirs. Vincent had never let go of her arm, and Sarah didn't object. She kept walking numbly next to him, stumbling on her weak legs, supported by Vincent. He should leave. He really should get going, but Sarah's fingers clasped with white knuckles at the fabric covering his arm, and he couldn't. Not just yet. - - \"Are you with me, Sarah?\" Sarah was fighting desperately to lock it in – her inner darkness – it threatened to swallow her at this very moment. The feeling of loneliness, of not belonging to this world was eating her alive. And it hurt like hell. I don't want it to hurt. Make the hurt go away! Through her haze, she heard a distant voice. 'Are you with me?' With whom? I'm not here, I'm everywhere, nowhere ... I should be dead. I'm overdue. They stopped. Someone was shaking her mildly, gripping her chin, forcing her out of her bubble. \"Sarah!\" - - Those empty eyes. Always her eyes. He should have recognized her during his preps for this hit. He should have recognized those eyes. Twenty-three years had passed, though, and he considered it a forgiving fact that she'd been only nine the last time he'd seen her. She wasn't coping at this very moment, she was retracting. I haven't done all of this just to leave her behind as a wreck. Fuck! \"Sarah!\" He forced her to look at him. \"Look at me!\" She did look, but through him, into nowhere. Vincent slapped her. Nothing. He slapped her again. Nothing. He lifted his hand to give her yet another -s mack! – Sarah slapped him. Stunned he touched his cheek. Anger was seeping through her gaze and she said in a low, controlled voice, \"Stop hitting me for fuck's sake!\" The corner of his mouth lifted in half a smile. She's back. \"Needed you to get out of your self-induced coma before you'd stop breathing. We'd be a suspicious looking couple if I had to drag you around.\" - - Sarah slowly shook her head. She was beginning to get angry, and maybe that was a good thing; it took her mind off what she'd just had to witness. \"What's wrong with you, Vincent?\" \"What do you mean, 'wrong'?\" \"How can you kill people so cold-blooded?\" \"By 'cold-blooded' you're implying there's no reason. There's always a reason. I'm not cold-blooded.\" Frustrated she wanted to kick him until he got it. \"People, Vincent! Humans. They have mothers and fathers and children and mortgages and dogs and friends. People care about other people; you're hurting them – us…\" Vincent jerked at that last word. His eyes narrowed marginally and his lips twitched. When he spoke, he said it slowly, as if making his point very clear. \"I. Have. Never. Hurt. You. Sarah.\" \"Yes… and no.\" She licked her lips and tried to decide which way to pursue this matter. \"You have – almost – not laid your hand on me… and I'm still alive. But you hurt me terribly all those times I thought you were going to kill me.\" She studied his face. \"You don't know, do you? You just don't understand.\" Sarah wanted to cry all of a sudden. Not for her, but for him. She took his tie in her hand and fiddled with it. She really wanted to caress him, to embrace this lost man and give him some warmth, but didn't dare. \"What hurt you so much, Vincent? What killed your soul?\" -[Chapter 17] - Chapter 17 Would You Notice? ' What killed you soul?' He snorted. A little melodramatic, aren't we? Vincent hadn't said another word to Sarah as they walked back into town. He was just going to get his things at Sarah's and then he'd be gone. That was all there was to it. She'd be OK now. His work here was done. Sarah would be safe. Right. - - What motivates him? How can he live this way? What made him go down this road - so far, far away from anything even close to what most people would call normal? Sarah needed to know. If she was ever to come out of this experience in one piece, mentally, she needed some answers. If there were no answers, there was no hope. She couldn't keep on living, knowing that this black hole of a man wandered the earth. It would slowly eat her; poison her mind, her soul. He would always be there, because he was a part of her past and now he was responsible for her future. And if there was no hope… then what was to become of the rest of her life? What would've been the reason for her to live through this ordeal? She'd be in debt, but to what? To whom? They walked on, but Sarah needed to stop. A wave of nausea washed over her. Trembling, she gripped for Vincent for support. She had to be strong; she didn't want to crumble in front of him again. Get a grip! Straighten up! Seeing people getting killed before her very eyes wasn't normal. Not to her. Not to anyone. Shouldn't be, at least. How can he? \"Vincent.\" He finally stopped. \"I feel sick.\" \"Breathe, Sarah.\" He gripped her shoulders and looked her in the eyes. \"You're doing fine. Actually, you're doing great. Breathe, and it will pass. OK?\" Pressing white lips tightly together, she nodded and fought the nausea that threatened to overwhelm her. \"Help me home,\" she whispered. - - They had made some tea, and Sarah had put on some music. She was sitting on her sofa with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders, sipping at the hot, strong liquid. Vincent's cup remained untouched. He'd been avoiding her gaze since they got back. She was still cold. The chill on the inside refused to leave her. She knew something was terribly wrong with Vincent, and she HAD to find out what it was, even if it scared the hell out of her. Vincent sat next to her, obviously uncomfortable, at the edge of the cushion. \"Vincent, what happened to you?What turned you into this?\" He didn't react, and she abruptly put her cup down and gripped his shoulders, trying to make him look at her again. He had the strangest look in his eyes, they were darker than she'd ever seen them, and looked hollow somehow. Like entrances to hell. Vincent rose abruptly and began pacing the room in front of her. He looked like a caged tiger , a white tiger, ready to bolt at any moment. He behaved like he was in withdrawal, except that his gaze wasn't dull and dazed, it was razor sharp. \"Tell me, please. You need to tell me!\" she pursued. It was unbearable to watch him. Tell me, Vincent; let it out, whatever it is. You don't have to be alone. All of a sudden he sat down on the low table in front of her. It creaked under his weight. Cornering her in the sofa and pinning her with his hypnotizing eyes, he narrowed them as he spoke. \"I don't need to tell you shit, Sarah. You don't want to know.\" \"I do,\" she pushed on. Ignorant to the fact that in front of her sat the most dangerous man she was ever likely to encounter. \"I'm not gonna stop until you tell. Come on, you need it too, I know you do!\" \"Playing Dr Phil, are we?\" he sneered, unexpectedly raising his voice. She gaped, but snapped her mouth shut again; the venom with which he had said it was a new element in their relation. She'd been the one doing the fighting and screaming. Not him; he'd stayed unnaturally controlled for the most parts. Suddenly he stood, his dark eyes fired up and his nostrils flared in rage. Sarah stood too, backing away from him and maneuvering herself towards the front door, afraid all of a sudden. This Vincent she didn't know, couldn't predict. \"You wanna know? Wanna know who I really am?\" he roared, following her, gripping around her throat and making her gasp in fear. \"I'll show you!\" He shook her violently and threw her away from him so hard her head hit the wall. Sarah produced a half strangled squeak, bit her tongue enough to draw blood and slithered to her knees. When he sank down in front of her, the fury was gone as abruptly as it had appeared. - - \"I'm sorry, Sarah, I'm so sorry.\" His heart pounded wildly in his chest and he had a metallic taste in his mouth. Never wanted to hurt her. FUCK! I gotta leave before… before she makes me do something I'll regret… He'd lost it there for a second, and he was afraid it might happen again. Her presence did something to him; it opened carefully closed and locked compartments within him. It was dangerous. Lethal. He cupped her cheeks in his palms and tried to make her look at him. Sarah gripped his hands with hers and looked up at him with tear-drenched eyes. Biting her bloodied teeth together, she whispered in a broken voice. \"Take me to your world, Vincent. Let me in!\" The desperation and need in her eyes told him of painful loneliness, and an understanding beyond his comprehension. He nodded to himself and stood, taking a step back. In some odd way she knew more of his life, the dark, fearful past he'd been so careful to hide, than she even understood herself. Yet. Her past intermingled with his. They were cut from the same stem. Shredded. Broken. Just barely hanging on. He realized that he could tell her. Then maybe she'll know she isn't alone… Vincent let out a deep sigh of both relief and a kind of frightening anticipation he hadn't experienced before; a foreboding of pain. And finally he told her. For hours he spoke of the abuse, the violence and the fear. How there had been no one to stop his father when he had gotten angry, when the alcohol had dulled his compassion and sense. How he'd used to beat his son unconscious and then call school the next day and tell them he was sick, to give the bruises some time to heal. How he'd used to come in to his room at night to violate him. How he every time the social services had taken him away had sobered up until he'd had him back and then it had gotten worse. All until the day Vincent had been old enough to strike back. At twelve, he'd killed him. He had gotten a gun from a kid at school. By shooting his father in the groin, he'd started with a place that wouldn't kill him at once. Vincent had watched, fascinated by his new power, how the fucker had writhed in pain on the floor as the pool of blood between his legs had grown wider. Then he'd beaten him. To death. After he'd washed himself and got rid of the gun. He'd called the cops, crying, saying someone had broken into their house and that there had been a terrible fight. Something about a woman. They had never had a clue. He had been twelve. Going on thirty. Sarah cried and cried. She had never believed it had been that bad. How had he survived? She asked, and he told her more. Finally they were silent in the blessed knowledge that someone else knew, that someone shared their secrets. Making them less filthy. Less dark. - - To his surprise, Vincent felt cleansed. Yeah, he had told Max once, in the cab. But then he had laughed and joked it away. What twelve year old does that? But now, this, was different. He didn't object as Sarah crawled closer on hands and knees. They had remained sitting on the floor, unable to move to a more comfortable position. As if a painful story demanded a painful position. Vincent closed his eyes as Sarah carefully caressed his cheek, followed the curve of his grayish eyebrows with the tip of her finger, lay her palm against his cheek, leaned over and kissed his eyelids, first one and then the other. He reveled in the sensation of giving in, of trust, of being close in a way he had never experienced in his whole life. When she gently kissed his closed lips he accepted the gift, knowing she didn't ask for anything back. Slowly, they sank to the floor; Sarah held him in her arms and rocked his body like a baby, with tender, careful movements. She didn't stop, she didn't get tired, and she didn't want to talk about herself. Exhausted, he finally he relaxed in her arms, and as the morning broke on the third day, they fell asleep there, on the floor in Sarah's small living room, with a CD playing on repeat softly in the background. And the city woke to yet another day. -[Chapter 18] Author'snnote: So, I'm finally finishing this story about lost souls, andisastrous meeting, a match made in hell and about love, humanity andnwhat it means to be human.

It was like a living organism,nwith a mind of its own. He knew it was a cruel world. And only now henrealized he'd helped to make it even darker. That he'd turned itninto his own twisted playground for getting back at it. Avengingnhis life – or lack of life. Faces ofnpeople he'd never known flashed before his eyes. They refused tonleave him alone. And theynwere all dead. By mynhands. It wasnmere coincidence that he'd failed with Sarah… Or was it?nHad there been a deeper meaning? He hadn'tnconsidered his choice of occupation for many, many years. Perhapsnnever. It had suited him perfectly and he'd seen other people asntrash anyway. He'd never seen anyone that he'd thought of asninnocent or worthy of living, and even if he had ever pitied someone,nhe still wouldn't have hesitated. He'd stopped feeling anythingnway back, when he was still a child. Sarah hadnseen him. And he had seen Sarah. Suddenlynsomeone had meant something. And whatnhe had seen hurt him. He hurt for himself and the boy he'd oncenbeen, and he hurt for her; for her lost years and her lack of anfuture. Vincentnfrowned as he stared at the flaming orange and red horizon,nbeautifully drawn by the polluted sky in the rising sun. All of itnwas too much for now. He needednsome time alone. To figure things out. Hencrouched next to Sarah. She slept peacefully on the floor. He'd putna pillow under her head and laid a blanket over her earlier, whennhe'd woken up. Shaking her gently, he said in a low voice, \"Inneed to leave. There's some coffee and toast in the kitchen.\" - - Sarah flewnup from the floor, her eyes wide and confused. She'd feared this.nShe'd even dreamt it just now. She stoodnin front of him, swaying, and with a pained expression on her face. \"Stay.\"nThe thought of being alone again scared her more than death. To losenhim now that she'd had him so close would make her more lost thannshe'd ever been before he had re-appeared in her life. \"Incan't. You know that.\" He sighed slightly. \"I don't love you,nSarah.\" He stroked her cheek with the palm of his hand. \"And evennif I did, I could never attach myself to you… or to anyone.\" Henlaughed, somewhat bitterly. \"Can you see me as a family man?\" ' Indon't love you…' Anthrobbing ache spread from the center of her chest and radiated outnthrough her body at his words; she felt cold, lost... \"I don'tnmean family, Vincent.\" She choked on her words as tears started tonspill from her eyes. \"I won't have kids, you know that! Just younand me. Just us…\" Her voice trailed off. She looked at himnpleadingly. \"I need you,\" she whispered, staring at her own feetnin defeat, as if the request was so big that she couldn't look himnstraight in the face. \"Please don't leave.\" She needednhim so badly. Hencan't leave! - - Vincentnfelt truly sorry for her. He didncare, probably enough to even stay around for a while, but he didn'tnwant to. It was true what he'd said: he could never attach himself,nand he'd hurt her more by giving her false hopes. He nevernused to stay in one place for long. He needed to keep moving, nevernknowing what would happen or where he'd be the next day. Vincentnreally didn't know where he would be the next day. His nextncontract had been lost during his hibernation at Sarah's, and fornthe first time in many years he didn't have a pre-determinednschedule. Dropping out of a contract without any kind of explanationnwasn't a smart move. He was most likely blown in the business andnwould have to fight like hell to be able to get back his position. Getnback? He wasn'tnso sure any more about what he wanted to do next. Sarah had awokennsomething in him. That little lingering humanity he'd thought hadnbeen gone forever, to the point that he'd barely considered thenissue, was suddenly itching deep inside of him. Like scarntissue. And itnfelt… good…? It didn'tnfeel entirely normal. What'sn'normal' anyway? \"I neednto be going. Come here.\" He pulled her towards him and embracednher. The hug was tender, and in it he gave her all the affection hencould muster. \"Don't be afraid, Sarah. You'll always haventhis…\" He bent down and whispered in her ear as he placed anlittle object in her hand. Then he closed her fingers around it. Vincentnleft without knowing to what or where. But he felt free. Released. Thanknyou, Sarah. And good luck. - - Sarahnstood there, swaying, with an intense pain in her chest. Henmight as well have shot me, 'cause that's how it feels. As henwalked out the door, never turning around as he pulled it closednbehind him, she fingered the little crumpled cartridge. It was thenone he had retrieved from the floor behind the counter back at thencafé, and inside was a little piece of paper with a phonennumber written on it. He didn't get to see it, but through herntears, a weak smile appeared. He'llnkeep his promise. I'll be seeing him again – when I need him… She tooknone deep breath and let it back out. The painnhesitated slightly before aiming another stab at her. Then shentook another breath, feeling an unexpected rush of excitement as shenrealized she could leave the apartment and just… go anywhere. The prospect of just walking down the street outside her buildingnsuddenly felt surprisingly appealing, even thrilling. If thingsnhad turned out just a little differently, she wouldn't have beennaround breathing that breath, or taking that simple walk. Suddenlynendlessly grateful to be alive, she turned to look at her apartmentnand her smile widened. I'mnstill here! I'm still fucking HERE! Hittingnthe button on her stereo, Mick Jagger's raspy voice filled the roomnand Sarah sang along with all her heart. \"Butnit's aaaall right now, in fact it's a gas. It's aaaaall right –nI'm Jumping Jack Flash – it's a gas,gas,gas.\" - - Threenyears have passed and I haven't heard a word from him.

It's been a long time but I'm sure you remember. HEY!! I'm back! I know I got a lot of flack for taking down \"To Live Or To Die,\" but I didn't like it anymore. It was too rushed. There were some good things about it, and some stuff I'll keep – as you'll be able to see from the first chapter – but there were some flaws that I just couldn't live with, so down it came. And you'll be seeing familiar things and new things, new perspectives and old perspectives. I don't know if anybody even cares anymore. I kinda feel like I was one of the first people in this section to begin with, and I'm one of the last to leave. It's been a while, I'm a bit rusty, but when Vincent comes to visit, especially after a long absence, he's a hard muse to ignore. And I'm not talking about the gun, either. LOL All right, this is going to move slow. And I don't know how often I'll be able to update, between work and everything, but if I get a bunch of hits and some nice reviews I may pick up the pace. Good reviews encourage the author! They also have a tendency to go to her head, so I'll try to avoid that pitfall. Every chapter is going to be named after a song I think applies to the story. So without further ado – here we go! 8888888888888888888888888 Chapter One – Shadow On The Sun Peter made his way along the beach. Vincent's home was tucked away in the edges of the thick jungle that lined the Thai beach. Songklah was his home, but he'd never been here for this long. He'd never gone this long without a job. And it worried him. Peter never worried. It wasn't in his creed. The sun had just set and the colors of the clouds were a brilliant, dazzling display of beauty. During the day, most everyone stayed inside, daunted by the heat and humidity. By sunset things became cooler, and the Night Market opened, and people danced and sang and drank and made love. Vincent sat in his lounging chair, legs up, a cold drink at his side. He was dressed in shades of beige, almost to blend in with the sand around him. His eyes were covered by his expensive and custom-made sunglasses, but he knew that Peter was there. Peter saw it in the slight incline of his head. \"Have a seat,\" Vincent said in a conversational tone, when Peter was close enough. He did, watching the rest of the fading glory of nature. \"So how are you?\" Peter asked in his muted British accent. Vincent gave him one of his subdued grins. He didn't look at him, just continued to watch the sunset through dark lenses. \"How should I be?\" he replied cryptically. Then, he pushed the glasses back so that they perched above his crown of silvered brown hair, and finally gave Peter a look. \"I mean, that's why you're here, isn't it? You think something is wrong.\" Peter shrugged. There was no game playing with Vincent. He lived and died by manipulation and knew every single trick. Either this conversation was going to be straight up or it wasn't going to happen at all. \"You know, personally, I don't care,\" he said. \"I mean, I don't care about anything. But truth be told, Vincent, you and I are the closest thing either of us has in the world to anything even remotely resembling family. So it would just defy the basis of human nature if I didn't show you some concern.\" \"I'm fine,\" Vincent said, although it was clipped. \"Oh, yes, you're fine.\" Peter knew he was going where no one else dared to go. Nobody spoke to Vincent like this, if they didn't want a gun in their face, or at least a few broken ribs. \"You're always fine, just like me. And I wouldn't begin to argue the point with you. However, it has been a marked two weeks since you've taken a job. And that is a break in your routine. You never go more than a week, not in the last half dozen years, without a job. So I came looking for you. Isn't that what I should have done? Isn't that what you expected?\" Vincent gave a barely perceptible nod. \"So you're saying I wanted you to come here.\" \"Maybe you did. I would say that you're only human, but we both know you aren't.\" These words were spoken in a sigh, almost dismissively. No big deal. \"I would really like to hear your excuse, however. I'm sure it will provide my empty life with some genuine amusement.\" That did manage to get a smile from him. And a bit of a chuckle. \"And thus we come to the point. You're here because you're bored.\" \"And your timing was perfect,\" Peter supplied. A pause descended between them, both waiting for the other to speak again. It was Peter who said the most dangerous thing to say. \"You're still thinking about her, aren't you?\" Vincent's smile, already faded, disappeared entirely as his jaw tightened. Then he pursed his lips and gave a little jerk with his chin – a nervous gesture that Peter knew better than anyone. He was thinking of exactly the right thing to say. \"Well,\" and Vincent's voice was very, very careful, \"it's simply good workmanship to review a job. Spot the flaws. Learn how to avoid future mistakes.\" Peter rumbled in his throat. Vincent's mistake had been very bad for business. Luckily, Annie Farrell would never practice law again. She'd be lucky to walk and talk. Still, for Vincent's perfect marksmanship to have taken a dent like that meant one of two things – the silver fox was losing it, or he had been distracted. And then the unpleasant third option. He'd done it on purpose. \"That's good, I suppose,\" Peter said, nonchalant. \"Perhaps it will come in handy for your next job.\" Vincent quirked an eyebrow. \"I haven't agreed to any next job,\" he pointed out. Peter felt a mild ripple of surprise. \"So does that mean you're not planning on ever taking one? Vincent, if you're thinking of retiring, it would have been best to tell me.\" Vincent gave a twitch of a shrug. \"I'm still thinking about it.\" All right, enough was enough. It was bad that the job had made the papers. The Attorney General's office in Los Angeles made so many ripples over the death of its witnesses that it had made the national news stream, and Felix Reyes-Torrena had gone from local infamy to world-wide. For Vincent to walk away now would mean he would retire in disgrace. And pride, Vincent's or his own, didn't allow that. Furthermore, Felix was pissed. Sure, Annie was out of the picture, but she wasn't dead. And worse, ever so much worse, Calliope Fanning was alive. Vincent should have killed her, he should never have let her walk away from him with knowledge of his existence. And yet, foolishly, he'd let her live. Not out of some slip up, some mistake that could happen in situations like that, but deliberately and consciously. \"I've never in the last six years ever made you do anything you didn't want to do,\" Peter said, his voice friendly but firm, \"but I'm afraid that I must insist that you take this next job.\" \"And what job is that?\" He sounded bored, but Peter knew it was to cover up his annoyance. Peter produced a plain, unmarked envelope from his jacket pocket and set it on the table beside the drink Vincent had not touched. Vincent looked down at it, and then up at Peter. With a cocky smile, Peter asked, \"Would you like to open your present or have me spoil the surprise?\" Vincent frowned at him, and then picked up the envelope. With this thumb he split the top open, reached inside, and her picture came out. Nobody but Peter would have ever caught Vincent's reaction. But then the hit-man said, \"She looks exactly the same.\" Under his breath, almost to himself. Peter sighed. \"Look, I, of all people, understand eccentricities. I've lived my life on them. You, however, have not, which is what makes this difficult. Felix wants you to fix your mistake. He claims he's giving you a chance. I made it clear that she was not on the list he'd given us, and he accepted that, but made it clear that if I wished to continue conducting business, he would take care of this matter. Now, personally, I don't care. He can threaten me all he likes, and if he becomes a nuisance I could easily send someone after him. I'm bigger and I have more power, and he knows it. He's gotten a bit too full of himself with this world-known-name nonsense. However, it would be foolish of me to ignore it and think I could continue with business as usual. And I hate hassles. So I told him that if your performance was questionable, I could send someone else, someone very good, to solve this matter to his satisfaction.\" Vincent straightened in his chair. It made Peter feel a pang, deep in his heart. It was unusual for him to pity anyone, but Vincent was perhaps the only other human being in the world who he felt was worthy of it. \"I have not done this yet,\" Peter went on smoothly. \"I wanted to speak with you first.\" \"Who would you send?\" Vincent asked. A grin quirked the corner of Peter's mouth. \"Rochester.\" Vincent bridled. \"You can't be—\" \"Vincent, you made a choice. Now I have to make mine. You didn't think your actions wouldn't have repercussions, did you? You of all people know how fates intertwine. In spite of your creed, people do notice certain things. They notice when a woman survives driving a taxi cab for a hit man, no matter how indiscernible he was, and especially when that woman has a rather sensational story. I've heard rumors of her writing a book. I'm attempting to have them investigated, see if there's something I can do, pay her off, keep her from publishing.\" \"That should be easy for you,\" Vincent said, although his tone was anxious. \"True. But there is the matter of Felix. So, I give you a choice, now. You can take this job and finish what you started. Or, you can retire. And do whatever the damn hell you please.\" He said this with a knowing smile. Vincent frowned. \"As in?\" Peter sighed. \"Sometimes you are very thick. You can take the job, kill Calliope Fanning, and either retire or continue, your choice, with no black mark on your record. Or, you can retire now – or go rogue, if you wish to be more colorful about it – and go and save her. Or you could just do nothing, continue to sit on this beach and watch as many sunsets as you please.\" Vincent didn't speak for the longest time. Peter waited, patiently, giving him time to think. More than likely, he wasn't going to get an answer today, but Vincent's life had been about making quick decisions that had to be right. It was one of the reasons he was still alive. \"Why would I want to save her?\" Vincent finally said. Peter clucked his tongue. \"You let her live to begin with, Vincent. You're fortunate that I'm the only one who knows what that means. You liked her.\" \"Maybe, but why would I risk so much for her?\" \"I don't know. But once a man shows one eccentricity, it's inevitable that he'll show more. I'm not judging you, Vincent. I would be the last one to ever do that. Whichever of these choices you make, nothing will change between you and I.\" Vincent ducked his head a bit. Peter knew it was the closest he'd ever get to seeing his appreciation. Peter understood. He was not one for shows of emotion either. \"If I decide to save her,\" Vincent said, \"you won't be angry about Rochester?\" \"Of course not,\" Peter chuckled. \"Of course, I'll also never give you a job again. Hence, the retirement. But that shouldn't be a problem, should it?\" \"No,\" Vincent agreed. \"And I guess I won't hold it against you either if he kills me.\" \"No,\" Peter agreed. \"I'm going to have to tell him, however, that I offered the job to you first. So he might be expecting you. Just to make it fair. I can't let things be too easy for you, can I?\" Vincent chuckled. \"No, you can't. But why Rochester? Why not Berk or Sam?\" \"Because I have to make it look good,\" Peter said. \"That, and Rochester annoyed me last week.\" \"How?\" \"Shot off his mouth about going into business for himself to a competitor of mine. He's very smart, Vincent. You'll have to kill him if you expect to ever have a moment's peace in your life again.\" \"Or you,\" Vincent pointed out. \"You never cease to amaze me with your cleverness.\" \"It's so much easier to let the dogs finish each other off,\" Peter agreed. \"Is that what I am to you? A dog?\" Peter just looked at him. Vincent laughed. 88888888888888888888 All right, if you want more, anybody out there had better review! I'll wait![Chapter 2] Disclaimer: What? I don't know Vincent? But I have this receipt…. Vincent: What is that? Gimmie that. ( He snatches the receipt ) Me: I got a thirty-five percent discount. Vincent: That's not for me. That's for the job. Stupid Max, giving away my money… Me: Well, I guess this day just sucks for you. You're not even in this chapter. Vincent: What? You think these people read this stuff for your interesting characters? Or worse, for that Ray guy? Me: Ah, well…maybe. But I know that some people will be happy to know that Jackson Rippner makes a kind-of-cameo. Vincent: ( bridling ) Rippner? That idiot I caught in that other writer's room? You are not telling me that he's— Me: Hey, you took off! Grabbed old whats-her-name and disappeared into the closet! You left me alone with him! You get what you pay for, toots! Vincent: ( dangerously ) Call me toots again. Me: Toots. Why, what are you going to do? You want to see the end of this fanfic, buddy, you'd better me nice to me. Vincent: Sure, I'll be nice. Just wait until the fanfic is over, and I'll show you how nice I am. Me: Ah…uh. ( uncomfortable ) Okay, well, I guess that's your cue (to the reader) to read on. And I hope I'm alive when this is over. Vincent just smiles wickedly. (If you're confused, go read a story in this section called \"Not The Type,\" about chapter three or four or so. Actually, read the whole thing, it's pretty good) 888888888888888888888888 Chapter Two – Daughters Callie had nightmares. Dr. Gregg told her that it was normal. Dr. Martinez reassured her that they would fade with time. But it didn't make them less painful. Or less terrifying. Some nights, she was driving the cab, and he was in the back seat. Those always lasted the longest. He was talking to her, about things, she couldn't remember. Just having a rambling conversation. They would argue, share things about themselves. She couldn't turn around, only glimpse him in the mirror. His voice was clear and distinct, as if right against her ear. It always broke down into a fight. These dreams would always end with her spinning the cab, and as it spun, her adrenaline surged and her body woke up. Others, it was in the jazz club. She was sitting at a table, waiting for him to come back. When he did appear, he walked around, indiscriminately shooting people in the face. Everyone screamed around her, but she couldn't get away. She was tied to the seat, and when he finally reached her table, he wanted to pretend that everything was fine. She would get herself loose and he would chase her out into the street, where he would press her up against the wall, start kissing her, and then strangle her. Her inability to breathe was what would jar her from those dreams, and always with a sore throat. The third one, however, was the worst. That was the one on the train. She was always crying hysterically in that one, running and screaming and begging Vincent to stop chasing them. Annie was in front of her, and sometimes Vincent would shoot Annie in the back of the head, and sometimes he would miss – it depended on the variety of the dream – and always they were running from car to car, a never ending stream of them, one to another. The train would stop and they couldn't get off, and then it would start again and they'd be running, endlessly running. That dream was the hardest to wake from because it just went on and on. Nothing stopped it. She hadn't fully realized how badly that night had affected her. Even when Vincent disappeared through the security gate, she still felt him hanging over her. A ghost. She barely remembered digging out her cellular phone – she had to turn it back on and wait for a signal, as Vincent had turned it off after Ray called her that last time, bugging her about visiting her father – and no memory at all of the ride back into town. Her first clear memory was of hearing that Annie Farrell wasn't dead. It didn't matter, Callie told herself. It didn't soothe her guilt one drop. Sure, they tried to give her credit. One of the first things that Callie had told Ray was that Vincent had shot Annie, on the blue line going into Long Beach, and it was this information that allowed them to get to Annie in time to save her life. But she lay in a comatose state, and the doctors said that her condition did not give any hope for a full recovery. She was going to be lucky if she could talk again, let alone practice law. Vincent may as well have killed her, for all the good her surviving did. Callie knew, rationally, that it wasn't her fault. Dr. Martinez told her that on the correct occasions, when it would penetrate into her brain. Vincent had been given the contract, Vincent had wreaked his havoc across the landscape of the city. She was an innocent bystander, sucked into his deadly game. But she had tried to rescue Annie. She had tried so hard, and she'd failed. Vincent was a killer. Machine-like, cold blooded, ruthless. Dr. Martinez told her that it had only endangered her own life to thwart him the way she had, and that she was lucky to be alive. She could not take responsibility for Annie. Callie heard it. She said she believed it. She wanted to. But somehow, she didn't. Truth be told, she much preferred to talk to Laurie. Her father, Ray Sr., had once been a cop, like her brother. Difference was, her brother liked being a cop, and her father had done it because it was what he was good at. When the opportunity for retirement came, he had taken it without hesitation, and there was no going back for him. He didn't miss it one bit. But during his time with the L.A.P.D., he'd made a few friends, and Dr. Laurence Gregg was one of them. Originally, Gregg had worked as a police shrink, the kind who worked over criminals, determined their mental states. While Laurie, as all his friends called him, had loved his job, the draw for bigger and better things was heavy, and before he knew it he was running an institute for the criminally insane. Laurie was a good fifteen years her senior, but there was something youthful about him that drew her to him. Tall, lanky and mildly grizzled, with thick, graying brown hair that curled at the nape of his neck and facial hair that was barely kept neat, he walked with a cane, which he didn't hesitate to swing at people who annoyed him, because his right leg had been mangled in a car wreck when he was sixteen, and he had never fully regained its use. His humor was quick and cutting. He was brilliant, and he was always right, which made most people hold the opinion of him that he was an arrogant asshole. The night Ray had brought her home from the airport, after the police station and then the hospital, she had charged into her father's arms. The sweet relief of being home had overpowered any urge she had had to play it cool. While she told Ray vehemently that she didn't want her father to know what happened, it came out. There was no help for it. And Ray Sr.'s first reaction had been to get her to a therapist. Callie tried to fight. She claimed she was fine, but her father saw through her easily. She agreed to move back into the house and out of student housing on her college campus, and take a few days off from school, and even quit her job – she could never drive a cab again, she knew that. Then she locked herself in her room for three days, appearing only bleary-eyed through a partially opened door to accept trays of food, and when she came out, she had a two hundred page manuscript under one arm. She wouldn't let her father read it, although he wanted to. It was a detailed and intimate description of that night. Ten hours of hell. Ten hours of Vincent. Still, she wouldn't go see a shrink. Ray Sr., who was rather cunning, more so than either of his children gave him credit for, told her that she should consider one of the offers that were coming in. People wanted her story. She was the next movie of the week; she could be on networks or even on the big screen. He knew perfectly well that these things not only did not appeal, they repulsed her. But still, the offers came, and they were pestered until Ray Sr. considered selling the house and changing their phone number to unlisted. If she had put so much work into writing about that awful night, her father pointed out, she should do something with it. Put these hounds to rest. And he knew someone who could help her. And that was how she met Laurie. A few days with Laurie had helped her come to a few conclusions. First off, she did need a shrink. He set her up with one of the women on his staff, a particularly talented woman by the name of Guadalupe Martinez, known as Lupe to her later on. And second, she did need to write a book, but not alone. He would take her under his wing. He had the know-how and experience to help her, and he didn't even want publishing credit, merely to be mentioned as one of her advisors. And slowly, the next week evolved into something resembling a real life again. There were days with Laurie when they worked for six, seven hours straight. And then there were days like today, when Laurie came to the house, and they spent the middle afternoon hours in the living room of her father's house, psychoanalyzing the weirdos on the Steve Wilkos show. \"He's lying,\" Laurie said. He was sitting, his bad leg up on the couch, his other on the floor, giving him a sprawled appearance, the exactly same place she had sat that night. She was in her father's place, in his favorite chair. \"He's not blinking,\" Callie pointed out. \"I mean, he's straight faced.\" \"Yeah, but look at that face,\" Laurie argued. \"I mean, look at it.\" Callie squinted. The particular participant, as they were known, was a man with little hair on his head but a great amount of it on his chin, frizzy curling masses of red on either cheek. He was young, maybe her age, maybe a bit older, and he'd just been accused of child molestation. \"Why do people agree to this stuff?\" Ray Sr. asked as he entered the room. Even though he was retired, he still looked and smelled like a cop. He had thin brown hair, pushed back like his son wore his, a craggy face, and the wide blue eyes his daughter had inherited from him. Ray Jr. had somehow gotten brown ones, which was a bit of a genetic anomaly. He was in black pants and a white button down shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbow. If he'd been wearing a tie it would have looked like he was heading to work. \"Money,\" Laurie quipped dryly. \"People do all kinds of humiliating things for money.\" Callie flinched. \" I'm not going to have to go on one of those things, am I?\" Laurie turned and looked at her. Her tone, which before had been lighthearted, had sudden cooled into a somber one. She'd been approached, he knew that much. Oprah, Maury, Dr. Phil…they all wanted to interview her. Even Sixty Minutes had given them a call. \"You know you don't have to do anything you don't want to,\" Ray Sr. said, his mildly gruff voice reassuring. Callie looked a bit relieved, but not much. \"All right, I have to get back to work,\" she said, standing up. \"That paper isn't going to write itself.\" \"Hang in there, only a few weeks to go,\" Laurie said. He stood up, stretched and turned off the television. Callie gave him a mildly amused grin over one shoulder, made her way down the hallway to the spare room her father was letting her use as a private study, and shut the door softly. \"Thanks again for helping her out,\" Ray Sr. said as Laurie limped into the kitchen, cane firmly clenched in his hand. \"I don't know if that old wacko in the psych department would have let her write that paper if you hadn't strong-armed him.\" Laurie nodded, looking down. Raymond Fanning was older than him by twenty five years – when he'd started with the L.A.P.D. he'd been a fresh-faced naïve little punk who thought he knew everything. Ray had been quick to show him he didn't. And from what he'd heard, Ray Jr. had inherited the same kind of wisdom, the knack for following procedure and always getting it right. There was a lot to be said for doing things by the book. Even though Laurie still allowed that certain amount of rebellion. Perhaps Callie was more like her mother. He'd only met her a few times, and hadn't even met Callie until all this unfortunate mess had happened. \"I wanted to talk to you,\" Laurie said, moving deeper into the kitchen. He watched as Ray Sr. went into his routine of sandwich making. He was a master at it, no doubt. The older man paused, however, at the tone of Laurie's voice. \"What is it?\" \"I was approached by someone,\" Laurie said, seeming a touch uncomfortable. He shrugged it off – Ray had a right to know, it was too important. \"It seems that some people have taken interest in the world Callie is doing…that I'm doing with her.\" Ray grunted. \"Well, she's been given pretty specific instructions not to talk to anyone yet, not until the Justice department gets done with her,\" he reminded him. \"You know you can't get your book published without the all clear from them.\" \"True, but we can field some offers,\" Laurie mused. \"I just have some concerns, Ray. About her safety.\" \"My son is already way ahead of you,\" Ray Sr. assured him. \"He recommended some private muscle. We're going to be talking to some guys tomorrow.\" Laurie nodded. \"Good. But…\" It bugged him. That conversation over the phone bugged him. \"What is it?\" Ray pressed. \"I got a phone call yesterday evening at my house. A man named Jackson Rippner. He said he represented some people who were interested in purchasing Callie's story. I asked him if he was a publisher, but he said he wasn't. He implied that it might be better for everyone concerned, especially Callie, if the whole ugly matter just went away. He said they understood that she had suffered considerably and they were willing to compensate her financially. He even named some numbers, and…\" Laurie paused, feeling awkward. \"They were considerable.\" Ray's eyes had narrowed at him. \"Did they threaten her?\" he asked, his voice tense. \"Not outright,\" Laurie said. \"I had some feelings like this when you came to me, Ray. All this business with the Torrena indictment. I'm surprised they haven't put Callie in witness protection.\" \"The D.A. told me,\" Ray said, struggling to keep his tone calm, \"that if they could figure out a way to use her, it might come to that.\" He suddenly looked pale, much older than 65. \"If that happened, I'd go with her, you know.\" Laurie nodded again. \"I know. I'm just worried that she's already a target. Maybe you want to get someone in sooner.\" Ray suddenly brightened. \"Hey, look, I know that this might sound nuts, but…do you think maybe she could stay at the institute?\" Laurie scowled for a moment. St. Anthony's Institute for the Criminally Insane, known affectionately by some and not-so-affectionately by others as \"Crazy Ant's,\" hardly seemed like a bright, happy place where Callie would feel comfortable. \"Why?\" he rasped. \"Well, first of all, I know you have some staff rooms, places for people to stay and be comfortable, some for your resident doctors, so it's not that far-fetched that she'd be comfortable there. Second, it's secure, isn't it? I mean, it's guarded like a prison.\" \"To keep people in, not out,\" Laurie said. \"You want to throw her into a building with some of the worst nutjobs in L.A.?\" \"You could stay with her, help her finish her work, get her college degrees settled, get this book written…it'd be safer than her staying here. Ray and I have been taking turns around the clock, he's got a couple of his friends helping too, but even if we hire armed guards, I still don't feel safe.\" \"So putting her in a prison will make you feel safe,\" Laurie said dryly. \"She wouldn't be in a prison and you know it. Some of your facilities make the Hilton look shabby.\" Laurie chuckled. \"In the executive wing, I guess that's true. I don't know, Ray, I'd have to pull strings, and it'd be improper for me to use the institute's resources for personal reasons--\" \"Screw improper,\" Ray said, slapping his open hand on the counter top. \"Forgive me if I get a little reckless when it comes to protecting my daughter.\" Laurie considered him thoughtfully. \"I could arrange an early internship. There might be a few things I could do. Give me a couple of days. In the meantime, get your security. You'll want to have them at the house, anyway, whether she's here or not, to protect yourself. These people don't respect family.\" \"Yeah, tell me about it,\" Ray sighed, weary. \"I never liked my job, you know that? I did it for thirty-odd years and I didn't like a single damn thing about it. Know why? I hate criminals. I mean, they just turn my stomach. Car jackers, robbers, burglars, rapists, murderers…I don't know where my kids get the fascination for it from. Not from me, that's for sure.\" He paused. \"I can't believe that man had the nerve to come into my house and terrorize my baby girl right in front of me.\" Laurie didn't say anything, just looked at Ray, sympathetic. \"I'd like to get his gun away from him and get him into a closet for five minutes alone,\" the older man finished with a growl. \"Show him what it's like to have someone bigger than you treat you like a punching bag.\" Laurie winced. It was just as well that Ray was retired. He may have been a good cop, but he had no understanding for psychology. Someone like Vincent, from what Callie had told him, had probably already had that done to him, when he was young. By a father or an uncle or even an older brother. People who embraced violence usually did so because they wanted to prevent violence from happening to them. That was his theory, anyway. \"All right, I'll be in touch,\" Laurie said, and limped out his exit. 88888888888888888888888 \"Dad would kill you if he knew about this.\" Callie pulled the gun from the holster secured to her belt. It had long since been made to fit comfortably – she was used to its weight, used to the sleek silver and black instrument inside of it that slid out and into her hand. Her palm no longer sweat as she held it. And her arm muscles no longer ached after firing. She was used to the recoil, used to the sound, used to the vibrating explosion as if it were happening right inside her own chest. The first time she had fired this gun, she'd nearly wet her pants. She'd been shaking and nervous and looking at her brother pleadingly, not wanting to do this. Not like this, anyway. She knew weapons training would come at some time in her career, but Ray was insistent that it be now. \"You can't have a concealed weapons permit if you don't know how to handle a weapon,\" he said. Her first shot had been miles off target. The recoil had gone down into her knees. Her stomach ached and she threw up afterwards. Ray wouldn't let her eat lunch until practice was over after that. A few days later, it was gone. The nightmares fed her, she knew. Whenever she didn't want to go to practice, she would just remember one of them, a moment, a flash. It was all she needed. She would never be a victim like that again. Never. Now, she stood on the range, her right arm bent so that the elbow was flush against her ribs. Her left was also bent, only so that it cut across her chest, fingers of her left hand extended over the right one, shielding herself as the weapon fired six rounds, emptying the small clip, sending particles into the air toward her face. They scraped against her palm. \"Good, very good,\" Eddie said, coming around. He waited until she had holstered her weapon before walking to the target at the end of the range. The bullets were neatly clustered in the middle. \"You're a natural.\" \"No, I've been doing this every day for almost eight days now,\" she said. \"I'm just a fast learner.\" Ray came around, dressed down in his jeans and white T-shirt, his own gun holstered to his hip. \"Don't think it's going to end anytime soon,\" he told her in a low-key voice. \"Well, you'd better use public ranges from now on,\" Eddie said, coming over to them with the target neatly rolled up. \"Here, for your bedroom wall,\" he said, handing it to her. \"Yesterday, Daniels was asking about what we were doing here every day. He wanted to talk to you, Ray, but I told him it was your day off.\" Ray chuckled. \"Well, I guess it couldn't last forever. But I appreciate what you've been doing, Eddie.\" The two shook hands as Callie pulled off the protective glasses and yanked the baseball cap off her hair. The tail, which had been shoved through the back, flopped in the humid breeze. Eddie flashed her an extra grin – he was cute, she had to admit. He was young, newer to the force than her brother, but already he'd been given a lot of responsibility helping the SWAT guys train on this course. The fact that they were on it now spoke to how big a favor Eddie owed her brother. \"What have you been telling Dad?\" Ray asked as they left, checking back in their equipment, referring to her earlier remark. \"Self defense training,\" she said. \"Hand to hand, I told him.\" \"Ah, a half-truth. Always better.\" \"I don't like lying to Dad but he's already upset enough.\" Her voice was low, almost bitter, as she said it. \"And what about you?\" Ray asked. She could hear the muscles in his jaw tightening. \"Me?\" she said with a loud sigh. \"I'm sick to death, that's what I am.\" She quickened her pace, and Ray had to hurry a bit to catch up with her. \"Why did this happen to me!\" she shouted as soon as she was in his office, the door shut behind them. \"Why did he have to get into my cab?\" Ray watched as Callie nearly exploded. She was trying to hold it in – a blossoming mushroom cloud that didn't want to expand. \"I had a life once. Now I have this!\" She shook the empty holster at her waist. \"I had my own place and now I'm living at my father's house again! I had a job and I was going to get my degree, and now people have to go beg my professors to accept independently written papers so I can finish my courses! AND I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR!\" Ray hissed between his teeth. That last outburst had rattled the windows. She shut her eyes, squeezing back the tears. \"I hate him, Ray,\" she said, her voice cracking. \"I hate him so much. I just burn inside with how much I hate him and I can't do anything about it.\" He crossed the room to her and put his arms around her. She didn't respond at first, just let her arms hang limply, but she rested her head against his chest. She breathed deep, trying to get the tears under control. \"Is this the first outburst you've had?\" Ray asked after a quiet minute. \"Second or third. The first one I had with Dr. Martinez in our third session.\" She sniffled. Her voice was gravelly. \"So she knows about the anger.\" \"Shooting the gun helps,\" Callie replied. \"She says to keep doing it. It's good anger therapy.\" Ray nodded, his chin against her hair. \"It's going to get better, you know,\" he said in a calm, reassuring voice. \"It will.\" She sniffed again. She squeezed him, closing her eyes, just quiescent against him for a moment. \"And I hate that I'm being such a damn baby about it,\" she whispered. Ray almost burst into a laugh, but instead it came out more like a quick bark. \"Callie,\" he said soothingly, \"you're not being a—\" \"Yes I am.\" She pulled away, wiping her eyes. \"I am. Worse things have happened to people. I mean, look at Annie.\" \"That isn't your fault.\" \"I know, but…I was there. I feel responsible.\" She gritted her teeth. \"And here I go whining again.\" \"Right now, it's fresh. It's raw.\" Ray was talking like a cop now, being rational. Almost impartial. \"You have to give it time, Opie.\" She gave him a quick grin at the familiar nickname. \"All right, Junior,\" she replied. \"Will you give me a lift over to the hospital?\" Ray nodded. \"What are you reading now?\" \" Lord of the Rings ,\" she said. \"Second volume. I think Annie likes Aragon. Her heart-rate goes a touch faster when I read his parts.\" \"I was always a Gandalf fan myself,\" Ray said, holding open the door.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: Really? We have to go through this every time? Vincent: Yes. You wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong impression, would you? Me: The wrong impression? Like, I'm the only girl here to still wants to play? Face it, honey, I do just about own you. Vincent: No, no, Michael Mann and Tom Cruise own me. Me: ( snorts ) The only human being Tom Cruise owns is Katie Holmes. Vincent: Be nice. We share a face, you know. Me: You don't look anything like Katie Holmes. Vincent: ( exasperated sigh ) Why do I put up with you? Me: Because I write damn good fanfic, that's why. And since when is it your scene to tell anyone to be nice? Usually that's what all us fangirls are telling you. Vincent: Some fangirls you're all turning out to be. First you all abandon me for that Ripper guy-- Me: Rippner. Vincent: Whatever. And now he gets a part in my fic? How is that fair? Me: Get with it man, life's not fair. You'd be the first person to say that. You've mellowed since your movie debut, old man! Vincent: Getting shot does that to a person. Me: Well, don't worry, you'll live through this fic. Although you might wish you hadn't. Vincent: ( droll ) Thanks a lot. Really. Me: You're welcome. Now the rest of you, get out there, read and review, dammit! I know you're there, I can see you hitting the story on my Stats page! And BTW, there's many part of this next chapter that are flashing back to the first story, because it's been so freaking long I had to use some flashback stuff, and also I stole the first chunk directly from the old \"To Live Or To Die\" story. Stuff like that is going to happen a lot. Vincent: Shame on you. That's cheating. Me: Indeed. ( winks ) 88888888888888888888888 Chapter Three – Mr. Lonely He wasn't going. It was stupid. Why hadn't he killed Callie? He asked himself again and again. It rotated through his mind, a never-ending cycle that was starting to feel like an organ grinder on his skull. But he wasn't going back. Not to fix his mistake, nor to \"rescue\" her. That idea was ridiculous. It was over and done, he didn't look back. And if Peter didn't want to send him any more jobs, well, that was his problem. He wasn't much anymore into killing for money anyway. And he had enough money to last himself for the rest of his life, however long that might be. It didn't matter. He needed a distraction. It was a stereotype, it was true, but the reason stereotypes existed was the simple fact that certain commonalities existed between persons of similar culture. In this case, flesh in Thailand was cheap. Sure, they tried to dress it up, call them \"escort services,\" but Vincent didn't bother with the pretty pictures. He made his call. He asked for his regular. She came quickly, and had a nearly eager look on her face. Vincent began to wonder if this was the best idea. But the tension was getting a bit too unbearable, and a man had needs, after all. There was a routine to it. Vincent didn't like the cheapness of a woman in a slinky black dress showing up in his room, banging her on the table and then leaving her cash as he discretely checked out. He'd tried it once, it hadn't been to his taste. The nightlife was something to be experienced, and while he usually did it alone, the rare opportunity to share it with Cathy, as he called her, was not unappealing. He rather liked the illusion of being on a date, so dinner always came first, followed by music of some kind. Cathy was wearing black, as she always did, and her hair was flamed with some kind of bright red dye, something new for that evening. He rather wished she hadn't done it, he preferred her silky, jet-black locks, but as he had his eyes closed half the time he was with her, he didn't feel the point was worth arguing. She smiled at him, chatted sometimes when there was something for her to talk about. He didn't really give her much room. There was a rather cheap jazz band that played sometimes in this one nightclub that had a tendency to change locations by the month, and Vincent used up most of the conversation either complaining at how bad they were, or complementing them on their occasional good performance. It wasn't their fault, their instruments were not the best quality, yadda yadda yadda, he knew he would carry on at times, but she was paid very well to sit, smile and agree. On the days when he didn't feel as talkative, she would pick up the slack talking about the movements of the market, who was arrested for what, and faithfully reciting the occasional jazz facts that amused him to teach her. On this evening, she was unusually quiet. As was he. Her almond-shaped eyes, a pale golden color that reminded him at times of a cat, watched him, especially when she thought he wasn't looking. Her quiet, contemplative state made him uneasy. She wasn't paid to think, and whatever she was thinking about, he just didn't think it would be good. The band was particularly bad that night, but Vincent had no heart to start badmouthing them. After all, beggars couldn't be choosers. He considered going to a club where they played prerecorded music, knew that would cost money and possibly make him and Cathy stand out, but might almost be worth it at this rate. He just wished he could stop thinking. Finally, she leaned forward, arching her back in a cat-like pose, exposing her chest to him, which was artificially enhanced. His gaze settled on her breasts and he began to think that perhaps the date portion of the evening could come to an early end. \"You remember my friend Tina?\" she said in her rich, Thai accent, which had mellowed considerably since he'd first met her. Vincent gave a half-shrug. Yes, she would also talk about the other girls, either just to trash them or to tell amusing stories about things that had happened to them. \"What about her?\" Vincent asked, disinterested. \"She got married.\" Ah, so that was the cause of that look she'd been wearing all night. \"To who?\" Vincent asked. \"A regular.\" \"Won't her other regulars get upset?\" Cathy let out a coy, coltish laugh. \"No, Vincent, she has no others.\" He looked at the woman, intensifying his gaze, saw her melt under it, and for a moment, lose track of what she was going to say. He leaned closer to her, to kiss her, and shut his eyes, visualizing another face, another pair of sweet lips— \"Tina planned it. As we all do. Find one who cannot resist you. Eventually, he makes you his wife.\" Vincent froze. \"That's a big gamble,\" he said, inches away from her face. \"What if the one you pick is already married?\" \"There are ways to prevent that,\" Cathy went on with a sigh, her breath, freshened by her drink, drifting over his cheek. \"We are very cunning, you know.\" \"Oh, I know,\" Vincent said with a smile. He reached under the table and his hands found her soft, slender leg. Slowly, he made his way up to the edge of her skirt. \"But most of the time, men don't like to be pinned down.\" Cathy just went on smiling. \"You know, I read that in America, women give their favors away for free, and then the man never marries her. Is that true?\" \"Yes, it's true,\" Vincent said, feeling the warm inside of her thigh. \"You see, that is why it works for us,\" Cathy explained. \"Because we are not free. Eventually, every man realizes that it is easier to make a whore his wife than to make his wife a whore.\" Vincent cocked an eyebrow. There was a certain truth to that. \"So what happens when the man doesn't propose? How long does it take for her to…figure it out?\" Cathy winked at him. \"Has never happened yet, Vincent,\" she purred. It was almost enough to wreck the mood. But some calls were more urgent than the annoyance of a female mind, intent on ensnaring a mate. Vincent paid the bill and took her back to a hotel room, where he made damn sure she didn't have any false ideas about what he really wanted from her. 888888888888888888 Afterwards, he returned home. Alone. There was a heavy brown envelope on the table in his makeshift dining room. His home was very basic, although everything was very expensive. He had nothing else to spend his money on. Other than jazz. Vincent picked up the packet, turning it over in his hands. The picture of Callie from before was resting underneath it, and it flickered up at him, catching his eye. It was a black and white, taken from a distance through a zoom lense. It didn't capture her, not the way she was. But he remembered that last moment, standing in the airport. The dead look on her face as he tried to kiss her, and then the spark coming back. \"There you are,\" he'd said to her. And kissed her again. It had been a mistake to get into her cab. He had known it from moment one. He remembered telling himself that he should get out, that he should only hang with her to the next stop, but what choice had he had? South Union wasn't exactly an easy place to hail down a cab. L.A. wasn't like Chicago or New York, where the cabs swarmed like bees in September. It was the second stop where things had gone to hell. He should have killed her when she tried to escape. Left her with the two dead punks. Just left the whole mess behind. Before he got attached. He seemed to remember telling himself the same thing as he stood in that gas station lot, staring at the pictures that reminded him of downtown Gary. Something had been wrong with him that night. It was still wrong – he couldn't place it, but it had somehow acquired her face. Her face, which stared at him from new pictures, more recent ones. The same face he left behind. The same pale, shrunken face of someone defeated. He could see it in her eyes. She was still walking around with him in her head. He was still with her. The thought made him smile. Force had always been his means to every end. Violence was just a way of life, a way to control things, a way to keep outside things from controlling you. He did not hesitate to use it, he did not feel one way or the other about it. He had been charming with her, he told himself, during that first ride. Even the second one. But when those punks had tried to mug her, well…plan B. No problem. He had initially pegged her as a spoiled girl who really had no idea how the world actually worked. It wasn't common to see too many pretty college girls driving cabs, and her novelty struck him. She seemed to have a cool, almost tough veneer, but once he got her talking he knew she was just like everyone else in the world, playing it safe. And then she had tried to get away from him. The pure brass balls of that move had impressed him. Impressed him so much, that he hadn't killed her. Like he should have. Sure, he reprimanded her. Just because he liked spunk didn't mean he could tolerate it. And it seemed that made it better, made it more fun. Breaking her spirit, taming the beast, just made it that much more interesting. Because the job had not been interesting. Not for a long time had it been interesting. That was why he was off that night, he told himself. He was bored. He was limited. He was asking himself if this was all he was, just a hired, if very expensive, gun. Just a machine that took lives. Wasn't there anything else of meaning? And why hadn't he ever cared before? So he worked on her. As if she was the personification of that thing inside of him, curling and squirming and trying to get out. The more she fought, the more he enjoyed it. The harder he had to press, the more attractive she became. She was still fighting. These pictures had been taken at a shooting range. She was with a man he thought he recognized as her brother, and another one, also looked like a cop, blond haired and skinny. She was turning around, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, with a gun holstered at her hip, a pair of safety goggles over her eyes and a pair of ear mufflers strapped over her baseball cap. Vincent smiled. She was trying to shake him off. Still trying to fight him after he was long gone. He felt flattered. More than that, he felt intrigued. Maybe he'd made his previous decision too hastily. The prospect of this…it was like life was starting to gain back a bit of its taste again. Underneath the pictures was a fat package of papers that had been faxed through. There was a typed note on the front, no salutation or closing, just simple words. \" Jackson sent me these not fourteen hours ago. They came from the office of Dr. Laurence Gregg, whom she's been working with. I thought they would be of interest to you .\" Vincent flipped the note back. Fax paper was so thin, slick against his fingers. But the first words, the first lines of what was written there, made him forget everything else. \" That's the why . There is no reason . There's no good reason, no bad reason to live or to die.\" Such were the words spoken to me by the man I only knew as Vincent as he rode around in the back of my cab, using me as his personal driver to take out the hits he had been paid to make that night . 888888888888888888 \"I'll get the trash,\" Callie said, coming up behind her father as he finished washing the last dish. She grabbed up the bag where it was tied and sitting beside the back door, and flashed him a smile. \"You almost done?\" he asked her as she unlocked the deadbolt and let in the cool evening air. \"Almost,\" she said. \"I'm going to stop tonight and finish tomorrow. I should have it into him by late tomorrow afternoon.\" She pushed open the screen door and gave him a classic, \"whoopee,\" look, the one to show him what she really thought of what she was doing. Somehow, the thrill of getting her degree just didn't seem to exist anymore. But she had set her mind to a purpose, and Callie did not quit. She dragged the bag behind her as she lumbered down to the dumpster her father shared with a handful of neighbors. A long time ago about five of them had gotten together and rented it, splitting the cost between them. It was locked, and she had just remembered to grab up the key before taking out the bag. The dumpster was down the driveway and far off to the left, but she made it without incident. They lived in one of the older neighborhoods of L.A., where it was still relatively nice and everybody knew each other. \" Ten million people in L.A. and nobody knows each other .\" She was coming back up the walk when his voice went through her head. She stopped, and realized she was at the exact point in the driveway where they had stood that night. Her car, an old Delta 88 Oldsmobile, occupied the spot where the taxi had sat. Vincent had stopped her, rested his backside against the trunk and started to ask her personal questions. He'd asked her personal questions before, but that had been before he'd shot and killed two street thugs in front of her, and murdered a jazz musician he claimed to have liked while she was in the bathroom. It was also before he pushed her up against a wall and kissed her. He'd kissed her again, sitting here. The memory was suddenly striking, fresh and clear as if it were happing right now, and she was watching it, a spectator in her own flashback. He reached out with the other hand and firmly drew her to him, so that she stood between his legs, which were parted slightly to get her closer. Their faces were inches apart. \"You know, I'd almost hoped you'd be an unappreciative brat,\" he murmured. \"Complain about your parents even though they're saints. But you don't. I'll bet every night when you pray, you pray to your mother to watch over your father. I'll bet you're keenly aware of how much he misses her, and yet love him all the more for staying with you.\" \" You talk about me like I'm special,\" she said. \"I'm just someone who's mature enough to appreciate her parents.\" \" Which makes you probably the most well-adjusted person I've ever known,\" Vincent said. And then, after a beat, he kissed her. Again. The motion of Vincent's lips on hers was so quick that it took her by surprise for a moment. It wasn't really a full kiss, she realized, when she pushed him away. His mouth had been open, and had gently rested on the corner of hers, fully expecting her to kiss him back. The surprise and – was it? – hurt on his face threw her, and she wasn't quite sure what to do for another second. Surely he couldn't be serious. Vincent put down the manuscript – that was what it was, a manuscript. A first person account, her account, of that night. The things he had done, through her eyes. It was stark and sharp and painfully accurate. Even the kissing. He didn't let himself think too much about kissing her, but it was as if he were suddenly doing it again. As if she were here, in his arms, and sense memory could feel and taste her. Full on scarlet stained her cheeks now. Her eyes had gone hazy, distant, a desperate attempt to escape the stress of the situation. Using the opportunity, he lifted one hand to the snaps on her jacket. His knuckles pressed ever so gently against her breast through the leather. \" You were attracted to me?\" he whispered, ruffling the thin hairs around her ear. She shivered as one snap came undone. \" Never trust your first impression,\" she muttered. Humor was the last defense. He slipped two fingers into her jacket as he undid the next snap. She wasn't pulling away. \" Oh, always trust your first impression,\" Vincent smiled. \"Maybe I thought the same thing.\" Confusion fluttered all across her face. He had her on the ropes and he just kept yanking her around. In a few more minutes she was going to be helpless. He made himself stay focused and slow as he undid the snaps, one by one, and watched as she struggled to think. When his hands finally slipped inside, caressing her curves, reaching up and finding her breasts, her eyes shut and she was almost scowling with the effort that took. He shifted his weight, his fingers enjoying the softness of her body and the slinky sensation of the shirt, as he pulled her farther and farther into his grip. Soon, her face was resting against his, the bridge of his nose pressed against her forehead, so he had a front row view to her face and how she was fighting back against her attraction. Callie shut her eyes, sucking in a hard breath. It wasn't fair. It wasn't normal. Why had she been chosen to carry such a burden? Laurie had told her that it was natural for her to feel this way. Vincent had manipulated her, relentlessly, throughout the night. It was only normal for there to be scars. She just had to work through them. Deep breaths, push the memories back. It was past, all in the past. Vincent paused, thoughtful. \"What if it was true?\" he said. \" What if what was true?\" \" That we were dating, and that you brought me home tonight to meet your father. Did he like me? Would he think I was suitable?\" At the look she gave him, he amended, \"I mean, taking out the…obvious.\" Swallowing, knowing this was impossible, she carefully picked her answer. \"He seemed to like you well enough, Vincent. You were very polite.\" \" Yeah, but would we get along?\" Vincent pressed. \"Like family?\" Vincent shoved the manuscript away. He didn't want to think about it. All his life he'd lived with the fact that his father blamed him for the death of his mother. He'd been completely rejected. That pain never went away, but he told himself it didn't matter anymore. He was a man, he had his own life. He looked around. This was his life. He sucked in another breath. Callie …always her face. Always the memory of her. Nothing had been right since that night. He couldn't understand one bit of it. And even less could he bear the thought of the world without her in it. Peter…Peter understood. Vincent did not know how, because he did not understand it himself. But Peter had come to him and given him clear choices, and his blessing for whatever he decided. Vincent decided. He was going back to L.A. 88888888888888888888 Callie came back into the house. She was shivering. \"Is it getting cold out there?\" her dad asked as he wiped his hands on a dishtowel. \"No,\" she said, hearing the tremor in her voice. \"Just a breeze.\" Her father studied her carefully. \"Bad memories?\" he asked softly. She looked at him, stricken. He thought he could see her trauma…she would die of shame if he even had a clue. She needed to talk to Laurie. First thing in the morning, she was going to call him. \"I'm going to go to bed,\" she said, keeping her tone soft. \"You going to lock up?\" \"Yeah, don't worry about it,\" he said. \"Get some rest, finish your paper. Before you know it, sweetie, your future will be here.\" That's what I'm afraid of , she thought. So I've had a few people wondering how the titles are connected to the chapters, and it's just the song I feel is the most appropriate to the content of the chapter. So here is this chapter's song: Mr. Lonely--Akon Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely I have nobody For my own, I'm so lonely I'm Mr. Lonely I have nobody For my own, I'm so lonely Yo, this one here goes out to all my playas out there man, ya know? That got that one good girl dog, that's always been there man, like... And then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave. I woke up in the middle of the night Wondering why she had to go and take that flight Could have sworn I was dreamin For her I was feenin So I had to take a little ride Backtracking on these few years Tyring to figure out what I did to make it go bad Cause ever since my girl left me My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

Chapter Four – This Ain't A Scene The lunch crowd at the Barney's on Orange was intense. Rarely was it ever like this, but it was close to graduation, and everyone was rushing around, trying to get everything done. Located only a few blocks off her end of campus – or what used to be her end, anyway – Callie found it a very easy stop to grab a good, cheap sandwich. \"You're going to have to share a table,\" the waitress, Tammy, told her as she seated her at a newly-cleared row. A booth on one side and about six chairs across on the other, it was just waiting to be filled. Callie hardly paid attention as she sat down and flipped open the menu. The waitress was seating two others, and they were spaced apart, but she knew that wouldn't last long, as another group came in through the door. As she had gotten the coveted corner, the other two – both of them men – had to scoot down, so that she was effectively surrounded, so that the other three could stay together. \"Oh, wait,\" said the man sitting beside her, suddenly patting down his bag, \"dammit, I forgot my wallet. Could you excuse me?\" Callie hauled herself out of the seat and let the guy go. When she sat back down, the man across from her was grinning. \"Worst nightmare, personally,\" he said. \"Losing my wallet, I mean. I couldn't image going anywhere without it.\" \"Me neither,\" Callie said, smiling and chuckling politely. Then she went back to the menu. \"You know, I'm embarrassed to admit, I haven't been in here before, but it seems like a crazy popular place,\" the man went on, apparently oblivious to the fact that she wanted to be left alone. She looked up at him again, and was struck by the brightness and the roundness of his eyes. Glacier-blue. Brilliant. He had the appearance of someone who had just come in from the cold, with his high cheeks a soft pink, and his mouth a full coral-rose pout. He was attractive, she had to admit. \"So what is it that makes everyone want to come in here?\" \"Usually the sandwiches,\" she said. It was difficult, playing nice. The last time she had talked to an attractive guy, he'd put a gun to her head. But he didn't look anything like Vincent. He was young, with longish brown hair and a wide smile. She tried to let down her guard. \"Uh huh…\" He picked up the menu. \"Which one do you come in for?\" \"The club, usually,\" she said, \"but today it feels like a meatloaf sandwich day.\" \"Ah.\" He looked at that item, pressed his lips together and raised his eyebrows, a facial expression to show keen interest. \"My mother used to make those for me for lunch, always on Tuesdays. Monday night meatloaf.\" He grinned at her, charming. She nodded back. \"My father usually does spaghetti,\" she said. \"You know what it's like to get cold spaghetti in your lunch box?\" He chortled. \"I couldn't imagine. But cold pizza works, and so does pasta salad, so I guess it can't be that different, can it?\" \"Oh, it can,\" she laughed. The waitress came over, anxious to serve the customers and get them out the door. Callie ordered a meatloaf sandwich and a rootbeer, and her new lunch companion did the same. \"I'm sorry,\" the man said, leaning a bit closer to her, \"I didn't even get your name.\" \"Calliope,\" she said. \"It's Greek, from my grandmother. You?\" \"Jackson,\" he said. \"Nothing special about it, really. Although I think my parents were having a bit of fun at my expense, because my last name is Rippner.\" Her eyebrows shot up. \"That wasn't very nice of your parents,\" she said with a shocked smile. \"Nope,\" he said. \"But you…Calliope. That was a Greek muse, wasn't it? Of poetry or something?\" \"Heroic poetry,\" she confirmed. She considered it for a moment. \"When I was little my father called me his kaleidoscope. Come to think of it, I think that was my high school nick-name, too.\" \"Yeah, I learned a long time ago to stay away from nicknames,\" Jackson agreed. \"So are you a student?\" \"I'm finishing,\" she said. \"Graduating this month.\" He frowned at her. \"Huh. You know, it's the strangest thing,\" he said, looking at her closely. \"But all of a sudden you seem really familiar.\" \"I do?\" Something prickled in the back of her head. This is a nice guy , she told herself. This is not Vincent . \"Are you a student as well?\" \"No, not a student. I work as a manager. But you…did you ever…did you ever drive a cab?\" The shock vibrated into her spine. Then she let out a gasping laugh. \"Um…up until about two weeks ago, yeah.\" She narrowed her gaze, studying him. \"You know me from that?\" His mouth split into a very wide grin. \"I think so! Yeah, I must have ridden in your cab at some point. Not too many pretty female cab drivers around here, to be honest.\" \"No, not really,\" she agreed. \"Well, I must have made an impression. Usually all anybody sees of a cab driver is the back of his head.\" \" Her head, in your case,\" Jackson corrected her playfully. \"So why did you quit?\" \"Oh, I was just doing it to make some money through college,\" she said, suddenly feeling a jolt in her stomach. She hadn't said she quit, but Jackson must have been assuming. He was just lucky, guessing correctly, she told herself. \"And it just didn't hold the same thrill for me anymore.\" \"Yeah,\" Jackson said, rubbing his lips with two fingers. \"Yeah, I guess getting dragged around all night by a hit man would do that to you.\" The world slowed. Callie felt everything around her grind down, like a movie where the projector was running out of steam. Her ears were humming and all other sound was blocked out by the sound of her own heartbeat. Finally, she licked her lips, swallowed, and said in a scratchy voice, \"What did you just say?\" \"You heard me.\" His voice had gone quiet, but she could hear it perfectly. Her mind was somehow aware of the noise around her, but she didn't hear it. There was just him. He tossed his head, casually. \"It's perfectly understandable, Calliope. That kind of experience would be highly traumatic. In fact, I'm sure that possibly nobody else alive has the kind of story that you do. But that's why you're writing it, aren't you?\" She pressed her lips together and swallowed hard. Her throat felt like it had grown cactus thorns. \"What do you know about what I'm writing?\" \"I've read it,\" he said, glancing around, making sure nobody was eavesdropping on their conversation. \"Not too bad, really. Kind of hastily written, but the first half looks like the edits are going pretty well. Not the kind of thing you could publish raw, but—\" She slapped the table. Her fork did a neat little flip and landed half-way between them. The water glass rattled, and a shadow fell over them. They both looked up and saw the waitress staring down at them, eyebrow rising quizzically, holding their soft drinks. \"Something wrong?\" she asked. Callie looked back at Jackson, who met her eyes without blinking. Then he turned back to the waitress and flashed her a winning smile. \"My friend just gets a bit too enthusiastic about proving her point,\" he said apologetically. He turned back to Callie. \"Calm down, sweetie, you don't want to embarrass us both.\" The waitress looked from one to the other, put down the root beers and went about her business as usual. Callie leaned forward on her hand, her eyes boring holes into Jackson's face. She had lived through Vincent – if this punk thought he could play her-- \"What the hell do you want?\" she hissed at him. \"Easy, gunpowder,\" he said, his voice still low, casual. \"I was actually complementing you. I understand where it's all coming from, you know. I mean, something like that, happening to a young woman seeking to enter the field of criminal psychology, could be a career builder for you. It's already gotten the attention of the head of Crazy Ant's. I hear he's already reserving a position for you.\" She just glared at him, eyes sizzling. She wanted to smash this rodent under her heel. She was going to die alone; there simply weren't any trustworthy men in this world anymore. \"And that's wonderful. No reason why it can't all happen. Except for publishing this particular book. There really isn't any need of that.\" \"Who do you work for?\" she asked in an undertone. \"Doesn't matter,\" he answered, \"except for the fact that they are extremely well funded, and are happy to offer you enough money to keep you very comfortable for the rest of your life, in exchange for you burying this book. Burying it deep.\" \"You work for Felix Reyes-Torrena?\" Jackson shook his head. \"He's a small fish. But small fish are important, to protect the big fish. And really, Callie, if I may call you Callie…that's what everyone calls you now, correct?\" Her eyes were going to smolder in her sockets. The waitress came back with two plates of food. Jackson looked up at her, flashing her another charming grin. \"Could I get that to go, please? I'm sorry, but it turns out I'm going to be leaving sooner than I thought.\" The waitress left Callie's place and rolled her eyes, holding Jackson's in her hand. Jackson pulled a ten dollar bill from his pocket, reached up and slipped it into her apron, and she winked at him, getting the message. \"And really, Callie, what good would this really do you, anyway? I mean, if you publish this story, it's going to attract all kinds of attention, and I'm sure not all of it will be favorable. I mean, you really think Vincent will like it if he sees his name in print?\" She flinched. \"You know him?\" she asked. \"You know Vincent?\" He pressed his lips together and stared at her. \"I can't guarantee your safety if you decide to continue on your current course,\" he said, matter-of-factly. \"But when you come to your senses, I'll be in touch.\" \"How?\" she asked, as the waitress returned with a brown paper bag. Jackson took it, handing her a fifty. \"I have my ways,\" he said, and to the waitress he added, \"This should cover both tabs, shouldn't it?\" The waitress gave him the brightest smile they'd seen from her all day. Jackson winked at Callie, put the bag under his arm and headed out the door. Callie looked down at her pre-paid lunch. She wasn't hungry anymore. 88888888888888888 Somewhere in a nondiscriminate apartment in L.A., a telephone rang. A man with a receding hairline, a handsome face and a Southern Welsh accent answered. \"Cash.\" \"Trent. It's V.\" \"Yeah, they told me you were coming.\" \"Airport? My flight arrives at eight o'clock Sunday night.\" \"Same time man. Not normal to see you again so soon.\" \"I've got some unfinished business.\" \"Yeah, your pack is light. Anything else you need?\" \"Nope. Thanks.\" The line went dead. Trent Cash nervously toed the twin bags that sat underneath the table. He was making the exactly same drop, only tonight and at a train station. Same intel, same everything. But he wasn't paid to ask questions or to give heads-up. Whatever was going on, it wasn't his business. He was just an extremely well-paid bag boy. 8888888888888888888888 \"Well, in a way, I'm almost glad,\" Laurie said. \"Means I don't have to waste time speculating anymore.\" \"So he called you too?\" Callie asked again, still incredulous. \"I just don't believe it. I mean, what is the big deal? It's not like the Justice department can even make solid connections – you know if they could I'd be in witness protection like that.\" She snapped her fingers. It echoed strangely in the late afternoon sunlight of Laurie's office. \"I'm not even allowed to use Felix's name.\" \"It's not about Felix, I don't think,\" Laurie said carefully. \"I think this has more to do with Vincent.\" Callie looked away. The color had long since left her cheeks, before she'd come in here to talk. Now she was turning slight yellow in pallor. \"I know it's upsetting, but we've already discussed the strangeness of him leaving you alive.\" \"I know,\" she snapped, harsher than she intended. It had been a rough day. Still, Laurie didn't deserve it. \"I'm sorry,\" she mumbled. \"I'm just sick of it.\" Laurie shrugged. \"I'm sick of walking with a cane. Doesn't mean I can change it.\" He watched her carefully, as she dragged her eyes back to him. \"You may have to face the possibility that this isn't over.\" \"I don't think I could take it if I had to see Vincent again.\" \"It's not Vincent directly that I'm concerned about. But maybe the people who paid Vincent are annoyed that you're alive and with a story to tell. Your dad and I were talking, and I've been making some arrangements. I guess now is as good a time as any to tell you.\" Callie straightened a bit in her seat. \"Tell me what?\" \"Well, I'm working on fixing it so that you can come and stay here at the institute for a bit. Maybe a few weeks, maybe a month – I'm already going to give you an internship, based on the work we've been doing together, it's not that far-fetched. We could just say that it's starting early.\" \"But why here? \" \"Because it's a prison,\" Laurie pointed out logically. \"Because the resident doctors' quarters are very well guarded to keep any unfortunately accidents from happening. And it's a very unlikely place for anyone to come looking for you. Who doesn't want to land in a bunch of trouble, at any rate.\" She grumbled. \"Just stick me in the Fed Penn in Terre Haute, why don't you.\" \"Well, I think you'll like our meal plan better.\" He kept his face straight. \"And the clean sheets.\" \"So you've just arranged for this on your own?\" she asked. \"Without even talking to me first?\" \"It was your father's idea,\" Laurie admitted. \"I didn't make him any promises. I figured I should tell you before I go back to him.\" \"You figured right.\" She bit her lip. \"I'll have to talk to my brother, see what he thinks.\" \"Well, your brother thinks you should have a concealed weapons permit and carry a .22 millimeter,\" Laurie quipped. \"It's not hard to figure out where he'll land on this one.\" \"Don't be so sure. Ray might think he's capable of protecting me on his own, with some friends. He feels responsible for a lot of it…for not getting me away from Vincent when he had a chance.\" She grew silent and thoughtful for a moment. \"Maybe that's the best reason to come here, though. I don't want Ray taking any more responsibility for me than he already has.\" Laurie nodded. \"There's something else we need to talk about.\" She raised her eyebrows at him. The \"now what\" expression was a classic. But they were only a week and a half into the work, so it was expected that there was much, much more to do. \"Vincent again?\" she asked wearily, reading his mind. He said, \"I think we should take it from a different angle.\" He pulled out his recorder, set it on the desk, and pressed the red recording button. \"We've been talking about you and your experiences, but we have to go the other way now. We have to look at things from Vincent's point of view.\" Laurie scooted closer to his desk, templing his fingers together as he usually did when he was about to be profound. \"It's vital that, as doctors, we can show empathy, even for the worst kind of people. Especially you must, Callie, because Vincent himself is totally without empathy. He's incapable of it.\" \"Then how can we know what he's feeling?\" she asked, struggling through the dark haze to follow his path, trying to be reasonable, logical, and think like a doctor. \"He's without empathy, not without his own emotions. He can't relate to people. Now, a lot of this is speculation, because we can't actually talk to the subject, but we can analyze him from his behaviors. For instance –\" Laurie ruffled the papers on his desk, her manuscript. And then he paused. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"It just…bugs me to think that Rippner was in my office. That he got a hold of a copy of this.\" She barked a laugh, but swallowed it quickly. \"It bugs you ,\" she snorted. \"Eh. Okay, back to the subject. I was going for this example…\" Laurie flipped the pages. \"Wait a minute,\" Callie said, leaning forward. \"Who else has seen that manuscript, other than you or me?\" \"Nobody else I know of, except for Rippner, if it's like he claimed.\" \"Well, what if we dusted it for prints?\" she suggested. \"I mean, maybe we can find Rippner's prints on it, and maybe that might lead us somewhere?\" \"Where?\" Laurie asked. Callie shrugged. \"I don't know…fingerprints always lead somewhere on Law and Order!\" Laurie chuckled. \"You watch too much television. First of all, you know how hard it is to match up fingerprints? Only if they're already fingerprinted as known criminals is it even possible – or if they're State employees. And that even depends on the state. Even if we got this Rippner guy's fingerprints, what good does it to us? The worst we have on him is breaking and entering.\" \"But still, Laurie—\" \"And do you know how long it takes for things like that to come back? How many search engines you have to use, how many different resources you have to contact? It would take a minimum of two weeks to even get a hit—\" Suddenly, Callie's cellular phone went off. Scowling, she reached into her pocket, and would have let it go to voicemail, except that it was her brother's number. Something told her to take it. \"Hello?\" \"Callie, it's Ray. I've gone some incredible news for you. We got a match on Vincent's fingerprints.\" 888888888888888888 Disclaimer: I forgot the disclaimer. I don't own anything. And right now, Vincent is pretty pissed. Vincent: ( glowering silently in the corner ) Me: He's mad because of Jack— Vincent: DON'T say his name. Me: That the other guy from that other movie was in this chapter more than him. Vincent: Whose fing fanfic is this, anyway? Me: ( sighs ) Yours, of course, dear. Anyway, back to my disclaimer. I don't own Vincent and I don't own Ja— Vincent: I said--! Me: Geeze, you are just a big whiny baby! I don't own the other guy, either. I also don't own Ray— Vincent: Who'd want him? Me: Don't be such a shit. You're on a plane right now, there's not a lot I can do with you. You know how long a flight from Thailand to the U.S. takes? I mean, it's not pretty. Anyway, you'll be in the next chapter. Lots and lots. Vincent: Liar. You're a liar. You're trying to build up all this tension, all this…this… build up between me and Callie, and how long it's been since we've seen each other, yadda yadda. So when we do see each other again it'll explode. Me: Okay, you got me. What's wrong with that, anyway? But you will be in the next chapter, I promise! Vincent: Yeah, I'd like to see you explain that whole fingerprint thing. Most everybody knows one of the first things professional assassins do is acid wash their fingerprints. Me: Tom Cruise would never use acid wash on his hands. So you're a glowing exception, sweetheart. Vincent: Now you're just making me look stupid. Me: Hey, suspend the disbelief for me, here! I gotta move this story along somehow! Anyway, the rest of you guys need to go and review. Go on now! I know you're out there, I can see you on my Stats page![Chapter 5] Chapter 5 – Sharp Dressed Man (From the ZZ Top song) \"I had a team on the MTA car,\" Ray explained to them as he came into his office. She sat at his desk, Laurie beside her, leaning on his cane because he insisted that Callie take the only extra chair. \"There weren't any leads there – too many people come and go on public transportation. Your cab wasn't much good either, although I'm sure his prints were all over the back seat. It was the bag that he dumped – got rid of it when you took him to the airport. I finally got a hold of it, and after we screened out all the employee prints, we had two that we couldn't match. So we started making the rounds. Its tedious work, but it pays off sometimes.\" Callie shot Laurie a look. He just looked innocent. \"We got a hit on one of the fingerprints in Indiana – Gary, Indiana, to be specific. With a juvenile detention center. He has a record.\" He handed Callie the packet, as if it were some sacred thing. \"I think you should have a look.\" Callie took it with trembling hands. Her eyes flickered over the names – she didn't care what Vincent's last name was. She never had. It wouldn't make him any smaller, wouldn't make him any less terrifying. The names of his parents mattered little, as well…although the fact that his mother, Veronica, died in childbirth got her attention. \"According to the files,\" Ray was saying to Laurie, \"he killed his father when he was twelve. Took a handgun that his dad kept in the house and shot him right in the head. He'd been in and out of foster homes – his father beat him up regularly.\" Callie looked up at Ray. Her face was twisted. She didn't want to feel sorry for Vincent, didn't want to empathize or even sympathize with him at all. \"A history of alcohol abuse with the dad…and combined with the death of the mother. This guy had a miserable childhood. When we went into juvie after murdering his father, he was treated like he was going to end up institutionalized. He lived there until he was emancipated on his eighteenth birthday.\" \"Only one place for a guy like that,\" Laurie said softly. \"Back to prison.\" \"That's what I thought too,\" Ray said, sitting down at the head of his desk. \"But he didn't, surprisingly enough. This guy didn't do any time at all after juvie. He joined the military, and from there his record was sealed. Only thing I could get was that he was honorably discharged about seven years ago. Then he vanishes.\" \"Someone like that,\" Laurie said, going with his earlier thoughts from before, \"would have been idea for the military to program. He would have been perfect for black ops operations, the kind of stuff you only read about in spy novels. God knows what kind of missions he was on.\" He was looking at the file over Callie's shoulder. \"From the look of these dates, he would have been going in during the middle of the Cold War. Looks like he was discharged soon after it ended. They didn't need him anymore.\" \"And someone with those kind of skills would be perfect to go into the assassination business,\" Ray quipped. \"I was talking to our Fed contacts – they were full of stories. Apparently guys like Vincent are a dime a dozen.\" Callie met her brother's eyes. \"So what does this mean now?\" she asked in a very quiet voice. \"I mean, what do we do with this?\" \"Well, it means that now the Feds are going to do everything they can to connect Vincent to Felix Reyes-Torrena. And if they get lucky…well, that means that you're going to be called on to testify to what you saw that night.\" \"Wonderful,\" Callie moaned, closing the folder and setting it on Ray's desk. \"This is as good a time as any to tell you,\" Laurie said to Ray, coming around to stand in front of the desk. \"Callie is going to come stay at the institute.\" \"As a guest or a resident?\" Ray asked with an arched eyebrow. \"As a guest,\" Laurie replied dryly. \"The place is secure – she'll stay in the resident doctors' wing, and I'll even give her an orderly for her very own. Won't that be fun?\" He tossed Callie a look. \"Does Dad know about this?\" Ray asked her. \"It was his idea,\" Callie replied. Ray was thoughtful for a long, quiet minute. Then he said, \"I think…I think you should pack your stuff, Callie. I think if it's possible you should stay there tonight.\" 88888888888888888888 It was an incredibly long trip, with two stops along the way. One of them, he didn't have to get off, but the other he had to switch planes to a commercial jet. Normally, he didn't care much. He had his I-pod and his jazz, he had a good book to flip through when he got bored – he hated spy novels, it was either too close to work or it was so ridiculously off that he was insulted. He grabbed either romance novels, simply because he found them incredibly amusing, or he picked up some science fiction, because it was so far removed from the world he knew. Sometimes he went for the classics, and it so happened that he had grabbed a copy of \"Crime and Punishment\" off the discount rack because he was in a hurry. He was in a sentimental mood. Problem was, if you weren't reading, watching the movie or listening to music, all there was else to do was think. And he'd been doing too much thinking as it was. It was the first time in a long time that he was going in without a set plan. Usually, his jobs were laid out for him. He was the third act in a play that had already been going on for two acts before him. He was the last minute, shadowy figure that stepped in from the wings and wiped everyone else out. But now, he didn't know his environment, he didn't know his entrances and exits, he was lucky he was going to get a weapon, but he had little else. His thoughts turned to Rochester. He'd met him, once or twice, in passing. A long time ago, Rochester had worked for the competition, until Peter had decided to take him under his umbrella. But Rochester had…ticks. Ticks were dangerous for men like them. Vincent killed because he was skilled at it; he could do it, quick, clean, neat, and no fuss. He took no pleasure in it, but he took no pain as well. Rochester, however. He was like the big bad wolf. He liked to play with his food. He liked to shit where he ate. He was a particularly nasty piece of work, and the thought of him getting his hands on Callie made Vincent squirm. Vincent didn't squirm. On the outside, Rochester looked like him – good suit, elegant manners, although he wasn't prematurely gray like Vincent. Although Vincent suspected Rochester dyed his hair. Rochester struck him as the vain sort, the kind obsessed with his own good looks. Vincent knew he was attractive, but he didn't care much about it. Rochester preened himself, like an arrogant peacock. Vincent had never much liked him anyway. From his accent, Vincent suspected that Rochester was originally from New Zealand. A Kiwi, as they were called. He wasn't sure if he lived there now. Rochester would have the balls to live somewhere heavily populated, somewhere where he could blend in and still stand out. Or maybe he moved around a lot, simply for the variety of life. Which meant that he might try to get Callie's attention. Try to charm her somehow – make it a meet-cute situation, catch her in a café and start talking to her. Somehow lure her back to his hotel room. It wouldn't work, Vincent thought with a malicious smile. First of all, Callie wasn't stupid or slutty enough to fall for it. And second, well, Vincent was quite sure, from what he read in her manuscript, that he had pretty much scared her away from sharp dressed men for a while. So, once Rochester figured that out – and it might take him a bit of time do to it – he would go for the more direct approach. Which put them on more equal turf. Vincent remembered well the house in the hills of L.A. where Callie's father lived; she might be staying there, especially after the apparent trauma her experience with him had caused her. If not, then she had told him that she lived in student housing on the campus. It wouldn't take long to track her down either way. Question was…did Rochester know this? Peter had told him that he was going to give Rochester the job, which meant Rochester got all of the intel. If Rippner was in charge of that, Vincent had to admit, it would be pretty thorough. If it was Felix's people, then it was questionable. And he wouldn't know until he got his own intel through Cash at his bag drop point. He just couldn't wait that long. But did he have a choice? He could contact Peter through a satellite phone on the plane, but how secure would it be? Satellites projected information. Even if he somehow got a hold of a cellular phone at his layover, there was still the possibility of things being picked up by a scanner. There was no help for it. He had to wait, and use a land line. 888888888888888888888888 \"It's not so bad, really,\" Laurie was telling her as they walked the late afternoon corridors. The sun cast long, dust-filled beams through the windows, giving the place a feeling somewhere between creepy and angelic. \"I'll stay here, too, if you want.\" \"No, I don't want to inconvenience anybody,\" Callie said as they paused at her dormitory. \"And your security system going in looked pretty good.\" \"Yes, and Bill should be here any minute now. You'll like him, he's alternate easy going and full-on intense. Takes his job very seriously but doesn't hesitate to laugh, either.\" She gave him a look. \"I would have thought you'd prefer straight-laced orderlies, like soldiers, existing only to kick ass and take names.\" \"Hey, just because these people are criminals doesn't mean that they're not human beings.\" \"Which, considering your view of human beings, still doesn't speak much for your opinion of them.\" \"Hush, you. Now this is your room.\" He turned on the lights. It was a two-person room, like a college dormitory, two twin beds, two desks, and two closets. Simple, done in shades of beige, with simple plain blue comforters and white sheets. One of the beds was already taken, as was evidenced by the stuffed animal by the pillow and the various personal items on the adjoining desk. Callie walked over to the other and put down her bag. \"You're sharing with an intern, her name is Lucy. You probably won't see her much, she pretty much lives in the psych ward.\" Callie raised an amused eyebrow. \"I didn't mean that how it sounded,\" Laurie amended. \"She's actually the perky type. You'll probably hate her.\" Callie grunted, pulled open her bag and started to unload her clothes into the drawers and hang them up in the closet. There was a light knock on the door and both she and Laurie turned around to see a young man standing in the doorway. \"Dr. Gregg?\" he said, looking at Laurie. \"Yes, Bill,\" Laurie said, then turned to Callie. \"This is her. Calliope Fanning. Callie, this is Bill, your shadow.\" Callie extended her hand for Bill to shake it. He was a large man – six feet at least, not quite stocky, but definitely wide shouldered and build compactly. He had feathery brown hair, deep blue eyes, and a pleasant expression. She'd met her share of orderlies and had found a good portion of them to be bully-like. Bill struck her as a notable exception. \"Good to meet you,\" Callie said. \"I'll try not to be too underfoot,\" Bill said, tilting his head to her. \"But Dr. Gregg was pretty specific that you weren't to be left alone when you leave your dormitory.\" Callie turned her eyes to Laurie. \"You were?\" she asked. \"Come on, this isn't a big shocker to you,\" Laurie replied dryly. \"Before Bill was an orderly he was a bodyguard. Took on a few celebrities, but figured out he was wasting his life and making too much money in the process. Somehow he figured out that he wanted to make less money and do more worthy work. Sometimes I think he should be checked in as a patient, but nobody listens to me.\" Bill chuckled. His smile lit up his face, made him handsome. \"Dr. Gregg gives me too much credit. I was a patient here, but they made me an orderly because all the other patients listened to me. Figured they'd put me to good use.\" Callie blinked, and then laughed. \"Well, that's reassuring,\" she said. \"So, what, you going to stand guard outside my door?\" \"We do a walkie talkie system here,\" Laurie said. \"I'll get yours for you tomorrow, the batteries are charging right now.\" \"Great,\" Callie said. She plopped down on her bed and stared out the window – which had bars across it. \"When is this mess going to be over?\" \"Maybe a week,\" Laurie suggested hopefully – although for Laurie, it came out more sarcastic than anything. \"Maybe a little more. You know how the legal system works.\" \"Quite frankly you're lucky you haven't been arrested as a material witness,\" Bill added. \"I've seen it happen.\" Callie looked at them both. \"Okay. Well, if the Lollypop Guild is done cheering me up, I'd like to get on to clicking my heels three times and saying there's no place like home.\" Laurie cleared his throat. \"Yeah, well…I have some paperwork to do before dinner. Bill?\" \"Yeah, fine,\" Bill said, stepping a little closer into the room. Laurie frowned, shrugged, and left them to it. \"Callie?\" Bill said, getting her attention. \"If you're feeling cooped up…I mean, what Laurie said before was right. I was a bodyguard for a couple of celebrities. It wouldn't be any problem if you wanted to…go out.\" \"With you?\" She resisted the urge to smirk a bit at the suggestion. It sounded like they were going on a date. \"I'm actually a lot of fun at parties,\" Bill said cheerfully—although she swore she saw a tint of a blush on his cheeks. \"And I know a good bar not too far away from here. Doogans. The woman who runs the bar makes the best martinis in town.\" \"I'm a bit of a bourbon girl myself,\" Callie said. \"But that sounds good, actually. You don't think we'll annoy Laurie if we don't invite him?\" \"I'm sure what Dr. Gregg doesn't know won't hurt him.\" Callie considered it for a minute. She had just met Bill…Laurie trusted him enough to leave her in his care, but she could see the expression on both her father and brother's face. \"Yeah. Would it be all right if I invited my brother?\" \"No problem. You need some alone time? Just call extension seven-eight on the phone when you're ready an we'll go. I'm going to change into some civies.\" He pulled at the sides of his blue scrubs. \"This is more of a day look.\" He grinned at her and left. 88888888888888888888888888 Vincent: So I thought I was supposed to be in this chapter lots and lots. Me: Well, uh… Vincent: That's what you said. \"Lots and lots.\" I was barely in it for two frickin' minutes! That's your definition of lots? And who the hell is this Bill guy? Why does he look familiar? Me: Because he's in all my stories. He's the only one I think that's in all of them. Vincent: ( disbelieving ) All your stories? He gets to be in all your stories? Me: He has different names. I call him Nate in my Dukes of Hazzard story. And in the Convergence story he goes by the name of Alex Tully. He does all kinds of things. He's very versatile. Usually he plays Malcolm Reynolds in Firefly, but I've never written a Firefly fic. Maybe I should… Vincent: ( beyond outraged ) I can't believe you're mooning over another guy in my fic. Me: Well, I can't play too easy to get, can I? You'd lose interest. Vincent: You need a trip to the closet. Me: Oh sht. No, really, that isn't— (The closet magically appears behind them and opens, the inside dark and inviting. Vincent seizes the writer and shoves her in, her protesting all the way. ) Vincent: ( standing in the doorway ) Go read and review, folks. This may take a while. ( He shuts the door behind him )[Chapter 6] Chapter Six -- Standing Outside A Broken Phone Booth… (from the song by the Primitive Radio Gods) It turned out that Callie didn't want to go directly to a bar and start drinking. She wanted to visit Annie. It was late in the day – the sun was starting to set. Visiting hours would be ending soon, but the staff was familiar with Callie. She led Bill – her brother had promised to catch up with them as soon as he got off shift, at the bar – down the winding hallways and found Annie's room. Annie's monitors showed that her condition was stable. It would take some time, the doctors said, for her to come out of her coma. It might take months. And it was also possible that she might never come out of it at all. When she did come out, she would need physical therapy to relearn how to walk, and speech therapy to relearn how to talk. Vincent may as well have killed her, Callie thought bitterly. But she put it in the very farthest back part of her brain as she reached the room. She picked up the book that sat on the bedstand – the nurses were kind enough to leave it there for her – and started her usual conversation. \"Hi, Annie,\" she said, \"this is my friend Bill. He's watching out for me a bit.\" Bill waved at the unconscious form and said, \"Hi, Annie! Nice to meet you.\" On the drive over, Callie had learned that his father had been in a similar coma when Bill was a teenager, and he had learned all the ways of communicating with comatose people. It didn't bother him, but he considerately offered to wait in the hallway. Callie got three quarters of the way through the next chapter when she heard someone come to the door. She looked up and saw… \"Max,\" Callie said, almost dropping her book. She stood up, stunned. \"Max, what are you—\" Max walked in. He looked pale, and slightly shaken. \"My mother…she's at this hospital. Callie, you haven't been at work in two weeks—\" \"I quit,\" Callie said softly. Two weeks…that was all it had been? It felt like a lifetime ago. \"I don't blame you,\" Max said softly, and looked to Annie. He looked utterly heartbroken. \"I saw in the papers…I recognized her name. I just didn't connect it to…\" \"Yeah,\" Callie said, suddenly very uncomfortable. She already felt responsible enough for Annie, and having Max here…that night, Annie had gotten out of his cab, right in front of her. Vincent had nearly gotten into Max's cab instead of hers. But Max had been distracted. Thinking about Annie? Callie believed so. Max raised his hand and she saw he was holding a business card. \"So,\" Max said, looking at her through his gold-rimmed glasses, \"you were there?\" She nodded, mute. \"God Callie…I'm so sorry.\" He looked down, at Annie again. It was gut-wrenching, the tension in the room. \"You're sorry?\" she burst out breathily. \"Max, I never realized…I mean, you knew her?\" \"Just a little,\" Max admitted. \"I was thinking of asking her out, but…well, she gave me her card.\" He gave a little, self-depreciating laugh. \"She gave me her card, you know? I thought, wow, this is the woman of my dreams, and she's making the first move on me! I could hardly believe it.\" Callie nodded. She thought she was going to cry. \"Well, I was going to head out. You know, if you want, you should stay and talk to her for a while. Talk about what you talked about in the cab.\" Max looked at her, confused. \"In the cab?\" \"I was behind you,\" Callie admitted. \"I saw her get out of your cab. That's how I knew where she was.\" Max shook his head. \"You're going to have to explain all of this. I mean, what happened? The papers were so vague. They said she was shot on the MTA by an unidentified shooter, but…\" he shook his head again, baffled. \"You were there? How?\" Callie took a deep breath. She shouldn't tell Max this, but she felt that she owed him something. \"I was there. The man who shot her had me as a hostage. I tried to stop him, but…he was a professional. I didn't stand much of a chance.\" \"So you were a witness? Shouldn't you be in protective custody?\" \"They're working on it,\" Callie said, inching toward the door. \"Look, don't tell anyone what I told you, all right? It's a big confusing mess right now. But stay and talk to her, Max. She'll appreciate it, a lot.\" By then, she had made it to the doorway. She turned her head and looked at Bill, and amazingly enough, the man read her perfectly. \"Callie,\" he said, standing up and coming around into the doorway with her – hospital doorways were always wide enough for two or three people – \"You ready to go?\" \"Yeah,\" she said, and tossed Max a smile. \"It was good to see you, Max. Keep in touch.\" 88888888888888888888888 \"You need to go easy on that bourbon,\" Bill said a few hours later, as they sat at the bar. It was a very nice place, with a large, rectangular bar that floated like an island in the middle of the room. There were large LCD televisions in every corner of the room, and one of them just inside one of the corners of the bar itself – two of them were on a hockey game, and the other three were on basketball. Callie looked at him. It was a mistake, ordering bourbon. She hadn't had any since that night, and she shouldn't have had any now – she needed to change her drink preference. The taste of it in her mouth, and sitting here with Bill – who had a habit of looking around him every so often, just the way Vincent had done – was not helping her mental state at all. \"Fine,\" she said. \"Let's go with Jack Daniels. Or Jim Beam. Or fuck it, let's do tequila shots.\" \"Not without me,\" Ray said, sitting down beside her. He looked at his sister, her nose and cheeks already red, and then to Bill. \"What's going on?\" Bill gave him a sidelong look. \"You must be the brother. I can see the resemblance.\" \"Ray, this is Bill, my bodyguard,\" Callie slurred. \"Bill, this is my brother the cop. A cop, a bodyguard, and a college student walk into a bar—\" \"How many has she had?\" Ray asked. \"About three,\" Bill replied. \"Don't worry, I drove here. We went to go see Annie, and they had a visit from some guy named Max. I think that had something to do with it.\" \"Don't talk about me like I'm not here,\" Callie grumbled. \"And I'm not drunk, I'm just…buzzed.\" \"Buzzed like a chainsaw,\" Ray remarked. \"You saw who? Who's Max?\" \"Max is the guy driving the cab that Vincent almost got into before he got into mine ,\" Callie said a bit too loudly. \"It could have been Max's night of hell on earth instead of mine, and maybe he could have saved Annie. He liked her, you know. They were gonna date.\" \"Maybe we should go get some food,\" Ray suggested, although the veneer was thin. Bill chuckled. \"Me, I'm never gonna date. Never again. Not ever.\" \"Really,\" Ray said, leaning over and looking to Bill. \"What's close? Denny's?\" \"Olive Garden up the street,\" Bill said. \"I'll go get the car.\" \"Okay.\" Ray slid the empty glasses away from Callie and got out his wallet as Bill left. \"You owe me,\" he told her, putting a couple of twenties on the bar-top. \"Come on, let's go eat. You can drink at Olive Garden, they got all kinds of pretty frou-frou drinks for girls.\" \"Shut up,\" she giggled, swiping at him. \"I gotta pee. You can't follow me to the girl's room, and nothing awful is going to happen to me if you let me out of your site for five lousy minutes.\" She brushed back her hair. \"Really, I'm not that drunk. I'm just pissed.\" Ray sighed. \"Fine.\" He stood up and walked over to where he could spot the hallway with the restroom. It was a very nice place that they were in. Clean, large walkways, well lit. He turned back to Callie, but she had her attention suddenly riveted on someone sitting at a table close by. Ray followed her gaze. The woman was very pretty – Latino, curvy, and about his age. She was getting up, extending her arms to Callie. \"Lupe!\" Callie greeted her, coming closer to accept the embrace. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Drinking, like you are, Cal,\" Lupe replied. \"Drinking a bit less than you, really.\" \"Ha, ha, you and my brother would make a perfect couple.\" Callie turned to Ray. \"This is Guadalupe Martinez,\" she told him, \"the doctor that Laurie is having treat me for my trauma. See how great of a job she's doing?\" Lupe shook her head and rolled her eyes. \"Nice to meet you…Ray, is it?\" \"Yeah, Raymond Fanning,\" Ray introduced himself. \"Junior,\" Callie supplied. \"Shut up, Opie,\" Ray teased, swatting her hair. \"Why didn't you tell me that your fellow shrinks were so pretty?\" He flashed Lupe a smile. Lupe cocked her head. \"You don't look like a cop,\" she said. \"I get that a lot.\" Ray held his smile. Damn, this woman was hot. Would it be inappropriate for him to ask his sister's shrink out on a date? He somehow thought so. \"Oh, good, you two can banter while I go pee,\" Callie said, indicating over her shoulder with her thumb. Ray watched her go, and once she was safely inside, heard Lupe say; \"Oh, there he is.\" Ray turned to her. \"Where who is?\" \"The cop,\" Lupe said. \"It's the way you guys look at things. Now you look like a cop.\" \"Yeah, well…Callie's been through a lot.\" \"I know. And I can't really take credit for helping her. Dr. Gregg is doing a lot more for her than I am.\" \"How long have you worked for Laurie?\" Ray asked. \"Pretty much since I got my doctorate. He claims he takes them in young and trains them, then ruins them for anyone else.\" Ray laughed. \"Yeah, I can see that.\" 8888888888888888 When Callie came out of the bathroom with a bit clearer of a head, Ray and Lupe were still talking. She paused at the threshold, and then made her way over to an empty seat by the bar. Ray looked over his shoulder at her, and she waved, making more of a sweeping motion away from her, indicating that he not stop his conversation. To her surprise, Ray did not. It was nice, seeing him with an attractive woman. Lupe had been more of a friend to her than a therapist. It wouldn't be a bad match, Callie realized. Then, she also realized that someone had come over and was leaning over her. She glanced up and saw a waitress, holding a tray, containing a thick glass holding bourbon on the rocks. \"This is from the gentleman at the end table,\" the waitress said, and her eyes held hesitation. Obviously this was not a new thing, but there was also the chance that the recipient of the drink would reject it if the person offering it was considered undesirable. Callie let her set it down and looked over to where the man sat. It was just not her day for men, Callie realized. This one was also smashingly attractive. He smiled at her, extending his arm in a toast, and then as the waitress walked away, he approached. He was dark haired, with his hair nicely styled and gelled, longish on top but trimmed at the nape of his neck. He had a smart little goatee, and his suit – deep blue with a widely spaced white pinstripe, and a white silk shirt underneath -- screamed Armani. She instantly wondered if he was Euro-trash, but when he spoke, his accent was all American. \"I hope I'm not intruding,\" he said. She just blinked at him, and gave him a bit of a smile. \"May I?\" he asked, reaching for the empty chair next to her. He seated himself at a respectful distance, but close enough for them to be in an intimate conversation. \"I asked the bartender what you were drinking, I hope you don't mind.\" Callie looked at the bourbon. She really had no desire to drink it. After her encounter with Jackson today, all her alarms were going off, but this guy…something about him. It made her hesitate to blow him off. \"Callie, is it?\" the man asked. \"I'm Rochester.\" He extended his hand. \"Most people call me Chess.\" \"Chess?\" she echoed, shaking his hand lightly. \"Not Chester?\" \"Oh, no,\" he said. \"Nobody who wants to keep all their teeth.\" She nodded. \"And are you like Chess? Strategically plotting your every move?\" He gave a shrug with one shoulder. \"It never hurts in life to have a plan.\" She arched an eyebrow. She suddenly did not feel like humoring him anymore. She looked toward Ray, and he glanced back at her again. Always the cop – still guarding her even while he was flirting. Ray noticed the stranger and gave a slight frown. \"Well,\" Callie said, rising, empty-handed, \"I'm afraid that this is one Queen who just refuses to play.\" She gave him a tight little grin. \"Thanks for the drink.\" And she walked toward her brother. Ray saw the exchange, and extended his arm out to Callie as she approached. \"You okay,\" he said once he had her encircled. \"Fine. We need to leave,\" she said. She glanced at Lupe. \"Wanna come? We're going to get something to eat.\" \"That sounds good,\" Lupe said. She was looking at Ray, and Callie, if she had been in a better mood at that moment, would have been happy to see that the doctor was also clearly interested. \"Where are we going?\" \"To the Olive Garden.\" Ray started to move them toward the door. He was the only one who noticed that the guy was still watching Callie, and he did not look happy. 88888888888888888888 Vincent approached the pay phone, reached into his wallet for his credit card – the one with the false name on it – and slid it along the space. The phone gave him a dialtone, and he started to dial the international number. Trent had not been there. Trent was supposed to be there. Trent never missed a drop. The man's timing was uncanny. And the hackles on the back of Vincent's neck were high up. Something was wrong. It felt like it took forever to get the connection, but when Peter answered, Vincent knew things were much worse than he thought. \"Where are you?\" Peter asked by way of greeting. \"At LAX, on a payphone. I used the credit card.\" \"All right, that's fine. Has anyone approached you?\" \"No…and I have to admit, I'm a bit disappointed. I was hoping to get cash.\" It was code. An easy code, but a code nonetheless. \"Well, I'm afraid I had to yank him back. Quite frankly I'm impressed you weren't picked up at customs.\" \"Picked up? For what?\" Peter sighed, and Vincent realized that the other man was very carefully holding back a strong fistful of anger. \"You've been identified,\" he said tightly. \"The woman, Callie, her brother is a police detective. He searched the airport after you left and somehow came up with your discarded bag. And he managed to get a set of your prints off the bag. So now they have a record on you from your time in Gary. The unfortunate business with your father. And since Callie provided them with a description, they now have a very actuate likeness of you and your face is on the front page of the international newspapers.\" Vincent felt a very uncharacteristic surge of panic. He shut his eyes and drew deep breaths. Bad things were going to happen to him and he had to stop them. But there was no direct target at this point at which to launch his defense. He was at a momentary impasse. Before he could respond, Peter said, \"This is very bad. I didn't realize how bad. I'm afraid that Rochester is now under orders to terminate you with extreme prejudice. I hope you'll understand that I didn't have any choice. I knew it was bad when you left that Calliope woman alive, but I didn't realize you'd been careless with your bag. Were you trying to get caught?\" \"I'm coming back,\" Vincent said, ignoring the question. \"And I'm bringing her with me. I'll need transportation from Bangkok. Something that will keep us under the radar.\" \"Fine,\" Peter sighed. \"I don't understand why I'm helping you.\" \"Why not? What else are you going to do?\" \"Good point. You'd better move quickly.\" \"So…no bag drop?\" \"No. You're going to have to visit Jackson. You'll have to make it look like I didn't help you. Will that be a problem?\" \"No. Just tell me where he is.\" \"At a place called Arcadian Estates, it's a townhouse community. Just don't kill him, V. He's very valuable to me.\" 888888888888888888888888 ( Vincent pops his head out of the closet ) Vincent: Sorry, the writer can't come out and talk to you today. As you can see from reading this chapter, she still hasn't learned her lesson yet. Me: ( background, distant, faint ) help! Vincent: Better review quickly. If you ever want another chapter again. Me: (still background, distant, faint ) Hey, you be nice to my readers, dammit! ( Vincent pulls the closet shut, cutting her off .)[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: Don't own the characters from the movie, nor the song title. A/N: To the Jackson fangirls -- Jackson altert!! Chapter Seven – Versions of Violence (from the song by Alanis Morisette) Peter was a smart man. He'd been in this business for a long time, although he was only a few years younger than Vincent. He was one of the dozen or so human beings in the world that was powerful and invisible. Money did not have to bring celebrity, not if you had enough of it. Arcadian Estates was owned by a dummy corporation, and certain apartments were kept empty so that they could be occupied by operatives, depending on the mission. Right now, Jackson had taken up residence in a smaller one, ground floor, so that he could easily get in and out. Vincent had never stayed at any of Peter's safe houses. He'd never needed to. He didn't like the big cities, where almost all the places like this were located, and part of his routine was to be in and out in one night. That was what made him good. No fuss, no muss. Ah, the good old days, he thought as the cab pulled up. It was getting past nine o'clock. He'd gotten this cab at the airport, and the driver was very good. A young African-American, glasses, the kind that didn't like conflict. He was polite but not friendly. Disengaged. \"Hey,\" Vincent said, leaning forward, \"I'm only going to be here for a bit, maybe a half-hour at the most. Think I could persuade you to wait?\" \"I can keep the meter running,\" the cabbie said, \"no problem.\" \"Yeah, well…in case I'm late, I'll give you a hundred, plus the fare, however long it takes, as long as you just keep waiting.\" Vincent flashed the hundred dollar bill. It was his only one – the rest were all fifties and twenties. He was an all-cash kind of guy, but as Trent had not brought him a bag, he didn't have his usual supply. He ripped the bill in half and handed half to the driver, shaking his hand in the process. \"Yeah, man, sure,\" the cabbie said. \"Great, here's half, you'll get the other half when I come back,\" Vincent said. \"What's your name?\" \"Max,\" the guy said. Vincent smiled. He couldn't give his name. On the way here, Vincent had asked Max if he happened to have a newspaper in the cab, and Max had said no, but there was no guarantee he hadn't already looked at one and wouldn't suddenly remember. \"I'm Albert,\" he said, and got out of the cab. Max pulled into a parking spot along the curb and put the car into park. He glanced at the back seat and saw that Albert's briefcase was still sitting there, plain as day. \"Definitely not from around here,\" he said with a rueful chuckle. 8888888888888888888 Vincent pressed his ear against the door. There was no sound. No television, radio, running water…he stayed silent and still for a few minutes, in the empty hallway. Peter always had the marked apartments away from the main paths. Sometimes they were hidden entirely. When he was sure the apartment was empty, he picked the lock and slipped inside. Moving through the dark, Vincent carefully scoped everything out. He located Jackson's gun – even a lousy shot kept one, it was just pure common sense in their line of work. It was nice – a glock, with a silencer. It was under the bed, on the right side – a very obvious place for people to keep a gun. He supposed he was lucky that Jackson kept a gun at all, now that he thought about it. Jackson really was a terrible shot. Now, the question was – where was his gear? Vincent had worked with Jackson on a few occasions. He was never quite sure exactly what Jackson did, except for the obvious gathering of intel, at which, admittedly, Jackson was quite good. He knew he didn't like him much – Jackson was a talker. That was probably part of his job, but still, Vincent didn't have to like it. Still, Jackson was no wimp either, and like or not, he respected him. The first place was the bedroom. Five minutes was spent rummaging through the single closet and the single chest of drawers. There was no way it would be in the living area, and the bathroom was ridiculous… Vincent moved down the hallway into the kitchen. It was stupid to keep important things in a kitchen – the risk of fire was always highest in a kitchen. Then again, if Jackson had to dump his gear quickly, that would be the easiest place to do it. Five more minutes. Twenty now. He did not want to be here longer than thirty. He felt the first prickles of anxiety. No, he had to be calm. Where would be an unlikely place to store waiting intel? Vincent went to the cabinet under the sink – always the least appealing place in any kitchen, as it was filled with pipes and usually cleaners. But as Vincent popped the cabinet open, there was a metal box, about the size of a desk drawer, sitting there. With a padlock on it. Vincent had never had much time for padlocks. Picking door locks was easy, but padlocks were a pain. Still, he tried it. He would have liked to just take a hammer and smash it, but the amount of noise that would make…and if Jackson came home while he was doing it, it would be like an alarm system to the man the second he walked through the door. It took him almost ten minutes. His fingers were trembling mildly, and he kept cussing under his breath, but he did hit paydirt. Callie's picture, freshly printed images from a digital camera, smiled up at him. Vincent pulled out the whole box, and was surprised to find how heavy it actually was. It wasn't all on Callie. There was intel on a few other jobs as well, but Callie's stuff was all on top. Addresses, written notes in Jackson's nearly illegible scrawl, and lots and lots of photographs. Vincent stuffed as much as he could into his suit pockets, and it made a bulge. He would go through it in a bit. Right now he was at the end of his allotment and it was time for an exit. And that was when he heard the front door click open. The first thing Vincent did was pull out his gun. It was his now – rammed into the back of his pants, like an idiot. But what choice did he have, he didn't have a holster or anything, not even his switch. Things like that would never make it through security, and he had depended on Trent to bring him a bag. But Peter had to protect his own – if airport security had decided to nab Vincent, Cash could have gone down with him, and that would have been bad for business, not to mention just plain embarrassing. Jackson walked down the hallway. Vincent heard him toss some papers down with a rubbery thwap onto the coffee table, and then head into the kitchen. The minute he reached for the light, Vincent cocked the gun. \"Don't,\" he said. Jackson reacted fast. He had his knife out, but Vincent had wisely already put the silencer on the gun. Crack shot that he was, he shot at the knife, and the bullet hit the blade, bouncing off it and going into the nearby wall. The affect was to send a painful vibration that left Jackson clutching his hand. \"Do it again and the next one goes into your wrist,\" Vincent said. \"Fucking hell, Vincent. What do you think you're doing?\" Vincent smirked. Jackson was quick, he'd give him credit. \"What gave me away?\" \"Your stupid hair is reflecting in the window,\" Jackson replied cockily. \"Are you out of your mind? Have you even read the papers?\" \"I was in transit. There wasn't any way for me to know until I landed. But yeah, I saw. And when my drop didn't make it, I knew something was up. So I decided to come see you.\" \"Why me?\" Jackson sounded surly. Vincent's eyes had long since adjusted to the dark and he could see the expression on the younger man's face. Blank, unassuming. Jackson was a master of expressions. \"Because your name came up when I was offered the assignment,\" Vincent said. \"And I have a good memory.\" Jackson chuckled. \"Peter told you to keep him out of it, didn't he?\" That threw him. But Jackson was a talker – his most important skill was the ability to keep people off balance. Vincent was not about to be played. \"You know, I know that you have this opinion of my kind of people,\" he said coldly, glacier-like, putting as much scorn and loathing into his voice as he could manage to convey to Jackson exactly how much he did not appreciate his attitude – and it was easier than he thought, because most if it was coming from his exact dislike of Jackson himself – \"that we're just well-trained dogs. But even the best trained dog will eat his master if he's desperate enough. I'm not stupid, Jackson.\" \"No, you aren't.\" Jackson's tone was almost conciliatory, but Vincent could tell he wasn't completely buying it. \"I've never understood why Peter is so fond of you. If that's what you can even call it. I've had a lot of interesting theories, but I'm not paid to—\" \"No, you aren't,\" Vincent cut him off. \"So, I take it you're here for the stuff on Calliope Fanning?\" Vincent felt his finger twitch. Damn Jackson, he could put so much into that tone of his…\"Don't bother,\" Vincent said. \"Your hiding place was pretty easy to find.\" \"Was it?\" Amusement. It flickered in those huge blue eyes, which were glowing slightly, cat-like, in the dim light. \"Huh. I'll have to try harder in the future.\" A warning bell went off in the back of Vincent's head. Jackson was hiding something. \"What is it, Rippner?\" Vincent asked, coming closer. He aimed higher, so that Jackson was staring down the barrel of the gun. \"What aren't you telling me?\" \"I haven't told you anything,\" Jackson replied, shrugging. \"You're so smart, you've figured everything out for yourself.\" That tore it. Vincent reached out and grabbed Jackson by his collar. He yanked him forward and spun him around, shoving him hard against the opposite cabinet. Jackson's spine met the hard marble edge of the countertop and he grunted, then bent over backwards. Vincent had him spread eagle and helpless, and the gun pressed to the underside of Jackson's jaw. \"I have no time for your bullshit,\" he said. \"What don't I know? What's not in your intel?\" Jackson stared upward, not meeting Vincent's eyes. \"Peter's going to be very pissed if you kill me,\" he said calmly. \"Even you, I'm sure, have limits.\" Vincent pressed the tip of the gun harder, digging it into Jackson's throat. \"You willing to bet your life on that? Haven't you heard? I've gone nuts. I've come all the way back here to protect a woman I should have killed. You think I'm playing the game by the rules? You think I have anything left to lose?\" Jackson met his eyes. Blue against green, ice against fire. \"On the table,\" he said. \"What I just brought in. The address for St. Anthony's, called Crazy Ants by most of the staff and patients. That's where your girl is. That's where they're hiding her – she just moved today, it was a last minute thing.\" Vincent paused. \"That was too easy,\" he said. Jackson chuckled. The tremor went through his neck and up the metal barrel of the gun. \"Rochester got all of this about two hours ago. Two hours, Vincent. Quite frankly, I doubt it matters much now, and I'm not going to risk dying to protect information that's already—\" He didn't get to finish his sentence. Vincent yanked him up, turned the gun around and clobbered Jackson over the head with the butt. The man fell limp, but breathing. Vincent checked the packet before he took it, just to make sure the weasel hadn't been bluffing, and he was rewarded for this extra bit of care. The address for Crazy Ants was the first thing in the pack. 88888888888888888888 Rochester lazily moved up the walk. It was a quiet evening – dogs barking in the distance, traffic rolling by on the nearby streets, people putting out their garbage. It was beautifully, wonderfully mundane. Nobody in this world took time to appreciate the mundane. The porch light was on and so was the kitchen light. Rochester moved in the shadows, keeping out of the line of sight. Raymond Fanning Senior was hovering over the sink, probably washing dishes. He had a cop's face, heavily lined. His brow was furrowed in concentration. How could he be happy? Rochester wondered. The simple answer was, he couldn't. His wife was dead, his daughter was in mortal danger, and he himself had cancer, and hadn't even told his children yet. But it would be over soon, Chess mused. And Ray Sr. would get to die knowing the full extent of himself as a man. So few actually got to do that. Chess moved along the garage door until he found the back entrance. He did not break the glass, but instead sliced it expertly and used a suction cup to keep it from falling. He reached through, unlocked the door from the inside, and let himself in. It was easy to move silently through the garage. Concrete that was saturated with grease and various other fluids did not echo footsteps as well. As Rochester entered the kitchen through the side door, he had to be cautious. There was no window on this one so he couldn't see through it, but as he cracked the door he saw that Fanning Sr. was still intently washing the dishes. He was making a bit of a racket, and the radio was on beside him, so when Rochester reached him and slipped the razor blade around his throat, he almost didn't notice. Not until Rochester spoke. \"If you move, you'll get hurt.\" He felt the older man tense, but wisdom and years prevented him from doing anything foolish. \"Pull your hands out of the dishwater and get them where I can see them,\" Rochester told him, in the casual tone of voice that indicated he was in no hurry. Fanning obeyed. Wet hands dripped suds onto the floor below. Rochester twitched his shoe to keep it from getting dampened. Then, ever so gently, he moved the knife so that it gave the older man room to move, but not so that it would easily slice through a jugular vein if he was prompted. \"Now turn around.\" Fanning didn't look anything like his daughter…except in the eyes. Of course, the first thing that Rochester noticed was the sudden look of surprise on Fanning's face. \"What?\" Chess asked. \"Nothing.\" Fanning's voice was gravelly, rough. \"No,\" Rochester said with mildly strained patience, \"you were surprised. Not when I grabbed you, but when you saw me. Why?\" \"I thought you'd…be someone else,\" Fanning finished with a light shrug. \"Huh,\" Rochester said. \"Vincent?\" The muscles around the old man's eyes tightened. Rochester smiled. \"You met him, didn't you?\" Rochester reached behind him and yanked out one of the kitchen table chairs, dragging it beside him and turning it around. He indicated for Fanning to sit. \"He came to this house, that night, with your daughter. What did she tell you, that he was her boyfriend?\" He chuckled. \"That was classic. I wish I could have been a fly on the wall and seen that.\" Fanning sat down, put his hands on his knees, and looked at a point on the floor. \"So what do you have around here, duct tape, binding cord, anything?\" Rochester started to rummage through drawers. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the subtle shift in Fanning's body language, saw his eyes rise to glare at him. \"Before you do anything stupid,\" Rochester said, still rummaging, \"you'd best know that the second you touch me, you're dead. I'm faster with this knife than a teenage boy popping his cherry. So just a friendly heads up.\" In the last drawer, he found what he was looking for. A roll of duct tape, almost new. Rochester scooped it up and used his teeth to pull off a long strip. \"Get your hands on the arms,\" he said, and then ripped the tape with his teeth. He tucked the roll under his arm and then wrapped Fanning's wrist in place. He repeated it for the other wrist, and then, for good measure, did it a half-dozen more times on each arm, until Fanning was bound from wrist to elbow to the arms of the chair. Rochester put the blade away and expertly stepped on Fanning's free foot as he bent over and bound him from the ankle to the knee against the chair leg. Then he did the other leg. After that, he wound the tape around his stomach and then his shoulders to the back of the chair until he used nearly the entire roll. Smiling, he tossed what was left back onto the counter. He came around and stood in front of Fanning, folding his arms and scrutinizing him. \"So I guess you're wondering why I'm here…or maybe not. It's not everybody's daughter that manages to witness five hits and lives to tell the tale. You guys knew that this was coming and you've done a pretty good job hiding little Callie from me. But sooner or later, Ray, you've got to face facts. I am going to find her. She is going to die. How she dies, however, is going to be up to you.\" Ray's chest heaved, but he was well in control of himself. It was an old cop's instinct to be this cool, Rochester knew. \"Vincent didn't kill her because Vincent was old and stupid,\" Rochester went on, conversationally. \"Or maybe he's going through a mid-life crisis, I guess it happens. Me, though, I'm young and hungry.\" His voice and mannerisms gained intensity as he went on. \"I live and breathe this shit and there's really nothing, not even your cop son, that's going to keep me from getting to her. Sure, you're going to run me on a wild chase, that I can admit. You might even keep her from me for a good long while. Now, I have to tell you…that's going to make me frustrated. And when I get frustrated, I get mad. And when I get mad, well, I have to somehow relieve my stress. And that means, what am I going to do to your precious Callie when I get a hold of her?\" Fanning's eyes were slowly gaining a bloodshot look. If he had possessed heat vision, Rochester would be a smear of ash on the floor. The thought made him smile. \"You're going to die, Ray,\" he suddenly said, softly. \"Cancer, isn't it? You only have what, a year left? And it's not going to be pleasant. Cancer eats you from the inside. It's an ugly, painful business. But you know, there are worse ways to die.\" Rochester had started pacing, lightly, not too far back and forth, but enough. \"I know a lot of them. I'm still looking for more. Nobody's coming here, are they? Your daughter is holed up in that insane asylum they call an institute, your son is on shift. We have all night. We could find worse ways to die than cancer. But we don't have to.\" He stopped and leaned down into Ray's face. \"And Callie doesn't have to, either.\" To his credit, Fanning hadn't changed facial expressions in the last several minutes. But if looks could have killed… Rochester smiled gently. \"It will be quick. Squish, done, you get to meet your maker without all the agony beforehand. And I give you my word that Callie will get the same. But if you force my hand, first, you get to die the ugliest death I can possibly give you – and trust me, that's considerable. It won't be anything, though, compared to what Callie gets.\" He leaned in a bit closer, so that he was almost by Fanning's ear. \"I could make it last for days, if I wanted.\" He felt every muscle in the older man's body coil. He was struggling with himself, a battle he had never imagined fighting before. \"All you have to do is get Callie over here. I'll even wait, so that you can see her die quick and clean before you join her. I'm going to bring you the telephone, you're going to call your daughter's line, and you're going to get her over here, alone. Or you're going to die knowing that before she joins you, whatever you suffer will be nothing compared to what she's going to endure. She's nobody to me. I can think of a million different ways to soil her before I'm done. You're a cop – you've seen the filthy things a man can do to a woman. Imagine all of them, on your precious…baby…girl.\" There was a strange noise, and Rochester backed up a bit to figure out what was going on. He realized it was coming from Fanning's throat, and that suddenly, with more force than he would have expected, Fanning hocked the ugliest loogie known to man right across Rochester's cheek. Rochester closed his eyes. He straightened, made his way over to the counter and found the paper towels. He cleaned himself using warm water, all the while cool as an icicle in January. Fanning, however, had seemed to unleash something else with the wad of flem. A stream of profanity issued from him, until he made himself hoarse. The assassin patiently waited until his victim was done. Then he pulled the razor blade from his pocket, and made good on his promise. 888888888888888888888888 ( Jackson and the writer sit on chairs. Jackson has a very large ice bag on his head and the writer looks distinctly bruised. Both look very peeved at Vincent. ) Me: Did you have to hit him so hard? ( Vincent just smiles smugly .) Jackson: I think I have a concussion. Me: Do you know how many fangirls are going to be pissed off because of this? Vincent: Bring them on. Jackson: He's just being pathetic. He just wants attention. Vincent: ( to Jackson ) You want attention? I can give you more. Me: And to think, Rochester makes Vincent look like a teddy bear. Jackson: Well, that's your own fault, you created him. Me: Oh, I don't need shit from you, too. Vincent: Actually, she borrowed him, too. Wasn't he in that movie, Ironhead? Me: Iron man . And yes, Robert Downey Jr. plays an excellent psycho. Vincent: ( with a warning look ) Do you need another trip to the closet? Me: You'd just better watch your step, buddy. Jackson: ( to break the tension ) Nice move, putting Max in there, by the way. Me: Thank you. ( to Vincent ) See? He knows how to be charming. Vincent: I can be charming. Me: Nearly making out to death in a closet is not being charming. Vincent: Why did you have to bring Max into this, anyway? Me: It was a full circle kind of thing. You needed to get into a cab with him, trust me. Vincent: Whatever. Me: ( sighs ) Anyway, I forgot the disclaimer, so I don't own anything. At this rate, I don't want to. Jackson: Hey![Chapter 8] Disclaimer: Vincent, Jackson and Max are all pains in my ass. 88888888888888888888888 Chapter Eight – Death Rides a Horse (from the piece by Ennio Morricone, used in Kill Bill ) When he'd left Jackson's, and climbed back into the cab, he had dutifully handed Max the second half of the hundred dollar bill. \"Thirty five minutes,\" Max said. \"No problem,\" Vincent replied. \"I need you to take me to St. Anthony's. You know where that is?\" \"Crazy Ants?\" Max echoed. \"The looney bin?\" \"Pretty much,\" Vincent replied. \"How far away are we?\" \"About twenty-two minutes,\" Max said, starting the cab. \"Good.\" Vincent thought for a few minutes as Max headed out into traffic. They were a few city blocks away when he suddenly said, \"Hey, hang on a second. I want to make a quick detour first.\" He gave an address. Callie's father's address. If he knew Rochester at all… \"How far out of the way?\" \"About an extra fourteen,\" Max replied. Vincent smiled. The guy knew his business. \"Take me there first. I won't be five minutes. Then Crazy Ants. I'll give you another hundred.\" \"No problem, man,\" Max said. Vincent settled into silence then. Normally, he would have chatted with the driver, gotten to read him a bit, but he wasn't in the mood. This wasn't like his other missions. This one was personal, and he was distracted by it. It was a bad sign, he told himself. Distractions were just ways to get killed. He had to be doubly careful, but he just couldn't help but wonder… Callie would have told her father about him. Then again, some little girls kept secrets from their fathers. Callie was, in many ways, still a little girl, although maybe not so much now, since the night they'd spent together. It sounded so romantic when he put it that way. Was he being romantic about Callie? What did he expect when he found her, anyway? He had no real idea. A natural human reaction to someone seeing a person who had caused them so much grief – and from the last few glimpses he'd had of her that night, he knew she had suffered considerably at his hands – was either anger or fear. Or both. Who knew how it would manifest? He doubted she was stupid enough to attack him, but he had no doubt that she'd try to run away. He had to be careful. Approach the situation with extreme caution. Maybe even make sure she wasn't alone. He might have a better chance if she was with others – the threat of harm to them might make her more docile. It had worked before…with her father… \"We're here,\" Max said, and Vincent blinked, realizing the cab had stopped. \"You want me to go up the driveway?\" \"No,\" Vincent said. He slid out of the back seat. \"Hang on a second.\" He knew Max wouldn't leave him. He'd waited the extra time for him before and knew that Vincent was as good as his word. Still, Vincent felt an urgency to get up the driveway as quickly as possible. He caught the scent of death before he was half-way there. Fresh death, from the intensity of the smell. It was warm, salty – given time, it would become much more acrid and bitter. Rochester had gotten in by the side door through the garage. Vincent pulled his gun and moved like a cat in his wake, but when he reached the kitchen, he knew Rochester was already gone. The bastard had had his fun. Vincent felt an awful twinge in his chest, looking at Callie's father. He'd been a good man, loving his children. Not enough fathers did that. He had had Vincent's respect, even though they'd barely known each other. There was nothing for it. Vincent turned and headed back out. He had to get to Callie – Rochester was already on his way, he was sure. He'd done this just for fun. He'd known exactly where Callie was already – killing the father was just rubbing salt in the wound, softening her up. Vincent scrambled to get back into the cab. As they pulled away, he turned and saw another car pull up, this one going up into the driveway. He caught a flash of a familiar face by the streetlight. It was the brother. \"I'll give you two hundred if you can get us to Crazy Ants in half the time,\" Vincent told Max. 888888888888888888888 The group of them didn't make it to the restaurant. Callie threw up on the curb half-way there, and Bill suggested she go back to her room at the institute and get some sleep – she was overstressed. Ray wanted to go with her, but Callie insisted that he not. She wanted him and Lupe to have a nice dinner – in spite of the prelude of vomit, she joked. She and Bill climbed into a cab, although Callie wasn't happy about it, and he took her back. She took a long shower, and lay down on the bed until the world stopped spinning. It was maybe an hour before she heard a knock at her door. \"Who is it?\" she mumbled, but tried to be loud enough to be heard. \"Laurie,\" came the familiar voice. \"I brought some Chinese food. Moo-Gu Gai Pan, your favorite.\" Callie pushed the towel off her face, which had been damp from the cold water she'd soaked it in. Now that she was sober again, her stomach was starting to growl, and the mention of her regular dish was enough to jump start her hunger. She got up and let Laurie in. \"So what happened?\" she asked as she went back and plopped down on the bed as Laurie put the white bag on the dressing table. \"Did Bill call you, or my brother?\" \"Uh…both, actually,\" Laurie admitted, sheepish. \"But Bill just wanted dinner and he was asking how he could get a pizza delivered here. I told him I would just bring Chinese, save him the trouble and expense.\" \"Where is he?\" she asked, pulling the bag toward her and digging through it. \"How many fortune cookies did you get?\" \"He's taking care of a few things down in the patient wing,\" Laurie said, helping her and himself to the food. He had pulled up the dresser chair beside the bed. \"He'll be back soon if you miss him so much.\" She looked at him. \"Was that jealousy?\" she suddenly said, emboldened by the lingering aftereffects of intoxication. Laurie looked startled, shook his head, shrugged. \"Why would I…I mean, that's silly.\" He shoved a forkful of Kung Pao chicken into his mouth. \"I also brought some root beer, I know that's your favorite.\" Callie looked at him for a long moment with a faint smile, and then said, \"So where are the fortune cookies?\" Laurie handed her the smaller bag. She dug one out, cracked it open, and pulled out the fortune. \"You're supposed to eat those at the end of the meal,\" he said. \"Sometimes I can't wait,\" she said. \"And besides, I don't know if my stomach can handle Chinese at the moment. A fortune cookie is blander.\" She took a bite. \"See if it stays down.\" \"What's the fortune say?\" Callie smoothed it out between her fingers. \"'Someone is interested in you. Keep your eyes open.'\" She frowned. \"That's a strange fortune. I've never gotten one like that before. Nowadays they're bland sayings like, 'You're a natural leader' or 'Sunshine and rainbows are good for you.'\" She looked up, caught Laurie's blush. Her smile returned. \"Eh, who believes these things anyway?\" she said, bundling it up and tossing it. \"Hand me that root beer.\" 888888888888 Ray and Lupe had a nice dinner that somehow turned out to be a kind of date. Lupe was incredibly attractive, but she was also smart and funny in all the right ways. He had to remind himself that there was a crisis going on. They exchanged numbers, and Ray went to swing past his father's house. It was part of his routine, checking up on his dad, especially now, with Callie being out of circulation. He felt bad, confining her to the walls of that institute, but safety was the topmost priority. He wished that his father had agreed to go with her. They had had that discussion – Vincent, after all, had visited the house. What if he came looking for Callie there? Ray Sr.'s safety was important as well, but the retired cop claimed he could take care of himself. Ray was going to try again. There had been a prickling at the back of his neck for the last two hours. It was his cop sense, the thing that told him something was really, really wrong, even when things looked perfectly ordinary. He caught the thick smell of blood before he was half-way up the walk to the house. He ran the rest of the way. And what he found was the worst thing he'd ever seen in his career, never mind the fact that it was his own flesh and blood that was the victim. On the wall, written in blood, were the words, \"I'm coming, Callie.\" And there was a drawing there, it looked like a little figure, rounded, stunted. He couldn't quite… Was it a chess piece? It looked a bit like a horse. Yes, a knight. Ray stood in the middle of the kitchen, and turned his eyes away from the sight. He pulled out his phone and reported the crime scene. He did not mention that it was his father's house. It didn't matter at the moment. He was a detective. He did things by the book. 888888888888888 Callie had just finished mopping up the rest of the Moo-gu-gai-pan with one of the \"pancakes\" that came with it when Laurie's cellular phone went off. He looked down at the caller id. \"It's your brother,\" he said. She frowned. \"Wonder why he's calling you and not me?\" she mused. \"Huh.\" Laurie looked at her for a second, and then answered. \"Yes?\" \"Is Callie with you?\" Ray's voice was hushed, and it was hard to hear him, as he sounded like he was in his car. \"Yes,\" Laurie said, nonchalant. Something was really, really wrong. \"Leave the room. I'm on my way – is there anyone else with her?\" \"Not at the moment…want me to check my files in my office?\" It was a cover, to get him out of Callie's line of vision. She was watching him, and he was sure she could hear the concealed panic. \"Whatever you need to do man,\" Ray said, waiting for Laurie to finish playing his bluff. Laurie lowered the phone. \"I'll be right back,\" he said, rising. \"Ray wants some information.\" \"I'll go with you,\" Callie offered. \"No, hang on…I'll page Bill.\" Laurie went back to the phone. \"Hang on a second, Ray.\" \"Hurry, man.\" Ray's voice was…strange. As if he were pretending to be someone else. Straining to be… Just then there was a light knock at Callie's door, and it popped open. Bill appeared, looking a bit disheveled. \"We've got a few problems down in the ward,\" he said. \"I'm going to have to go back—\" \"Watch her a minute,\" Laurie said to him in a low voice, giving him a very pointed look. Bill, who was very intuitive, instantly understood that something had happened, but he kept his mouth shut. \"What is going on?\" were the last words he heard from Callie before he closed the door. He started the walk down the hallway, trying to get distance between him and her, but not too much. \"What is going on?\" he echoed to Ray. \"Dad is dead.\" The words were choked. \"He's dead, Laurie. My father, Callie's father…I just found him at the house. He had been tied to a chair and cut to fucking shreds.\" He was barely holding it together now. \"I'm en-route. I'm taking Callie and we're getting the hell out of town, or something. I don't know, but I can't…I can't…\" \"Ray, calm down,\" Laurie said, keeping his voice cool and level. \"You're upset, it's natural.\" \"I'm a few minutes away,\" Ray said between gasping breaths. \"I'm…I'm coming…oh shit…\" and he must have dropped the phone because there was a thud. \"Fucking hell,\" Laurie murmured. 8888888888888888888888 Callie stood up. All of her alarm bells were going off. Bill blocked her way. \"Something is wrong,\" she said. \"And if it is,\" Bill told her calmly, \"Laurie will handle it. Meantime, you need to stay close to me.\" \"But you have to go down to the ward,\" she argued. \"I have to know—\" Bill caught her by the forearms. He was considerably strong, and he met her, eye to eye. \"Callie, you aren't going to panic. You're going to stay calm. Whatever is happening, you'll know about it soon enough. The ward can handle things without me for a minute.\" Callie looked back at him, and for a minute, she seemed to acquiesce to his suggestion. She turned away, and then, slick as an oiled snake, she charged past him, getting just under his left arm and to the door. Bill was only thrown for a moment. He was on her heels, ready to grab and restrain her if necessary, but she came to a sudden halt when she realized that Laurie was only half-way down the hallway. He was deathly pale, almost translucent. Her unexpected stop caused Bill to slap into her from behind and they both stumbled. Callie saw Laurie's face, and said in a forceful tone, \"Tell me what's going on.\" Laurie couldn't speak. It wasn't his place to tell her…but Ray had been near hysterical – for Ray, anyway – and there was no telling how long it would take for him to get here and deliver the news. It might be best if he… \"LAURIE!\" Callie shouted, stepping up right into his face. \"What the fuck is going on? Tell me right now, right now! \" He looked down at her. His heart was breaking…he had known Ray Sr. for a long time, they had been friends, as much as any two in their professions could be. Bill got Callie by the shoulders, ready to restrain her. She struggled against him, elbows and heels. \" Laurie !\" Her voice was at the top of her lung capacity now, shrieking like the squeals of an engine in bad need of a good oiling. \"Tell me, please, for the love of God, tell me!\" \"Your father is dead,\" came a voice, not Laurie's, from behind him, a bit of a ways down the hall. All three of them looked. It was Vincent. 8888888888888888888 Vincent had paid Max everything he promised, and got up the walk as quickly as he could. Once he was sure that Max had driven away, he calmed himself and found the back entrance. In the packet of papers he'd stolen from Jackson had been the security codes to get him into the institute. Without it, he wouldn't have had a chance. But that meant Rochester had it, too. He had to haul ass. Surprisingly, they were easy to find. He could hear Callie shouting at someone named Laurie—the doctor who was helping her write about him, he realized. She was almost hysterical. He followed the noise. They didn't see him approach. Vincent dared it as close as he could, but stopped just short of being within eyeshot. They would hear him, though. Callie was with another man as well, who was attempting to restrain her. He looked formidable – he had a bodyguard's appearance, but was dressed in scrubs. An orderly, maybe a bit more. From Callie's twists and turns, he could see that she was unarmed. In only jeans and a t-shirt, there was nowhere for her to tuck a gun except into her waistband, and it would have fallen out with all the ruckus she was making. He had to get her to come to him. And there was only one way to do that. He had to make her rush him. And there was only one way to do that, too. Finally, her voice screeched, cutting through his eardrums. \" Laurie! Please, for the love of God, tell me !\" She didn't know, but they did. So he ended the suspense for them. \"Your father is dead,\" he said. The suddenness of his voice surprised even him. All three turned and looked at him, with different levels and flavors of shock. The bodyguard, that Vincent could get so close and he not know it; the doctor, that Vincent was even there, and privy to such information; and of course, Callie. She looked at him at first in disbelief. Then it melted into anger, and something else…hatred. Blistering, freezing hatred. He'd been looked at like that a few times in his life. Also by someone he'd had an emotional attachment too. It felt the same. He was surprised. But she did what he expected. At the delivery of such news, she screamed, wordless, and broke from the two men flanking her. They shouted her name, but it was too late. She had her hands out, as if to strangle him, but he easily side-stepped her, grabbing her wrist and twisting her arm. She flopped back against the wall, and he turned to the other two. He aimed at the wall and fired. The doctor, who walked with a cane, ducked down and scrambled back, self-preservation kicking in. He did, however, start to shout Callie's name. The bodyguard was quicker, getting back and slipping into a crevice to shield himself. Vincent didn't know if he was armed -- probably not, working in a place like this. At least not with anything lethal. Then something unexpected happened. He felt teeth on his wrist, and he jerked. His hand released its hold on Callie's arm, and then, for good measure, she kicked him, getting the back of his knee at just the right angle. Then she ran away. Vincent watched her go for a second, then looked back at the other two. The doctor was not a threat – not at this distance. But the bodyguard, he was probably going for a weapon stashed somewhere. Callie had a gun. A good bodyguard would be aware of those things. He could easily go get it if he knew where she kept it. Which bought him a little bit of time. So he turned and ran after her. 88888888888888888888 Me: What? I already wrote the disclaimer. Vincent: That wasn't very nice what you said. Jackson: Yeah, I mean, what did I do? Max: I didn't do anything, either. Me: Oh, all right. Max, Jackson, I'm sorry. Vincent, kiss my ass. ( Vincent steps toward the writer. Jackson and Max step back, unwilling to get in his way . Then, like a Big Damn Hero, Bill arrives .) Bill: That's enough. Me: What the hell are you wearing? ( Bill looks down at his \"Captain Hammer\" shirt .) Bill: I got another gig. Joss Whedon's Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog . Me: Nice gloves. Vincent: (sarcastic) Yeah. Bill: Don't you start. Me: Um, no offense, sweetie, but I'm afraid that Vincent is going to hurt you. Rochester: Then I'll help. ( Rochester appears in his Iron Man costume ) Me: ( throws up hands ) This is not a superhero fic! Both of you, out of the costumes, now! ( Bill and Rochester look at each other, shrug, and start stripping .) Me: Whoah, hey! Vincent, stop laughing! Vincent: I'm sorry. But you always get what you ask for. Me: All right, show's over! Everybody go review! Geeze…[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: I don't own anything from the movie Collateral, Red Eye, Iron Man, or anything Joss Whedon. 88888888888888888888 Chapter Nine – Shut Up and Let Me Go Denial. It was usually the first step. She didn't believe her father was dead. No, wait, it had been anger. She'd rushed at Vincent, absolutely believing that he had done it, but no, denial had come quickly, pushing her into panic mode. She ran away, and her intent was to get out of the building, to get back home, to see for herself. But fear was pushing at both of them. The horror of the news he'd delivered seemed to be in competition with the horror of Vincent's presence. She heard him behind her, heard him call her name once or twice. She had to get away from him. Everything depended on it. She didn't have a chance. They rounded some corner, and her ankle twisted in her rush. She made only a light fumble, but it was enough. He slammed into her from behind, and mashed her into a wall, taking the breath from her lungs. She tried to scream, but didn't have the air. He pulled back for a second and spun her around, and she looked up into his face. This wasn't happening. It was a nightmare, brought on by her drinking. She was actually still asleep in her room, and she was going to wake up any second— Her breath came back. She managed to get the first part of a scream out before his hand nearly stuffed itself inside her mouth. His thumb went into her jaw, pressing hard on a nerve that caused her to wince. Then, with a power she didn't know a person could have, he forced her jaw to close. Her teeth ground together painfully, but she had a second surge, and started to struggle against him, kicking and squirming. \"Stop it,\" he ordered her in a harsh, breathy voice. He was so close to her – bodies locked together, almost like lovers, but brutal. She could suddenly feel every inch of him touching every inch of her, and intimately – bones grinding, his thigh between her legs, pinning her hard. She fought harder. It took every ounce of strength she had, but the knowledge of her father's death surged again in her brain, like a bad drug. Vincent swore in a language she didn't recognize, yanked her away from the wall, and the next thing she knew, they were in blackness. A closet. He'd found a closet and put her in the corner, imprisoning her there, his body the only barrier. He held her tightly until she lost her breath again, and her energy was slowly sapped from her. Finally, realizing there was no getting away, she instead turned her head as far from him as possible. His face had been pressed right against hers, cheek to cheek, the stubble of his beard scratching her neck in an unwelcome and intimate manner. She could feel his breath, smell his toothpaste. His lips were against her jaw, and she could hear him murmuring things into her ear, things her brain couldn't process. \"Calm down, breathe,\" she finally understood. His hand was against her mouth again, had been this entire time, and somehow he had her lips smashed so tightly against her teeth that she couldn't begin to open them. But the smell of him, and the taste – it assaulted her, filled her, until she felt like she was practically inside him, or he was inside her. She twisted her neck, trying to gain some room. Finally, he said, his mouth causing her earlobe to move with the motion, \"I'll take my hand away, but you can't scream again. Understand? Nod if you understand.\" It took a few seconds for her mind to comprehend, but she did. Slowly, she jerked her head up and down. He lowered his hand and clean air filled her nostrils. She stretched her lips, moistening them. Damn, his taste was even more intense. \"Hurry up,\" she bit, her voice raspy. \"Hurry up what?\" he asked, looking at her carefully. She glared at him. It was accompanied by a heavy sneer of her upper lip. \"Kill me. Like you did my father. Kill me quickly. You owe me that much.\" He blinked. She thought he'd come to kill her. Well, it was a natural assumption and he couldn't blame her. Still…\"I'm not here to kill you.\" \"Liar.\" She turned her head away. \"You're just such a liar. You've never told the truth, not once.\" \"I've never lied to you,\" he said, feeling indignant, in spite of the trauma of the situation. \"I'm not going to kill you, Callie. If I was, I would have done it in the hallway. I would have just shot you, like anyone else. Why would I be bothering with all of this?\" \"Because I ran away from you,\" she said, with an insanely calm kind of logic that he couldn't fault. \"I rushed you in the hallway before you could get a good aim, and then you didn't want to risk misfiring when you were chasing me. So just get it over with!\" Her voice rose, and he pressed a finger to her lips, hard. \"For the third, and last, time, I'm not here to kill you. If I'd wanted to kill you, I would have done it long before tonight.\" \"Whatever,\" she spat, words distorted but understandable behind his imposing digit. \"You killed my father, didn't you?\" He looked very serious. \"No, I didn't.\" \"Liar!\" Now she was loud, and he was going to gag her if she kept it up. He grabbed her face, squeezing her cheeks in with his fingers and thumb, causing her lips to protrude. \"I told you to be quiet,\" he hissed at her, his spit and breath fanning over her face. She winced, closing her eyes. \"You killed him,\" she whispered, eyes still tightly squeezed shut. \"I know you did.\" \"No, you don't,\" he spat back at her with contempt. \"You don't know shit, and you never have, and at this rate, you never will. I didn't kill your father, and if you say I did again it's really going to piss me off.\" She opened her eyes. How they blazed at him! \"Is that supposed to scare me? You getting pissed? You don't know pissed, asshole!\" she growled, starting to wiggle again. It would have been impressive if she hadn't been talking through overly-puckered lips, caused by the hold he still had on her face. And to her astonishment, he chuckled. \"No, sweetie, it's you that doesn't know.\" And then he kissed her. She protested with a loud, angry whimper – as loud as it could get with his lips squashed over hers. He pulled back, sure now that he had her full attention. He kept his eyes level with hers, his face only an inch away from hers. \"Now listen to me, very carefully. I did not kill your father . But the man who did is coming here to kill you. I'm here to protect you, you stupid bitch.\" She did not believe him. It sparkled in her eyes, like light glinting off sharp metal. And the sudden burst of profanity, directed at her, surprised both of them. \"Why?\" she demanded. Vincent did not answer. He pulled his gun and showed it to her. \"See this? It's neat and simple. Painless, mostly, unless people try to be cute. And I'm good with it. But this other guy, his name is Rochester—\" He saw recognition dance across her face. He pushed it aside, intent on asking her later. \"—is a different kind of animal. And if he gets a hold of you, Callie, it's going to make everything that happened to you that night with me look like a romantic evening at a fucking amusement park. Do you understand?\" He let it sink in for a second, and then was quite satisfied to hear her say, \"Yes.\" \"Now, you and I are going to walk out of this closet, and we're going to leave the building. You're going to come with me and I'm going to take you somewhere safe. Do you understand?\" She looked puzzled, and still insanely angry, but she nodded. He tucked the gun away, seized hold of her upper arm painfully hard, digging fingers through muscle until they nearly hit bone, and dragged her behind him. He cracked open the closet door, and when he was sure that the hallway was empty, he stepped out, her with him. They managed to get down the hallway and turn two corners before there was a loud click behind them. \"Let go of my sister,\" Ray Fanning said. Vincent froze. He'd been watching, but the corridors were dark. He'd been thinking too much about exactly what was going to happen next…he hadn't been watching carefully enough, and this guy had now snuck up on him. He was going to regret this, but it was necessary. 88888888888888888 Callie could not believe that this was happening. \"I said let go,\" Ray said again, calmly. Callie felt Vincent's fingers unclench, felt the blood start flowing again. But she didn't move. \"Callie, step away,\" Ray told her. There was something really wrong with his face. It was wild – his normally smoothed back hair was going in all directions, bent and kinked down across his forehead and even into his eyes. The hand gripping his firearm, pointed levelly at Vincent's head, seemed to tremble. \"Now turn around!\" he ordered Vincent. Vincent turned. Carefully, but unhurried, and certainly unconcerned. Callie suddenly had a terrible flash of that first moment in the alley…when she realized what Vincent was…those two street punks had had a gun right in his face, and he had killed them in two seconds. Probably less. \"No, Ray,\" she said, her voice scratchy. \"Don't.\" \"Be quiet Callie,\" Ray ordered her sharply. To Vincent, he said, \"You son of a bitch. You monster. How could you do that to—\" His voice cut off, choked. His hand was shaking a bit more now. \"You…bastard…\" \"Ray,\" Callie warned, \"Ray, please!\" \"SHUT UP!\" Ray barked at her. Callie saw Vincent move, saw his hand go to his back waistband, where the gun was tucked. She remembered the move, remembered it as clearly as if she'd just seen it two minutes ago. And she lunged forward, grabbing her brother around the waist and tackling him to the floor. His gun went off and plaster from the ceiling showered down on them. There was yelling and a commotion, and when Callie looked up, it was Bill who was standing over her, asking her if she could get up on her own, making sure she wasn't injured. Vincent was gone. Bill pulled her to her feet and Ray dragged himself up. Everyone was talking at once – Bill asking her questions, Ray swearing at her, demanding to know why she'd done that, and then Bill trying to tell Ray to calm down, and more swearing from Ray. \"SHUT UP!\" Callie screeched, a few centimeters away from Ray's face. The tactic seemed to work – Ray stopped talking, but only for a second. His next words were much, much worse than any profanity. \"Dad's dead.\" In her mind, she wanted to say, \"I know.\" She wanted to hug him, she wanted to cry with him. But her brain had hit its maximum point, and this confirmation, coming from her brother, was just too much. Systems shut down. Everything had to reboot. And she fainted. 8888888888888888888 Consciousness was almost more of a shock than the faint. It was as if Callie's brain had just suddenly realized that it was sleeping, and that it shouldn't be. She drew in a sharp breath and half-rose off the bed. Blinking wildly, she realized she was back in her room, at the institute, and someone was with her, talking to her in a soothing tone. \"It's okay,\" Laurie said, sitting on the bed beside her. \"You're okay, you're safe.\" She looked at him, made a strange choking sound, and then fell back again. \"I'm not okay,\" she croaked. It sounded horrible. Laurie sighed, deeply. \"I know. Here, drink some water. It's cold.\" Callie pushed herself up onto her elbows, moving slowly, because her head felt swimmy. Laurie pressed the straw to her lips, but she spat it out. \"I can't drink water through a straw,\" she grumbled. He frowned at her. \"Why not?\" \"Pet peeve,\" she answered. He sighed at her in annoyance and removed the straw. \"Don't choke,\" he said, tipping the edge of the glass against her lips. She drank a little at first, and then nearly drained half the glass. \"Easy,\" he warned, and put the glass back. \"What happened?\" she asked, still feeling fuzzy. \"You passed out. It must have been shock.\" Laurie had his cane between his legs and was leaning on it with his wrists crossed over the handle. \"Do you remember what happened?\" She lay back down, blinking rapidly. Yes, she remembered. As if it were all there in a picture and all she had to do was look to take in the whole thing. Every single detail sharp and clear. She drew a heavy breath, and then pressed the heels of her hands into her eyes. \"Yeah,\" she said, and then the tears came. She was surprised that she had the energy to cry them, but they came. She felt Laurie stroking her shoulder, and she popped back up again, clinging to him. He held her closely, cradling her. She wasn't sure how long the storm lasted. She knew it felt good to be in Laurie's arms. She knew she was in the only safe place in the world at that moment. Or at least the only place that felt safe. Then she realized that Laurie was talking in a soft voice, and it wasn't to her. \"Going to be a while,\" came the reply. Callie lifted up her head and peeked over Laurie's shoulder to see Bill just inside the doorway. He looked like hell…she almost felt sorry for him. \"He wasn't supposed to leave.\" \"He's not going to get into trouble,\" Laurie grumped in disgust. \"That'd be stupid. He had an emergency and good reason to leave the scene. See what happened here?\" \"What are you talking about?\" Callie asked, wiping her cheeks and sniffing hard. \"Your brother,\" Laurie said. \"He had to go answer questions. Police procedure. Now that you're awake, there's a detective outside who wants to talk to you, too. And there's two police officers guarding your door, and a third patrolling the windows outside that wall.\" Laurie pointed to the small windows, barred as they were. \"Fuck them,\" Callie growled. \"I don't want to talk to anybody.\" \"I know,\" Laurie said soothingly. \"But you're going to have to. In a little bit.\" She looked at him sourly. Then she slumped back against the pillows of her bed, dejected. \"Who cares? What are they going to do to me, throw me in jail? What can anybody do to me right now?\" Laurie and Bill exchanged looks. Callie was a rollercoaster and it was no surprise. She was sinking into the black, and as much as they wanted to help her, she just needed time. \"You want to be alone?\" Laurie asked softly. She thought about it for a moment, and then sighed. \"Yeah. Please. I just want to…I don't know.\" She slid farther down, and turned so that she was curled away from them. \"I just want everyone to leave me alone.\" Laurie patted her lightly and got off the bed, following Bill out of the room. \"If you need anything, just shout,\" Laurie said, and closed the door behind him. Callie lay on the bed, trying to clear out her head. Now that she was alone, she realized it was a mistake. She didn't want to be alone. Being alone made it harder to deal with the truth that her father was dead. Her father was dead. But who had killed him? Vincent swore he didn't. Not that his word meant much…but just the fact that he was here and she was still breathing spoke worlds. He told her, quite forcefully, as if offended, that he wasn't going to kill her. Then what the hell was he doing here? Who was his target? He'd said he was going to protect her. He'd tried to make her leave with him. It had to be more manipulation, more bullshit. More of him using her to get what he wanted. She was an easy mark, he knew that. He could use her and dispose of her and never have to worry… A rational voice in her head spoke up, uninvited. It pointed out that Vincent had explained to her that Rochester, the man she had briefly met at the bar, had killed her father. Why would he do that? He also said that Rochester was coming to kill her. That didn't surprise her too much – she'd been waiting for someone to try and kill her for almost three weeks now. It seemed a relief to finally have a solid place to put that fear. She rolled onto her back and shut her eyes. Nothing made sense…her brain couldn't be working right. Vincent couldn't care if she lived or died -- he didn't believe there was any good reason to live or to die. Not for anyone, not even himself. So why would he bother? Why would he go through so much trouble for her? It had to be a trick. A plan. A scheme. Nothing else made sense. And then her brain did what she had wanted it to do all night. It went blank. Precisely, it went blank because there was suddenly a hand across her mouth, and an unfamiliar weight straddling her hips. Her hands flew up as her eyes opened, and she saw only a dark blur as the figure straddling her managed to get both her wrists pinned above her head in its other hand. Finally, she got her eyes to focus. And what she saw did not surprise her. It was the man from the bar, who called himself Chess. Rochester. He smiled down at her. \"Having a rough night, Calliope love?\" She didn't even have the strength to glare at him. \"Aw, poor baby. You're probably in that stage right now where you just don't want to live anymore. Usually happens in severe depression. But you know, it can always, always get worse.\" He had a strange way of talking. A wiry kind of intensity that seemed to run through him like a live current of electricity, and at the moment, he seemed to have it barely under control. He was a colossal thunderstorm hiding behind fluffy white clouds. The rumble of his thunder echoed in the distance, threatening. \"Fuck you,\" she managed under his hand, muffled as it was. \"Well, actually,\" he said, looking thoughtful, \"that is on the menu. But somehow, baby, I'm thinking that if we get into it right now , it'll be a rush job, and neither of us will leave satisfied. Now, you promise to be a good girl and I'll take my hand away, and we can talk like partly-civilized people, except for the whole me-straddling-you thing. Otherwise, you can scream and fuss, and watch me kill some more people tonight. Do you really think you could take that, sweetums?\" She shook her head. \"Then you're going to play nice for now and be quiet?\" She nodded. There was apathy in her eyes, and it was throwing him off. But he took his hand away, and she stayed silent. \"You're the one who killed my father,\" she said in a dead voice. \"Oh, so my reputation proceeds me,\" he said, sounding satisfied. \"Did you get to see my work personally?\" His answer was the lethargy in her eyes being smoldered by a slowly building white-hot rage. This seemed to excite him. \"You know, I'd heard you were a firecracker, but up until now I wasn't believing the stories.\" \"Go ahead and do whatever you like,\" she said, her words coming from the bittern cavern that had replaced her heart. \"Vivisect me for all I give a shit. You'd be doing me a favor. Dying can't hurt more than living right now.\" \"Ah, that's the grief talking. You know, sometimes I do get ahead of myself. When we dance, sugar, I want to make sure that I've got all of your attention. It's just no fun when the other party's mind is somewhere else. I'm pretty selfish – I don't like sharing you with anyone else.\" His eyes sparkled. \"And right now, I'm doing just that, aren't I?\" She narrowed her eyes. \"I don't know what you're rambling—\" \"Vincent,\" Rochester said, smiling like a crocodile. \"Your knight in shining – well, more like tarnished – armor. He was here, wasn't he? I can smell his aftershave on you.\" Rochester dipped down his head, taking a heavy sniff of her neck. She tried to shy away but there was nowhere to go. \"Hmm…very uncharacteristic. You know, he used to be so good at this job. Not artistic, like me, but very efficient and effective. He's still got some skills, but he's got a big old weight hanging off his leg right now, and it's going to slow him down.\" \"You're crazy.\" He chuckled. \"Spoken like a woman in denial. I can't blame you, it's not exactly flattering. But he's going through some serious effort to keep you alive. Which means that you and I can't enjoy our private time until he's out of the way.\" She scowled. \"So you can't kill me until after you've killed Vincent? Why?\" \"Because I don't rush for anything,\" he said in a slow kind of purr. \"The thought of being interrupted…unbearable. So I'll let it ride for now, let the anticipation build. It'll be so much better that way.\" \"Why not just do it quickly and get it over with!\" she barked, a bit too loudly. He glared at her. \"You don't tell Van Gogh how to paint sunflowers, do you?\" And then, abruptly, he smiled, and stood up. He backed up, using the footboard of the bed, and reached up toward the ceiling, where a large vent sat in the middle. It slid out easily in his hands, and he let it fall with a loud crash that made her jump. Then, as if he could fly, he disappeared up into the opening, vanishing without another sound. The cops came in, summoned by the crash. They only saw Callie, sitting on the bed, looking at Rochester's escape route. They tried to find him, and came up empty. 88888888888888888888888 Me: Are we going to do one of these every time? Jackson: You sort of have to. You've set up a pattern and if you skip it, people will notice. Vincent: And then they'll come looking for you, and this cab. That's not good. Me and Jackson: Huh? Vincent: Sorry, wrong movie. Me: No, it's the right movie, just the wrong part. And that really, really wasn't nice to call Callie a stupid bitch. I'm going to get complaints. Vincent: Well, that's your fault. I mean, how intense did you have to make it all, anyway? And why the hell did I have to find her dad? Me: I dunno, I thought it was poetic. Or something. Look, it was hard enough to decide to off him, let alone how he got offed. And come on, we waited like eight freaking chapters for you and Callie to finally reunite! There were going to be some sparks and not all of them pretty as fireworks. Jackson: Where did Bill and Rochester go? Me: Bill had to get back to his gig with Joss Whedon. And Rochester…well…I don't want to talk about it. Vincent: What are you babbling about? Me: Well, turns out Callie is a Marvel fangirl, and…well… Vincent: Oh, no! That's just going too far! ( Vincent runs out of the room .) Jackson: Is that true? Me: No, I just said that to get a moment's peace. Okay, everybody, go review![Chapter 10] Disclaimer: Don't own, don't sue. 888888888888888888888888888 Chapter Ten: I Hate Everything About You (from the song by Three Days Grace) Stupid, Vincent told himself. It had been stupid from second one. He'd gone in there half-cocked, half-crazy, like some idiot brash rookie. But Callie had known. She'd known very well what was going to happen. And she'd saved her brother from him. He had to respect that. He was screwed. There just was no other way to put it. He was completely, utterly screwed. He should cash in his chips and go home, just forget it. Callie's brother would protect her. He'd do anything to protect her, and she also had that doctor, and that bodyguard… His mind flashed to the image of Callie's father. Something in him seemed to go dark at the very image of it being her. Although Rochester would do worse to her. Much, much worse. He drew a breath, and his cellular phone. He started to dial the number. This was bad, he heard a reasonable voice telling him. He shouldn't be doing this, he shouldn't be lowering himself like this. Peter had his limits, after all. \"You really screwed the pooch this time, didn't you?\" came Peter's voice, before Vincent could identify himself. Of course Peter knew it was him. Modern technology and all that. Vincent opened his mouth to reply and found nothing. He was getting out of hand. He was betraying his entire mode of life with this crazy endeavor… \"Oh, and next time you knock someone out, make sure that they're unconscious,\" Peter continued, in a casual tone. \"Jackson?\" Vincent managed. \"You managed to bruise him but not break him. Thank you for not killing him, by the way. I know you wanted to.\" \"Does he suspect? You asked me to make sure—\" \"Jackson does what he's told,\" Peter assured him. \"No, you didn't give anything away. But I'm sure that Jackson is going to be quite confused by his next set of orders, which I've just given him. You are to report back to LAX and go through to private gate fifteen. I've set up the jet. Stay out of sight and just sit tight. I know that's difficult for you, but it can't be anywhere as difficult as it was to make this call.\" And the line went dead. Vincent drew a breath. He felt a strange rush of feeling toward Peter, the closest thing he'd ever had in his life to brotherly love. Then it passed, and he caught a cab and headed to the airport. 8888888888888888888888 They had sedated her. Ray found her in Laurie's office, where they had moved to, where it was sure that there were no large vents leading in or out of the place, and she was lying on the couch, an ice bag over her head. She hadn't been injured, but she had felt like her skull was going to explode with all the stress, and cold seemed to help. They held each other, took turns crying, and then just held hands. Ray dozed off, exhausted, his head on his sister's lap. Callie was too tense to sleep – every time she heard a noise she looked around for its source. Bill and Laurie took turns coming in to check on them. The police patrol had moved to the office, and the grounds were being searched, but Callie knew that they wouldn't find either Vincent or Rochester. Men like them didn't get caught. They were ghosts. Demons. Vincent…the thought of him was strange. He seemed pleasant, compared to the man who had threatened to not just rape her but degrade her in all manner of unseemly ways. Vincent seemed…safe. Vincent had wanted to protect her. Why was that thought touching just now? Ray had been convinced, when he'd come in, that Vincent was responsible for their father's death, but Callie had calmly told him she didn't think so. Ray didn't believe her, but neither of them had any heart to fight, so they let it drop. She wanted Ray to wake up, wanted to convince him of her side. Rochester had frightened her. Frightened her in a way she hadn't known she was capable of feeling. It was a cold, sticky kind of fear, permeating her insides. The feel of him on her, the pressure of his legs, the touch of his breath, the vibration of his voice…she felt as if he still lingered on her, a stain, an odor. But this was ridiculous. Vincent had done his share of damage. None of this would be happening if it hadn't been for him. And the way he had handled her in the closet….the way he had kissed her, as if marking his territory. Oh, who the hell knew anymore…she'd been manhandled so much this night… The door creaked open slightly. Bill and Laurie were together now, both of them looking haggard. \"What time is it?\" she whispered. \"Don't remember…after midnight,\" Laurie managed in a sleepy tone. \"They wanted to take you to the county jail and put you in lockdown,\" Bill said. \"To keep you safe. Not prison accommodations, a bit nicer, but still…bars. Dr. Gregg talked them out of it.\" Callie grunted. \"You sure that was wise?\" Laurie shrugged. \"You want to be in a cage?\" He noticed Ray dozing. \"Well, I take it back—\" Callie chuckled – the first bit of humor in what felt like forever to her – and then gently shook Ray awake. He popped up with a bit of a start, shaking the couch for a moment. \"What?\" he said, his voice heavy with sleep. \"My legs were falling asleep,\" Callie said, smoothing back Ray's mussed hair. \"We have to get some better sleep accommodations.\" \"No, I don't want to leave you,\" Ray murmured, rubbing his eyes. They were horribly bloodshot. \"We can put you together,\" Laurie said. \"We just need to decide where.\" Ray stood up, shaking himself the rest of the way awake. \"All right, um…where do you suggest?\" \"I've got a few places that I think might work, but then again…well, you'd better check them out.\" Ray nodded and turned to Callie. Bill was sitting in the armchair closest to her. \"Don't worry,\" he said, \"I got her.\" Her brother gave her one last look over his shoulder. She attempted a weak smile back, but when he was gone, she groaned and put her head in her hands. \"I don't think I can take any more of this.\" A few minutes passed, and then Bill sighed, deeply. \"Callie,\" he said, \"tell me what happened earlier tonight. Tell me about Vincent and this other guy, Rochester.\" She looked at him, a bit startled. She hadn't expected that question from him, but the way he stared at her, the intensity of his bright blue eyes, threw her off guard. So it came sliding out…and not just the story, but her impressions of the whole thing, her confusion when it came to Vincent, his wanting to take her away to somewhere she'd be safe. \"After meeting Rochester, I'd almost take him up on it,\" she finished, mostly joking. Bill looked thoughtful, and then, almost reluctantly, he stood up. \"Come on,\" he said. \"Laurie and Ray are waiting.\" Callie frowned. \"I thought they'd come back when they were ready.\" \"Just come on, Callie,\" Bill said. \"I don't want you to be left alone. Just trust me. You trust me, don't you?\" Callie shrugged. Laurie had trusted him. That was good enough for her, so she followed him. The hallway was not quiet. The whole building had been upset by the night's events and there were still rustlings and distant noises that Callie found distinctly unpleasant. She decided, then and there, that maybe she didn't want to work here. Sure, she adored Laurie, but this place was starting to give her memories that she didn't want. It might not work out, she realized. Laurie…all through this he'd gone above and beyond the call of duty. He'd stuck his neck out for her and she hadn't even properly thanked him. Her father had been his friend…no doubt he too was shaken by the news. And that he'd had to hold it back from her…she wanted to be angry at him for that, but he'd done the right thing. It was Ray's place to tell her. She heard a buzzing. Bill pulled his cellular phone out of his pocket. He grunted into it a few times, and then turned to her as he hung it up, saying, \"Thanks.\" \"What is it?\" she asked. \"That was your brother,\" Bill said. \"He says it's a no go. In fact, they all want to pull out of here. He wants me to get you out of here, discretely, and take you to his precinct.\" She almost sighed. \"Well, I can't say I'm not happy to leave here, but still…what are they going to do, put me in a jail cell?\" \"It might be the safest place for you,\" Bill said sagely. \"And you'd be alone…the real threat in prison isn't the bars, it's the other prisoners.\" \"Great, solitary confinement. Wonderful.\" But still, she followed him down the stairs and toward a back exit. To her surprise, a taxi cab was waiting. \"That's…weird,\" Callie murmured. Bill pulled open the back door. \"Come on,\" he urged. \"We have to hurry.\" She let him push her in. She felt tired, malleable. Bill could have come onto her at that moment and she probably wouldn't have had either the energy or the inclination to fight him off. But as she rested her head against the back headrest in the taxi, and watched as the green-glowing sky of L.A. passed by, she started to realize that the route they were taking was lasting a bit too long. She looked around. They were getting onto the 105 Freeway. \"Where are we going?\" she finally asked, turning to Bill. Until now, she hadn't noticed how anxious he looked. \"Ray's precinct isn't off the 105.\" \"I know,\" Bill said, and was now looking, almost resentfully, at the back of the driver's head. \"We're going to the airport.\" She jumped. \"For what? Did the plan change? Are you going to get me out of town now?\" \"Yeah,\" Bill said, looking at her. There was something strange about it… \"What's going on?\" she asked, feeling a new surge of adrenaline. This one, however, felt much more hyper than the ones before it. It made her feel irrational, or more like she was going to crack up entirely. \"Where are we going?\" \"I told you,\" Bill said, tearing his eyes away. \"The airport. We're getting you out of town.\" She shook her head. \"Does Ray know about this? I want to call my brother.\" She reached for her phone, and realized it wasn't there. When had she forgotten her phone? She never forgot her phone. \"Hell…let me borrow yours.\" She reached across, toward his pocket. His hand clamped down across her wrist. Now she was afraid. \"Bill, please,\" she said, her voice turning pleading. \"I want to talk to my brother. He needs me. That monster Rochester just killed our father and—\" \"I know,\" Bill said, his voice strained. \"And he's going to do worse to you. Much worse. This is for your safety, Callie, trust me.\" \"Trust you?\" she spat. She was on the full emotional spectrum now, shifting into defiance and hurt. \"How can I trust you! You make these crazy choices for me…who gave you the right? You're not the boss of me! I want to talk to my brother now!\" Bill just stared at her, like stone. Callie turned to the driver. \"Excuse me,\" she said, her voice clearly indicating that it was an emergency, \"could you please turn around? This man is trying to kidnap me!\" The driver turned his head. It was a familiar profile. One she'd seen in a restaurant, sitting across from her… She gasped and pushed away, huddling in the corner between her seat and the door. \"Jackson,\" she whispered. \"Good to see you too again, Cal,\" he said with a smirk before turning away. She shook her head, squeezing her eyes shut. Tears were forming with the raw rage and fear and panic. \"No, no, no, this isn't happening…you are not doing this…\" Her eyes flew open and she shot a fist out at Bill. \" They trusted you!\" she screamed at him, her voice ricocheting around the enclosed space. Her fist smacked him in the shoulder, not hard enough to hurt but enough to get his full attention. \"How could you do this to them, to me !\" She realized she was sobbing. Bill looked awful. The guilt was all over him, and it seemed like her words had cut him. \"I know,\" he said. \"But it's for your safety, Callie. This is the right thing to do.\" \"LIAR!\" she screamed, and lunged at him. Bill was a large man, and he caught her wrists in his hands, pinning them back against the other door of the cab. His face was very close to hers, so close she could see the different shades of blue through his irises. \"Listen to me,\" he said in a soft, calm voice, still laced with self-resentment. The intensity of it frightened her. \"Listen very carefully. You are not safe here. I am not going to let Rochester cut you into pieces, Callie. But Dr. Gregg and your brother don't understand, not like you and I do.\" \"What do we understand, Bill?\" she asked in a soft, tremulous voice. \"We're here,\" Jackson said, pulling through a gate. They had weaved their way, during Callie and Bill's exchange, through the back roads of the international airport, and found the private hangars. They had stopped, clearing only twenty feet away from a sleek jet that looked like it was owned by someone who had a lot more money than most Hollywood elite. Bill did not let or go, or move to get out of the car. He looked at her, that intense gaze still there. \"Are we going to have any more problems?\" he asked in a low tone. \"How much did they have to pay you to do this?\" she murmured. \"You don't believe me, that's fine,\" Bill said, although he couldn't look at her anymore. His eyes shifted away. \"You'll see.\" He pulled back, but didn't let go. She was dragged with him, limp like a doll, through his side of the cab, the door of which Jackson was holding open. Callie glared at him, and then at Bill. \"So what now?\" she asked, tone icy. Bill let go of one wrist but held fast to the other as he walked her across the tarmac. There was a figure waiting for her. He was dressed in a darker suit, a charcoal gray, that off-set his silver-gray hair. Vincent. Callie stopped walking, point blank. Bill was jerked back a bit. She was going to hyperventilate – she could feel the oxygen leaving her lungs, and her chest started to heave. Gasping, she said, \"Oh God, Bill, please, please don't do this…\" \"Callie,\" Bill said gently, tenderly, \"you said it yourself. You said he wasn't going to hurt you. He wants to protect you…he's the best chance you have against Rochester.\" She blinked away tears, trying to maintain some of her dignity. \"How do you know so much?\" she asked. \"About Rochester?\" Bill asked, then he shrugged. \"They showed me the things he's done. I saw pictures.\" He shuddered, turning pale. \"God, Callie…I would have made you see them, too, but there wasn't time. I'm sorry it had to be like this. But when it's over, you'll forgive me. At least I hope you will.\" He really did sound regretful. It was hard to hold back the sobs and they came out as dry wheezing. She closed her eyes, and then felt him let go of her wrist. \"Go on, Callie,\" he cajoled. She shook her head. \"You don't know,\" she groaned. \"You don't know what this man did to me.\" \"I know he took you hostage earlier tonight, and could have killed you,\" Bill said rationally. \"He didn't. He should have killed you almost three weeks ago but he didn't. I know it doesn't make sense, but…you have to go.\" Almost against her will, her legs started to move. She couldn't look at Bill anymore. The level of betrayal was enough to make her wretch. These horrible people…everyone around her was against her, and the people who loved her were far away, or dead…she choked on another sob. Finally, she reached him. She kept a good distance, more than an arm's length, between them, but she couldn't look at him. She just stared down at his shoes. They were expensive, leather shoes. Foreign, from the design of them. \"Are you ready?\" came Vincent's voice. It was exactly like she remembered. She, at his mercy. Finally, she raised her eyes up to his. He was looking at her patiently, but it was edged with an urgency that she was familiar with. In the dark of the hallway and even greater dark of the closet, she hadn't gotten a good look at him. He seemed…different, somehow. More terrifying, and somehow less, at the same moment. \"Are you breathing?\" Vincent asked, raising one eyebrow. \"If you're stressed, you have to remember to –\" \"Keep breathing,\" she finished for him. \"I know.\" She shook her head, the despair finally reaching its ultimate, peaking in her throat and coming out in a high, whining voice. \"Vincent…don't make me leave my brother, please. He needs me so much now, I mean, Dad is dead…you remember my dad, don't you?\" Vincent sighed, and something flickered across his face that she had never seen before. Was it…compassion? Was he capable of that? Or maybe it was something else, because he closed the distance between them, and very, very gently, took her hand in his. \"The best way to protect your brother,\" he said in an undertone that was nearly tender, although that familiar force was behind it, \"is to get as far away from him as possible. You're a dangerous person to be around, Callie. And since I seem to be responsible for that…\" and then he broke off, as if he had just forgotten what he was going to say. He looked confused, gave a brief shake of his head. \"Come on,\" he said, tugging delicately at her fingers. \"Come on.\" 888888888888888888888 Jackson watched the exchange, not hearing the words, but understanding the body language. It was bizarre, for him, to stand and watched as the great and terrible Vincent was brought low before a little girl. He was careful to make sure the sign above his taxi read \"Not in Service,\" as he climbed back in and headed out. Traffic was always sticky around LAX, and it turned out that the 105 headed back into L.A. was out of commission from this end. The freeway entrance had a blockade over it, indicating it was closed. Swearing softly, Jackson turned back into the airport traffic, which pushed him into even more congested traffic. He couldn't seem to merge far enough left to make his turn, and wound up in the main part of the airport. He had just paused in front of one of the many lights when suddenly the back door opened and someone slipped inside. \"Not for hire right now, buddy,\" Jackson said, resenting the temporary role of driver he'd been assigned. True, being a manager wasn't all glamour, but there were limits for any man— \"Spare me,\" came the familiar voice, tinged with that attitude that had become familiar over the last few days. \"So did it work? Did she get on the plane?\" Jackson glanced at Rochester in the rearview mirror. He was watching him intensely, dark eyes large and round. \"Yeah, she's on it,\" Jackson said with a sigh. Usually, it was his business to know how everything operated, but there were times when he just had his own part to play, and moved on. Still, this job was making less and less sense as it went along. \"Good,\" Rochester said. \"Now they're together. Isn't that sweet, though? Vincent thinks Peter is helping him. He's actually helping to corral him into the trap.\" Jackson snorted. \"You know, evil villain talk is pretty far beneath you,\" he remarked. Rochester smiled and laughed. He had a very human sounding laugh, and his smile would have made any woman believe him to be a very handsome and even down-to-earth kind of man. But Jackson, too, had seen the scene after Rochester had done his favorite work, and knew better. \"Oh, well, it doesn't matter,\" Rochester sighed. \"Talk is cheap. It's results that cost the big bucks.\" He leaned forward so that his face loomed over Jackson's shoulder. \"And Vincent is really naïve enough to fall for this? He actually trusts Peter that much?\" Jackson shrugged one shoulder. \"Everyone has a weakness.\" \"Seems that old Vinny has two,\" Rochester murmured thoughtfully. Then he broke into another smile, this one almost like a shark. \"You know, I can't decide which part will be more fun – when I finally get to do her, or making him watch as I do it.\" Jackson had pulled up at another light. He was going to turn and say something scathing to Rochester, but reconsidered. He may have been Peter's mouthpiece, but that didn't always completely shield him from the stupidity of annoyed assassins. Sure, Peter would get mad at Rochester if he killed him, but Jackson would still be dead. And he'd heard a few unpleasant rumors about Rochester wanting to go into business for himself. \"Thanks for the lift, errand boy,\" Rochester said, tossing a twenty into the front seat. Jackson looked at it with contempt and would have given a derisive reply, but his passenger was already gone. 8888888888888888888 (The writer enters with suitcases packed) Jackson: Where are you going? Me: Away. On a trip. I won't be able to update for the next week. Not until Sunday night, anyway. Vincent: Who's going to look after us while you're gone? Me: I can hear the fangirls jumping up and down with their hands raised as we speak. ( Vincent merely glowers as Rochester enters, looking extremely hot and muscle-ly in his wife-beater. He's carrying a pizza .) Me: (under my breath ) Boo-ya. Rochester: What, me or the pizza? Me: You brought pizza? ( Rochester motions for Jackson get up. Jackson does, looking peeved, but Rochester sits down beside the writer and flips open the pizza box ) Rochester: Hope you like Mediterranean Style. Me: My God, I thought I was the only human being on Earth who liked that. Jackson: ( annoyed ) What did you bring that for, anyway? Rochester: Well, I figured that since we're all stuck here, we may as well get some munchies. Me: Good thinking. Vincent: ( sulking ) Look, don't you have some Iron Head fics to be in? Rochester: ( unfazed ) Nope. ( He and the writer start making googly-eyes at each other ) And it's Man. Iron Man. Me: And are you really an Iron Man? Rochester: ( suggestively ) Wanna find out? Vincent: All right, that's it! ( He charges toward Rochester ) ( Casually, Rochester lifts his hand and the Iron Man beam flies from the palm of his hand. Vincent is blown back .) Me: ( outraged ) HEY! Rochester: ( innocent ) What? He started it. Me: That's my main guy! This is his fic! You're just tagalongs, the entourage! You can't do that! ( The writer runs off after Vincent, who is smoking slightly .) Rochester: Oh well. ( shrugs ) Guess all of you will just have to review if you want to complain about this week's entertainment.[Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven: Black Holes and Revelations (from Starlight , by Muse) If she hadn't been so utterly paralyzed by the night's events, Callie would have appreciated the luxury of the private jet. It was decorated in dark browns and reds, the seats wide and comfortable, set across from each other like in a living room. A round table made of rich cherry wood sat between them, and there was a couch stretched out across the opposing side, upholstered with velvet and cushioned with fluffy pillows, although everything was in dark masculine shades. The carpet was so thick she almost swore she felt her feet sink. The lone flight attendant was of Asian descent, very pretty, with her dark hair cut neatly along her jaw line and her clothes all perfectly accenting her long shape. She was also very good at her job, and noticed nearly immediately that Callie wanted something. \"Would you like a cocktail, Miss?\" the woman asked, her voice only containing the barest hint of an accent. Hell, yes, I want a whole bottle of the strongest stuff you have. But instead what she heard herself saying, half-joking, \"You wouldn't happen to be able to make an Apple Martini, would you?\" The woman nodded. \"We have a full bar, Miss. Would you like a sugar rim?\" Callie nodded. Whatever she drank, her only real goal was not to not feel her legs when she was done. \"Here, before I forget,\" Vincent said as they settled down into the chairs, \"this is yours. It's for when we get to Bangkok.\" She mouthed the word \"Bangkok.\" It was a sleek black leather case, like a checkbook, only wider. She realized it was a passport, with her face inside. It was made up under a false name – Regina Chatwin. \"How…where did…where did this come from?\" Vincent gave her a quick, blank look, and didn't answer. \"Fasten your seat belt,\" he said. \"We're leaving soon.\" The flight attendant returned with the martini Callie had requested, sitting on a serving tray. She set down delicate blue napkins on the small table beside Callie's seat to place the glass. Then she handed Vincent a newspaper, and quietly walked away. Callie looked to Vincent, who she realized was watching her. She sipped at her drink, noticed that it tasted extremely good. With a mild jerk of her head, she asked, \"Does she cost extra?\" \"Who, Mariko?\" Vincent asked, glancing over his shoulder at the flight attendant. He turned back to her with a rather indifferent smile. \"I wouldn't know; she works for the man who owns this plane.\" \"Oh,\" she said softly. She had thought it was his. Why she'd thought that, she wasn't quite sure. \"And here I was thinking the assassin business must pay pretty well.\" He blinked. \"Was that a joke?\" She shrugged. She was going out of her mind. The martini was gone before she knew it, and she put the empty glass down on the table. Before she knew it, there was another in its place. This Mariko woman moved like a ghost. The plane started to taxi, and before she was even aware of it, they were in the air. She felt the mild pressure pushing her into the plush cushions, and glanced toward the couch. It looked very inviting. Hadn't she slept before? It was well into the middle of the night now, she should be sleeping now. It didn't seem to matter…the grief and the pain had taken everything out of her. She didn't know which end was up. Vincent flipped through the newspaper. Callie wondered how long they would be stuck on this plane, as they were technically flying half the world away. They would doubtlessly need to make stops to refuel…hell, they could be on this plane for the better part of twenty-four hours! She took a gulp of her refreshed drink and then set it down. Her eyelids drooped, and she rested her cheek on her shoulder for a moment. A blink turned into a sudden, half-dream like image, part of one of the reoccurring nightmares she'd been having for the last three weeks. The one where Vincent was chasing her out of the jazz club, and had pressed her up against the wall, and kissed her. The sudden chemistry of that kiss startled her awake. She shook herself, and let out a deep, distressed sigh before she could hold it back. \"What's wrong?\" Vincent asked, his eyes still on his newspaper. Her eyes snapped to him. \"What's wrong? \" she echoed, her voice cracking a bit. That got his attention – he looked up at her, his gaze mildly dangerous. A warning. She chose to ignore it. \"What's wrong, \" she went on, \"is that my father is dead, a demented psychopath wants to kill me, I'm on a plane to fucking Bangkok -- although God knows why -- when I should be with my brother, but I'm stuck here with you !\" The last words were spat out with scorn. \" That's what wrong!\" Vincent sighed, straining for patience. She had seen that look before. She was becoming unruly and he wanted to manage her. Her frustrated shifted into a blue-hot rage. \"I told you,\" he said, \"you're here for your protection—\" She gripped her arm rests and was leaning forward a bit, staring at him with wild eyes. \"But you haven't told me why!\" she shot at him. \"Why are you protecting me, Vincent? Why do you care whatever Rochester does to me?\" Now her tone was high pitched, borderline hysterical. \"Why, Vincent? Tell me why!\" Vincent gazed back at the woman across from him. Why did women always get like this? Why did they always need to talk everything to death? Why couldn't they just be accepting of the facts as they were presented? But no, they wanted feelings. They wanted intimacy. It had never, ever been to his taste. Sure, he respected women, but he wanted nothing more from them than the occasional satisfaction of a particular need. \"You're exhausted,\" he said, at the very limits of his tolerance. The itch to be violent with her, to subdue her, was getting uncontrollable. But she wouldn't be able to take it. He would end up hurting her, and that thought made him pause. He didn't like to think about why he was pausing; but instinct, which he put a lot of stock into, told him not to resort to force. \"You need rest. When was the last time you slept?\" Callie blinked. Numbly, she tried to think. She remembered lying down after throwing up outside the bar, but not sleeping…\"Don't remember,\" she mumbled. Vincent looked toward the couch. \"You should lie down. We're going to be here for a while. Sleep will make you calmer.\" \"You mean it will shut me up,\" she said bitterly. \"That too,\" he agreed, only a touch sarcastic. Then, softening, he said, \"Come on.\" She started a bit when he stood up, but he extended his hand to her gently, and she found herself reluctantly taking it. Defying him took too much energy, and he hadn't physically harmed her so far. She took his hand and started to rise, but the alcohol, her stress and sheer exhaustion collided together to make her slip. Her weight tipped forward and Vincent had to readjust to catch her before she collapsed against him. Her head was throbbing. It was just as well that Vincent wasn't telling her anything, she'd never be able to take it in now, not with the state she was in. She sighed again, willing the world to stop spinning. And then she realized how intimately he was holding her, and that he was staring down at her, an expression on his face that seemed familiar and alien at the same time. She couldn't help it. The question came out again, but this time in a quiet plea. \"Why are you doing this?\" Their eyes met. That lupine green that had been burned into her brain countless times shimmered back at her. He pulled her closer to him, and Callie didn't resist. When had this happened to him? Vincent had replayed that night over in his mind, looking for his mistakes, but he hadn't once tried to consider when these feelings for this woman had started to develop. He remembered finding her reasonable attractive when he'd first approached the cab. He remembered not wanting to shoot her in the head after she first tried to run away from him, and not quite understanding why he hadn't done that. Then there was the jazz club, listening to the music, getting lost in the mood, dancing with her, feeling her close to him… And kissing her outside in the street. That spark that had passed through them had rocked him. Was that the moment? The point of no return? He raised his hand and brushed his fingers through her hair. She really was rather a mess –her face was swollen from tears and strained from tension. But as he stood there, so close to that face, to this person who had somehow managed to graft herself onto a part of his spirit, he felt a sweet kind of relief. He was with her now. It didn't matter what else happened, he was finally with her. He was leaning down. Her face was getting closer. And then Callie blinked and realized that he was about to kiss her, and turned her head away. It hurt, but it did not surprise. Vincent was used to hurt. He could have tossed her away, thrown her onto the couch…a dozen other things flashed wickedly through his mind, but he dismissed them. He wasn't that kind of man. Instead, he maneuvered her and then gave her a mild push down into the couch cushions. \"Get some rest,\" he said, and returned to his seat. She looked at him, shaken. Her body had stiffened and now she couldn't relax. \"Is there…is there any way I could call Ray?\" she ventured. Vincent looked up at her, a bit startled. \"Why?\" he demanded. \"So that he knows where I am,\" she said, keeping her voice smooth. \"He's got to be really, really worried about me, Vincent. I mean…our father was just…!\" Vincent looked away as her voice trailed off, his jaw tightening. He let out his breath and said, much to his own surprise, \"Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Your father seemed like a good man. He didn't deserve…what happened.\" She seemed a bit thrown by his sudden condolence, but took it in stride. \"So you can understand why my brother is--\" \"It's not a good idea,\" he said, his tone more conversational now. \"Rochester probably knows you're not in L.A. any more, but he may not know where we're going. No sense in giving him a trail. On top of that, if Rochester thinks your brother knows where you've gone, it might tempt him to do the same thing to him that he did to your father. So you'd be endangering yourself and him. Your doctor friend as well.\" Something about the way he said friend …did he sound jealous? She exhaled, defeated. It was too much, she should have known better. \"Fine,\" she said in a small voice. She turned away from him and lay down on the cushions, then curled so that her back was to him and her limbs were pulled in protectively between her and the back of the couch. Before she knew it, she was asleep. If she did dream, she didn't remember it. 88888888888888888 Hours passed. Vincent tried to read the newspaper but his eyes kept going to Callie's back. Here she was, flesh and blood, and totally vulnerable. He had absolute power over her. She had to go where he led, do what he said…sure, she could kick and scream, but he'd win. He had won last time. He rested his head back against the headrest and tried to shut his eyes. The deep sound of her breathing filled his ears, and when the noise outside the plane, the whine of the engines or the thrust of the air pressure, overpowered it, he felt himself straining to catch it again. She was a talker. She probably didn't realize it, but words came out of her mouth, randomly, while she slept. She was probably in that deep sleep where you don't remember your dreams. Did she dream about him? He figured she did, but doubted they were pleasant. He didn't want to be pleasant. Being pleasant left too much room to argue. If she started to think that he had feelings for her, she might try to manipulate him, and that simply wasn't acceptable. Couldn't she see that all of this was for her safety? Couldn't she just accept the help he was giving her, much to his own extreme inconvenience? But then again, she was dealing with a tremendous amount of stress on top of that. Most people got pretty upset when a parent was viciously murdered. He had noticed that over the years. It had never made too much sense to him, but he had encountered, like in Ray Sr., the kind of father that was capable of creating affection instead of animosity. That was why Vincent had liked the man. He didn't ignore his children. Callie sighed and shifted in her sleep. \"Watch,\" she said, her voice soft and perfectly clear. She could have been having a conversation. Vincent turned his eyes away again. He could seduce her. The thought jumped into his brain and latched on. It wouldn't be that difficult. Her body wanted him, even if her brain didn't. He could seduce her and get her out of his system. It would be easier then, wouldn't it? Without the distraction of wanting her so damn badly? Instinct, again, told him that wasn't going to work. How long had he been sitting here? The sky outside was starting to lighten. He could catch faint glimmers of the ocean underneath them. A rumbling noise distracted him, and he realized it was coming from her. Her stomach was making strange, gurgling noises. Loud, almost intense noises. Sure, she was tired, but her body was also hungry. Mariko appeared, as if psychically commanded. \"Would you care for something to eat?\" she asked. \"We have fresh eggs, and bacon.\" \"Some omelets sound good,\" Vincent said. \"Toast? Or perhaps you would prefer pancakes; I can make them from scratch.\" \"That would be fine,\" he said, his eyes back on Callie. He felt stiff from sitting in this chair what, eight hours now? She needed to wake up. She needed to eat, build up her strength. He stood up, stretching his muscles. The cracks and the mild tweaks reminded him that he was getting older. He didn't need sleep like most other people did – military training had long since taught him how to go without. He would catch a few hours once they got to the boat. Then it might be safe enough to close his eyes for a bit. He approached the couch and bent down. He grasped Callie's shoulder and gave her a gentle shake. She shifted, but did not wake. She was really deep in it, he realized. \"Callie,\" he said, bending low, over her ear. \"Callie, wake up.\" Her eyes popped open and she blinked, then they drooped shut again, overwhelmed by exhaustion. \"Few…few min…nuts.\" Vincent shook his head, biting back irritation. He stepped over to the small bar, where Mariko had made their drinks, and poured a glass of water. The flight attendant was busy making the pancake batter, and he could hear the sizzling of the pans and smell the sweetness of the oil. His own stomach gave a lurch and made a mewling sound. He was hungrier than he thought. Going back over to the couch, he knelt down beside her. He had to shift her so that he could reach her face, but still it didn't rouse her. He dipped the tips of his fingers into the water and flicked a few drops on her face. Her cheek twitched. Vincent sighed. He wiped away the drops, and then realized how warm she was. Warmer than the kind of sleep warmth that made him suddenly want to bury his face in the crook of her neck and inhale her scent. He violently shook that thought away, and flicked more water onto her this time. She flinched, her eyelids fluttering. \"That's it,\" he said, his voice a bit louder. \"Come on, back to the waking world.\" She rolled onto her back, putting her right smack in the middle of his arms. Her shoulder rested against his chest, and she looked up at him, as if not believing this, as if wondering if he was a dream. \"Yes, it's real,\" he said. \"Don't you remember?\" She started to flounder, trying to get herself into a sitting position. Without being asked, Vincent slid his hand under her back and gave her a light push. She groaned, her face scrunching. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. \"Head hurts,\" she hissed between her teeth. \"You're dehydrated,\" he told her. \"Drink this.\" He handed her the water. She took it and eyed it suspiciously. Vincent snorted. \"Yes, I drugged it. I woke you up from a dead sleep to drug you and knock you out again.\" She narrowed her eyes at the scathing sarcasm, but took the water. Then, the smell of the pancakes on the griddle reached them both. Callie turned her head, her eyes looking eager in spite of herself. \"Breakfast will be ready in a few moments,\" Mariko told them, appearing silently and disappearing the same way. Vincent, whose calves were bunching up from being crouched beside her, hefted himself onto the couch. It was just a bit too close to Callie for her comfort. Her body language spoke louder than any words, and he heard it. Vincent felt weary. \"I don't suppose there's anything I can do to make you trust me, is there?\" he said, and then was surprised those words had slipped out of his mouth. Everything he did was usually so calculated. Being improvisational was one thing. Being vulnerable was something else entirely. She blinked in surprise. He almost expected her to answer, but instead she swallowed the rest of the water. She set the glass down, but when she straightened again, Vincent was even closer to her, his hand sliding along the back of the couch to rest on the back of her neck. His face loomed in her vision, the salt and pepper of his overgrown stubble, the shape of his lips, the curve of his cheeks. \"I read your book, you know,\" he said, his mouth very close to her face. She frowned. \"My book?\" She didn't think of it yet as a book. It was a memoir of that night, and a research work in progress. Then she blinked, and realized that Laurie had mentioned that the manuscript had been shifted on his desk. \"How?\" she whispered. He smirked. \"Jackson sent it to my employer. He sent it to me.\" She was blushing furiously. Then she willed it away. He had terrorized her , not the other way around. She had nothing to be ashamed of. \"You really think,\" he said, his voice low, that familiar murmur she remembered too well, \"that all those times I kissed you, I was just trying to manipulate you?\" \"Yes,\" she said, before she could think about the answer. She looked away, willing him to move back. She was at the edge of the couch. The only way to get away from him was to stand up, and even that guaranteed nothing. Besides, she still wasn't sure how steady she'd be on her feet, and to tumble into him again was unthinkable. \"Really? That one outside your father's house?\" She flinched. It was too much, the pain was too raw, the loss of her father. But she did remember. She remembered how tender he was, and how confused she had been when she thought about it later, wondering what he had hoped to accomplish. \"Doesn't matter,\" she said in a cracked voice. \"Doesn't matter what you meant by any of them. It doesn't change anything.\" He let out a soft breath and it spread against her cheek. \"You know, I'm sorry about before, when I called you a stupid bitch.\" She narrowed her eyes in annoyance. Her lips flattened. \"But really, sometimes, Callie, you can be really, really dense. Why the hell do you even think you're on this plane, right now?\" He had gone back into his working mode, she could tell by the way his voice changed. That reasonable tone, the way he seemed to be almost counseling her on the way she should feel. \"You realize that you're safer here than anywhere else in this world? Or worse than that, it should be me trying to kill you and not Rochester. But no, I've gone through all this trouble to save your life, and do I get any thanks? No, all you can do is look at me with suspicion…and clam up.\" \"What do you want me to say?\" she burst out, turning to him. \"You want me to say thank you?\" \"It would be a start,\" he returned. \"Fine. Thank you, Vincent. Thank you for everything. Thank you for getting into my cab three weeks ago and dragging me around the city to watch you murder a half dozen people. Thank you for making me a target for a major crime lord because he thinks I witnessed all those murders, and can testify against him. Thank you for being the reason that this creep Rochester even knows I exist. And thank you for dragging me away from my brother, who is the only family I have left! I don't know what I would have done without you!\" His eyes, which had clamped into hers as she spoke, had slowly grown brighter, the line of his mouth drawing tighter and tighter. She could feel the suppressed fury radiating off him like waves of heat, and she stood up, attempting to protect herself. He followed, like she knew he would, and he grabbed hold of her, yanking her close to him. He wasn't much taller than her, but his presence towered over her. \"So what do you want me to say, Callie? You want an apology? Oh, I'm sorry, all right. I'm sorry I ever got into your cab! Before that night, you were nothing – you were just another speck of dust. Have you even stopped to realize that the only reason you're alive now is because I couldn't kill you? Did you even think about why?\" His voice had risen slowly as he railed at her, and he was losing control. He didn't know where half the words coming out of his mouth had come from, and he knew if something didn't stop him, he was going to blurt out something he could never, ever take back. She stared up at him, partly in fear, but partly in curiosity. \"So tell me, why then, Vincent,\" she dared him, even though her voice shook. \"Why can't you kill me?\" He grabbed her by the back of her neck and brought her face up to his. He stopped, his mouth a few centimeters away from hers, and waited. When she didn't move, he said, \"Don't tell me you don't already know.\" She didn't know what came over her. The memories, the nightmares, washed over her, but there was something wrong with them. It hit her, all in a rush, the horrible power she had suddenly gained. He hadn't killed her…because he couldn't . 888888888888888888888 Jackson: Dun dun duuuuuuuunnnn! Me: Shut up! I can't get Vincent to stop smoking. ( Vincent sits in the chair, smoke still coming off his suit. Not to far away, Rochester, in disgrace, glowers on ) Vincent: ( disjointed ) Mommy? That you? Jackson: ( to Rochester ) Oh, you're really screwed now. Rochester: Really? About time. Me: ( furious ) Not that, you jerk! You almost cooked him! Rochester: Well, he shouldn't have gotten up in my face! Me: You don't get to use those things in this fic. Hope you can hold your own without them. Rochester: Oh, look at me, I'm shaking in my shoes. Jackson: Wow, you're really getting into character. Rochester: Well, not much else to do with my time, considering the entire last chapter was just Callie and foxy-boy there on the plane. Me: Vincent, come on, snap out of it. This whole chapter was all about you! You and Callie, anyway… Vincent: ( still dazed ) Me? Me: Yeah, you, the reason I'm writing this fic. Vincent: ( tipsy ) Really? Jackson: Oh, God, you blasted him stupid. Me: ( strokes Vincent's hair ) Of course, dummy! Vincent: Aw. ( pulls the writer onto his lap ) You're sweet. ( puts his head on her shoulder ) Me: Um…okay, you guys go review. Maybe he'll be sober by the time you come back.[Chapter 12] Chapter Twelve: You're All I Have (from the song by Snow Patrol) It was unbelievable. If she had been anyone else, she would be dead. But no, somehow that night everything had gotten turned around. She had been his prisoner, and somewhere along the line, he had become hers. The look in his eyes, which filled her vision, was so desperate, so lost…it shocked her. Could it be? Could it be that this man, twisted and broken as he was, had feelings for her? That perhaps he even thought he might love her? She let out a breath that was almost a gasp, and then he couldn't take it anymore. He closed the rest of the distance, and she found herself closing her eyes and parting her lips. She had to know. She had to know the truth. He kissed her. It was gentle, but demanding. All the other times it had been passionate and forceful – he had been trying to get something out of her, get her to do something. The feelings had come almost as an afterthought, although they shook the whole foundation. Even outside her father's house, when he had been more thoughtful and subdued, there had been something dangerous lurking underneath. There was danger now, certainly. And a terrible urgency. But he was tender with her, which shocked her even more, and allowed her to prolong the kiss. His mouth moved over hers, the stubble of his beard scratching her in delicious familiarity. His hand had moved so that his fingers were entwined in her hair, but not painfully – no, delicately, tangling himself up in her burnt auburn locks. The other hand was on her back, his fingers splayed along her spine, moving up and down, causing sparks of electricity. Tentatively, she reached up and grasped his shoulders. She felt him tense, but when she didn't push, he relaxed, and she could feel the muscles in his arms. Then, she did something she had hitherto thought unthinkable – she reached up and stroked the back of his head, and was stunned to feel how soft his silver locks were, how pliable and smooth. She heard something, and realized it was a moan in the back of his throat. The rush of sudden power over him went to her head, and made her dizzy. She shifted the kiss this time, her teeth grazing his lower lip. And then, almost out of control of herself, she flicked her tongue against his upper teeth. His body seemed to surge in her arms. It convulsed and tightened around her, and then the spasm passed, and she almost smiled. It was true. Vincent had feelings for her. All this time she had been so upset over how he had affected her, she hadn't spared a single thought for how she might have affected him! He gave a little growl and his mouth suddenly smothered hers. It felt so good…it was insane how good it felt! It shouldn't…she was going crazy, it was the grief, it had to be, it had dislodged her, was making her do unimaginable things. It was like playing tag with a wild lion – any second he could turn on you and eat you alive. Sparks of reason flickered through her brain, and a voice demanded, louder and louder, that she stop this. But she was drowning in him…like playing in a riptide, letting it carry you away. Finally, when he broke for air, she turned her head away. It took a full minute for her to get enough of her wits about her to put pressure on his arms and get him to release her. For a moment, it felt like he wasn't going to do it. One didn't crawl into the cage and then simply knock to be let out again. His body was rigid, almost vibrating against hers. \"Vincent, please,\" she said, keeping her voice breathy and sweet, \"please, stop.\" \"Why?\" He was equally breathy, but she heard that predatory tone in his voice. \"Because,\" was all she could manage for a few heartbeats. \"Because this isn't right. I can't do this.\" \"You can't? You are .\" She shook her head. Why couldn't she think straight? Dammit, she had gotten giddy and ignorant and didn't stop to remember that the reason Vincent had been so successful influencing her last time was because she had been so attracted to him, at least initially. She had forgotten the power he had over her, which was still very real and very toxic. \"Please,\" she said, her voice still soft, trying to be innocent. Maybe she could appeal to that man inside him that didn't want to hurt her. That part of him she had just noticed, that had feelings for her. \"I'm not ready for this. Please, Vincent.\" Reluctantly, so reluctantly, he eased his grip. He stared at her for several long minutes, and then they were interrupted by a soft cough. \"Breakfast is ready,\" Mariko said. Vincent made a gesture toward Callie, as if she should go. She turned, going to the small dining area where two fresh omelets and a stack of pancakes awaited them. Her step was unsteady, but it took Vincent another five minutes before he could join her. 8888888888888888888 This was, by far, the worst night in Dr. Laurence Gregg's life. When they had discovered that both Callie and Bill were gone, Ray had assumed the worst. But what was the worst? If someone had killed Bill to get to Callie, wouldn't there have been a body? Or maybe both of them had been taken. And then there was the unfathomable – that Bill had taken Callie. Laurie couldn't bring himself to believe it. Bill had been with the hospital over five years, and Laurie had known, when he was hired, the kind of past he had. He worked at the hospital not for money or glory, the both of which he'd already enjoyed. It certainly wasn't for glamour or excitement, of which there was none of the first and too much of the second. No, Bill had worked at this job because he was one of the rare few who saw it as a calling, a vocation, a need to do good in the world. After this job, he was going to promote him to the head of the orderly department, and he was almost sure that Bill wouldn't accept the promotion. But Bill was gone, just like Callie. Laurie tried his house, and got nothing. Ray had been livid. He was already at the edge, dealing with the violent death of his and Callie's father. This had cracked him down the middle. First he'd reacted violently, starting to throw things and generally wrecking Laurie's office. Laurie had called on some other orderlies to help restrain Ray, although Ray was not his patient and they couldn't exactly strap him to a bed, but they'd managed to hold him down long enough to sedate him, which had taken the wind from his sails. In the ensuing hours, the police had gotten to work, but their results were not good. There was no way to know where Callie had been taken. If she had been executed, it would have been done quickly, and the body would be nearby, but there was no sign of her in the subsequent search. Laurie knew. He'd read the things that Callie had written. Vincent was not a local. If he'd taken her, then he would have gotten her out of the country as quickly as possible. And worse, if that Rochester had gotten her, they wouldn't know for sure until the body dropped. It was bleak. It was awful. He had never felt like such a failure and disappointment in his life. And worse, so much worse, he felt guilty for letting Callie down. He felt grieved over her loss, as if she had died. So he sat in his office and snuck shots from the bottle of whiskey he usually kept locked in the bottom drawer of his desk, which he rarely drank except when the day's stress threatened to snap him in half. He had gotten half-way through a bottle that was three quarter's full when the telephone rang. Laurie looked at it. It was his private line. It was also well past three in the morning and the place was deserted, except for the few foot cops who had been left to watch over the scene. Ray was in the room where Callie had been staying, as it was the first available bunk that they had that wasn't in the ward – although Laurie had threatened to put him down there if he didn't at least try to get a hold of himself. The phone kept ringing. Six, seven, eight. Finally, he reached out and picked it up. \"Dr. Gregg,\" he said. \"Hello, doctor,\" came a familiar voice. It sounded tired, but nonetheless the power was still there. \"I take it you're having a bad night.\" \"Rippner,\" Laurie said. \"Why do I get the feeling that none of this is coincidence?\" \"Well, you are a doctor,\" came the snide voice. \"One would hope that would mean you had some brains. But if it's any consolation to you, you're not the only one whose been having a bad night. And I'm here to make it all better.\" \"Oh, lovely,\" Laurie mocked, even through the slur of alcohol. \"So you're the doctor now. What do you want, my head on platter?\" \"If I did, you'd give it,\" Jackson mocked. \"You know perfectly well how much Calliope Fanning means to you, Dr. Gregg. So I'm sure that you'll be much more responsive to the offer I'm about to make.\" Laurie sighed, weary. It was true. He would put his head on a platter to get her back. \"Name it.\" \"My employers don't want you publishing that book,\" Jackson said, reiterating what he had already said before, both to him and to Callie in the restaurant. \"They want you to cease and desist all research, any mention of Felix Reyes Torrena, or of anything that might legally pertain to him.\" \"So what do you want, my word? There's more to it than that.\" \"Indeed. Let's just say that we know what channels to watch. We'd ask you to turn over all your research, but who knows, you might be foolish enough to make back-up copies and neither of us could ever get a moment's rest over it. So we'll make it very simple. Anything gets out with her name on it, in any connection to that night in question, and it's a straight up execution.\" \"So I agree to this, and you return Callie to me?\" \"I can arrange it,\" Jackson said, although there was something in his voice, something fidgety, that made Laurie doubt that he really could. \"Why bother?\" He knew he was being risky, but he had to know. \"Why return her? You obviously want her dead.\" \"Yes, but you don't,\" Jackson replied smartly. \"Dead, there's nothing to prevent you from attempting to destroy our client. Alive, and it's a continuous threat we get to hold over your head. And hers, incidentally.\" \"So how do I even know she's still alive right now?\" Laurie dared. \"Let me talk to her.\" \"She's not in my present company,\" Jackson said simply. \"So how do I know that you can do what you say?\" \"You don't,\" Jackson snapped. \"But is that a risk you want to take?\" \"It's more like your risk, Mr. Rippner,\" Laurie said, getting some steam. \"Until I get proof that Callie is alive and safe, I'm not giving up anything. If you can guarantee me her safety, then I'll give you whatever you want.\" There was a pregnant pause. \"Fair enough. Give me your cellular phone and I'll see what I can arrange. But don't do anything foolish, Laurence. You'd hate to jeopardize her, wouldn't you?\" Laurie gritted his teeth. He gave the number, and then Jackson hung up. Ray was not going to like this. 8888888888888888888888888 Breakfast was delicious. Callie tore through her omelet and pancakes, alternating one to the other, stuffing herself until she felt nearly delirious. She hadn't realized how hungry she was. And as she sat there, feeling her strength coming back to her after rest and a meal, she started to feel something like sane again. The mere thought of her father was a knife-like pang in her heart, but what would he have said? He would have told her that she had to deal. He was gone, she had to accept it, because there were more important things – especially to him. She knew, deep down, that her father had died because he'd refused to give her up. He'd died for her. She'd be damned before she would let that sacrifice go to waste. But worse than that, she was starting to feel the first glimmerings of wanting revenge. She pushed them aside – they were ridiculous. Not only was the task inestimably dangerous, but she had no way to even think about accomplishing it. \"You full?\" Vincent asked her. She glanced at him across the table. He'd barely gotten half-way through his meal. She had scarfed it down like a hog at a pig's trough. She noticed her empty place. She was about to say no, she really wasn't, but Mariko beat her to it. Another omelet, this one a bit smaller, and a few more pancakes glided gracefully onto her plate. She sucked down another glass of orange juice. She had never really liked orange juice – too much acid for her taste. But this stuff was fantastic. Delicious and sweet, no pulp, just the right thickness. She could have drunk this stuff for the rest of her life and been happy. Vincent went back to his meal. Callie noticed that he had let the pancake syrup get into his omelet. It sent a sharp jab through her ribs – Laurie did that. Oh, God, Laurie…she wished she could call him. He was the only voice of sanity right now, as her brother was no doubt still consumed by the loss of their father and crazy with worry over her disappearance. Laurie would be worried, he would be upset, but he would be rational. She had always liked that best about him, how rational he could be, even when everyone else panicked. What would he tell her? She was stuck in this situation and she had to make the best of it. So to go over the facts: 1) Vincent was not inclined to harm her. He wanted to protect her. Truthfully, after what she'd seen, she was pretty sure he could do it, too; 2) Vincent had feelings for her, but how could she know for sure what they were? Men were disposed of doing stupid things when it came to their lusts, but she doubted that Vincent was such a victim of his urges. So it had to be more than lust he felt, didn't it? Why couldn't he say it, though? Why couldn't he just come clean and tell her? Laurie had emphasized that understanding your patient was critical – not feeling pity or sympathy, but being able to understand on an empathetic level where the other was coming from. Vincent was coming from an empty life – no mother, no father, foster homes, abuse, and God-knew what else. No ties of any kind, no romantic affiliations, never been married…she wondered if he'd ever been involved with a woman. Not just sex, but men who had abandonment issues generally tended to be unable to establish any kind of intimacy with a member of the opposite sex, or even their own. Being physical was not a problem – the mind didn't have to be connected to the body. In today's world, people were just things, commodities. He more than likely bypassed the traditional method of getting laid for the world's second oldest profession. So, her doctor's mind told her, having intimacy issues, he would be unable to express to her what his feelings were. He probably didn't understand them himself. Which was why he was acting the way he was acting. If it was weird or out of character, though, she couldn't be sure. She only had one night with him against which to measure everything else. To her mind, though, it was out of character. The cool Vincent, who was in control and who got things done, no matter which way, seemed hesitant. There was an old saying – he who hesitates is lost. It had to be making him crazy. Which made him more dangerous. Her mind switched from the doctor track to the victim. He was holding her by force. She was still a prisoner, his prisoner. She could not come and go as she pleased. She was limited. So she had to guard herself carefully. Being at the mercy of a man who had feelings for you that he didn't understand could be an extremely ugly situation, indeed. He might start to resent her. His frustration could get the better of him and he could get some pretty whacked ideas about how to handle them. She had to push him away. She couldn't let him get comfortable with the thought of having her around. She couldn't be too cooperative or too trusting. She couldn't lead him on in any way. So kissing him again was definitely out. She should never have done it before. Which now made pushing him away a big risk, she realized. Vincent had probably faced rejected multiple times in his life and always at critical junctures. It would lead to anti-social behaviors like he exhibited. If she rejected him, would her life become forfeit? If she gave a no-holds-barred I'm-not-interested attitude, what might that trigger in him? She was screwed. Blued and tattooed. She couldn't lead him on, and couldn't reject him. So that left one very uncomfortable alley. She had to figure out what she did actually feel for him, and walk that line. Vincent had handsome. Even his behavior had not detracted from the smoothness of voice, the Adonis-like qualities of his face, his pure animal magnetism. And the thought that he had feelings for her …well, the thrill she'd experienced before at that discovery was what had led her to her current dilemma. Suddenly she realized he was looking at her across the table. \"So you are full?\" he asked, puzzled. Callie jerked to realize she hadn't touched her second helping. Quickly she plied her fork into her food and shoveled it into her mouth. Great, now she'd really gotten his attention. He watched her eat – that drove her nuts as it was – with the kind of curiosity that unnerved her. But she got through it, because yes, she was still damn hungry. When she finished cleaning her second plate, she gulped another pint of orange juice and leaned back with a half-sigh of contentment. She closed her eyes, suddenly sleepy again. Then she felt Vincent's hand close on hers, which had been resting on the table. They weren't that far apart, as the table was small in the enclosed space. Startled, she pulled her hand back and her eyes opened. She pulled herself up straight, admonishing herself for doing exactly what she wasn't supposed to do. Vincent looked down at where her hand had been, and then at his empty one. His brow wrinkled, and she felt a stab of panic. So much for walking the line – her first time out on the rope and she'd already toppled, without knowing if there was a net below. Then he withdrew his hand and his expression was tight. \"We should be landing in about four hours,\" he said. \"When we do, we'll be boarding a boat and crossing the gulf.\" \"The gulf?\" she echoed, confused. \"What gulf?\" \"The Gulf of Thailand,\" he said, as if it were obvious, and he was not amused. \"It'll be an overnight ride. When we land in Bangkok it will be night for them.\" \"Then why did we eat breakfast?\" she muttered, having gone stupid in her uncertainty. \"Because, Callie,\" Vincent sighed, \"I was being considerate of you. You're still on continental North American time. Don't worry though, you'll adjust. And if you don't, well—\" He shrugged. \"Fine,\" she said, standing up, irritated at his sudden attitude. Nevermind she was the reason he had it. \"Where's the lavatory?\" she asked. Vincent eyed her suspiciously for a moment, which she didn't hold in any specific regard, as Vincent looked suspiciously at everything. Then, when he didn't say anything, she added, \"You have parachutes on this plane?\" \"Why?\" \"Figured I'd try to escape,\" she quipped, smirking down at him. \"Either that or just go to the bathroom. You decide.\" \"Lavatory is down that hall,\" Vincent said, pointing over his shoulder. Then, for good measure, he added, \"And parachutes are locked in a cabinet on that side.\" He pointed the other way. Callie nodded. \"Well, that settles it. Lavatory it is.\" And she went. 8888888888888888888888 (Vincent comes into the room, in a new suit, looking slightly miffed. He sees only Jackson and Rochester, munching the pizza and watching television .) Vincent: Where's the writer? Jackson: ( around the pizza ) Working. Vincent: About damn time. On what? Rochester: Well, sometimes she's working. And the rest of the time she's reading Red Eye fanfiction. Vincent: Excuse me? Jackson: ( smirks ) You heard him. Vincent: Why in the hell would she do that? Jackson: Don't know. Maybe she's going to give me my own fic after she's done with yours. Me: Don't start. Rochester: Did you finish? Me: Can't. I'm blocked. Vincent: Well that's what happens when you read Red Eye fanfiction. Me: Who told you that? ( Everyone eyeballs Jackson ) Jackson: It wasn't me! It was Ironhead over there. Rochester: That joke is getting old. You need to be smoked too? Jackson: ( ignoring Rochester ) And when are you going to give me my own fic? Me: You have over 500! All the good ideas are taken. And I'm not big on you and Lisa. Jackson: Well, she is hot. Me: Yes, she is. ( Everyone looks strangely at the writer ) Hey, I'm straight, not blind. Vincent: Wait a minute. You said you're blocked? Me: I'm on chapter seventeen. It's an incredibly hard chapter. The hardest I've ever written. Jackson, Vincent, Rochester: How hard is it? Me: Not funny. Vincent: Wait a minute…you're not putting me through some kind of existential hell, are you? Me: I'm not an existentialist. But yes to the hell part. Vincent: Wonderful. Me: All right, guys, I need inspiration. ( they all stare at her, dumb ) ( furious) I said I need inspiration! ( Everyone scatters ) Me: Go review. Give me some inspiration.[Chapter 13] Chapter Thirteen: Just A Ride (from the song by Jem – no, not Jem and the Holograms) On her beside table, the telephone rang. \"Dr. Martinez,\" she answered. \"Lupe?\" The voice was familiar, but terribly strained. She squinted, trying to recognize it. \"I hope you remember me, Ray Fanning, we had dinner earlier?\" She broke into a smile. \"Of course, Ray. Are you all right? You sound…stressed.\" He gave a bitter laugh. \"Look, I know we just met, and this is asking a lot, but is there any way you could come to your office? Some things have happened and you probably need to know about them. Plus…I just need a friendly face.\" She was already getting out of bed, pulling on her jeans. It was her day off, but she didn't care. \"I'm on my way,\" she said. When she got there, and Ray started recounting to her the events of the night, she was stunned. It was amazing how much could happen in a short period of time – all of this between when they'd finished their dinner and very early this morning? He looked awful. His hair was bent in twenty different directions, and he had a mildly slurred speech pattern that indicated he was coming off a high dose of medication. Dr. Gregg had yet to make an appearance, but they were using his office at the moment. \"So what are the authorities doing?\" she asked, using Laurie's personal coffee maker to brew up a pot of extra strong java. \"What they can,\" Ray said wearily. He was on the couch, hadn't moved from there since he'd plopped down after greeting her with a rather frantic hug. He was rubbing his forehead a lot, which she guessed was a nervous gesture. Also his lips. Both were mildly red from the abuse. \"Filed a missing persons report, are searching all the most likely places…although they don't really have a clue. They said that they're going to question Felix Reyes Torrena because they have reason to suspect his involvement, but they don't expect it to go anywhere. And I've been pretty much walled out of the whole thing – they won't let me do anything because I'm her brother. Which frustrates the hell out of me.\" \"So there isn't anything else?\" Lupe asked, pained. Ray rubbed his forehead again. At this rate, he was going to take the skin off. \"No,\" he said, with an uncharacteristic air of defeat. Lupe recognized this. Ray was still in shock. The murder of his father and the disappearance of his sister were overloading his ability to be rational. He was sliding into despair. She'd seen it before. She'd treated victims of violent crimes on various occasions, and not all of them had to have something directly happen to them in order to qualify for that title. Ray was in a very bad place. He needed help. \"All right,\" Lupe said, leaning back in her chair. She liked Ray, a lot. She was surprised at how much she had grown to like him in just one evening, and she was never one to turn her back on someone in need. She had to do something to help him. She reached over and pulled a blank notepad from the edge of Laurie's desk – he always kept one handy, it was the habit of most doctors. \"What are you doing?\" Ray asked, one eyebrow arching in puzzlement. \"We have to take stock of everything, Ray,\" she said. \"Right now, you're all on your emotional side. You have no reasonable one, and that's valid. You're allowed to not be reasonable at this time, considering all the things that have happened to you.\" Validation of the patient's emotions was always first on the list. \"So I'll be your reasonable side. We're going to work through this.\" Ray scowled. \"What the hell good will that do?\" he asked. \"Will that bring Callie back?\" \"And you sitting there, stewing in despair, that's going to be more effective?\" she asked gently. He considered this. It seemed to connect to something in his brain. \"Fair enough,\" he said. \"Ray, you have to accept at this moment, you are helpless,\" she said, keeping her tone smooth, professional. \"You have no leads, no trail. Your sister is more than likely still alive and she will be recovered, given time.\" \"You can't know that,\" Ray said, shaking his head. There was a dull glint in his eyes. \"Fine,\" Lupe said. \"You're right, I can't. So we have to face the possibility that she's gone, too. But we'll get to that later. Right now, you can't give up hope. So we have to work with what we have. All right?\" After a long moment's consideration, Ray gave a slight, if defeated, nod. So Lupe got to work. 8888888888888888888 She took a lot longer in the lavatory than he would have expected, but when it came to women, Vincent was only familiar with peripheral habits. Like going to the bathroom in pairs, and always spending too much money on shoes, those sorts of irrelevant things. When she came back, after what was probably close to a half hour, she looked a bit more put together. Her hair had been smoothed down with some water, her face had been washed, and he suspected she had asked Mariko for a toothbrush. Her clothes were still wrinkled from sleeping in them, but how badly could a pair of jeans and a T-shirt get damaged, anyway? Still, she had somehow smoothed out a few of the heavier lines, and when she took her seat across from him, she seemed to be more herself. Vincent had noticed at breakfast that she had been famished, but also heavily distracted. The need to think and the need to eat seemed to be running neck and neck with her. While he had no idea what was running through her head, he knew she wasn't happy with it from the continuous vertical lines between her eyebrows. When she sat down, her body language seemed tense. She was sitting with her shoulders forward, her fingers twined together and hands pressed between her knees. He knew she wanted to say something, but the words weren't coming together. Once again, this was one of the things about women he could do without. This incessant need to talk about things, rehash them over and over. Then again, she confused him like no other human being on earth. She had kissed him before, even advanced the passion of the kiss, and then had shoved back, like she'd forgotten herself. He knew that physically, she wanted him, but that her mind resisted. Women were so conflicted; he couldn't imagine continuously having to deal with a split between his head and his heart. Still, he couldn't help himself, which bugged him even more. Trying to take her hand before had been a bad idea. The sting of the rejection was something he pushed aside. He was used to ignoring his pain. As difficult as that was becoming lately, he was determined to keep at it. Finally, she cleared her throat. \"Vincent,\" she said. The sound of her name on his lips was odd. Usually it was a plea, or an expression of fear, or anger. But this was simple, and he liked it. \"I, uh…I wanted to tell you. I know that you've gone through a lot of trouble for me. And while I'm not completely sure why, you seem to want to protect me, and for that, I'm grateful. If I wasn't here with you, I'd probably already be like…my dad.\" She strained against the shudder in her voice. She couldn't break, yet. \"So I want you to know, I'm thankful.\" \"You are.\" He didn't really buy it – or maybe he didn't want to buy it. She seemed sincere, but also placating. \"Why am I hearing a 'but' coming?\" She shook her head. \"No, it's not like that. I just…this is all extremely hard for me and I know I'm acting crazy, but you should just know that that isn't going to change. Right now I'm being rational, but that's how grief is. Grief makes you do things you wouldn't normally do. So…\" she trailed off, and he could tell that this was the hard part, the part she'd been really unsure about. \"I just wanted to make it clear that…that I'm not… comfortable with…I just, uh…\" She looked away. He felt a smile tugging at his lips. It was almost fun, watching her squirm. Whatever she thought was so important, he couldn't imagine. But he didn't have the heart to tell her she was wasting her time. Instead, he just sat back and accepted the free entertainment. \"Okay,\" she said, getting a hold of herself. \"I wanted to ask you. I don't think I'm being unreasonable about this. I just don't want you to…I'm worried about being taken advantage of.\" Now he frowned. He saw the \"oh shit\" flicker in her eyes. \"I mean, before, when we…kissed. I know I kissed you back, and that was wrong. I know it's a lot to ask, but could we…could we please keep the physical stuff out of this? I mean, unless you expect me to…to, uh…in return for…\" She was flicking her hand, a nervous gesture. Finally, he'd had enough. \"You're worried that in return for my saving your life, I'll expect sexual favors,\" he said plainly. She flushed to the roots of her pretty auburn hair. \"Yeah.\" His face split into a wide, toothy smile, showing all his canines, and he laughed. \"Look, I'm sorry!\" she said, her voice a bit louder, to be heard over him. \"I know that you're not that…you're not that kind of guy—\" \"Oh, that's big of you,\" he said, still smiling. \"I just wanted to get it out in the open,\" she said, spreading her hands wide, palms down. Her voice was taking an edge to it, now. \"I just want you to know that I'd appreciate a little…a little distance.\" \"Distance,\" he echoed, the smile mellowing. \"Yes,\" she said, looking fearful and hopeful. \"Do you…do you understand what I'm trying to say?\" \"You're saying, thank you for helping me, just please don't touch me,\" he translated plainly. She nodded, her eyes hesitant. \"Fine,\" he said, pulling out the half-finished newspaper. \"You sure?\" she said, even as his attention clearly diverted from her. \"I mean…I don't want to offend you.\" \"You haven't,\" he said, raising his eyes to meet hers, dead on. \"Okay, then,\" she said, leaning back in the chair. Slowly, so slowly, she looked like she was beginning to relax. He looked back at his newspaper, and after a few minutes, he heard her give a low, relieved sigh. 88888888888888888888 Callie had never been out of the country once in her life. She wasn't sure what she expected when they landed in Bangkok. She had heard the old song from the 80's by the Pep Boys – at least, she thought it was the Pep Boys – about how dangerous it was, etc. But if Vincent lived here, or close to here, then it must have had something that afforded protection. The airport wasn't that much smaller than LAX, but much less hectic. They exited the plane outdoors, and Callie was immediately struck by the humidity in the air. The stars, though--they were so bright, so brilliant. Being raised in L.A., she was used to the green sheen of the night sky, sometimes mixed with orange, and few stars. Here, it was like a black velvet blanket littered with diamonds. Vincent, very carefully, took her by her upper arm and guided her. He seemed to have taken her words to heart. It had not been easy to say those things to him – the risk of humiliation had been alarmingly high, but still, it needed to be done. Worse, the risk of angering him had not appealed, but he'd taken it well. Too well, in her opinion, but she wasn't going to spend all her time second guessing everything. Vincent had proven relatively trustworthy so far, so she had to roll with it. That was what he'd tell her, anyway. There was a car waiting for them, a simple, nondiscriminatory black car with diplomatic plates. Vincent seemed to give a little groan when he saw it, but they climbed in back anyway. Outside, the windows were heavily shaded, but she could see from the inside perfectly well. She couldn't stop staring out the windows, the front, the back, hers, the driver's side, Vincent's side, every way she could turn. It was exotic and strangely familiar. A tourist attraction, but like none she'd ever seen before. The city sparkled with its own unique charm, and she felt the inexplicable desire to have the driver stop somewhere, let her get out, and explore. She had to remind herself, severely, that she was not on vacation. Denial was a step of the grieving process, she counseled herself. Nothing to be alarmed about, but nothing to run with, either. They turned away from the lights of the city and passed through more obscure roads that were lined with almost jungle-like foliage. She swore she saw a few wild animals in the headlights of the car. Up ahead, she realized they were approaching a dock – she could tell by the tall sticks that stuck up into the night, the mainsails of various boats. The body of water behind them shone as black as the night sky. The driver spoke. It was in a language she didn't understand. Callie's eyes went to Vincent, awaiting his reaction. He replied, briefly, in the same language. The car made a right turn onto another road. She sighed, muffling it, keeping it soft in the back of her throat, pressing her head against her hand. She wanted to ask and didn't dare. Vincent had told her before that they were going to be getting on a boat. He'd said they'd be on it for a while, traveling to…where again? She didn't have time to fret over whether she should ask – the car pulled up to a particular dock and stopped. Vincent got out of the car and started to walk up the plank to a large boat that looked more like a yacht, or at least as close to a yacht as she'd ever seen. Callie hesitated for a moment, and then followed. The driver was moving toward the trunk, where Vincent had put his bag. She had no bag – she was here, in another country half-way across the world, with only the clothes on her back. Callie looked at the boat. She hesitated, not sure what she should do, but looking back, into the wildness behind her, she knew she didn't want to stay. So with a deep breath, she walked up the plank and onto the boat. Just as she reached the top, she heard Vincent make a noise that was clearly surprise, but not alarm. Vincent was talking to a man that he seemed familiar with. They were smiling, shaking hands, talking softly. The man, upon inspection, seemed nice enough, although she was hardly in a position to judge such things. He was a bit taller than Vincent, not much, with shaggy brown hair and large blue-green eyes that smiled easily. He seemed young, at least younger than Vincent, and had an innocent air about him that was throwing her off. She frowned a bit as she approached, and the man's eyes drifted to her, his eyebrow lifting. It gave him a rather dashing appearance. \"I see you brought your friend,\" the man said, and she was surprised to hear a British accent, although it was hardly the proper kind that one heard in movies. \"This is Peter,\" Vincent said softly, hardly looking at her as he gave the introduction. \"The jet and the boat are both his.\" Peter gave her a rather cocky grin, as if he was showing off and he knew it. \"Welcome aboard the Jade Arrow, Miss,\" he said. He extended his hand, which she shook. He had rather soft hands, she noted, softer than the average man. Then, Peter turned back to Vincent. \"I brought someone who very much wanted to see you,\" he said, his voice taking on a mild strain that signaled to her something major was about to happen. Vincent's eyes guarded but not dark. \"Who?\" \"Hello, Vincent,\" came a voice from the seating area behind them, and a woman appeared, her skin and hair dark like the natives, her eyes like almonds and her figure as lithe and slim as they came. She wore a black dress that was simple, but accentuated everything about her that was seductive and slinky. Her small breasts were pert and settled nicely in the strapless top, and one slit in the skirt revealed almost her entire thigh, right to her buttocks. Her hair was styled perfectly, jet black and straight against her jaw. She smiled at Vincent. Then her eyes drifted to Callie. Having undergone unprepared travel and not having bathed, Callie felt about as presentable as a wad of used Kleenex. She almost blushed, but bit it back, especially when she saw Vincent smile, slowly, wolfishly. \"Cathy,\" he said, setting down his bag and walking over to her. He took her hand, and kissed it. His eyes locked onto hers and saw nothing else. \"Whatever are you doing here?\" \"Peter was visiting a friend of mine,\" Cathy purred, her voice heavily accented, but her words easy to understand. \"You know how Peter gets when he drinks. He saw me and told me he was coming here to get you. I invited myself along.\" She pouted, just fetchingly enough to soften the hardest man. \"I hope I have not intruded?\" \"Absolutely not,\" Callie heard a voice say, and then realized it was her own, so hard and cold she didn't recognize it. Her eyes flashed to Vincent, who darted her a quick, appraising glance, and then proceeded to completely ignore her again, going back to Cathy. \"Wonderful,\" Cathy said, giving her a charming smile. \"Vincent, would you like to see your room?\" \"Love to,\" Vincent said, his voice that low, soft purr Callie knew she'd heard a dozen times before. To hear it directed at another woman shot a flame of jealousy through her that scared her with its intensity. Turning herself in nearly military fashion, she looked up at her host, who had the courtesy to look bashful. \"Perhaps I may also be shown to a room…Peter?\" Peter took her arm like a gentleman, and led her away, and Callie made herself not look at Vincent and Cathy again. 8888888888888888888 Vincent: ( outraged ) You're still reading that Red Eye fanfiction? Me: ( sheepish ) Yes. Blame Angrw and NicolinaN. It's their fault. Jackson: ( sing song ) Sure it is. Vincent: You shut up! You've caused enough trouble! Why are you even still here? Jackson: Hey, don't bitch at me because you can't control your Writer. And I'm here because I'm going to show up again. ( to the writer ) Right? Me: ( even more sheepish ) Yeah. Vincent: Where is Rochester? Maybe I can get him to blast you with one of this wrist thingies. Me: He's off doing Tropic Thunder. Although he's still got work to do as well. You know, truth be told, nobody knows it, but I've already written and posted a Lisa/Jackson fic. Vincent and Jackson: You have? Me: Yep. You know all that Dukes of Hazzard stuff I've been writing? Vincent: ( annoyed ) Yes. Me: Well, Lisa and Jackson are in it. Jackson: We are? Where? Me: Right in the first one. You're reoccurring characters. Lisa plays Shelly, Henri-Mae's best friend. And you play her husband Lloyd. You two run the boarding house in Hazzard. Yeah, I based those two characters on you. Kinda sick, huh? Jackson: ( under his breath, aroused ) Sick hot, yeah. Vincent: Great, so now everybody is going to go running to that fic and… Me: No, don't worry. My Dukes fiction was of more interest to me than anyone. I have an entire story from the Bad Reputation series that I haven't posted, and I've been working on a sixth one that's had more stops and starts than this one. So don't feel too bad, Vincent. You're not the only one on whose shit list I reside. Vincent: I never said you were on my shit list… Jackson: So let me get this straight. In your Dukes of Hazzard fanfic, the Bad Reputation series, you have Lisa playing Shelly, Henri-Mae's best friend. Me: Yes, that's what I said. What, you can't re-read? Jackson: And I'm her husband Lloyd? Where the hell did you get the name Lloyd? Do I look like a Lloyd? Me: No, but it just sort of…stuck. I think I was using her more than you at first. I even named Henri-Mae after Lisa, did you know that? Jackson: Uh— Me: The main character is Henrietta Mae Locke. Henrietta, after Lisa's middle name. So really, deep down, I'm a closet Red Eye junkie. Vincent: Um, hello! You were writing chapter 18, remember? You got through the big emotional climax and now you're working through the action climax? Want to get back to work? Jackson: Why Henrietta? Me: I thought it was a cool name. Henry for short, but that was too masculine, so I added the Mae. Henri-Mae. Yep, after Lisa. Vincent: Hey! Come on, remember me? You wrote this fic about me, remember? Jackson: He's so needy. Am I that needy? Me: After reading NicolinaN's recent Red Eye fic, yes. You are. Very much so. Jackson: ( grumbles ) Vincent: ( whines ) Me: Okay guys, go review! I'm sure I'll get some interesting responses this week! (wink)[Chapter 14] Chapter Fourteen: Indifference (from the song by Pearl Jam) \"I can't help but notice that you don't have any luggage with you,\" Peter said as he unlocked the door to her suite. Callie just shook her head, distracted. \"Well, being a bit of a ladies man myself, I do prepare for such occasions. You'll find some clothes in the closet and fresh personal items in the drawers. Feel free to make use of whatever you like. Everything is new – never been used, so you don't have to…worry.\" She arched an eyebrow at him, but nodded her thanks. When she entered the suite, the first thing she did was look in the closet, wondering if there was something suitable for her to change into. She wanted to burn the clothes she wore. The best thing she did find that was closest to her size was a comfortable lounging suit made of thin cashmere. It was very expensive and felt absolutely wonderful. She went into her personal bathroom to change, and found everything she could ever need – hairbrush, cleansers, deodorant, toothbrush and paste, and even a small box containing various hair accessories. When she came out, she was surprised to find that Peter was still there. He had been on the telephone, apparently, and was close to the window that overlooked the ocean, so she couldn't overhear his conversation. He said goodbye to whoever he was talking to and turned back to her graciously. \"You have to be starving,\" Peter said to her as he observed her sit down on the bed. \"I didn't exactly have the menu on the jet at its top notch.\" \"The jet is yours?\" Callie asked, rubbing her hand across her eyes. Why was she so tired all of a sudden? She had slept way to long to be this tired. But then again, sleeping too much had the same affects as not enough sleep. Peter just gave her a modest smile. \"Please, come. I'm unable to have anything but the best around me wherever I go, and I'm also an incurable showoff.\" He motioned out the door, and not knowing what else to do, Callie followed. The galley was like the most expensive kitchen she had ever seen. There was a chef there, preparing coffee and sandwiches, but such sandwiches as even her father couldn't rival. The breads varied, all different types and shapes, perfectly cut pieces of lettuce and onion and tomato, Dijon mustard and meat of such quality that it practically melted on her tongue. Considering she'd eaten breakfast about five hours ago, she didn't think she'd be so hungry, until she sat down at the small table with Peter and was presented a plate by the single server, a man with a boyish face who didn't meet their eyes. Once she started eating, she didn't stop until she realized she was going to explode. Peter munched across from her, talking idly about things she had no idea. Talking about the chef and where he'd come from, talking about the boat, talking about his things. It was pleasant enough of a distraction from the continuous nagging voice in the back of her head, reminding her that Vincent had disappeared with that woman and hadn't re-emerged. As if on cue, Cathy appeared in the doorway. She was dressed in a black silk robe that hung open and exposed the swell of one breast, an alluring look. She smiled at Peter, hardly acknowledged Callie's existence, and went right for a plate. \"You don't mind, dear, if I take some back to our suite, do you?\" she asked Peter as she piled the sandwiches on. \"There's chilled champagne, too, if you wish,\" Peter said, seemingly oblivious to Callie's sudden discomfort. An olive was half-way to her mouth, forgotten, as she stared at the two of them, brooding. Again, on cue, the server appeared, holding a silver bucket with the chilled champagne inside. \"Shall I bring it to your room, ma'am?\" \"No thanks, I shall do it.\" Cathy took the bucket in one arm and the plate in the other, and with a devious wink, she slinked back down the hall. Callie watched her go. It was only when Peter cleared his throat that she drew her eyes back to him. She was amazed to see the man playing the innocent, looking at her with a gentile expression, as if the previous five minutes hadn't occurred. \"I'm sure as you know, Vincent isn't much of a conversationalist,\" he said. \"At least, not when it comes to explaining what the hell is going on.\" Callie arched an eyebrow. \"How do you know him?\" \"Oh, Vincent?\" Peter looked mildly abashed. \"Well, I'm not the proudest of my past, or his, but we were in foster care together.\" This time Callie frowned. \"Foster care?\" \"In the same home, for a bit. It was a big place, neither one of us was much interested in the reigning social class, and we found that being together kept us safer than being alone.\" There was a grim look that flashed across his innocent features. \"It was a very long time ago, I was fifteen, Vincent was seventeen.\" Her frowned deepened. \"You seem much younger than that.\" His smile was a thousand watts. \"My thanks, love. I do try to stay in good shape—\" \"Don't let him pull that wool over your eyes,\" came Vincent's voice from the hallway as he entered the galley. Callie noted that he'd showered, and was now wearing only a pair of pajama bottoms, long silk things that did little to conceal his muscles underneath. A white towel hung around his neck and his chest was bare, and his hair had turned a few shades darker when it was wet. Callie couldn't help but note the amount of scars he had on his torso…\"He's younger than me by a few years,\" Vincent went on, going to the fridge and pulling out two large bottles of water. \"But he's a true believer in plastic surgery.\" Vincent shot the other man a look over his shoulder. \"One of these days your skin is going to crack like old cement.\" \"If money can't buy happiness,\" Peter said, tossing back his head, \"at least you can be unhappy in nicer surroundings. And look better in the process. Plastic surgery is making leaps and bounds in medical science. The skin hardly shines anymore.\" He touched the side of his face as if to demonstrate. Callie frowned. \"You'd never know it to look at you.\" Peter shot Vincent a triumphant smile. Vincent came to the table, popped open a bottle of water, and just shook his head. \"I thought you and Cathy were eating in your room,\" Callie murmured. \"We are,\" Vincent said smoothly. \"But she didn't have a third arm to carry the water. Got to keep hydrated.\" He winked at her, and she blushed and looked away, her food now forgotten, her stomach becoming an angry knot. \"Your friend was just asking me about our past, Vincent,\" Peter said. \"Our past?\" Vincent replied with a cocked eyebrow. \"Oh, you mean me keeping you from getting killed every night until your sixteenth birthday.\" Vincent turned to Callie, oblivious to her anger. \"Peter is a true child prodigy, you know.\" \"Really?\" In spite of herself, she was interested. \"Really. And completely without shame. Mastered the legal system and emancipated himself from the state when he was sixteen, same time as I got out. We went our separate ways for a while, but…business has a way of bringing old friends back together.\" Callie swung shocked eyes to Peter. \"So…does Vincent…work for you?\" she asked tentatively. Peter's eyes became guarded for a moment, but then the man gave a shrug. \"I never dirty my hands with the details,\" he said dismissively. \"I'm in business with so many people, sometimes I can't keep track.\" Repulsed, Callie curled back into her chair, crossing her arms over abdomen. \"Yeah, like of how many times I've saved your life,\" Vincent muttered. \"About a half-dozen times, I think is the current count.\" \"And thus, your free use of my various resources,\" Peter said. \"I really didn't expect to see you down here,\" Vincent said, stretching his back. Callie looked away before she could notice the ripple in his muscles. \"Well, you know how little I'm able to resist the charms of Bangkok,\" Peter returned with a smirk. Vincent chuckled dryly. Turning to Callie, he said, \"Peter is hopelessly attracted to any woman of Asian descent. And he's not particular, either. Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean—\" \"Although Thailand has the most beautiful variety, and the easiest systems of getting them,\" Peter jumped in. \"See what I mean?\" Vincent said, picking up the other bottle of water and turning back to the hallway. \"No shame.\" \"You going to sleep?\" Peter asked. Vincent shot him another wolfish grin, which Callie couldn't help but think was for her benefit. \"Depends. At any rate, knock on my door when we reach Songkhla, okay?\" Peter nodded, touching two fingers to his forehead. Then he turned back to Callie. \"And what of you? You know Vincent from—\" Callie just stared at him. \"He works for you, and you don't know?\" Peter gave a little shrug, a bit more expressive than Vincent's little twitches. \"Vincent doesn't like to tell me anything. I'd like to think he's protective of me, but I know better.\" \"So what do you do, Peter,\" Callie said after a pause, wanting to put some kind of conversation in the silence of the kitchen, \"that you can afford your own jet, a yacht in the middle of the Gulf of Thailand, and your own personal hit man?\" \"Stocks,\" Peter replied smartly. \"I thought you were in the legal field.\" \"No, no, that was simply a means to an end. I'm a bit of a wiz on the Stock Market. Speaking of which, I do have to make a few phone calls. Do you know your way back to your room?\" The thought of spending her time with Peter didn't exactly appeal to her, knowing what she knew now, but the thought of being alone was even less appealing. She bit her tongue, though, before she could say anything aloud. Damn her if she was going to show these people any throat. \"Yes,\" she said miserably. \"Good. We'll be going for possibly another eight hours or so, it's at least five hundred miles across the gulf, it not a bit more. You might want to get some rest, take a shower, even wander around the deck. Make yourself at home.\" With a flash of white teeth, he was gone. Callie sighed. She felt like a prisoner. Which was the strangest thing, because she was being treated with the kind of indifference that no captor would dare. Not that there was any way for her to get off this boat, and even if there was, where the hell was she going to go? She got up, nodded her thanks to the server who took her plate away, and went to the fridge. There was another bottle of champagne there…upon closer inspection, she discovered that it was quite expensive. She pulled it out and got a glass from the rack overhead, then headed to the deck. It was a beautiful night. She'd never seen so many stars. She made herself comfortable in a lounge chair, and popped open the champagne. The cork sailed over the edge and disappeared into the black sea below. Foam spilled over her hand and dribbled down to the floor, a silver snake of suds. She shook it off and poured herself a glass. It was delicious. She sat there, staring up at the stars, for a good while. She could see the arm of the Milky Way, stretching out over the heavens, a thick streak of cosmic dust and nebulae… That's us…lost in space . Vincent's words. It felt so long since that night, she hadn't realized how long until now. How could three weeks suddenly feel so long? Because their relationship had been altered, her doctor's mind told her. Change can create a feeling of distance from the past. But what relationship? She frowned at the voice of reason, but then embraced it, letting the cold light of order fill her mind. It cooled the heat of her passions and let herself think more clearly. She was tired of rehashing things. She was tired of pondering the mystery that was Vincent. She missed her father. She would have given anything to be with him at this moment. Her throat closed and another wave of grief washed over her. She drank more champagne. She thought about Laurie, and his rough voice and his even rougher chin, his grizzled hair, his sense of humor. She ached to hear him right now, longed for some of his wisdom, his ability to throw cold water on any intense situation. She thought about her brother, and even through the haze of memories from her last visit with Mr. Bourbon she could remember his smile at Lupe, her doctor. There had been a spark there, and it made her happy. But all of that was being threatened by her situation. She hoped that Ray reached out to Lupe. He needed someone so badly, and she wasn't there. That's not your fault , her conscience told her. And then, carefully, as if handling a porcupine, she thought about her father. She thought about how, no matter what pain or agony he had suffered, he was with her mother now. He had been so devastated when she died – yet it had not driven him from his children, but instead made him hold them closer and more tenderly. And her father had always been a good Catholic. Good Catholics thrived on suffering, at least the ones playing for real. For as long as she could remember, whenever something had gone wrong, or pained her, no matter how big or small, he had encouraged her to \"offer it up.\" He would have offered it up. He would have suffered proudly. He would have gritted his teeth and taken it. Her father was one of the toughest son-of-a-bitches she knew. That made her smile. Her first real smile since she could remember. It made her cheeks ache with the unfamiliarity of it. Soon the bottle was gone and she felt warm and fuzzy. She found herself remembering how her face had hurt when Vincent struck her so he could kill Annie. But he hadn't killed Annie. Why hadn't he? He'd gone through the motions, surely there was no way Annie could have lived if he hadn't wanted her to. Or maybe she was giving Vincent too much credit. Everyone made mistakes. He'd made a major mistake by not killing her. He even admitted the mistake he made by ever getting into her cab to being with. She shook her head, realizing that the wind was picking up and she was cold, her fingers were freezing and her toes were numb. She left the empty bottle and used glass behind, got up and pulled herself down to her room, where she stumbled in the dark because she couldn't remember where the light switch was. She bumped into the bed and plopped down. Her face pressed against the satin of the comforter on the bed, and she remembered something else. She remembered the kiss. She turned her head to the side, then slowly pulled herself up on her arms and rested on her elbow. Vincent's face as he looked down into hers, the sound of his growl as he responded to her touch. Why was she tormenting herself like this? It was impossible…it would never, ever work. She could never get over what he was, and he certainly didn't seem capable of providing her with anything that she would need from him. Like stability, support...sanity. Her mind drifted to Laurie. He could give her all those things. A thumping broke into her thoughts. Startled, Callie became stone sober for a moment, but soon the haze slipped back over her. This was a boat, surely there were all kinds of noises— Voices. A female voice, giggling. A man's voice, gruff…Vincent's voice. Bloody hell, they were in the room next to her. The thumping came again. Something was going on right against the wall between their rooms, and like a slow-motion eight-car pile-up, she couldn't look away from it. There wasn't anything to see, but her imagination was more than willing to fill in the pieces. More strange noises, they were right against that wall, and pressure was being applied, she could hear the creaking. Then she heard Cathy's voice, and it wasn't giggling now, it was moaning, loud and long and hard. In a rhythmic pattern, following other physical noises that were muffled, wet thuds against that stupid thin wall. Sobriety kicked in, her buzz now completely gone. They were fucking right against the wall of her cabin. Callie stood up, pulling the blanket with her. She made it up to the deck before she threw up all of the champagne over the side of the ship. She was crying when she was done, and barely managed to wrap herself up in the bulky comforter before she collapsed back into her lounge chair. What the hell was wrong with her? It wasn't like she was jealous , was she? But the thought of Vincent sleeping with that whore was just nauseating. And infuriating. Rationality tried to tell her she was repulsed at the fact that Vincent had probably been fucking this woman for a long time, and about whatever nasty, exotic diseases he could have picked up… Forcing herself to calm down, Callie sat back in the chair and looked up at the stars. She breathed in the cold sea air, and wished she could wrap herself up in that comforter like a cocoon and never come out. Or at least, when she did, she'd be changed. Different. Someone other than who she was. Someone was shaking her. In a blink, the sky had changed from black to a pale gray-pink. She pushed the comforter out of her face; it had slipped over it in the middle of the night. She must have fallen asleep and not known it. It couldn't have been a deep sleep; she didn't feel rested at all. In fact, she felt more tired than ever. She blinked in the light and tried to focus on the person who had woken her. When her vision cleared and she saw Vincent standing over her, she scowled and pulled the blanket back. He was the last person she wanted to see. \"We're going to be arriving in about an hour,\" he said, his voice that same low monotone. She did not answer. If he was out here, then they weren't fucking in the room next to her anymore. How long had she been asleep? When had she fallen asleep? She didn't remember… \"You might want to freshen up,\" Vincent went on, his tone just a bit more cajoling. She scowled into the blanket. She wanted to start swearing at him but didn't dare risk him thinking she was jealous. \"What are you doing out here, anyway?\" he asked. She stood up, pulling the blanket around her. Giving him her best stone-face, she turned and went down the stairs, back to her cabin. There just wasn't anything she could have said at that moment that wouldn't have completely given her away, anyway. She missed Vincent's expression as she went. Perhaps if she'd seen it, she would have been slightly mollified. 8888888888 Vincent watched her go. He didn't like it when she wouldn't talk to him. He didn't like it when anybody wouldn't talk to him, but especially her. When a person stopped talking, that was when a person became dangerous. He turned and looked out over the sea. It was always cooler, out here on the water. He was wearing a high-necked black sweater which he didn't really like, but knew he would need so he packed it anyway. He sipped his coffee and felt himself start to warm up. Of course, he'd had every single intention of pissing Callie off. It should have gratified him to see her like this, as it had been what he was aiming for. Sure, she pretended that she wanted nothing to do with him, but he remembered how she'd kissed him. She had kissed him . No one could fake passion like that. Still…the look on her face as she stood up. She was a mess, her hair needed washing, and her face was red. She had been crying? He wasn't quite sure. The coldness in her eyes, though. That bothered him. Before her irritation had been amusing, encouraging. Now it was murderous. That was simply the only word for it. 888888888888888888 Breakfast was eggs, potatoes and French toast. The table was spread with fine silverware, and Peter was already at the head, pouring himself some coffee. Cathy was the first to join him, dressed but still looking mildly disheveled, followed by Vincent, who seemed preoccupied, although Peter paid it no mind because in his experience Vincent's natural state was preoccupation. Callie came in last, dressed in the most comfortable clothes she could find, a pair of designer sweats and a hoodie. Her hair was neatly pulled back into a pony-tail, having been freshly dried from a shower. She did not make eye contact with anyone except Peter, who wished her a good morning, to which her only reply was a tight smile and a nod. She sat down across from Vincent, but did not look at him once. She began to pull food onto her plate, mostly French toast, along with some of the fruit from the various bowls that garnished the setting. She ate in silence, seemingly oblivious to the sudden tension in the room. Peter was, by nature, a host. Being a man of money and importance had also determined that he be one who possessed social graces, as Callie had already seen from the previous night, as he had chatted aimlessly while she ate. He commented about the weather, about how they were sure to dock within the hour, about what was going on in Songkhla that day, what he had seen on the news, international affairs and whatnot. Cathy listened politely, but seemed determined not to catch Vincent's eye. Vincent, on the other hand, stared at Callie and would not look away until she looked back. She didn't. One she dropped her fork onto her empty plate, she stood up, taking her cup of coffee with her. She mouthed a \"thank-you\" to Peter and promptly left the room. Vincent watched her go, and for the first time Peter seemed to notice his perturbed expression. \"Well,\" he said, keeping his voice low, conversational, \"I'd say the two of you have had quite an evening.\" Cathy's hand automatically went to her neck, which Vincent noticed out of the corner of his eye that she was touching marks he'd left there. Upon second thought, he wondered if leaving them there had been a good idea. \"I can't thank you enough, Peter,\" Cathy beamed. She slid her hand to Vincent, who let her take his without comment. \"I have to admit that last night was certainly…something.\" Vincent gave her a flickering smile, but his eyes kept going to where Callie disappeared. Peter sighed deeply and leaned back in his seat. He seemed to instantly forget that Cathy was in the room. \"You really aren't that thick, are you, old friend?\" Vincent's ears pricked at the use of the words \"old friend,\" something Peter only said whenever he really wanted Vincent's undivided attention. \"What do you mean?\" Peter snorted. \"Your rooms were right beside each other. You knew that perfectly well. What were you thinking?\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" The finality with which he said it, and not at all with the sort of innocent evasiveness that might have come from a more average person, should have been a clear enough sign for Peter to shut his mouth. But Peter did not shut his mouth lightly, and so continued. \"I have to admit, she's not what I expected. Sure, she's reasonably attractive, but for all the fuss I would have expected a supermodel as opposed to a fresh faced young girl. Then again, beauty is only skin deep. And the amount of trouble you've gone through, not to mention that I've gone through, has been considerable. You're doing a very piss-poor job of convincing me that it's been worth it. If she's important, Vincent, I'd say you've sufficiently fucked it up.\" With that, Vincent stood up, threw down his napkin, and left the room. Cathy just stared at him from across the table, her cheeks a mild shade of pink. \"What were you two talking about?\" she asked. Peter finished his coffee and stood. \"I'll be with the captain. I suggest you take your leisure where you may, Cathy. I don't think you'll be seeing much of Vincent after we dock.\" 8888888888 \"What are you doing?\" Callie had filled the sink with suds and water. She was dipping her jeans and T-shirt into it, and wringing them out, an old-fashioned way of doing laundry. She did not speak nor look at him. \"So now you're not talking to me,\" Vincent said. \"Can I ask why? I did what you wanted, I left you alone, gave you space. I've given you more than space.\" She acted as if he wasn't there. \"Callie, I'm talking to you.\" He stepped closer to her, and caught her wrist in his hand. She stopped, took a breath, and then turned her eyes on him. He wished she hadn't. The complete indifference, the passivity, felt like she was looking right through him. Vincent knew perfectly well why she was angry, and knew she possibly had every right to be, but at the same time, she had made it perfectly clear that… The words were coming out of his mouth before he could stop them. \"You didn't want me,\" he said. \"So why are you angry at me for finding someone who does?\" Coolly, she arched an eyebrow, as if to silently say, \"Your point?\" After a few moments of this, he let go. \"Fine,\" he muttered. \"Fine.\" And he turned and left. 888888888888888888888 Vincent: You cheated! Me: In what way did I cheat? Vincent: All of this chapter was just the stuff you kept from the last version of this story! The To Live Or To Die one! It's just cut and pasted! Me: And carefully edited, in my defense! I didn't cheat, this came from my favorite stuff from the last story. I adored the whole boat scene and wanted to make sure it stayed in. My favorite part was Callie wallowing in self-pity on the deck. And getting drunk on Don Perginon. Jackson: You can't spell. I know that's not how that champagne is spelled. Me: Oh stuff it. Anyway, I also love that it's Vincent that finds her on the deck. That was just pure…oh, well, I don't want to toot my own horn too much. I just wanted to make sure to reuse this stuff. And I did carefully edit it, and made sure it make sense. Not the easiest thing to do but much easier than writing it all from scratch. Vincent: ( grumbles ) Jackson: ( whines ) Me: What are you whining about?? Jackson: I wasn't in this chapter. Am I going to be in another chapter soon? ( pouts ) Me: Oh great. Now I have to hear it from you. Hey, everybody, go review so I can post another chapter and maybe put Jackson it in! Jackson: ( claps hands ) Yay![Chapter 15] Chapter Fifteen: Stockholm Syndrome (from the song by Muse) When Callie exited the yacht, the only thing she had in hand was a plastic bag containing the wet jeans and T-shirt she had attempted to wash earlier. It had been foolish, what she tried to do, but she had desperately needed some kind of distraction, and it had been the only thing that occurred to her. She figured that, wherever they were going, there would be a bathroom, and she'd just hang them up when they reached it. Peter told her to keep the clothes she wore and not worry about it. He even encouraged her to take anything else she wanted, but she didn't. She especially didn't want that cashmere lounging outfit – she'd never be able to wear cashmere again without thinking of… Dammit , she thought. Vincent was pissed at her. He didn't scowl at her or treat her rudely, but it was apparent that he had shut her out. Only as they got off the yacht and into the waiting car did she realize that this had also been unwise. She needed Vincent. As much as she didn't want to admit it, he was the only familiar thing in this crazy world, at the moment. She considered, briefly, asking Peter to help her. But she doubted that he would. She had never imagined Vincent having friends of any kind, but it seemed that if he had ever had a single friend in the world, it was Peter. There was a brotherly way between them, twisted but noticeable, and she didn't think she had a chance of cracking it. Vincent shook Peter's hand, his only farewell, before heading for the second of two black, unmarked vehicles. Callie followed, not having been directed to do so but also not having anything else to do. Vincent tossed his bag into the back seat, but didn't get in – instead, he turned around and headed back toward Cathy, who had emerged, looking mildly confused, from the boarding ramp. Callie, who had gotten into the back and stayed silent, watched through hooded eyes. It seemed that Vincent was taking his farewell. It was rather obvious, from the remarks made by both him and Peter the night before, that Cathy was paid entertainment, but she didn't want to assume. Still, it was satisfying to see the disappointment on the woman's face when Vincent turned away from her and headed back to the car, alone. Callie contemplated this turn of events. She had managed to irk Vincent, but how justified was she? Her rational doctor's mind attempted to analyze the events – she had frustrated him, sexually. Kissing him like that on the plane and then telling him not to touch her anymore? He'd taken it too well, and why not? Vincent had no ability to communicate his frustrations in any other way. As violence was how he handled stress, sex was the obvious release for thwarted emotions. Of course he was going to sleep with Cathy. Cathy demanded nothing from him emotionally. She was safe. She tried not to stare at Vincent as they drove away from the landing dock. She had been drunk the night before, and illogical. Now, she was feeling rather forgiving, which felt equally ridiculous. But there was no alcohol to blame this time. Still, her natural instincts told her she had made the right call. Being close to Vincent blocked her ability to think straight. At least, in a romantic way. Oh hell, in all ways , it was the truth, and if she was going to survive this, she had to deal with the truth. Vincent had to keep his hands to himself. Otherwise, something bad was going to happen. Very bad. She wasn't as mesmerized by the drive this time, but still, it was quite scenic and interesting. It provided her eyes with some distraction, even if the wheels in her head refused to stop turning. When they finally reached their destination, she was a bit relieved to see that the hotel, exceedingly luxurious and clearly designed for American tourists, was a touch of home. Inside, it felt like she was back in familiar territory. Although much, much more posh than she would ever had been able to indulge in, it was at least recognizable in this unfamiliar setting. There was a beautiful bar set in the middle, with plenty of plush chairs around and heavy wooden tables. The bar itself was sunk a bit into the floor, a few steps down, so that it was sectioned off without anything as cumbersome as walls to divide it. Around them were various hotel shops, many of them for clothing, clearly designer and extremely expensive. \"All our shops,\" said the woman at the desk, in perfect English, to Vincent as he checked them in, \"are attached to the hotel, so any purchases you wish to make can be charged to the room.\" Vincent nodded, uninterested. Callie, unable to help herself, wondered what she might be able to get away with, if she could get away from Vincent for just a few minutes. After all, with a bag of soggy clothes was not the way a woman wanted to enjoy her stay at a place like this. When he turned away, both keys in hand, he didn't even tell her to follow, and Callie was starting to get annoyed. She felt like a lost dog, following around a memorable stranger. But still, the elevator doors opened long enough for her to get inside behind him, and they rode up to their floor in silence. It was room 13457. A combination of good luck and bad, she noted. Thirteen and seven…but she didn't think of herself as a superstitious person, and let it go. It was only when she was in the room, saw how it was much smaller than she would have guessed… and that there was only one of them…that her mouth opened before she could stop herself. \"We're sharing?\" Finally, he turned his eyes to her. Green flint. He smirked, his jaw hard. \"Yes,\" he said, his tone almost mocking. \"We're sharing.\" She shook her head. This was too much. She had asked him and he had complied! But how in the world could they share a room like this and not wind up falling all over each other? Her mouth opened again, but she couldn't figure out what to say that didn't sound completely wrong. \"Relax,\" he said, reading her mind. He tossed his bag into a chair. \"I'll keep to what I said before. But this is safer. If we had two rooms, I'd have too much space to guard. This way, you can see trouble coming. And I can keep you close.\" He turned away. The room had one bed. A king size, which meant it was easily accessible for five people to sleep in, but still. Thick, embossed comforters and a pile of pillows…she had the urge to sink herself in them. She felt exhausted, like she hadn't gotten a single drop of rest from being in that stupid deck chair all night. But she couldn't even sit on the damn thing. Instead, she went to one of the chairs beside the small two-person table and sat down in it. It was very comfortable…it had one of those extended seats so her legs could stretch out. She could almost sleep in it. She considered it. Because there were some things she was not going to share with Vincent. One of them was a bed. Her stomach gave an uncomfortable lurch. If she took a moment to appreciate this situation from Vincent's perspective, she was seeing that he was going through a lot of trouble for a woman he didn't have any reason to protect outside from some personal feeling he couldn't even quite identify. What was his payoff from this? Sooner or later, he might see it was net zero. She was really walking on thin ice. But still, her other half argued, she hadn't asked him for any of this. She didn't want to be here. Whatever twisted reasons Vincent had, she couldn't take responsibility for any of them because she had no say in them at all. \"You look tired,\" Vincent said, coming out of the bathroom. \"You want to get some sleep?\" She looked down at the bag of soggy clothes. She couldn't go to sleep, not yet, she had to hang them up. As much as she didn't want them, they were the only things she had. Vincent followed her eyes and picked up the bag. \"You can go downstairs later and get yourself something from one of the shops,\" he said, in a tone that was dangerously close to generous. \"I'm tossing this out. They have a spa, or a salon or something like that, too. We might want to consider changing your hair color.\" He narrowed his eyes and cocked his head. \"Can't say I like that idea much, but it may help.\" She frowned, grasping her dark auburn locks. \"Why?\" she asked. He looked at her like she was an idiot. \"To make it a bit harder for Rochester to find you when you're not with me,\" he said. \"You're pretty sure he'll find us? We're in Thailand.\" \"He'll find us,\" Vincent said plainly. \"It's just a matter of time.\" \"So what's the plan then?\" she asked, grateful for a reason to talk. \"Do we just wait for him? I mean, you have a plan, don't you, Vincent?\" He had turned and walked away from her, pacing the length of the room. He had folded his arms, and she had a sudden fear that he didn't have a plan, that he was playing all of this as a giant improvisation exercise. Wasn't that Vincent? Darwin, I-Ching, roll with it . She opened her mouth to press him, unsure exactly how, but then he started to speak, in a quiet tone. \"The only way to do it is to kill him,\" he said, as if more to himself than to her. \"And the only way to do that is to lure him into a position where he thinks he's won.\" His back was to her, all she could see were the muscles of his neck as he stretched them lightly, a nervous habit he did when he was thinking. \"Which means we have to bait him.\" Then he turned and looked at her. \"You want me to play bait?\" she said, disbelieving. \"We should still change your hair color. Don't want to make it too obvious.\" She frowned. \"So what do you know about this Rochester guy? Other than the terrible things he does to his victims?\" Vincent shrugged one shoulder. \"Nothing. There isn't anything to know. No family, no ties, like me. No personal attachments. Nothing to exploit.\" Then he frowned, a worried frown, as he looked at her. \"Until now,\" she said, unable to help herself. \"Until me.\" His eyes…how strange they turned. That unfocused look she had seen a few times during that night, as if he were gazing inside himself and was horrified at what he saw, but didn't dare show it. \"It's a double play,\" he said, even softer. \"Rochester wants to take me out, too. Probably either Peter has let him think that's what he wants, or else he's got a separate contract with Felix. Either way, doesn't matter. So he's waiting to do you until after he kills me. That way, he feels he can take his time. With me alive, there's too much of a risk of being interrupted. Some guys might think of that as part of the thrill, but he doesn't. He doesn't like to be hurried.\" Callie shuddered. Yet another reminder of the hell that awaited her if this didn't work. Still…\"You have a lot of faith in Peter. You really trust him?\" Vincent blinked, as if just seeing her. \"Yes,\" he said, bluntly. \"And how do you know…that you can?\" It seemed very, very odd that Vincent, of all people, would have blind faith in anyone, no matter how special that person might be. More than odd, it seemed an outright aberration. \"Because I do.\" Candid. No room for argument. She couldn't let it go. \"But…I mean…doesn't it seem…risky? I mean, how can you afford to do what you do and trust… anyone ?\" He gave her a little smile. \"You won't understand it, Callie. Don't try.\" \"Oh, what, is it a guy thing?\" she said, a bit derisively. \"No,\" he said. \"It just is.\" No luck. He wasn't cracking. Switch tactics . \"So Rochester, he doesn't trust anyone? And he won't kill me until he's killed you? You're sure?\" \"It's too much of a risk for me to be alive,\" Vincent said. \"I'm the bigger threat, so logic says you take out the bigger threat and then the smaller ones are much easier.\" \"So you mean, that's how you'd do it.\" Funny, how he knew how people would react to situations, and yet he had no emotional tie to how they felt. He had no empathy, no ability to connect to anyone, and yet he could still predict their actions spot-on. \"So until you're dead, I'm safe?\" He shrugged his shoulder again. \"No, you're not safe. He may wait to kill you, but he'll use you to get to me. It's a classic tactic. So we have to establish a few rules. \"You have to stay inside the hotel, unless I tell you otherwise. I'm sure this is going to chafe your ass, having to do everything I tell you, from what I read of your memoir, but it's necessary. I need to know where you're going at all times. If I can't watch you, I'll get someone from hotel security to do it.\" She frowned. \"They'll do that?\" \"If you have enough money, they'll do a lot worse,\" Vincent said casually. \"Anyway, you also need to stay in public places at all times, where there are a lot of people. A lull in the crowd will give him the chance to approach you. People around will discourage him.\" \"Why? He seems to like an audience.\" She thought of meeting him in the bar. God, what if she'd joined him? What would have happened? She didn't continue the thought. \"True, but having too many people around risks drawing too much attention to yourself. He may be a showboat but he's not stupid. Trust me, Callie.\" She bit back a snort. Trust me . But what choice did she have? Then the words slid from her mouth before she could think about them. \"I'm tired. This is all making me tired.\" \"Then sleep,\" he said, heading towards the bathroom. \"Go on, take the bed.\" He gave her a look over his shoulder, a look that made her insides give a strange little roll. \"I'll keep my word. You're safe.\" She frowned in his wake, where he'd disappeared into the bathroom. The thing must be huge, she pondered, but right now, it was the hugeness of the bed that beckoned her. She felt herself standing up, kicking off her shoes, shaking off the hoodie so that she was only in the tank top underneath it, and yanked off the heavy comforter. She settled herself into the nest of pillows and was asleep before she knew it. 8888888888888888888 Ray woke up. He hadn't even been aware of the fact that he was asleep. He remembered talking to Lupe… man, he'd talked himself hoarse. \"How is he?\" he heard the familiar, gruff voice of Dr. Gregg, Laurie, saying. They were just outside his room. He was in one of the temporary lodgings for the overnight doctors, like a dormitory. Had this been Callie's room? He hesitated to ask. Lupe answered. Her voice was sweet and husky, like raw honey. \"He's…better. He's calmer. This news isn't going to help that.\" Ray sat up, clearing his throat loudly. \"What news?\" he called through the partially opened door. \"Hey out there, what news?\" Lupe reached in and pushed the door the rest of the way open. She was in her doctor's clothes – dressy slacks, sleek shirt, and of course the traditional white lab coat. Around her neck hung her identification, and her hair was pulled back in a dark bun. Her glasses perched on top of her head, but he was sure, when she put them on, it completed her professional look. An attractive woman was a neon sign in a mental institution, and she had to play it down. Somehow, it just seemed that much more alluring to him. Laurie followed. He looked like hell. Ray was used to Dr. Gregg looking rough around the edges, but this was above and beyond. His eyes were bloodshot and there were dark bags underneath them. It was obvious that he was running on empty but had no intention of refueling. \"There haven't been any leads on Callie,\" Lupe said gently, sitting down in the small chair beside his bed as he pulled himself upright, swinging his legs over the side. \"The police are talking about the trail going cold.\" \"And if she's left the country, there's nothing they can do. It's being turned over to the FBI,\" Laurie chimed in, his voice sounding even worse than his face looked. \"Which is very comforting, considering their workload.\" \"So,\" Ray said, trying to process this, \"so what do we do?\" The two doctors just exchanged looks. Ray snorted. \"Fine.\" He stood up, his head feeling a little woozy from the drugs, but otherwise, feeling much more like himself. \"What about Bill? Anything on him?\" \"We can't get him on any of his phones,\" Lupe said. \"We're pretty sure he's left town.\" Ray shook his head. \"Of course he's not answering his phones…what's he going to say? 'Oh, yeah, Callie? Yeah, I helped her get kidnapped. Sorry, gotta run, more bad deeds to do today.' What about family – Dr. Gregg, you have Bill's work file, don't you? Next of kin, anything?\" \"Already been turned over to the police as our first suspect,\" Laurie replied. \"If they've found him they haven't told us.\" \"They'll tell me,\" Ray said, reaching for his coat. He'd slept in his clothes, but he didn't care. \"Anything else either of you has to say before I go?\" he added, turning to them. \"One more thing,\" Laurie said, clearing his throat. \"There was a guy named Rippner. He was trying to get Callie to drop the book she and I were working on. He tried to get to me, too…\" He paused, hesitating. \"And?\" Ray pressed, knowing there was more. \"He called before,\" Laurie pressed on. \"After Callie disappeared. Implied he knew where she was. Said we'd get her back safe as long as I buried the book.\" \"Which line did he call?\" Ray asked, straining for calm. Doctors …so smart, with all that school, and not a brain between them. \"My personal line,\" Laurie said, frowning. \"What does…\" \"I'm going to get the call traced. What time did it come in? It's important that we know so we can pinpoint the origin of the call. Come on, Laurie, you want to find Callie too, I know you do.\" He snapped his fingers as he turned and headed out the door. 88888888888888888 Bill sat in the molded plastic chair. They were holding him for questioning, and hadn't formally charged him with anything, but he knew it was coming. After leaving Callie at the airport, he had refused to ride back with Rippner. He couldn't be around that man for more than two minutes alone, for fear of wanting to strangle him. He had walked from the private gates to the main hangar of the airport and hailed himself a cab. It had taken a couple of hours. A few more to get home, considering traffic. He was surprised to find that there weren't cops waiting for him at his house. And the thick brown envelope containing the pictures was still sitting on his kitchen table. Nothing had been touched. It felt like a stranger's house, now. What had he done? He sat down at his kitchen table, feeling the wash of guilt becoming painful, sharp. He reached for the pictures. The pictures were the reason he had done it. Rippner had convinced him that Callie was in more danger from Rochester than from Vincent. Going with Vincent was her only option of safety. Rochester had gotten to her right underneath their noses, and could go back at any time, no matter what they did. He already had proof of that, from the commotion at the hospital. But with Vincent…with Vincent she was safe. That thought really bugged him. He had seen how terrified she was of Vincent. He had heard her scream, watched her run. He had been helpless to save her then, too. He was out of his league. He picked up the pack of pictures and pulled them out of the envelope. This was what awaited Callie, if Rochester got her. And it was more than visual graphics, it was medical reports of the victims. That was worse, the cold, clinical descriptions of despicable acts. This was why he had done it. To save her from this. As gruesome as the images were, they helped soothed his conscience. So many great, heroic acts in this world went completely misunderstood. He could live with that. As long as Callie was safe, he could live with it. But he knew they were coming for him. And he was no criminal. So he had gone straight to them. They put him in this room about five hours ago. They hadn't fed him much more than a few candy bars from the vending machines, and given him a couple of cans of Mountain Dew to keep him awake. They didn't put him in the holding cell because he was being so well behaved. He had turned himself in, after all. And they were waiting for the brother, Callie's brother, to have his crack at him. Except Callie's brother wasn't there. Bill didn't mind. It was better being here than anywhere else. At least here, he knew he was in the right place. And they had left the pictures with him, so that he could comfort himself, every now and again, that he had done the right thing by Callie, even if she hadn't liked it. Sometime, early in the morning, there was a commotion outside, and suddenly the door to his room burst open. It was Ray, and he looked furious. Bill knew what was coming. He took it calmly, expecting worse. He anticipated Ray punching him, at the very least. But instead, the man lunged at him and grabbed him by his shoulders, hauling him up. Bill took it. He knew Ray had every right, and just went limp. \"You son of a bitch!\" the cop roared into his face. Bill winced a bit under the bad breath – he smelled like he'd just woken up. Morning breath fumes. \"We trusted you! What the hell did you do!\" Bill's back slammed the wall, pushing some wind from him. But he didn't resist. He waited until a few other cops came in and pulled Ray off of him, and then slid to the floor. He wanted to tell them to stop, to let Ray have at, he deserved it. But he kept silent. There was a lot of yelling, and talk of throwing Ray out of the room, but he prevailed. He went to the other end of the table, glaring down at Bill, sitting on the floor so that only his head was in sight. \"Get up!\" Ray snapped at him. \"Get on your fucking feet!\" Bill turned his eyes to him and slowly got to his feet. He took the chair he had been knocked from and set it upright, then sat down. He met Ray's eyes, unashamed. \"They told me,\" Ray said, his voice lower but no less intense, \"that you took her to the airport. That you put her on a private jet. Where was the jet going? Who was on it?\" \"I don't know where it was going for sure,\" Bill said calmly. \"I think someone said Bangkok, but I'm not sure.\" \"Bangkok,\" one of the other cops murmured behind Ray. \"Fucking Thailand?\" \"And who was on it?\" Ray asked again. Bill knew Ray was going to explode when he heard the answer. He had to play this carefully. No sense in getting Ray exiled from his holding room; that would defeat the entire purpose of this humiliation. He wanted Ray to understand, like he had been made to understand, that Callie was safer where she was. He reached across and picked up the envelope, grabbed it by the bottom, and yanked up. The pictures spilled out. Ray saw them. It was impossible not to see. The blood, the horror. His face had been red with suppressed rage, but the blood drained out, leaving him pale. Then, his eyes rose again to meet Bill's, indiscernible. \"What are you telling me?\" he asked in a near whisper. \"This is what Rochester is going to do to Callie,\" Bill said. \"You remember Rochester, right? The guy who got to Callie in her secured room in the middle of the hospital? The only reason she's not like this right now is because of Vincent.\" Ray flinched at the mention of that name. \"How do you figure that?\" Bill sighed. This wasn't going to be easy. \"Haven't you asked yourself,\" he said slowly, \"why Callie even lived through that night with Vincent? He should have killed her – you know it, Ray. You're a cop. Assassins don't leave witnesses.\" Ray gave a twitchy shrug, but Bill could tell that the thought had occurred to him, several times. Unpleasantly. \"But Rochester is the one who murdered your father,\" Bill said. Ray shook his head. \"Vincent did it,\" he said stubbornly. \"As a warning to Callie.\" Bill shook his head back, \"No, he didn't. Look at the pictures, Ray! This is Rochester's work! Even Callie told you that she didn't believe –\" Ray made a sweeping motion with his hand. \"Don't,\" he said. \"Callie's not in her right mind when it comes to Vincent. She could have Stockholm Syndrome for all we know.\" \"Well, she's with him,\" Bill said, playing the card. \"That's who was on the plane. He wants to protect her. I don't know why, but it's got to be safer than…\" He looked down at the pictures, letting his voice trail off ominously. Ray just stared at him. Bill waited for the eruption, but instead, Ray turned away, putting his hand up, palm out. \"Get this guy out of here,\" he said, his voice shaking with fury. \"Get him in a cell. Charge him with aiding and abetting a kidnapping.\" \"Wait!\" Bill called. Ray paused, looking at him over his shoulder, eyes bright with wrath. \"The guy who arranged it, his name is Jackson Rippner,\" Bill said, finishing what he'd originally intended to do. \"I saw him, met him. I can give you a description. He's the one who gave me this envelope. We can try to get prints--\" \"Get a sketch artist, then,\" Ray said to another cop, turning away from Bill. \"That's two that have identified this Rippner. He's our link. Find out what gate they went to, find out who owns the jet she got on, LAX has got to keep records.\" \"That was the first thing we did, Fanning,\" said the other cop, who had helped pull Ray off of Bill. \"Nothing's come back yet.\" \"All right,\" Ray grunted. \"I need a phone call traced from Dr. Laurence Gregg's office at St. Anthony's. And get that envelope down to forensics for latent prints. Come on people, I can't believe this hasn't been done already! Daylight is burning!\" 888888888888888888888888 Jackson: I thought you said I'd be in the upcoming chapter! Me: First of all, I didn't say which chapter. And Second, we did mention you. You were very important in this chapter. Vincent: You're whining about not being in my fanfic? Me: Don't worry, Vincent. If-when I write his fanfic, I'll make sure that you make an appearance. Vincent: ( perking up ) Seriously? Me: Seriously. Vincent: You promise? Me: Absolutely. Jackson: Wait, that's not fair! Me: What? How do you get that? Jackson: Well, you've written Vincent a bunch of fanfics. Me, I'm only getting my tiny one. And my tiddly little part in this one. Me: First of all, you have over five hundred fanfics ! Vincent has a measly 20 or so! And second, when is anything I've ever written been tiny? Jackson: Um, let's see…\"More Like His Mother,\" and \"Untouchable.\" Which was a brilliant fic, by the way… Vincent: Oh, hush. You big ass-kissing crybaby. Jackson: You should talk! Me: Neither of you should talk! Shut up! Let the readers go review! – Please?[Chapter 16] Disclaimer: The Usual. A/N: Ah, I have no excuse. It's been over a year since this story was updated and even longer since it was worked on. I have four chapters sitting in the hole. I was waiting until i had finished to update, but instead I decided to just update. Four chapters should keep you guys busy for a bit. I will, eventually, finish. I just don't know when. This is what happens when you work two jobs, leave your house at 7ish a.m. and don't get home until almost 6:30 p.m. every day. 8888888888888888888888888888 Chapter Sixteen: Stupid (from the song by Sarah McLachlan) When Callie woke up, she had lost the whole day. And she was alone. The sky had turned to twilight and the world outside looked like a wonderland. Callie lay on the bed, staring out the large window, wondering where Vincent was. Maybe he had left a note, she told herself, and managed to pull herself upright to check the bedside table. Her head throbbed in objection – sleeping through the day hadn't agreed with her, apparently. And after realizing there was no note on the table, she realized she had to pee. The bathroom was larger than she had anticipated. It contained both a shower and a bath – a very round, deep bathtub that resembled a Jacuzzi. But it was nothing compared to the shower. It occupied the entire corner, and was hexagon shaped, with two nozzles that formed an X when the spigots were fully on. Everything was done in a soft, cocoa colored tile, and the mirror stretched fully across the room, making the bathroom seem twice as large. She washed her face, ran a brush through her hair – someone had left a basket of personal supplies, and she didn't hesitate to make free use of them – and then wandered back into the main room. She was still in those stupid sweats from the boat, and Vincent had tossed out the clothes she had come in. It was when she reached for the hotel room door that she saw the note. He had taped it at eye level. \"Don't go out.\" Callie cussed under her breath. Lot of fair this was, him leaving her alone. Was she even allowed to call room service and get something to eat? It might let a stranger into the room. Then the memory of what Ray had said happened to her father flashed through her mind and she felt subdued. Rochester would do worse to her. Vincent was trying to protect her. Still, she couldn't bear the thought of pacing this room, luxurious as it was, just waiting for him to come back! She was able to hold herself off for almost a half-hour – it was closer to twenty minutes when she convinced herself she was only going to the lobby. Vincent may have not meant the lobby – he may have just been warning her not to leave the hotel itself. But in the lobby she was more than safe. He'd said to stay in public places, well, she'd get one of the women who had to work in the shops to help her, and therefore she wouldn't be alone. She felt guilty only for the elevator ride down. Vincent would be mad at her, she realized, if she misunderstood his direction, but was that her fault? Mr. I'm-vague-and-mysterious couldn't be bothered to leave more details? Of course she'd misunderstood, who wouldn't have? He'd have nobody to blame but himself. When she entered the small gallery where the clothing shops were, she forgot herself. She could charge anything she purchased to the room. And there was little doubt in her mind that Peter was picking up the tab for this – after all, he had loaned Vincent his jet and then his boat, right? So therefore, it was all up for grabs. She was a kid in a candy store. For a little while, she was able to forget. Forget the horror back at home, forget the confusion of being with Vincent, and even forget her fear and grief. She knew she was just sidestepping reality, but it was worth it, for just a little while. Such clothes…the woman, a very young Thai lady with a witch's streak through her short dark hair and eyes like toasted almonds, who was on the counter that night spoke English perfectly. Callie explained that she had no clothes at all, that she had to buy everything. The woman, whose nametag read \"Lei,\" hooked her up with everything she needed and more. She even pointed her across the way to an associate, Beth, an American transplant, to get her a bathing suit. Hotel services sent a bellhop to help her get all her purchases up to the room, and by then it was fully dark. Vincent was still not back. Hangars had been provided, and Callie even hummed to herself as she hung things up, but still, no sign of her self-appointed bodyguard. It was almost nine o'clock when she had had enough. Flipping through the television channels, she discovered on the hotel's commercial line that there was a pool on the roof, encased in walls of glass. She decided to put on her bathing suit and take a trip upstairs. The pool was heated. In the cool of the air conditioning, it felt wonderful. She floated and relaxed, and took comfort in the people around her, all of whom seemed more than content to mind their own business. Then she did some laps – in high school, she had been on the swim team, and had continued the exercise into college, but she was long out of her routine. She swam until she felt herself start to cramp, and then decided maybe it was time to take a break. She was under water, having just done her last flip and turn, when she looked up through the watery depths and saw someone standing at the pool's edge. He looked familiar, and as Callie's head emerged, she realized Vincent was there, staring down at her. He didn't look happy. She treaded water for a moment, staring up at him. She waited for some kind of reprimand, some chastising remark, but nothing came. Then, he looked around, and she had the feeling he'd been scanning the entire area for several minutes. From her under-sided view, his lips seemed to be curled in a mild expression of irritation. Finally, she realized he was holding a towel. He made a jerking motion with his head, and she didn't dare argue. She swam over to the steps where the pool became shallow and walked up and out. As the water pulled away from her body, she suddenly felt very vulnerable, almost naked, even though the suit was a one-piece and very modestly cut. He waited for her at the top. He had opened the towel and it hung down in front of him, his arms spread. As if he expected her to step into it. Callie suddenly blushed furiously at the thought, and her cheeks gained more heat when she realized the thought made her blush. Still, the way he was looking at her, chin lowered, eyes up, an intimidating glare although it lacked real teeth, she didn't dare stop. She stepped closer to him, reaching for the towel, but he folded it around her, encasing her in its warmth and pulling her closer to him than she wanted to be. \"What are you doing?\" he said, his voice low. It sent air over her wet skin and made her shiver. \"Swimming,\" she said, struggling to keep her tone innocent but not cowed. \"Where have you been?\" He didn't answer, just hooked the towel behind her and then grabbed another one, this one going over her shoulders. He pulled her a little closer this time, his displeasure still obvious. \"You need to come back to the room with me, right now,\" he said, his voice cool. She frowned. She was suddenly indignant, being rebuked as if she were a small child. \"I'm pretty wet,\" she said. \"I want to dry off a bit.\" He gave her a look that nearly broke her reserve. But she clung hard. \"It's not a good idea,\" he said. \"I can't believe you didn't listen…didn't you read the note?\" \"It said don't go outside,\" she said. \"I'm not outside. I'm inside. I've been inside the hotel all day…well, night. You said don't go outside. I haven't.\" He gave her another you're-an-idiot look, but she frowned, holding fast. \"Oh, come on, Vincent!\" she hissed at him. \"I've been alone how long? Nothing's happened to me. If you've been in the room I'm sure you saw I went shopping. Where do you think I got this? Nothing happened to me.\" She scowled now, feeling angry. \"And where have you been?\" The sudden thought of Cathy popped into her head and she felt irrationally jealous. She knew it appeared in her face but she didn't care – anything to get the heat off her. \"With your friend from the boat? You've been having fun and expecting me to just rot in the room, bored out of my mind?\" He raised an eyebrow. The look unsettled her and she turned her eyes away. He answered by letting go of the towel across her shoulders. \"Well, excuse me,\" he said, his voice still subdued. \"I forgot that you know everything. By all means, then, finish drying off. I'll see you when you decide to come back to the room. Take your time.\" The sarcasm dripped thicker than the drops of chlorinated water that oozed off her suit. She watched him go, but he didn't look back. Fuming, she went over to a lounge chair and sat down. For several minutes, she could hardly think – just replay the conversation over and over in her head, if it could have been called that. The looks on his face, the injury of his words. He left her alone! And she hadn't disobeyed him! What was she, a mind-reader? Was she supposed to just know everything his words meant, even if that's not what he said? He was being unreasonable! Then the guilt came. The continuous reminders of why she was here. That was followed closely by the resentment, and then her thoughts turned back to her brother…and Laurie. She missed him so much. It was like an ache in her belly. She didn't have this confusion, this pain with Laurie. With Laurie, she knew where everything was, no turmoil, no anguish. She realized she'd been sitting there long enough for the towels she was wearing to be soaked through and her suit to be as dry as it was going to get. Her hair felt like straw as she stood up, heading over to the small alcove where the fresh towels were kept. She peeled off the used ones and tossed them into the hamper, and just as she was reaching for a fresh one, she felt a powerful hand grip her just above the elbow. She turned her head but saw nothing. Whoever it was dragged her toward him, if it was a him , and she only saw the flash of blue from the janitor's uniform he was wearing before she found herself, again, in a dark utility closet. The light snapped on and she would have screamed if there wasn't a hand over her mouth. Rochester smiled down at her. \"Hello, Callie,\" he said, almost cheerfully, as he pressed her into the door, effectively keeping it shut. \"Fancy meeting you here.\" She looked up at him, shock and disbelief overpowering her for a moment, but then, quickly, the anger kicked in, and she started to struggle. Furiously, she lashed out and grunted, until she saw the annoyance rise in his face as well. She didn't care – this was the man who had killed her father! She suddenly felt vicious, dangerous, and even bit against the fingers that held her lips closed. \"Hey now!\" he snapped at her, and she felt a sudden pain that made her left arm go numb. He must have been pressing a pressure point because she couldn't pinpoint the source. \"That's not very nice. What, didn't like my message? But I thought red was every girl's favorite color.\" She had no idea what he was talking about – she looked at him as if he were deranged. She didn't care, though. The sudden urge to make this monster pay overwhelmed her. \"You know, I just put the old dog out of his misery,\" Rochester said, pressing harder against her so it made it harder to struggle – although she did keep trying. \"Didn't even tell you he had cancer, did he? But your mom died of cancer, too, right? Small cell? You know that runs in the family. Now you've got it on both sides, Callie. You know cancer is a much crueler killer than I could ever be. So if you really think about it, you'll realize I'm doing all of you a favor.\" She muffled obscenities underneath his hand. \"Ah, I'm unappreciated in my own time.\" He wiggled against her, rubbing her suggestively. \"Fine with me, most geniuses are.\" She glowered at him, and unbidden, tears came to her eyes. She struggled to keep them back, realizing he would just take more perverse pleasure in her pain. She blinked several times, but he was too close for her to fake it – he saw her pain, and it made him smile. \"So what is this, Callie? You escape on a little weekend getaway? Your new sugar daddy buys you everything you need…and you're stupid enough to snap at him and let him walk away. You should have listened to Vincent. But I'm sure your head isn't exactly in the right place right now. It can't be easy, falling hard for a guy who put you through so much hell. And yet that poor stupid sap just keeps taking it from you, no matter how many times you kick him in the balls.\" Rochester ground his hips into her, making her wince. He got one thigh between hers, and she let out a small, whimpering cry. \"It's almost kinky, if you ask me. Watching it, though. Any woman who tried to do that to me would…well, I think I'll just show you.\" He leaned over her, and Callie let out a scream. It wasn't much – it caught in her throat and burned there, vibrating through her chest. She felt his mouth on her neck and the touch of his lips was like acid. She realized he was kissing her, but it was more than that – he was sucking on her skin, drawing it into his mouth. She bucked. His leg went deeper between hers, almost lifting her feet from the floor. Her breasts ached from where they were smashed against his chest, and then she felt a pinch and realized his other hand, the one that wasn't pinning her shoulders to the door, was squeezing one of her breasts. Which left her mouth free, but she couldn't get enough air to scream. Oh God, this was it, she realized. This was the beginning. He had been waiting to get her away from Vincent, biding his time, and now, this rotten little closet was the last thing she was ever going to see. The thought drained her of every drop of adrenaline. She fell limp, sagging against the door. He lifted his mouth from her skin and turned his eyes to her, puzzled. \"Oh, come on, sugar, I wasn't finished yet.\" He chuckled. \"You know, though, this has really been a lot of fun for me. You're like ripe, fresh fruit, dangling in plain sight. I can swipe you any time – usually, I'm a go-for-it kind of guy, but you're really making me appreciate the anticipation.\" \"You're not going to kill me,\" she said, her voice cracked and weakened. Vincent's words suddenly rang back to her. \"Not until you've killed him. You said it yourself, before.\" He blinked. \"Yes, I did. Well, I'm nothing if not inconsistent.\" He looked her over, raising an eyebrow suggestively. \"Looks like we're kindred spirits.\" That got her attention. She snapped her eyes up to his. \"What are you rambling about?\" He chuckled. \"Look at you. That sweet little bathing suit you've got on. I saw you by the pool before. You break his balls, but you know you want him. You just can't live with what that says about you.\" Her eyes widened. \"You're…you don't…\" She couldn't get the words out. Instead, she just snorted and looked away. He stared at her for a long moment, and then she felt him seize her hair and pull her forward. One hand clamped around her jaw, muffling her scream, as his teeth descended to the raw spot he had created before. And he bit down. She felt the hot blood against her skin, and had a sudden and horrible vision of him ripping out her jugular like some jungle cat. But instead, he let go, and she felt the sting of air against torn skin right before he tossed her behind him like a used towel. She slammed face first into a shelf of towels, smacking her jaw against the metal edge, and when she recovered herself, she was alone. 888888888888888888 The elevator door slid open to reveal Callie standing in the car. Vincent opened his mouth to reprimand her again, his frustration that had been building over the last twenty minutes ready to vent itself on her, damn what she might think. But when he saw that she clutched a towel to her neck, and that the towel was streaked with dark red blood, he stopped in mid-remark, and immediately opened his arms to grasp her between them. \"What happened?\" he asked, even as he propelled her out of the elevator and down the hall to their room. He didn't take his eyes from her as he got the keycard into its slot, observing her paleness, the slanted look in her eyes. Shock, he recognized. And there was a bright red mark along her left cheekbone, straight, as if she'd run sidelong into a pole. \"Rochester,\" she managed in a small voice. He got her into the bathroom and made her sit down on the toilet. Her hand had clenched around the towel, and he had to nearly pry it off, although he was gentle about it. \"What the hell did he do?\" Vincent asked, even as he looked at the torn flesh. It didn't look like a knife wound, and it wasn't deep, but it was ugly, and would leave a scar. \"Bit me,\" she said. Vincent paused for a moment. Rochester had gotten to her, right under his nose. He'd had time to pull her into some secluded place, and do this to her. It was a message; that was obvious. He'd found them sooner than Vincent had anticipated, but…something about this didn't ring right. She mistook his silence for something else. She turned her eyes toward him, but didn't meet his. \"Please,\" she said, her voice like broken clay, \"no I-told-you-soes. I get it, you were right, I was wrong. I won't leave the room again.\" He blinked. He'd seen her like this before…had it only been a few weeks? The dead tone in her voice, the blank look in her eyes. He couldn't stand her like this. Broken. Defeated. He stared at her for a long moment, unsure what to do. Last time, he had kissed her, but he'd given his word, and knew that if he broke it, it would make things worse, not better. So instead, he reached behind him for a washcloth and soaked it in cold water. Then he pulled some ice from the nearby bucket and folded it into the white cloth, and pressed the bundle against the wound. \"Hold that here,\" he said softly. \"I'll be right back.\" She winced slightly as the cold met the heat, but he could tell by the lines of her brow that it immediately helped. She clamped her hand over the bundle and gave a slight nod, and he went into the main room and called for room service. He promised the guy fifty dollars if he hustled, bearing with him a considerable first aid kit. Then he went back into the bathroom. She was crying. It stunned him for a moment. He turned his back and suddenly waterworks. He was unprepared; the last time he'd seen her cry, he'd been chasing her through the metro rail train and just shot that district attorney. Sure, she had been upset, it was a normal reaction for a woman to cry in situations of extreme stress. It didn't mean he had to like it or that he knew how to deal with it. It had derailed him then and it derailed him now. He had no reaction. \"It's…it's not that bad,\" he said, feeling lame, as he went back to cleaning the mark. \"I know it hurts, but…\" Stupid. It wasn't that kind of pain. It was piling on her, and finally the avalanche hit. Her shoulders shook and her breath came in wet snorts. She had pressed both hands to her face, hiding herself from him. He resisted the urge to start swearing under his breath. In normal situations, when women cried, men felt the urge to comfort them. He'd seen it a dozen times, but had never landed himself in the position where he had to follow suit. And he knew if he put his arms around Callie, there was no telling where it might lead. He wasn't sure he'd be able to control himself. Finally, unable to help himself any longer, he knelt down in front of her and gently pulled her hands away from her face. With a clean hand towel, he mopped up her wet cheeks and then handed her a Kleenex. She blew her nose, tossed it aside, but didn't stop crying. \"It's not your fault,\" he said, scrambling for something, anything to say. \"It's mine. I shouldn't have left you. I should have stayed with you.\" She didn't answer. Her breath was still coming out in tight wheezes, obstructed by the sobs in her throat. He couldn't take it anymore. He got up on his knees and encircled her in his arms, being careful to keep clear of the raw, aching rip in her shoulder. He pulled her to his chest and pressed her there, and she responded, her arms going around his neck tightly. \"Callie,\" he said, hearing the pleading in his own voice and straining against being ashamed of it, \"please, please stop crying.\" How long he held her, he wasn't sure. At first she was tense in his arms, but slowly she unclenched and he felt her go soft against him. She rested her head on his shoulder, and slowly her sobs subsided. A knock on the door gave him an excuse to let her go. He extracted himself from her and went to get the first aid kid he'd ordered. It contained everything he asked – hydrogen peroxide, ointment, gauze and tape. He went about the job of bandaging her up, but she remained silent. She hardly flinched when he had to pour the peroxide on her, to make sure the wound was sterilized. If it had been him, he would have just poured alcohol down the damn thing, but didn't feel like hearing her scream. Rochester…he was taunting them, that was it. He knew she was Vincent's weakness and he was rubbing his face in it. \"It's not just skin, it's muscle, too,\" he said after medicating it thoroughly. \"Which means its going to ache for a while. You might want some aspirin or ibuprofen or something.\" He tried to keep his tone detached, but knew it was only a front. He'd already held her, for crying out loud, he had begged her to stop crying. He'd become a complete sap! Rather disgusted with himself, he didn't even notice when she didn't answer. When the gauze was firmly taped in place, he gave her shoulder a light pat. \"I'm going to order us some dinner,\" he said. \"You probably don't think you're hungry but I'm ordering a cheeseburger for you anyway, unless you want something different.\" He was at the threshold of the bathroom when she spoke. \"Club sandwich,\" she said. \"And some soup.\" He glanced at her over his shoulder, nodded, and headed back out into the main room. 88888888888888888 Callie sat on the toilet for several minutes after he left. She could hear him in the next room, on the telephone, then turning on the television. He sounded…odd. Strained. No doubt, he had just acted completely out of character. It had to be draining on a man to pretend he had compassion. But his tone remained polite to whoever was taking their dinner order, and he settled himself into the room's largest easy chair with a sigh as he proceeded to watch the news. She wiped at her face, and realized the only part of her that felt remotely clean was the injury on her shoulder. Her bathing suit had completely dried, leaving a salty crust from the chlorine on her skin. She didn't want to bathe, though, for fear of getting Vincent's hard work all wet. So she went into the main room, grabbed up a pair of shorts and a T-shirt from her earlier shopping spree, and went back into the bathroom, filling the sink with hot, soapy water. The tub was too large, and the shower, in spite of its width, seemed to promise only soaking her completely, and she didn't want to mess up Vincent's efforts. She scoured herself down as best she could, careful to avoid her wound. When she was done, she thrust her whole head into the deep sink and washed her hair. It was lucky that she had many nice bathing scrubs and body washes, as it gave the room and her a pleasant odor when she was done. She heard voices through the door when she finally finished, her hair neat and combed, sprayed down with leave-in conditioner. A rattling of silverware and glass told her that their meal had arrived, and Callie was extremely pleased to find a bowl of creamy tomato soup beside a large croissant stuffed with turkey, bacon and avocado. They ate in silence. Vincent didn't eat much, only munched on a steak sandwich, and didn't even touch the French fries. He seemed absorbed by the news, but from what she could tell, there was nothing on there that even remotely related to them. It didn't surprise her – the only thing that would come onto their radar would be international, and neither she nor Vincent was important enough to make international news. Felix Reyes Torrena, however… She nearly dropped her spoon when his face flashed onto the screen. Vincent had the captioning on so that they could read the translation in English, but it flashed across the screen so quickly Callie couldn't absorb it all. They were attempting to bring him up on charges again, blah blah, murder charges, blah blah. Callie looked to Vincent, who was frowning thoughtfully. After the segment was done, he turned the television off and looked back at her. \"What?\" he asked, nonchalant. \"Do you think it means something?\" she asked. He shrugged. \"Probably. Felix is the one who had the contract out on you. If the district attorney's office has finally gotten enough leftovers to level charges at him again, they can't be basing them on you because you're not there. So it might be a bluff. Or it might not.\" He shrugged again. \"Doesn't matter to us at the moment. We have bigger problems.\" She nodded. \"So what's the plan?\" she asked. He didn't answer for a good minute. \"I don't think we should stay here past tomorrow,\" he said. \"In the morning, we should check out.\" \"Where are we going to go?\" He didn't answer, but instead got up and put the rest of his dinner back on the room service tray. He took her empty plates and piled them up, then stuffed the whole mess out into the hallway. When he turned back, she was standing up, facing him, so that they were merely inches apart. \"Housekeeper doesn't suit you,\" she said, folding her arms. \"Come on, Vincent. I give up; I'm in this with you. I'll do what you tell me, but you have to tell me. You said something before about using me as bait…why don't we do that? We know he's here, we know he wants to get to us both, we can use that—\" \"No,\" he cut her off. His eyes strayed to the white patch just visible through the collar of her shirt. \"No, I don't want to take that risk.\" She sighed, frustrated. It was getting painfully obvious that Vincent had feelings for her…why couldn't he just tell her? Was it because he was sure that she didn't have any for him? She doubted that…it was becoming painfully obvious to her as well that she was giving in to his influence, she was becoming used to his presence, becoming relaxed, even trusting. He wasn't stupid; he had to know about his power over her. \"We can't just do nothing!\" she cried, flinging out her arms. He tried to go around her, turning away, but suddenly impulse seized hold of her and she grabbed his arm, yanking him back. He turned his head back to her, surprised. \"Vincent, dammit! We're not going anywhere, we're just running around in circles, I can't stand it and I know you can't stand it either!\" She suddenly gritted her teeth and glared up at him. \"I want him too, you know! That monster murdered my father and I want some payback! Go ahead and use me, I trust you!\" The words were out of her mouth before she realized them. He seemed to stop, looking down at her, his expression unreadable. Then, very softly, he said, \"Revenge isn't your style, Callie.\" \"Why not? He deserves it,\" she growled. \"I'm not afraid, Vincent.\" \"Well, I am.\" If he had been someone else, he might have clamped his hand over his mouth as soon as those treacherous words escaped. Because he was afraid – he was terrified. Rochester was going to torture her and kill her slowly and he wasn't going to be able to stop him. He had become weak and stupid, and he couldn't think clearly. She took a half-step back, her face gone slack with astonishment. \"Huh,\" she said faintly. \"Didn't expect you to say that. Expected you to say that I should be—\" \"You should ,\" he snapped, angry at himself, and at her. He tried to turn away again, but she had both hands on his arm now and was digging in. He wanted to shake her off, but couldn't find it in himself to fling her away. He turned, opening his mouth to muster up something scathing to her, something that would get her off him, something that would hurt just enough – And instead found her mouth pressed against his. At first he was too shocked to react. Then he wound both arms around her and squeezed her to him until there was no space between them. Callie gasped as the air was pushed from her lungs, but it didn't stop her from kissing him again, her hands going into his hair, her arms around his neck, strangling him. He could have died happy. No, this was too much. She was emotional, she was grieving, and she wasn't behaving like herself. It was…well, it was wrong. He couldn't take advantage of her like this, even though she had initiated it, she had given him permission to break his promise. He managed to get his hands on her upper arms and put just a half-inch of room between them, almost creating a suction noise as their lips finally parted. \"Callie,\" he said, his voice smoky. \"Callie, wait…you shouldn't…you have to be sure.\" He looked at her, eyes burning. God, he wanted her so badly, it would be the hardest thing he'd ever do in his life, pushing her away. She looked up at him. It was painful, to suddenly want him like this. To know it was her only chance. Her mind, her morals screamed at her to walk away, told her it was wrong, and she knew it was wrong, all through and through. She chose. She chose not to stop. She convinced herself that it was her only chance, the only time in her life she'd ever get this, and if she didn't do it the regret would drive her mad. She was wrong. But she still chose. 8888888888888888888888 Jackson: Well, that brings a whole knew meaning to the expression \"bite me,\" doesn't it? Vincent: Wait…where is the sex? Me: Sorry. No sex. Vincent: What, we didn't have sex? How could we not have had sex? Me: Yes, you had sex. No, I'm not showing it. Vincent: Oh, you mean you're not showing it in this chapter. But it'll be in the next chapter, right? Me: No, it won't. I'd get carried away and I'm not taking the risk. I'm trying to be less sexually graphic in my writing. I'm trying to be a good girl. ( Both Vincent and Jackson give her very pointed looks .) Me: Well I am! If it makes you feel any better Vincent, I've seen it in my head and it was very cute and very naughty and…well, I'm not taking responsibility for anyone else's imagination but mine. Vincent: The fangirls are going to be pretty pissed at you. Me: Sorry. Not happening. I think it's better this way, anyway. Jackson: How so? Me: I don't know. It just is.[Chapter 17] Chapter Seventeen – In Praise Of The Vulnerable Man (from the song by Alanis Morisette) \"We managed to lift a set of prints off that file,\" Ray said as he came back to his desk. Laurie looked up from the seat he had occupied across from it, expectant. \"That didn't match you, me or Bill, at any rate. Bill was pretty sure nobody else touched them, not any of the officers, nobody. So we're doing the rounds. It could take a while.\" He ran both hands through his hair. Laurie had to suppress a grin – it was his father's habit. Had been, anyway. \"Bill is with the sketch artist,\" Laurie told him, shaking himself from the threat of an emotional relapse. \"Rippner is our only human link but he's a weak one. We'll have more luck tracking the flight from LAX.\" \"We're working on the warrants,\" Ray said wearily. \"You'd think with 9-11 we'd have easier access to that crap but whoever owned that jet must have the kind of diplomatic pull that comes with presidents and oil tycoons.\" \"Even more reason to put pressure there,\" Laurie said, flipping a page idly. \"Why do you keep reading that?\" Ray asked, grumpy. \"Trying to figure out why Vincent would want to protect Callie,\" Laurie said simply. \"And what good is that going to do us? Is it going to help us find her?\" \"Dr. Gregg has his reasons,\" Lupe said just over his shoulder, setting down a four-square container holding four steaming cups of caffeinated liquid. \"Usually, yes,\" Laurie agreed. \"This is simply a matter of knowing your opponent.\" Ray reached for the container marked \"triple espresso\" and tried not to roll his eyes. He wasn't up for a squabble with a couple of shrinks, even if one of them was extremely hot – and knew how many creams and sugars he took in his coffee. \"I was talking to Bill,\" Lupe said, sitting down in a chair she pulled up from a nearby desk. \"We have to consider the possibility that he's right. That sending Callie with…well, it might not have been the worst idea.\" Ray looked at her like she was insane. Laurie arched an eyebrow. \"A bit of a jump, don't you think, Dr. Martinez?\" he asked. \"Well,\" Lupe said, spreading her hands, \"from what I know of the whole situation, and am not at liberty to discuss due to doctor patient confidentiality, Vincent is very efficient. He sets a goal and achieves it, regardless of the obstacles. His goal was not to kill her; that much is obvious.\" \"I am so sick of people suggesting that this sick fuck has feelings for my sister,\" Ray said, the outrage roiling behind his voice as much as he struggled to keep it subdued. Laurie sighed. \"Ray, you of all people should understand, as a cop, that people are not black and white. Vincent didn't just step out of a factory, ready made. He's not a machine, he's a human being, and therefore as complex as any human being. How do you think meat-eater assassins become like they do? You don't disregard human lives unless first your own life has been disregarded.\" \"Not in all cases,\" Lupe said. \"Tell that to Ted Bundy.\" \"Right, but he was a serial killer,\" Laurie pointed out. \"Serial killers don't become assassins. They don't stick to other people's schedules. They kill for their own needs and pleasures. Vincent kills for money. That's a different breed. Those kinds of men come from backgrounds that are breeding grounds of abuse and perversity. Ray,\" Laurie said, leaning forward and lifting up a particularly old document, yellowed with age, containing a police report, \"imagine, for just a second, if you had spent every day of your life until the age of twelve getting knocked around by your dad. Just consider it, for a second. What kind of man would you have turned out to be?\" Ray didn't answer. \"His mother died in childbirth. Those kinds of things happened. So he had no maternal connection. There was a grandmother who helped take care of him in infancy but she broke a hip and died of pneumonia when he was three. Her health wasn't great even before that, and there were complaints from the neighbors of listening to the baby cry for five hours on end, one report of negligence that almost resulted in him being removed to foster care when he was found with his diaper leaking all over the floor. So think of it – an infant, completely and utterly dependent and helpless, left in the care of someone who despised him. No nurturing, no love shown, not even the basic needs met. The grandmother dies, he's just old enough to start feeding himself, but he's malnourished, he's prone to violent outbursts, he's dressed strange when he goes to school, he can't relate to any of the children in the class, the teachers think he's just a trouble maker…he had every single card stacked against him. And then let's make it worse – let's add beatings that get him periodically removed from his home and put into foster care. Sometimes group homes, sometimes a couple in need of the extra cash. As soon as he can become independent, after eighteen years of being mal-adjusted to society, he joins the military. There, his violent tendencies are a plus, not a minus. He gets himself under control, bends to military discipline because it suits him. For the first time, he becomes accepted. Now, this was in the days of the cold war, so he could have applied for all kinds of fields – and which one appeals to him the most? The kind that harms other human beings. It's the only therapy he has. Then the cold war ends, and he's cut loose, back into society. He has absolutely no people skills, no personal ties. So he uses what connections he has and starts playing for the other side of the board. The pay is better.\" \"This kind of man would have massive problems with authority,\" Lupe said thoughtfully. Laurie shook his head. \"He would have problems with parental authority,\" he corrected. \"In the military, he would learn to bend to authority and then take his aggression out in his work. He would get used to taking orders. He would prefer it. He's incapable of knowing how a normal human being functions. He has no connection to society at all. We're raised to get jobs, have families, have a life. What kind of life does he know how to have? In the military, everything is routine. He doesn't have to think, just obey, and he's rewarded. Simple, like a pet. It's probably the happiest he ever was in his life.\" Laurie rubbed his hand over his eyes. \"God, it makes sense. It makes so much sense.\" \"What makes sense?\" Ray asked, frustrated. \"He went to your father's house that night,\" Laurie said. \"He saw her, Callie, with your dad. He saw how the normal deal was supposed to work. He'd probably glimpsed it half a dozen times but maybe he'd just never been inside it before. Mid-life crisis, whatever you want to call it, has hold of him, making him ask himself what his life could have been like, and then he sees this. He missteps. He starts questioning himself. This guy never questioned himself before, it throws him off. He starts to have emotions he can't place or even understand, and they're surrounding Callie. Everything connects to her. So he doesn't kill her. He is incapable of harming her. She is the last shred of humanity left in him.\" \"Think you're being a little dramatic?\" Lupe asked, a touch worried. \"Then why did Vincent murder—\" Ray started, but Laurie cut him off. \"He didn't, pure and simple. You go look at those pictures Bill brought us again and you'll see it was Rochester, not him. Vincent wouldn't have harmed your father, wouldn't have touched a hair on his head. He was the kind of father Vincent wished he had. Attaching himself to Callie attaches him to the kind of life he wants, or wished he could have had, as well. By extension, it makes her family his.\" Ray looked pale. \"So if this is all true, what you say…what makes you think he's going to let Callie go? What if he just decides to…keep her?\" All three of them fell silent for a long minute. \"We can't get Callie back until the threat of this Rochester guy is eliminated,\" Laurie finally said. \"So we have to find out where Vincent took her.\" \"And then what?\" Ray asked. \"Wait until they have their big movie-climax-showdown and then swoop in and take her back?\" \"Something a little less dramatic, and a lot less pleasant,\" Laurie suggested. \"Ray, by extension, you're a part of his new family, too. You're Callie's brother. I doubt he would hurt you.\" \"Sorry I can't say the same.\" \"No, wait, Ray,\" Lupe said. \"I think I see where this is going. You might be able to get Callie back if you play along.\" \"Play along?\" Ray was fuming. \"Play with this sick game?\" \"Well, you'll certainly do smashingly well with that attitude,\" Laurie returned sarcastically. \"And besides, all of this might turn out to be complete hogwash,\" Ray said, standing up. \"You have no way of knowing—\" \"Ray, why do you think I run an institute for the criminally insane?\" Laurie remarked. \"Because I have a good beside manner? No, because I can read people. I know their stories and I look at them as human beings, not as monsters and not as madmen. There's a pattern in everyone's life. Break the pattern and you break the person. Either for good or ill. It can free them or damn them. And I'm telling you that you have to put aside your personal feelings for this man if you ever want to get your sister back.\" Ray stared at him for a long moment, made a noise of disgust, grabbed up his triple espresso and walked away. \"That went well,\" Lupe commented. Laurie didn't respond. 8888888888888888888 Sometime as the sun was slowly turning the far horizon into a blur of blue, Callie slipped out of Vincent's arms and half walked, half limped to the bathroom. She turned on the shower and sat down in the stall, letting the hot and cold water mix around her, easing some of the ache away. Vincent was asleep. More soundly asleep than she would have thought. She had pegged him as a light sleeper, but after the night's exertions, she really wasn't surprised. Against the cool glass of the shower stall, her bandage rested, undisturbed. With everything they had done, she expected it to be hanging off her, but Vincent had been careful around it. She reached up, yanking at some of the white tape. She was curious, for some odd reason. But she couldn't see it very well, so as soon as she had pulled one strip off she gave up. It was an excuse. An excuse not to think. She reached out and cupped some water in her hand and splashed it onto her thighs, rubbing away the residue that resided between them. She hadn't known that sex was such a messy thing. The movies never showed you that part. She sighed, pulling her knees up and resting her elbows against them, face in her hands. It was comforting, sitting here among the running water. It was like a shield around her. When she was younger, she had always taken too long in the shower, her mother and later on her father pounding on the door for her to get out, people needed to use the bathroom. They didn't understand that it was her safe place. Here, among the cool tiles and the silver faucets, and the particular way sound echoed, she felt safe. She was in the awkward stage of knowing she had done something very, very wrong, but was unable yet to regret it. Still, her rationalizing mind told her that when this was over, and she never saw Vincent again, this time would be the source of good memories, as opposed to the awful ones of that night. She was reaching, and she knew it. Logic told her that she would regret it – oh, how she would regret this night! It would bring her nothing but pain and heartache, because there was no future with Vincent. And sex was just an excuse, letting the body have at when the mind couldn't process. Vincent couldn't tell her how he felt, couldn't communicate intimately with her, so instead he made love to her. It was a cop-out. And in the end, it would lead to a dead-end road where they would part ways. For good. Still…everyone had told her that sex was great, but it wasn't what the movies and the pornos wanted you think it was. It felt great, but it was temporary. It was never as satisfying as it promised to be, when it was just used as a physical exercise. Her father had once told her, though, that when a man and a woman shared their first time, it was like they were going on a journey together, and it made it so much more than just animal pleasure. But Vincent…images flashed through her, sending peculiar tremors through her. He had been everything her darkest imagination had wanted. There were probably a hundred more things he would do if she asked him. She shook the thoughts away. It would do no good. These things would haunt her until she died, she didn't have to start now. There was a knock on the bathroom door, jarring her from her thoughts. She had locked the door behind her, wanting privacy – otherwise, she had no doubt Vincent would have just entered. There were no boundaries anymore, she could sense it. She considered ignoring it. She didn't want to see him right now, she wanted to be left alone, she wanted to think and figure out what she was going to do, she wanted to get her head straight --- The knocking got louder. \"Callie? I have to take a piss.\" She sighed, pulled herself up and turned off the water. She grabbed one of the towels and wrapped it around herself, and pulled the bathroom door open. Vincent stood there, naked as she had been, looking confused. \"You all right?\" he asked. She was standing to the side, so as not to be in his way, almost behind the door. \"Yeah. Come on. You gotta go.\" He looked at her as he passed, perplexed. Approaching the toilet, he lifted up the lid, and Callie slipped out. Hastily, she dried herself off, and pulled out the sleep shorts and shirt she had bought earlier, slipping them on. Then she sat down in the chair with the long seat for her legs, and waited. She couldn't bear to get back in that bed. And he was going to see that she was dressed, but she could also no longer bear to be naked. It was going to provoke a conversation – hell, probably a fight. He wouldn't understand. Men generally didn't. 888888888888888888 Vincent emerged from the bathroom to find Callie clothed and sitting in that recliner chair that had too long of a seat. He paused, and then sighed. This was why he didn't have relationships. The talking, always the talking. The sharing of the feelings, the sorting out of the cues. He didn't have the head or heart for those things. But Callie…Callie made him. She made him want to. She made him stop and think and be bemused. She made him nuts and a perverse part of him liked it. He sat down on the corner of the bed closest to her. What kind of insanity was it that made a person want to be unhappy? Because the thought of just ignoring her and going back to bed, which had its appeal, seemed like a betrayal. He was compelled to stop, compelled to ask her: \"What is it?\" She didn't answer. That was worse than anything. Peter had once told him the only thing more dangerous than a scorned woman was a silent woman. He did the only thing he could think to do. He asked what no man should ever ask. \"Did I do something wrong?\" She looked at him, in the dark. There were no lamps; he could only see the outside light reflecting in her eyes. He said, \"Because I can't imagine what I could have done between coitus and getting up to pee.\" Sarcasm now. He saw her smirk. He wasn't sure that was a good sign. \"You didn't do anything, Vincent,\" she said, and the tone of her voice was worse, oh so much worse than he had anticipated. It was…detached. Like he used to be. \"You're fine.\" He hesitated. \"So…are you coming back to bed?\" \"No.\" So simple, so final. It made him jerk his head back. \"All right, look, you're going to have to be a bit more thorough in explaining this to me. Like I said, if I did something wrong, just tell me, all right? Don't leave me hanging, Callie, I can't take that sort of thing.\" When did he get so honest? Why were the thoughts in his head finding their way to his mouth so easily when he was in her presence? Having sex with her had changed something, had caused his wiring to go funny. He was being…intimate. The thought almost made him shudder. \"You didn't do anything wrong,\" she said. \"No more than I did anyway. And it isn't your fault, you can't help it.\" He stood up. \"What is that supposed to mean?\" he asked, coming closer to her. To his surprise, she blushed and covered her eyes, shielding her sight from him. \"God, Vincent, please put on some shorts.\" \"Why?\" he demanded. He put his hands on his hips, enjoying her discomfort. It felt a lot better than not knowing what the hell was going on. \"You didn't mind before.\" \"That was before,\" she said, turning away. \"Adults usually have these kind of conversations clothed. Okay? Please, just humor me.\" Grumbling, he turned away and found his shorts. He sat down on the bed to pull them on, muttering under his breath. \"Why are you mad at me?\" he blurted, arms extended, elbows on his knees. \"What did I do?\" \"I told you that you didn't—\" \"Don't say that again, Callie,\" he said, getting angry. \"It's not true and you know it. Whether I meant to do anything or not, I did something and you're unhappy.\" She stared at him. \"When did you get like this?\" she said. \"Like what?\" \"Like Mr.-You-better-share-your-feelings-or-else. Vincent, I'm not mad at you . I'm mad at myself .\" He slapped his thighs. \"That's great,\" he said scornfully. \"That's so much better. So what did you do, then, that you're mad at yourself?\" She sighed again, lolling her head back against the headrest of the chair. \"God, Vincent, I can't explain it to you!\" \"Why not?\" \"Because…because it isn't the kind of thing that you can explain to a person!\" \"You're regretting having sex with me,\" he said. \"There, explained. What was so difficult about that?\" She stood up, feeling a surge of real anger toward him. \"God, you are the most difficult man on this planet! Not everything is black and white!\" She stomped away from him, toward the other end of the room, where the television sat in the large entertainment center and the dresser extended almost half the length of the room. He arched an eyebrow. Funny, he had wanted to say something very similar to her. \"Exactly how am I being difficult? I actually thought I was being rather simple. You…\" he trailed off, waving his hand. He didn't know how to say it. She regretted him. Fine, he understood. Why shouldn't she? He was poison to everyone. He had killed his mother coming out of her. He had ruined his father's life and then taken it away after his father returned the favor. He had kept everything and everyone at arm's length for his entire life, not for their sake but for his. Because getting too close, they would see – they would see the thing that he was, which even he was getting used to seeing when he looked in the mirror. He was worse than a monster. He was less than human. He was Vincent. His silence had thrown her off. He realized she hadn't responded to his comment, and when he blinked in surprise, he felt that his eyes were moist. More moist than they usually were. Oh hell. \"You're right,\" he said, his voice dead. \"You're right, it was a mistake. This whole thing was a mistake.\" She drew a heavy, shaking breath. Was she crying too? Suddenly she was in front of him, kneeling at his feet. Her hands grasped his knees, a bit too high for him to be comfortable. \"Not for the reasons you think,\" she said, shaking her head. \"This…this isn't me. You know I was a virgin. I don't believe in doing these things but I let myself get carried away. And you didn't…you're not the reason. We are the reason, you and I. You have a life completely…there just isn't any common ground between us, Vincent, except for these feelings you and I have, which don't make any sense. This whole situation is doomed.\" \"Because I'm a contract killer,\" he said. \"That's why, because of a job?\" \"It's a job to you,\" she said, with a slow shake of her head. \"That's the problem, Vincent. How can human life be just a job? You've…you've killed so many people and you don't feel anything about it. But I do, that's a difference between us that we can't work out. It's not like we're arguing on whose career comes first or where we'll live or how many kids we'll have. The basic fundamental difference between us is that I respect human life because its life , and you don't.\" He was staring at her, listening. He was trying to make sense of her words. \"I could…I could change.\" She felt like she was holding her breath. It was the closest he'd probably every come to making a declaration of his feelings for her, but she knew it was coming from a heart that had too many scars, a soul too battered and lost to find its way out of the dark. She felt a terrible sorrow, and put her arms around his neck, feeling a powerful urge to cry. Couldn't everyone be saved? She had always believed that. It was one of the reasons she had gone into the field she'd chosen. To help others find their way out of the dark. But what did she know? She was as lost as any of them. \"I can't be your reason,\" she said, her voice quivering. \"I'm not enough, Vincent.\" I'm not God . Slowly, hesitantly, he raised one arm and looped it around her back. This was…wrong. To be vulnerable like this felt so wrong. He closed his eyes, feeling exhausted. He couldn't take…being around her anymore. It confused and befuddled him too much. And the only way away from her was to bring this mess to a head. Abruptly, he pulled her away from him, turning from her. It was wrong, it was all wrong. This had gotten too far out of hand. \"Fine,\" he said, his voice rough. \"Fine…we're making too much of this anyway, Callie. Don't feel obligated to me, you shouldn't. I mean, it's one night. It's not a big deal.\" He stood up, walked away. Callie wanted to shout at him that that wasn't true – it wasn't one night. If she had really believed that all Vincent had wanted from her was a night of sex, she wouldn't feel this way. If she believed that it was just a one night stand, no strings, no complications, no obligations, she would have just blamed herself for being weak and moved on. But the things he'd said to her…while they were together, entwined as closely as two human being could be. The things he'd whispered to her, the things she saw in his eyes, felt in his body…no, he was defending himself now, shutting her out. It had all gone wrong, she had messed up, taken a mistake and made it worse. Put salt in a gaping wound. But she said nothing. The conversation was over. She couldn't fix it, not right now. Maybe another time. She prayed for another time, even though she didn't think she had any right praying at this moment. \"Take the bed,\" he said, going to the closet and pulling on some clothes. \"Vincent, I don't want—\" \"Take the damn bed, Callie,\" he said, cutting off her protest in a voice that forbid her from objecting again. \"It's okay.\" \"What are you going to do?\" she ventured after a long, stretching moment. He sat down in the seat she had occupied. \"I'm going to think,\" he said simply. \"Figure out a way through this. Go on, get a bit more sleep. You need it.\" His tone was so dry. Callie sighed, feeling more empty than before. She crawled up toward where the comforter had been twisted and kicked down, and finished knocking it from the bed. She managed to pull back a sheet and get under it. To her enormous surprise, she was asleep only a few minutes after she put her head to her pillow.[Chapter 18] Chapter Eighteen: Ready Steady Go Laurie's vision was getting blurry. The button for the elevator seemed to develop a twin as he tried to press it. He hadn't slept in over twenty-four hours. That had to be some kind of personal record. Even in medical school, he had always managed to collapse for at least an hour or two a night. But every time he shut his eyes he just kept seeing Callie's face. \"Dr. Gregg.\" Recognizing Ray's voice, he did not turn around. He had worked with his father a long time ago, in a building very similar to this one. He was used to the detectives not liking what he had to say. Nobody wanted to empathize with criminals. Nobody wanted to feel sorry for them and think about the horrible lives they had lived that drove them to crime. He was a bleeding liberal. He knew it. Still, it had led him to success and he wasn't one to second guess success. \"I'm going to try and catch a few hours sleep,\" Laurie told him as he reached his side. \"I probably won't get it but I'm going to try.\" Ray nodded. \"You know, what you said before. About guys like this Vincent being created by abuse—\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, before I was undercover, my first assignment was homicide. We caught a guy – he was a contract killer for the mob. Perfectly normal suburban family. Parents loved him. Had a good childhood. He got into the killing business because he wanted to be respected and feared. He was the coolest sociopath I'd ever had the displeasure of meeting. Hated anybody and anything that was more affluent than him. Which meant he hated a lot.\" Laurie raised an eyebrow, expecting the point. Ray went on. \"Another guy, a hit man, we grabbed him on sheer luck. This guy was connected. His lawyers managed to fuck the case so we couldn't make anything stick but he had a wife, a family. Two kids, the whole picture. Was never smacked around a day in his life. Doctors diagnosed him as having a multiple personality disorder. Was never caught or treated because the other personality kept itself so perfectly secret. That was one for the books.\" Laurie looked at him, patiently. \"My point,\" Ray finally said, \"is that not everybody who does terrible things does them because they're acting out some deep-set childhood trauma. Not all monsters are made monsters. Some are just born them. Some people are just plain evil.\" Laurie nodded. \"True. They are. There are all kinds of reasons people do the things they do. But this one,\" he said, meaning Vincent, \"this one I know better. This one has your sister not because he wants to harm her, but because he can't hurt her.\" Ray met his eyes levelly for a long moment. Then he said, \"Whatever I have to do to get my sister back, I'll do it.\" Laurie nodded. He didn't feel bleary anymore. \"I think I have a few ideas.\" 8888888888888888888888888 Callie had slept deeper than she realized. When she woke up, she was aware of something…no, someone…pressed against her back. Curled around her, intimately. Warm, firm…dammit, it had to be Vincent. Apparently, he had had some second thoughts since their previous conversation. She didn't move for several long moments. She couldn't be angry at him. It was her fault. If she hadn't initiated it, nothing would ever have happened. He made a promise and he had been keeping it. She was the one who blew it. Could she expect him to flip on and off like a lightswitch? She couldn't even ask that of herself, because…well, it felt nice. His hand was on her hip, moving slowly back and forth up her ribcage and then down again. His fingers danced, making circles and other patterns through her bedclothes. She was touched than he was still feeling playful, even after all their talking. She was sure, when he'd told her to take the bed, that he was very hurt. As much as he could acknowledge being hurt, and even then that couldn't be much. She had read his file in the office, the one Ray had brought to her. She remembered the records from his childhood, the neglect and abuse he'd suffered from his father. She couldn't image being just a baby, an innocent, blank-slate-of-a-baby, and having your closest living relation loathing your existence. It broke her heart to think about it. His strokes were getting a bit more…sexual, now. He had dipped under her nightshirt and was slowly pushing down the waist band of her shorts. He leaned over, and nuzzled his face into the crook of her neck. \"Vincent,\" she said, turning just a little. \"We can't—\" \"I'm not Vincent.\" The words stopped her cold, and she realized that the hair that was in her peripheral vision was dark, not gray. The facial hair that scratched her skin was fuller and softer, not Vincent's perpetual salt-and-pepper shadow. And with a great jerk of her muscles, she tried to turn, but he grabbed her hard, throwing one leg around hers, imprisoning them, and one hand curling up from below to clamp around her neck. Rochester. She opened her mouth to scream. She got out a good start of it, but he was fast. Something was suddenly stuffed between her jaws, and she gagged to realize it was a wet hand towel. \"I know what you're thinking,\" he said, casually, yanking her back and pressing against her, rubbing his hips suggestively against her backside. \"Haven't we done this before? Certainly. Isn't it getting a little old? Yes. Which is why I'm afraid you probably won't ever be getting out of this bed again, Callie. I've done a lot more than thrown the deadbolt – those things can be jimmied. I've got the entire door braced that will keep your new lover from coming to the rescue.\" He seemed to fold around her like a human blanket. His leg wrapped around her thighs made any kicking she did with her lower legs useless. She squeaked and gargled through the gag but he seemed to respond with arousal to her outrage. \"You dirty little bitch,\" he said in a nearly affectionate tone. She winced as she felt his hand slip under her nightshirt and grasp her breast. The worst of it was, he wasn't being crass about it – his fingers started to play with the object and stupidly it responded, a dog panting eagerly for a stranger who showed it kindness. She gave a little jerk but she could feel his amusement rumble against her back in a chuckle. \"What, I thought bad boys turned you on, sugar! You certainly seemed to get all wet for a former assassin who held you hostage.\" She almost choked on the gag. The thought that this creep was aware of the previous night made her sick. Worse, had he been listening in? What disgusting things had he been doing while--? Alarm suddenly spread through her when his hand left her breast and dipped down, going to the waistband of her shorts. He'd already pushed them down by a few inches and her naked hip was exposed to his touch. Still, he seemed intent on going farther. She gave a jerk, trying to shake him off. He laughed. \"You know, I had you pegged for liking the rough stuff, but you're just like any other girl. Seems its Vincent who's gone soft. I'll bet he was even gentle with you without asking.\" He had his hand under the waistband now. She gave a strangled cry of distress. \"Well, I can be gentle too, baby. I can take it slow. As slow as you like.\" She suddenly realized that his other hand was grasping tighter around the cords of her neck, and it was getting harder to breathe. \"Or maybe you're bored with that trite bullshit and would like something a little more… raw.\" Callie closed her eyes, desperately trying to think. She didn't have any access to weapons, her body was completely imprisoned. The only kind of escape she could muster was a mental one. Laurie's voice was clear in her mind. Men like Rochester got their rocks off by inducing fear and panic in their victims. The struggle was the payoff – the harder the fight, the sweeter the victory. He wanted her to fight him – he wanted her to kick back. Sure, he would hurt her worse; break her down into little pieces. But that was the point. There was no use in breaking something already broken. Suddenly, she made herself go limp. She even fought against the instinctive self-preservational force that made her fight for air against his grip. She had been in this half-dead state before – she had gone into shock right after Vincent had shot Annie. She just had to get her head into the right place--- He let go of her neck. Apparently, he thought she'd fainted from lack of air, but as he pulled her closer to him, he quickly reassured himself that he hadn't squeezed that hard. She made her eyes go blank, staring into nothing. He jerked her and her head lolled on her neck, a broken doll. He pulled himself up on his arm and she was almost under him now, and he stared down at her, into her face. She saw flickers of anger but ignored them. She couldn't show anything, not a single flash of emotion. If she didn't care what he did to her, it would piss him off. And an angry man was a man who made mistakes. Sure enough, the hand came down and whacked her hard across the jaw, causing her head to turn into the sheets. She didn't flop back up, and he had to pull her back to face him. He was starting to show his irritation now, his lips twitching, his eyes glinting. \"Going to make this unpleasant for both of us, yes?\" he said in a clipped tone, and then, to her internal horror, he smiled. \"Guess I'll just have to hurt you more.\" He slapped her again. This one sent a trickle of blood down her nose and across her cheek. And the pain sent a flash of something through her head. A picture. A picture of a gun. A picture of a gun stuffed into the mattress just below her. 88888888888888888888 Vincent sat up on the lounger with a bit of a start. He had fallen asleep harder than he realized. It must have been all the activity. And the emotional strain. He wasn't used to that sort of encounter from before, so logic only dictated that it would take itself out on him physically. He'd been dreaming. It was a dream he hadn't had in a very long time. He was a child, and he was locked on a room. It was dark, nobody was home, he was alone. He was hungry and there was another, unpleasant sensation, not like pain, but definitely upsetting. He was calling and calling, but nobody came. He was trapped there, forgotten, alone. It quickly faded. It always faded when he'd had it during his youth. He never expected to have it again. His heart was beating too rapidly in his chest and he had to sit there a moment to catch his breath. Sweat dripped down his temples and down into the palm of his hand, pooling on his skin. He considered it while he forced his body to relax. He had always had complete control of his physical reactions. Most of them. Callie had done this to him. An irrational anger flamed through him. She slept, as heavily as he had a few moments ago, and her snores were soft and rumbling. In the bed, where they had been together. They had been together and now they were apart. She had undone him. He knew this, had been telling himself this for several days, but the full impact was now becoming very apparent to him. This could mean his life. This could mean the end of the world as he knew it. Before, that hadn't sounded so bad. His world hadn't interested him for a while now. His life was devoid of meaning, of purpose. Why did he care if he lost it? Death had never scared him so much. It was only the knowledge that when he died, nobody would have known that he had existed. Nobody would have cared. She cared. Or at least she was supposed to care. That gave him…hope. But still, forever the wedge. Forever the distance and the strain. She wouldn't be with him. The cost was too high. For him as well. And yet he still wanted. Irrationally wanted. The anger flamed higher. He stood, pulling with him the Glock he kept secured under the cushion. He always slept with a gun within arm's reach. He moved it without thinking if he ever changed sleeping places. Before it had been under the bed mattress. He'd gotten these off Peter's boat and packed them into his luggage. There was another, still secured under his socks and underwear, loaded. He had never needed more than one gun, but he'd taken two. He realized now he'd meant to give it to Callie. She was a good shot. He remembered the pictures, the confidence in her stance. Sure, her skill was probably stemming from fear of him , of the consequences of their previous encounter, but he doubted that now things had changed between them that she had lost that skill. Rochester would be enough to keep it sharp. He sighed. Too complicated. He needed simple. And he was still angry, he realized. He was angry at her. Delayed reaction. This anger should have come sooner, but instead he'd gone with groveling. It felt…humiliating, in retrospect. Begging her. He did not beg anyone. Now it was too late, but he couldn't shake it. He paced, his bare feet silent against the thick carpet. He wanted to wake her up, but knew it was pointless. He'd just be feeding the beast. Making things more complicated. Besides, they had already exchanged all the necessary words. This had to end. He had said as much before. The only way to end it was to bring Rochester out into the open. And the only way to do that… Vincent sighed again. He didn't want to do it. But not doing it was only making things worse. He was delaying the inevitable. He went to his suitcase and pulled out the extra Glock. He pressed a fully loaded clip into it and cocked the gun, putting one bullet in the chamber. Then he walked over to the bed. \"Callie,\" he said, tapping her shoulder. She stirred, but didn't wake. She would be groggy when she woke. Maybe she wouldn't understand him. Still, something would not let him let it go. \"Callie,\" he said, leaning down into her face. He shook her until her eyes opened, but he could tell by the dilation of her pupils that she was not awake, merely reacting to him. Maybe she would remember. Stress sometimes did miraculous things to people. \"I'm putting this gun –\" he showed it to her, saw her eyes flicker, but nothing else, \"—under the mattress.\" He reached below and shoved the gun deep under, until it was almost directly below her, on her side of the bed. Rochester wouldn't stumble upon it. She nodded, hummed an affirmative, and then went back to sleep, snoring again in seconds. Vincent turned to the closet and pulled out the pale gray Armani suit he had also gotten from Peter's yacht. It was very similar to the one he'd worn the night he met Callie. He got dressed and left the hotel room. 8888888888888888888 It took everything in her not to kick against Rochester as his hands pressed against her windpipe. She told herself, over and over in her head, that he wasn't going to kill her. She hadn't suffered enough. He hadn't played with her enough. She would pass out, he would let go, and she would revive. It was hard to hang onto those thoughts. The world started to grow blurry and then glow with a thousand dots of light. She vaguely heard him start swearing at her – he had been sure, she knew, that choking her would get her to react. At least get her kicking. More slapping. His hands pulled away from her throat as he viciously dragged her back to consciousness. The force of the blows knocked the gag from her mouth. Her cheek was streaked with blood from her nose, now possibly in the shape of his handprint. He grabbed her face, squeezing her cheeks together, making her lips pucker out. Her mind briefly flashed to the encounter at St. Anthony's in the closet, with Vincent. In spite of herself, she gave a twitch. He smiled at her. Then, of all the disgusting things, his tongue was suddenly against her cheek, lapping up the blood. Then he was kissing her, that same tongue shoving into her mouth, and the taste of her own blood made her retch. Against, she gave a twitch. He had to throw her off the bed. She had to make him so angry that he would toss her off the side. But how? There was no way to predict the actions of this man. His tongue slid around her mouth, the tip tracing her teeth before he plunged further, triggering her gag reflex. She considered biting down, but found that her fear stood in her way. If she really hurt him, what would he do to her? He had already promised a hundred grizzly things. But she reminded herself that Rochester, like Vincent, was to be feared the most when he was calm. Shatter the calm, shatter the fear. Her body made the move for her. Unable to stand the intrusion any longer, her throat muscles contracted and she coughed, making her teeth rattle and bite down. He gave a squeak, pulled back and looked at her, eyes glittering. \"You sure can spoil a good time, you know that?\" She was still coughing, unable to yank it back. His weight pressed against her chest made it nearly impossible and she was going to choke again. He seemed to sense this, because he eased off and rolled her over, pressing her face down on the bed. She felt his hands on her back, slipping under her shirt, fingers spreading over flesh. His leg looped over hers again, making sure she didn't try anything. \"Don't want you to die yet, not before we've had our fun.\" \"Why now?\" she managed, once the pipes were clear for a split second. She coughed again, several more times, painful hacks that made her want to spit up. She didn't dare. He'd push her face into it. \"Why do this now? You finally run out of patience?\" \"Oh, the heart has reasons that reason cannot know,\" he sing-songed. \"But if you want to know the truth, the opportunity to torment your new lover was just too overwhelming. I'm pretty sure he's going to come pounding at that door any second now, but I've made damn sure that he won't be able to get in here. The only thing getting through that door is your screams.\" \"Fuck you.\" \"Hmmm…now we're talking.\" Callie ground her teeth. She'd let him bait her. He squirmed against her backside, one hand starting to roam freely. Fingers slithered along her curves and past her hip, resting on one of her rear cheeks. The journey was leisured. \"Don't get any silly ideas that you'll be able to get through this by closing your eyes and pretending its Vincent.\" His hand had moved up to the waistband of her shorts and was very purposefully pulling them down. The alarming sensation of air against bare skin made her shut her eyes, desperate to think of something, anything to delay this. \"I have a very definitive style.\" He buried his mouth in the hairs at the base of her neck. \"You'll be able to tell.\" A whimper lodged in her throat and she swallowed it down. \"So the plan is to rape me while Vincent listens outside?\" she asked. \"What happened to all your romantic plans? The part about it lasting for a few days?\" \"Oh, it will,\" Rochester chuckled. The shorts were past her hips now, tangled at her knees. Any second now and his hand was going to invade a place where she wouldn't be able to think clearly. \"Please,\" she snorted, forcing herself to sound calm. \"Whatever you think, I don't care if you put up a cement wall against that door, Vincent will find a way to get it down. He's smarter than you.\" He reached around, grasping her chin and pulling her head back, causing her spine to arch painfully upwards. She could almost see him if she turned her eyes all the way. In her ear, his mouth said wetly, \"If he's so smart, then why did he leave you all alone when he knew damn well I was here?\" \"Maybe it's a trap,\" she said. \"And I'm the bait.\" He laughed, the air whistling into her ear canal and causing shivers to go all down her body. \"Vincent would never use his precious Callie as bait. How stupid do you think I am?\" \"Pretty stupid,\" she said, pushing the button. \"You walked into the trap, didn't you?\" He smiled against her skin. \"If it really was a trap, Callie,\" he said, his voice much more serious, \"you never would have told me.\" \"And if it really was a trap,\" she countered, \" Vincent would never have told me .\" 88888888888888888888 Vincent paced around the lobby. It was too early in the morning, nobody was awake yet, except for the night duty clerk, who smiled at him cheerfully and wisely kept his mouth shut. Vincent picked up the newspaper, The Los Angeles Times , which always came ridiculously early, and sat down comfortably. He flipped through it, waiting patiently for The New York Times to show up. Glancing at his watch, he realized he didn't have time. He'd left the cage open long enough. If the animal hadn't wandered in by now, it wasn't going to at all. And it was a foolish plan anyway, really, when he thought about it. Too obvious. Rochester wouldn't fall for it. Then again, he'd very proudly displayed his desire to antagonize Vincent by attacking Callie at the pool. Obviously Rochester wanted him as much as he wanted her – probably more. But it was safer to do it here. Away from Callie's family… There it was again. Vincent felt irritation. He was trying to turn his skin back into steel and he just kept letting her get under it. Even the reason he was going back upstairs so soon, was because he didn't want to leave her exposed so long that Rochester could actually harm her before he got there. He was already headed for the elevator, the Times discarded on the end table. He pressed the button, and in the privacy of the mirrored car, he reached into his breast pocket for the particular tools he had brought with him from the hotel room. He hadn't been sure, while on the yacht, what he would need, but Vincent liked to be prepared for all possibilities. It was a small tool kit, no bigger than an oversized marker – magnetized screwdriver heads rattled around the bottom as he detached the base. This was an older hotel, why he'd picked it – most of the modern ones didn't have hinges outside in the hallway for exactly these kinds of reasons. The doors usually opened inward. Not this hotel. Here, the doors opened outward. Which meant the hinges were outside. Vincent did not knock. When he reached the correct room, he pressed his ear to the door. He could hear vague noises – he did not like to think about what they were. But it was obvious that Callie was not alone. She wouldn't be talking to herself, certainly not in those tones. Instead, he turned his attention to the door hinges. He reached up and felt with his fingertip the kind of screw head that held the hinges in place, and quickly put the proper tip in place on the screwdriver's base. He stretched hard – in spite of appearances, he really was not a very tall man. He was usually able to fake a few inches just by being so damn intimidating – and when push came to shove, lifts in his shoes. The tip of the screwdriver when into place, but the hinge was old and didn't want to turn. In this awkward position, it would take more time than he liked to get the door open. He couldn't get his arms positioned to use the right muscles to get it done faster. But he pushed as hard as he could anyway, until the join of his shoulder was screaming for him to stop. Vincent had long since trained his body to endure simple things like pain. He compartmentalized it, and the surge of victory he felt when the screw went loose and wobbled so that he could grasp and pull it the rest of the way with his fingers was almost worth it. The lower screw was easier, as he was pushing downward and had better leverage. Now, came the real trick. Getting the door open from the opposite way without alerting the party inside. He hadn't even attempted the lock, knowing that Rochester's ears would be attuned to listening for any small sign of his return. Getting a door to open from the opposite direction was much, much noisier business than rattling a key in a lock. Gently, delicately, and much more slowly than he wanted to, Vincent grasped the empty hinges and started to tug.[Chapter 19] Chapter Nineteen: I Love You To Death Nothing. It had only been hours, true enough, but Jackson Rippner did not exist. There was no criminal record on him in their database and nothing was getting any hits anywhere else. Ray remembered with despair that it had taken a little over two weeks to get any hits on Vincent. But Callie's trail was getting colder and two weeks would be a death sentence. \"Ray, you're going to dig a trench in my carpet.\" He looked at Laurie, and then toward Lupe. She gave him a gentle smile, and he felt the urge to go sit next to her. Being close to her was comforting. It was maddening, that this was all they could do. Laurie had told him all about Jackson Rippner's call to the hospital, and while they had checked the telephone records, it had come up to an untraceable cellular phone line – Ray had a hard time believing that there were such things, but sure enough, there was no name, nothing on the records that could even give them a hint of a trail. The airport hangar's logs were not much better. The jet they had used to smuggle Callie out of the country belonged to a company that existed only on paper. There were no names, nothing. A ghost owned that plane. It occurred to him that Vincent obviously had had help from very clever resources. The kind of resources that had enough pull to make themselves invisible. It would take weeks to get a single name from either the invisible company or the cellular phone, weeks they didn't have. Now all they had was the thin possibility that when Rippner called back, they might be able to use their fancy equipment to locate him. The line itself may be untraceable, but cellular phones still needed satellites to work, and satellites could be used to triangulate a position. It was a very long shot, and he only had himself to rely on. Laurie and Lupe were doctors, not cops. All the could do was wait, and pray. 888888888888888888888 Jackson Rippner had learned during the course of his tenure as a manager to not ask too many questions. At least, not the kind of questions that put the boss in a spot. But he had played a lot of games in his day, and this one didn't make too much sense to him. There were the facts as he had laid them out for himself. Fact: Peter had given the job of killing Calliope Fanning to both Rochester and Vincent. Fact: Vincent had decided to protect Fanning instead of kill her. Fact: Peter had assisted Vincent in this very effort. Fact: Peter had directly ordered him to aid Rochester in his mission. Fact: He had also ordered him to assist Vincent in getting the girl out of the country. Fact: Rochester knew where they were going, because Peter had told him to tell him. So he had logically followed. So what the hell was Peter doing? Playing both sides? Playing against himself? These were exactly the kind of questions he shouldn't ask. What Peter did was Peter's business. But the conversation with Rochester in the back of his cab kept playing over and over in his head. Whose side was Peter on? Could it possibly be both? His phone rang. Speak of the devil. \"Jackson.\" \"They're looking for you, you know.\" \"I figured,\" he replied to Peter's smooth baritone. \"They won't find me.\" \"There is a slim chance. You told Dr. Gregg you would call him back on his cellular phone. They could be setting up a trap. But there's a bigger problem.\" \"Which is?\" \"They've been attempting to find me using the records at the hangar in L.A.X. Even after they have Ms. Fanning back, I doubt that Detective Fanning is going to let the whole thing drop.\" \"So what do you want me to do?\" \"I want you to prepare to leave L.A. I need you in Miami. There's another job.\" \"But what about this one?\" \"Don't worry. I'll handle it. I just would hate to see Ms. Fanning lose her brother so soon after she's lost her father. But I think there's another way.\" Jackson felt the questions bubbling in his throat. He struggled with them, forcing them back. Instead, he said, \"So when do you want me to leave for Florida?\" \"There will be a package delivered to the condo in a few hours. It will contain your assignment. Study it. I'll call you when I have further instructions.\" Closer and closer. Peter sounded…unsure of himself. As if he didn't have everything planned ten steps ahead. \"Peter,\" he said, slipping. \"Yes, Jackson?\" \"What's…\" Don't say it, you'll regret it. \"What's the job?\" \"Everything is in the package.\" He could hear Peter smiling. \"Don't worry yourself, Jackson. You're better when you aren't distracted. Don't think, just do. It's what you're best at.\" And he hung up. Jackson bit his lip. This wasn't good. The suspicions that had been rumbling around in his guts were starting to manifest themselves in words. Vincent had some…hold, it seemed, on Peter. Peter was helping him, but at the same time, he was lining up Rochester to take him out. As if it were a game. Like he was playing chess against himself. Jackson felt a chill. He would go back to the condo. He would not call Dr. Gregg as planned. He would do as he was told. That was what he was best at. 8888888888888888888888888 Callie's words had caught Rochester's attention. She could almost hear the struggle -- either believe her that it was a trap, cut and run, or ignore it because it was too obviously bait and continue tormenting her as he had planned. Option B, at the moment, seemed to be in the lead, because his other hand had pushed the collar of her sleep shirt far enough over to expose her injured shoulder. He suddenly gave a hard tug on her bandage and ripped the cloth away. \"If you lived long enough,\" he told her, his voice still that low, sleek rumble of dark velvet, \"this would leave a scar. Your children would ask you if you'd been bitten by a vampire. You can already see the teeth marks.\" \"If I lived long enough,\" she sighed. \"Then again, there's also plastic surgery.\" He chuckled. \"I love how quick you are. We'll see how long it lasts, though.\" Without warning, he pulled up the shirt, and it gathered around her neck and then covered her face. He pressed down, and she was suffocating again, but worse, so much worse, was the fact that she was now very much naked. The humiliation hit her harshly, like a punch in the stomach. She wanted to curl up, try to shield herself, but he had her spread eagle. \"Mmmm…well, Vincent has better taste than I thought.\" His touched was gentle now, like a lover, and she tried to shut it out, tried to push it away. Then he grasped her to flip her over, and she couldn't stand it anymore. She grasped at the sheets, digging her hands in, pressing hard into the covers. She wasn't going to turn. She wasn't going to let him humiliate her any farther. \"Callie,\" he said with feigned patience, \"you're only going to make it worse for yourself. Come on, don't piss me off.\" She clung harder. Yes, she wanted to piss him off. Make him so mad that he shoved her so hard she would go rolling to the floor. On the floor, she had a chance. On the floor, she had the slightest possibility of getting to the gun. A sudden plan flooded her brain like a spotlight. \"Take this damn shirt off my head and I'll turn!\" He paused. Then, he made a gesture that might have been a shrug – she could only feel the vibration of the mattress, because her head was still enclosed in her stupid sleep shirt. \"Fair enough.\" He yanked and it came off, and now she wore not a stitch of clothing. She looked at him for a moment, and then threw her arms around his neck, bringing his face down to hers and kissing him passionately. It was easier than she thought it would be. Rochester was physically attractive, and if she just shut her mind off to the knowledge of what he was, if she just looked at the shell and concentrated on the shell, she could do it. She could do this. It threw him off. He was not expecting the sudden turn like this. For her to suddenly be eager for his advances only meant one thing – she was trying something. What, exactly, he couldn't imagine, but it was something. He clamped his hands around her wrists and forced her back, pinning her to the bed. It put some air between them, and for the first time Callie could see he was dressed in one of his expensive silk suits. \"What the fuck are you doing?\" \"What, you can dish it out but you can't take it?\" she asked, wiggling her body suggestively. She pulled her legs up – he had his hands on her wrists and couldn't push them away – and wrapped them around his waist, linking her ankles at the small of his back. \"Come on, baby, are you all talk and no show? Can't you get it up when a woman is willing?\" He gave her a look as if she were insane. Then, a very disturbing look came into his eyes. \"Oh, you want to play it that way, huh, dirty girl?\" He yanked her wrists, pulling her up and into him, so that she was now sitting on his lap in a very intimate position. He didn't let go of her wrists, however, but pinned them behind her back. \"I should have expected this. You did fuck Vincent. Sometimes I'm thinking you're sicker in the head than him and me combined.\" His lowered his head, and Callie fought a floodgate of sensation to keep her mind focused. She tugged at her wrists. \"You going to let me go?\" He leered up at her. \"I don't trust you that much, honey.\" She smirked down at him. \"Then how are we going to get your pants off?\" He chuckled darkly. \"Still so quick. Fair point.\" Callie gave him an equally twisted smile. She pulled back her ankles, trying to ignore the fact that this put some very private parts of hers very close to his. She was getting them under her to make it easier to leap. \"So what are we going to do about it, sugar? You can't leave me hanging all night.\" He shifted her wrists, keeping one over the other in an X, so that they were in one of his hands. He had very supple hands, muscular but with sleek, quick fingers. However, the concentration required to undo his fly took just a bit of slack out of his grip, and she was able to pull one hand free. Then, with all the energy she could muster, she slapped him hard across the jaw. He took it. The flinch from the sharp sting was a gut reaction, but as he was bouncing back, she realized with horror that he was smiling. The flinch had caused his other hand to go slack for just a second, and she pulled her other wrist free quickly, and brought it forward to slap him in the other direction, almost as much to get the smile from his face as to free herself. Then she dove. She tossed her weight over the side of the bed, grazing the blankets as she hit the carpeted floor. She got her foot into his gut and pressed, and managed to break free, getting on the floor and almost crawling clear, but she had to turn, and she knew that the second her hand went to the mattress, he would know she was going for a weapon. He was a professional, like Vincent, after all. He was very quick. On his feet, between her and the bed, now, and he was laughing. It was light, delighted laughter. It was harder to concentrate on the shell now, when the slime of a human soul that resided inside it was so clearly longing for damnation. And the fact that she was buck naked was not helping things. \"Oh Callie,\" he said, \"I could love you, I swear I could. I could love you to death.\" He reached for her, but she kicked at him, enticing more giggles. She scrambled to her feet, realizing now that her last chance lay somehow in antagonizing him enough into throwing her toward the bed. But how did one piss off a man who was this perverted? He came toward her, and she slapped him again. He grabbed at her, dragging her into him, and managed to kiss her, good and hard, before letting her go, and laughing. She slapped him again, more angrily, but while it cut off the sound it did not stop his Joker-esque smile. He rubbed his cheeks, as if savoring the sensation. \"You know, I'd forgotten that one,\" he said, more to himself than to her. \"It's one thing to let them fight, another to let them fight back.\" She struck a third time, putting all her might behind it. This one got his lip pressed against his lower canine, and a trickle of blood appeared. He licked at it, and then, with just a flicker of annoyance in his eyes, he walloped her. Hard. She rolled into it. It was easy to exaggerate because not much was required. Her head spun and her vision blurred, but she threw out her hands and grasped the edge of the mattress, and while her knees burned as they scuffed the carpeted floor, she struggled to hold onto her senses. She groaned, doubling over against the side of the bed. She couldn't let him see what she was doing. She moved her head from side to side, as if delirious. He approached, knelt down. His hands spread across her back, and she cringed at his touch. \"Enough foreplay,\" he said, his voice clipped. \"Time to get down to business.\" \"Some business,\" came Vincent's voice from behind them, and just then Callie heard several things hit the floor. It sounded like a pile of object being toppled over. One of them came flying in their direction, as if aimed, and it clipped off of Rochester's head, rolling onto the bed in front of them. Callie looked over her shoulder. Somehow, Vincent had gotten the door open, although how, she had no clue, and had knocked over what Rochester had put in front of it as a safety precaution. \"What kind of stupid hotel puts the hinges on the outside?\" Rochester snarled, and grabbed her by the shoulders, pulling her in front of him. He got his arm around her and held her flush against him, using her as a human shield. With his other hand, he reached behind him for something Callie couldn't see. Vincent had his gun drawn. He looked -- Callie lost her breath upon realizing this -- exactly as he had looked that first night. The suit was almost the same light silvery shade of grey, and there was a terrible glint in Vincent's eyes, as he had both hands on his gun, aimed right at them. \"Well, I guess the party is just going to have to start early,\" Rochester said, lightly, as if the whole thing were a casual encounter and not the worst nightmare of Callie's life. Vincent was not looking at her, however. His eyes were tight on Rochester. His mouth had curled up into his contemptuous sneer, which told her how much he was concentrating on the moment. \"You always hide behind little girls?\" Vincent taunted. Rochester laughed, full and robust. \"That's cute. Really. Like I'm going to believe for a second that the only reason I'm not dead is because I have my own personal shield.\" He pulled Callie's closer, and Callie attempted to slap at his arm with her hands, trying to distract him for even a second – Vincent was a crack shot. A second would be all he needed. But Rochester did not fall for it for even that little second. Instead, he grabbed Callie's hands and pinned them against her own chest with his arm, tightening his hold so that her feet were nearly ready to leave the carpet. She could feel his mouth against the back of her ear as he spoke. \"You're not going to risk it,\" Rochester said in a conversational tone. \"You might be able to get me in the forehead, but the chance that you'll get her instead is just too big. And you're not going to take that chance, not even for a second.\" \"I did use her as bait,\" Vincent said, deadpan. \"I'm feeling a little reckless tonight.\" \"Ha ha,\" Rochester said, bitingly. \"As if I don't know I've got the most valuable thing in Vincent's world exactly where you don't want her. Don't play me, old man, I'm too far ahead of you.\" He raised his hand and a very ugly knife came into view, a switchblade that glinted in the morning light. Callie drew in her breath as it seemed to float closer to her. \"Put it down.\" It was Vincent's turn to smile, although in his current state it was much more of a leer. \"You won't kill her. Not like that. It'd spoil your fun. And if she dies, you do to.\" \"Oh, I don't have to kill her, Vincent,\" Rochester returned coolly. \"I just have to hurt her.\" Without warning, he brought the knife up and ran it along her shoulder. The edge was so sharp she almost didn't feel it, but a few seconds later she felt a strange tickling, and then a burning as her own blood started to run down her skin. She stifled her scream – screaming would not help her. Rochester wanted her to scream and if she did, who knew what Vincent would do? He might fire, and hit her instead. He might put the gun down, and then they were both dead. \"Cute,\" Vincent said, his face getting more rigid. \"Won't work.\" \"Won't it?\" Rochester mocked. \"Right now she's trying hard not to scream. She's brave, I'll give her that.\" The knife moved again, pushing deeper, just below the first cut. This time she made a grunt before she caught herself. \"She'll break. They always break.\" Vincent's eyebrows were slowly merging together into one. \"This is between us.\" \"Oh, that lame line,\" Rochester laughed. He paused the knife, this time on the curve of her upper arm, as if he were getting ready to slice a potato. \"You're really not used to the whole talking thing, are you?\" He sliced. He sliced deep. Her screech was muffled in the back of her throat but her eyes closed and her face contorted. She looked and felt bile rise in her throat when she saw how dark and thick the blood was running, and could even see the layers of skin and fat and muscle he had cut through. Her arm trembled with shock and pain. \"If I put the gun down,\" Vincent said, \"you let her go.\" \"This isn't a negotiation,\" Rochester said, as if Vincent were a stupid child. \"You put the gun down. End of story.\" \"Why?\" Vincent asked. \"Give me a reason. What do I get out of it?\" Rochester seemed to consider this. True, men in their line of work did not negotiate. They simply did. \"I'll stop cutting her,\" Rochester said, offering a carrot. \"But I'm going to count to five, Vincent. Each number and she loses a little more blood. At five, I go for the throat.\" He moved the knife up a few inches and pressed the tip hard. \"One.\" Blood oozed out, and this time she couldn't muffle the screech enough. Callie looked at Vincent. \"Don't do it…ah…!\" \"Two.\" He had moved higher, on the curve of her shoulder, and had pulled the knife back, making a very deep gash right across the front part of the joint. Vincent seemed to be pulling back with the gun. Callie looked at his eyes, trying to read him. She didn't want him to put the gun down – it would make him…powerless. She had seen Vincent take out men, unarmed when they had their guns pointed in his face, but she had not seen this. She had not seen him truly weak. She realized, as Rochester said the word \"three,\" and sliced across her clavicle, that she had done this. She had made Vincent weak. Her sin had not only been against herself and her self-serving pleasure, she had also damaged him. The mechanism that made him so dangerous had failed him, because he was not doing what the Vincent she had first met in the back of her cab would have done. Her regret doubled, if not tripled. \"Vincent,\" she said, meaning to encourage him, meaning to tell him to let Rochester take as many chunks out of her as he wanted, but don't put down your gun! Instead, she heard herself saying, \"I'm sorry. God I'm so saaa--!\" The knife was slipping along the base of her throat, the point going into the hollow. As if he was tracing a line for her to be beheaded. Rochester was smiling against her ear. \"Four.\" Vincent turned the gun in his hand, showing it to Rochester before putting it on the carpet. \"Fine,\" he said, his voice raw, straining against panic. \"Just stop!\" The knife point had just been pressed against her jugular – she knew it because she could feel her pulse pounding against it. Then, gently, he took it away. He stepped forward, dragging Callie with him, and stepped on Vincent's gun, shoving it far behind him. She heard it hit the wall. Then, taking a step back, Rochester tossed her down, and she crumpled into a bloody heap right against the bed. Against the mattress, where Vincent had put the other gun.[Chapter 20] Disclaimer: Wish I could offer an excuse. Afraid I can't. Here's an update. I've been psyching myself up to finish this. Watching \"Knight and Day\" got me appreciating Tom Cruise again. But in the meanwhile… Chapter Twenty: I've Got All This Ringing In My Ears… Rochester looked down at Vincent, a knowing gleam in his eye. \"You know, I never thought I'd say it, but you are one sad man.\" Vincent twitched – his chin moved to the right a bit, his lips pursed just slightly, and he straightened the lapels of his jacket, then stood with his legs spread apart a little. He was irritated. To be talked down to by someone like Rochester was definitely annoying. \"I mean, you were a legend,\" Rochester said, with just a touch of awe in his voice. \"You could move faster than…well, anything I'd ever seen. You were the Flash. The evil Flash, anyway.\" Vincent did a mental inventory. He always kept a switchblade in his pocket. Rochester wasn't foolish enough to come closer – he had kicked the gun away, smart enough. And he probably was packing his own piece, just out of sight. \"I mean, what the fuck!\" Rochester gestured with both hands, down, towards Callie's naked back. She looked like she was attempting to recover a shred of her modesty. But Vincent saw her hand slip between the mattress and the box-spring. If Rochester looked over, he'd see what she was doing. \"Yes,\" Vincent said. \"I'm sorry, your point?\" \"So you fuck a girl, and now you actually care what happens to her,\" Rochester said, frustrated. \"You know, the worst part of all of this is that you're actually stupid enough to think that Peter is backing you up on your lamebrain moves.\" Vincent raised an eyebrow. \"What makes you think he isn't?\" \"How the hell do you think I even found you here? How do you think I knew exactly where you would be? How I even got into your hotel room? He set you up, Vincent! He had fucking Jackson Rippner drive your girl here to the airport! You knew perfectly well Jackson was working with me…are you really that thick?\" \"I'm not,\" Vincent said, \"but I was betting that you would be.\" Rochester laughed. \"Oh, yeah, the talk about me saying I wanted to work on my own. Please, Vincent. Nobody works on their own. He told you that to bait you.\" Coolly, Vincent raised an eyebrow. \"And you care because…why? Why tell me all of this? Unless you're trying to throw me off. That's the only reason you'd have to talk so much. We're at a stalemate, Chess, and you're stalling for time.\" Rochester's brow darkened, and he suddenly reached out and snatched Callie by the top of her hair, closest to the scalp, where it hurt the most. The knife, still wet with her blood, went to rest on the soft tissue of her left breast, just below the nipple. \"You want to see me stall?\" he said, his voice unnaturally calm. \"Let's see if she's as pretty with her tits cut off.\" Callie had the gun. She swung her arm around to press the barrel right against his ribcage. But she didn't move fast enough. Rochester looked down, saw what she was about to do, and then shoved her – more like hurled her with all his might. She went flying, the gun going off, shattering the table lamp. She collided into Vincent, who caught her in one arm and cradled her fall against his chest, but his other arm slid down hers, going to the gun and very smoothly removing it from her grip. Then, in the same fluid motion, he rolled her away from him, thrusting her almost behind him, toward the bathroom door. Rochester was already pulling out his hold-out gun, and he made a great leap so that he was on top of the mattress, going to the other side. He shoved back on the mattress as he landed on the floor, bringing it up, creating a flimsy distraction so that Vincent couldn't get a clear aim. Vincent, however, knowing Rochester was armed and not loaded with a potential casualty, grabbed Callie and headed the other direction, for the bathroom. He wanted to fire – just a few shots, one of them had a good chance of hitting – but knew that any blasts of the gun would bring security running. It was bad enough as it was – someone was going to come by and find the door removed from its hinges. So he kept going, into the bathroom. He slammed the door shut and locked it. Then he rounded on Callie and shoved her into the oversized bathtub. \"Get down,\" he said, throwing the extra towels at her. \"Get down and stay down and don't come up unless I tell you, understand?\" Callie nodded, grateful for the covering, but shaking. She should have been quicker with the gun. Hadn't Ray gone through trouble to teach her about firing in close range? Apparently it had either been too long since her last lesson, or all this trauma had knocked all her sense out of her head. She lay against the cool, dry porcelain of the tub, on her left side, not her right, and realized she was just under the faucet. She was suddenly terribly, horribly thirsty. Vincent turned back toward the door. He stood between her in the tub and the locked entrance, so tense he seemed to be humming. Callie had seen this before. It felt like it had in the alley – she didn't know what was going to happen, what he was going to do, but she knew that whatever happened, he would meet each action with an equal and opposite reaction. But truth be told, she realized as the pain and numbness – amazing how those two walked hand in hand – started to glaze over her right side, it was not the same. So far, Vincent hadn't really done anything. He hadn't even gotten her away from Rochester – she had done that. And rather stupidly – she could have gotten both her and Vincent killed. Then again, it was Vincent's smarts that had planted that gun. He had planted the gun and…and left the room. He had said that he shouldn't leave her! Then why the hell had he done it? Anger swelled, and she lifted up her head. \"I was bait!\" she cried. \"You set me up!\" The gun blast came through the top part of the door first, where Vincent's head might have been if he'd gotten closer. He backed up, stepping into the tub as the trail of bullet holes got closer and closer. Then more bullets, spaced more sporadically. Obviously Rochester knew he wasn't hitting anything meaningful. Vincent pressed himself against the tile wall and seemed to be counting. Finally, it stopped. Vincent waited a few moments more, and then slowly, creeping like a cat, he went to the door and pulled it open. Very wisely, he was not in front of it, but behind it. Then, he charged around the door and disappeared into the room. There were no shots. No sound of footsteps, not even Vincent's. Then, she heard him call, softly, \"He's gone.\" Callie lay on the floor of the tub. She could no longer stand it. She reached up and turned on the cold, letting a thin stream trickle down. She lay her lips against it and sucked it into her mouth. She couldn't stand this, this waiting! And her arm and chest were hurting so damn much! It was like burning, that's what it was. A bright, red, searing pain. As if the flesh were remembering, over and over, how it had been severed from itself. Cupping her hand under the water, she carefully ladled it over her wounds. There was one really bad one, that didn't seem to want to stop bleeding. She pressed one of the towels against it, but it seemed that only made it worse. Suddenly Vincent was squatting over her, reaching into the tub. He took her towel and started to pat her dry, efficiently and quickly. \"We have to move,\" he said, his voice clipped and authoritative. \"We don't want to be here when local law enforcement shows up. This isn't America, they don't do due process like we do.\" Callie opened her mouth, but seemed to be cut off by the fact that Vincent was not listening to her at all now. He had grabbed up what was left of the first aid kit and had unrolled the bandage. Deftly, he slapped a thick pad of gauze against her arm, over the deepest cut, and then wound the bandage around it, tying it very tightly. It seemed to help the pain just a little bit. \"Come on,\" he said, slapping her back lightly. \"I'll get you clothes, you get your ass out of that tub. We gotta go quickly.\" \"Go where?\" she managed, hauling herself up, but Vincent was in the other room now, in the closet, and he yanked out a pair of very expensive jeans – courtesy of the overpriced boutique downstairs – and a loose, flowery top. \"Come on,\" he urged, and it seemed as if he were going to dress her himself if she couldn't move faster. He had the top over her head and pulled her arms through it – not so roughly that it hurt but more quickly than she could have managed on her own in this state. He lowered the jeans so that she could step into them, and she looked at the back of his head as if he'd lost his mind and she were searching for his missing brain. \"What are you doing?\" she finally managed. \"Shitting where I eat,\" he said, and there was real disgust in his previously emotionless tone. \"Come on.\" He tapped her legs and she stepped into the jeans. He yanked them up hard, almost lifting her off the ground, but got them up around her waist and zipped shut even as she objected. \"You're not my mother and I'm not five!\" she barked, slapping his hands away and adjusting the zipper and snap. Then she flinched at the use of her arm. \"And I could have used some fucking underwear!\" \"No time, come on,\" he said, reaching next into the closet and producing a black satchel, very similar to the one he'd had in L.A. that night so long ago – and not really even a full month ago by the calendar – then extending his hand to her. \"Come on!\" he urged, more snappish, and snagged her fingers in his to drag her out the door. 8888888888888888 In a short while, Callie found herself stuffed down on the floor between the passenger seat and the dashboard of a very large and expensive SUV. Where Vincent had gotten it, she didn't know, nor at this point did she care. She simply accepted that he had probably stolen in – boosting cars seemed to be a major skill required on a hitman's résumé. She felt dirty. Not just from the dried blood – although that was incredibly annoying – but from the whole experience. Exasperation had turned her mute as her brain churned over the recent events, trying to make some kind of sense out of them. Or at least get them straight in her mind. Something Vincent had said stung her. She glanced up at him periodically, trying not to stare but pretty much failing. He had insisted she sit on the floor, down and out of sight. At first she thought that it was because she was a bloody mess – the wound on her arm had soaked the flimsy bandage Vincent had earlier attempted to apply, and the other various slashes Rochester had made on her skin had crusted for the most part, but still throbbed dully. Then she figured it was because of some plan Vincent had worked out in his head, three steps ahead of anyone else and ten ahead of her, for all she knew. It came to her, quickly, materializing in her head as if placed there by some transporter beam. \"Which one am I, Vincent?\" she asked him. It took him a second to hear her. He was in his \"mode,\" his head slightly bent, his nostrils occasionally flaring. He blinked and looked down at her, not so much that his eyes weren't still on the road – if that's what this thing they were on that was causing all this horrid bumping and shuffling could be called – but enough for her to see that he had no idea what she was talking about. \"Which one am I?\" she asked again, daring him to remember. \"Which what?\" he asked, clipped, annoyed. \"The shitting or the eating. Which one am I?\" He blinked again, two or three times, and she finally lost her patience. \"You said you were shitting where you ate before, when I asked you what you were doing. So which one am I? The shitting or the eating?\" He frowned, ever so slightly. \"I hardly think this is the time to have this discussion,\" he said in a tone that was actually polite. She snorted. \"Well, maybe not for you, but considering I'm the one stuffed down here with nothing else to do but bleed into the seats, I thought we'd just get a few things out in the open.\" For some insane reason, that made him crack his infamous half-smile. \"Oh, well, if we're being open, you were probably the eating.\" And he gave her a look that made her flush. It didn't help with the pain. After she didn't pursue it for a moment, Vincent went on, this time without the innuendo. \"You were the one who decided it was all a mistake. You're allowed to do that and I'm not? Sounds like a double standard to me.\" \"It was a mistake because it was morally wrong, not because – \" She stopped herself, choking on the next words because she could not, would not admit at this moment how emotionally attached she had become to him. It was not a sane person's thing to say. \"So you say.\" So damn calm now, as if they were just having a casual chit chat during a Sunday afternoon drive. \"So your grounds are moral. Mine are professional. Professionally, what happened was a mistake. I think I took your evaluation rather well—\" \"Oh, sure, if by well, you mean leaving me in a hotel room as bait —\" \"—and handled the situation as best I could under the circumstances.\" But suddenly he didn't look so confident. His eyes narrowed and his jaw twitched, and by now Callie could read him well enough to know that he was unsure. Another pause, this one longer and much more awkward. Finally, unable to stand it, Callie said, \"Where are we going?\" \"A safe house,\" was the brief reply. ","Summary":" Disclaimer – the usual Disclaimer – the usual.
