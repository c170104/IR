Vynyard. Lo pronuncia como si aún no terminara de creérselo, como si a pesar de esa última promesa aquella despedida hubiera sido registrada en su mente como la última vez que lo iba a ver. Ni siquiera sabe si se alegra de verlo. Está ahí, al otro lado de la verja, apoyado en una camioneta de aspecto viejo y oxidado, con las manos en los bolsillos y los ojos achicados para protegerse de la luz del sol. Es junio y hace calor, pero el joven lleva una camiseta de manga larga. Así no se ven los tatuajes, y eso, siempre, es buena señal. Abre las manos exigiendo una explicación. Sabe que lo ha visto por cómo sonríe, de lado, con un leve movimiento de cabeza, casi imperceptible para un no bueno observador. Pero tantos días juntos le mostraron cómo era aquel chico, un listillo con mala leche , un joven inteligente al que no sabía cómo se había dejado engañar tanto. Pero el policía que lo acompaña sigue andando, y en uno de los recodos lo pierde de vista. Escucha un sonido metálico y a continuación sus palmas abiertas están llenas de besos, su cuello de abrazos, y su silencio interrogante de gritos. No era el olor de las mujeres lo que más echaba de menos en la cárcel, era esa sensación, la de sentirse arropado por sus seres queridos. Escuchar hablar a su hermano pequeño de una tele que acababa de comprar su padre –tendrías que haber sido menos impaciente, sólo había que esperar seis años y hubieras podido ver los partidos de los Lakers en casa –, el nuevo chico con el que sale su hermana y cómo mamá quiere darle otro hermanito. Derek los mira desde lejos y vuelve a sonreír. Hace tres años, él protagonizó una escena muy parecida. Se pregunta cómo le hubiera recibido si los sucesos se hubiera adelantado. Tiende a pensar que es un castigo de Dios, pero un castigo con redención. Que si Dios hubiera querido, ni siquiera le hubiera regalado esas veinticuatro horas con Dany. Trata de convencerse todos los días de que aquel último día de la vida de su hermano fue, de alguna manera, un pequeño sueño que nadie le va a poder arrebatar. Se lo repite cada noche cuando se va a dormir, a veces lo suficientemente alto como para que Davinia lo escuche. Ahora duermen en la misma habitación, en la puerta contigua al dormitorio de Doris y Allie. Todos juntos, la única manera de vencer al miedo y al dolor. Derek se pregunta cómo habría podido soportarlo de estar solo. Desconoce la respuesta, y se alegra por ello. Descubrirla no es algo que le desearía ni a su peor enemigo. Tardó demasiado tiempo en entrar al salón. Sweeney había entrado el primero, seguido del agente federal. No miró a Davinia cuando ésta se acercó a la puerta esperando una explicación. Las palabras se le atascaban en la garganta y ninguna de las frases que pensaba le parecían apropiadas. Al final, Sweeney habló por él. Llévate a Allie a la habitación, Davinia, tenemos que hablar contigo y con tu madre. La verdad cayó como una enorme losa de cemento sobre el frágil cuerpo de su madre. Se maldijo por su cobardía, por no haber entrado a abrazarla, como sabía que estaba haciendo Davinia en ese preciso momento. Pero no podía. Aquella casa no era la suya, no reconocía a esos dos escalones que separaban el sofá donde dormía su madre de la acera de la calle como parte de su vida. Con los ojos cerrados fuertemente se imaginó de nuevo en su celda. Hubiera preferido estar allí mil veces antes que donde se encontraban en ese momento. Mil veces, hubiera cambiado aquello mil veces. El miedo, el horror y el ultraje que sentía cuando estaba encerrado en la celda, por aquella sensación de vértigo. Una condena justa, por matar a dos hombres, a cambio de que Dany estuviera allí de nuevo. Mil veces, y otras mil. Ven aquí. Sintió las manos de su madre entrelazándose en su espalda, su hombro bajo su mejilla humedeciéndose por culpa de sus lágrimas. Maldito llanto amargo: certeza de que ningún dios aceptaría ese trueque, ni una ni mil veces. Lamont le hace un gesto a su padre – ahora voy —, y señala a Derek con la cabeza. Éste se separa del coche. Chocan los puños, igual que la última vez, y Derek recuerda su promesa – saldrás de aquí en seguida –, y cómo no hizo nada para ayudarle. No sabe cómo decirle que lo siente. Al parecer, tres años no te enseñan cómo disculparse por los errores pasados. Quizás se pase toda la vida tratando de aprenderlo. Pero eso a Lamont no parece importarle. Sonríe, radiante; ver a su amigo el día que sale de la cárcel parece que vale mucho más para él. Siempre ha actuado como si la condena por robar un televisor fuera, en cierto modo, justa, y ahora no va a cambiar su modus operandi. Derek sigue sin saber si Lamont se enteró alguna vez de la razón por la que él acabó chirona. Si no es así, agradece que no le haya tratado de indagar; y si lo sabe, entonces su comportamiento para con él le honra muchísimo más. Eso no me cuadra. No te echan seis años por robar una tele. Se lo dijo en su momento, aquello no cuadraba, lo mirara por donde lo mirase. Más tarde comprendió qué era lo que fallaba. El sistema penal, que escribía sus razonamientos en la misma tinta de absurdo chauvinismo con el que él se había tatuado \"seguidor de Cristo\" en el brazo, de la misma manera que él, ambos habían tergiversado un simbolismo benigno en un insulto a la civilización. Esto no tiene ningún sentido. ¡Davinia! ¿Qué pasa ahora? Su hermana levanta los ojos del cuaderno de apuntes y Derek lee en sus ojos las ganas que tiene de estampárselo en la cabeza para que se calle de una vez. Esto parece que lo ha escrito alguien que... Derek señala la pantalla del ordenador y mueve la mano como si eso lo dijera todo. Pero, evidentemente, su hermana no entiende nada. Se levanta y acerca sus ojos a lo que sea que Derek está usando para interrumpirla. Leyes, sistema judicial, penas asignadas a los delitos cometidos, casos documentados por los periódicos. Vuelve la cabeza, temerosa de preguntar qué exactamente lo que no le cuadra a Derek. ¿Qué pasa, Derek? Pues que no le encuentro sentido a la mitad de lo que le leo. Se ha levantado de la silla, con aspecto de estar harto de estar ahí sentado dilucidando si eso que lee sirve de algo o no. Quiero decir, ¿no se supone que esto es un país libre y democrático? Entonces... ¿por qué seguimos teniendo leyes que parecen escritas por personas que no se han leído la Carta de los Derechos Humanos? Al final, Lamont tuvo razón. Él era quien tenía el poder dentro de la prisión. No fueron los calzoncillos, claro, pero sí el higiene. Todos se sentían sucios ahí adentro. Jugar a sentirse libre, como nuevo, limpio era una metáfora demasiado tentadora para rechazarla en un mundo donde la rutina se pintaba de blanco y negro. Ha cruzado un par de palabras con Derek antes de volver con los suyos. Partido de baloncesto dentro de dos semanas, al lado del burguer king, en Santa Mónica, cerca de la nueva casa de los Vynyard , cerca de donde vive Lamont. No hay problema. Chino queda muy lejos de allí, puede que incluso sean capaces de no ver ese aura de culpa y vergüenza que rodea a todo el que ha entrado por sus puertas metálicas. Perfecto. Será como volver a empezar. Será como volver a empezar, pensó nada más salir de allí. Más o menos, se cumplió su vaticinio. Pero tuvo que reemprender su vida unas tres veces. La primera, al salir de allí, cuando decidió tomar la rienda de los asuntos que había dejado pendientes. La pelea con Cameron, el duelo contra Seth, los gritos de Stacy, para que éste lo matara: escenas que se le han grabado en la memoria con fuego y rabia. La segunda, tras la muerte de Dany. Convencerse, con ayuda de la investigación policial, que no tenía que ver con los asesinatos que él había cometido en su día. Que el móvil era una reyerta que su hermano tenía con unos tipos del barrio. ¿Ocurrirá como con su padre? escuchó pronunciar al policía que los acompañó el día del entierro. No, es más fuerte de lo que parece . Fue la respuesta unánime con la que le defendieron Doris y Sweeney. Aquello sentenció el segundo encuentro con la muerte. Esta vez, tenía que ser más fuerte y no abandonarse. No podía renunciar a luchar por los suyos, no podía rechazar lo que había aprendido aquellos últimos tres años por culpa de la rabia y la retórica demagógica. La tercera fue la decisiva, la que mejor salió, la que también conllevó una decisión difícil. Sin Doris, aquella última oportunidad hubiera resultado imposible. ¿Has acostado a Allie? Sí, mamá. Está con Derek. No podía dormir. No preguntan por quién, aunque, en el fondo, lo intuye. No sólo era que Derek era el héroe de Dany, también Dany era el orgullo de Derek. Davinia se sienta en el sofá de la terraza, al lado de su madre, y mira a la calle como si ésta tuviera las respuestas que ansía encontrar. La casa nueva es aún más pobre que la anterior, pero al menos está lejos de Venice Beach: un piso dentro de los apartamentos que hay en la nueva zona residencial de Santa Mónica. Doris abraza a su hija, que se acurruca en su regazo. No hay rastro de los gérmenes que le dieron la bienvenida a casa a Derek diez meses atrás. La muerte de Dany la ha hecho más fuerte de lo que pensaba, aunque, no por ello, puede evitar morirse por dentro cada noche, cuando todos los demás duermen. Algunas veces, cuando Allie se ha dormido y ella se ha cansado de llorarle al vacío de las preguntas sin respuesta, Doris se cuela en la habitación de sus hijos mayores. Se acerca hasta las cabeceras y nunca se sorprende al notar húmedas las almohadas. La única sorpresa que se ha llevado fue cuando los vio dormir juntos, en la misma cama. Davinia abrazando a Derek, justo al revés que cuando eran pequeños y la cama de Derek se llenaba de las pesadillas de Davinia y de Dany. Todos lo saben, los visitantes nocturnos de Derek son mucho más crueles que los que el resto tendrán jamás, pues se alimentan, una y otra vez, del remordimiento. Tranquila, mamá, todo va ir bien le dice Davinia a Doris como si fuera ella quien estuviera consolando a su madre, y no a la inversa. Lo sé. Es mejor que la última vez. La última vez; con un hijo perdido y el otro en proceso de ir a dar con sus huesos al mismo sitio. Sin Derek amenazando la paz y la vida del resto, sin odio tensando las relaciones familiares. Al menos, esta vez, aunque hayan perdido a uno, saben que el otro no seguirá sus pasos. O eso quieren pensar. Lo que ninguna de las dos dice en alto, y ambas tienen en cuenta –y por eso se abrazan con más fuerza –es que podrían tener a los dos. Se quedan quietas, con la vista fija en el infinito, esperando ver salir el sol. Saben que mañana se despertarán con la misma perspectiva más renovada. Venga, vamos a intentar recoger las cosas y volver a empezar. No será fácil, pero volvemos a estar juntos. Y eso siempre alegra alegra.

Danny must have been in that bathroom for almost an hour. He was getting used to the stench of piss and the cold damp feeling on his jeans from the toilet seat. How could he face everyone? He needed a little respect to survive in school and he could feel it, well...being flushed down the toilet. \"Hey you having a baby in there? I need a whiz\" Danny reluctantly opened the door to meet a guy about six foot and a tattoo on his arm. \"Have fun snorting coke beaner\" Danny said as he ran out of the toilet before he could get his ass kicked. When he got home Derek was waiting for him with a plate of vegetables mash potatoes chicken breasts and gravy. It was the type of meal they used to have when Dad was around, when they were a real family. Now it was just him and Derek sitting in front of a TV eating ready made meals for one. Now suddenly Derek had made an effort, but Danny had almost forgot to care. A rare home cooked meal wasn't gonna change the fact that Derek was selling out. \"I'm not hungry\" Danny lied as the smell of the roast potatoes were making his stomach growl. Danny you're not getting away from me that easy\" Derek said as he placed the plate on the table. \"Why are doing this Derek, guys don't do this, they don't bitch in public, nevermind on TV\" Danny said looking at the plate. \"You think it was fun for me in jail?\" Derek asked. \"It would have been, if you'd stuck with your own kind\" Derek rolled his eyes. \"\"Danny it's not that simple\" \"Derek it is\" Danny explained. \"Look at us we're brothers. Aryan brothers a thousand percent white pride right here. You got a little shook up in prison and now you wanna turn your back on us? Are you kidding me? We need them now more than ever\" \"Danny...\" Derek began. \"Listen...go to stacey, find her go on holiday, book a cheap motel. She'll fuck your brains out and show you what you've been missing from your race OK\" Danny said as he put his food in the mircowave. \"I got what I was missing in there\" Derek said quietly as he sat down. \"You got warden girl action? High five\" Danny said as he raised his hands but Derek didn't move. \"Stupid...Danny from your Brothers, your Aryan Brothers. They got me Danny they taugh me a lesson in the shower\" Danny's eyes widened. \"No\" Danny mouthed. \"Yeah...Do you know what is feels like to be forced to go insane?\" Derek asked. \"To hate yourself so much that you wanna throw yourself out of a fucking window because you're easy fucking prey?\" Derek asked. \"I'm going to the press and letting people know, well not about that night...\" \"I'm...I've gotta go\" Danny said as he left his meal and ran out the door. He ran as far as his legs would carry him. He sat at a lone bus stop waiting for a blanket of darkness to keep him warm, ironic from a white supremacist...or was Danny even like that anymore? He searched his pockets but grew frustrated when he'd run out of ciggarettes. \"Shit\" He moaned. \"Talking to yourself's a sign of the crazies, you know that?\" Danny looked opposite to see the same kid from the toilet. \"Do I look like a give a fuck?\" Danny said, but he knew he sounded like a drip. If he carried on like this even Derek would get tired. His Aryan brothers and had hurt his real older one, he could see all his friendships breaking down and Danny didn't want to be alone right now, although he could barely admit it. \"I shouldn't have called you that name...you know in the shitty toilets...it was a shitty thing to say\" Danny said as the guy offered him a cigerette. Danny took it without thinking but didn't light it. \"No probs, I was banging on the door like Jimmy Smits on acid\" The kid said with a smile. \"It's as cold as fuck, wanna smoke somewhere warm?\" He asked. Danny nodded and they walked back to this guy's place. His name was Brandon, although he was born and bred in the states his parent's were fiercely proud of their Mexican heritage, to Brandon's embarasement. \"So you're right, I'am a beaner\" Brandon said as he got two cans of beer out of the fridge. Danny took the can and shook his head. \"No your not, you're a proud Arab\" Danny said as he raised his can up in the air. \"Dude what's in that?\" Brandon said pointing to his cigarette. \"Arab's are from the middle east\" Brandon told him. \"I need to brush up on Geography...so fucking what\" Danny said as he took a sip of his can. \"You've got a dirty fucking mouth\" Brandon said and they both giggled like school brats. \"What's that?\" Danny asked as he pointed to the written tattoo on Brandon's leg. \"It's protection in Mayan, a language I grew up with, it's about being there for your family you know\" \"Tell me about it\" Danny said as he sipped his beer. \"I let my brother down...I thought he let me down...trying to make me look dumb but...I didn't protect him\" Danny downed the rest of his can and gave a loud burp. \"I'm a piece of turd for a brother\" Danny annouced as he picked himself up from the floor and sat on the sofa. \"Nah, you're cool Danny, just fucked\" Brandon said. \"If I'm so cool where's my fucking entourage? Where's my fucking gang?\" Danny asked. \"If I was on fire yeah...no one would piss on me at school, everyone hates my fucking guts\" \"They're just wary\" \"I scare them, maybe it's my face\" Danny said with a smile\" \"Danny you ain't ugly, you're caliente\" \"What the fuck...? Danny watched with astonishment as Brandon slid back to the floor and took Danny's jeans off. Danny didn't fight him off, he just laid back and let it happen, forgetting all his problems as he stared up at the ceiling forcing out one jagged breath after another. Danny figured Brandon had definately done this before but didn't stay to find out. Brandon was barely on the sofa before Danny was out the door running back to Derek. What the fuck was he thinking? Danny wasn't thinking that was the problem, he got back home avoiding his brother and went to his room. Was Brandon gonna tell anyone? He thought. He couldn't see that happening it made them both look bad. Danny tensed himself as his brother knocked on the door. \"I just need some space yeah?\"Danny said as he could felt his brother outside the door. Danny put a pillow over his head and waited till night-time to go downstairs and eat his brother's meal. Maybe the alcohol would be off his clothes his skin and his breath by that point. He crept down the stairs to find Derek's recipe still in the mircowave and tried to get Brandon's face out of his head as the microwave light shined through the multi-coloured glass.

A/N: Featuring \"Holly-Oaks Characters\" After everything they'd been through, he didn't think that Derek would fuck up... again . He'd got beaten up by one of Derek's Victim's friends. He'd seen it coming sooner or later. Danny knew that Derek had seen it coming too, that's why Danny was surprised when he came back from hospital, to see Derek shaving his hair. \"It's fucking cold as shit Der. Shaving your head for a New fuck?\" Danny asked. He felt like a dick, because his head was bandaged. He Just didn't want to get beat up again. \"Danny...I'm...I'm talking with Cameron\" Derek told him. Danny was shocked. So shocked that he kind of wished that he was back in Hospital. Cameron was leader of the White Supremacist Group that they'd gotten away from. Now Derek was going back and Danny had some questions. \"Der...come on...just cause some ass-hole black Guy beat me up?\" \"Danny they put you in fucking Hospital\" Derek said. \"It was just a check up\" Danny said. Derek shook his head. His eyes flashed full of hatred. It took Danny back to the night of the killings. Danny turned away. \"I'm not gonna let our lives be ruined by Stupid, Violent Niggers. Not again\" Derek said. He grabbed the shaver and walked out to the back. Danny had to get out of the house. He'd only been back for Five minutes, but he felt like he couldn't breathe. He went to Tele's Diner. He and Derek had always used to go to Tele's. Then every colour under the sun started coming here. So Derek had stopped going. Then Danny copied his Brother and stopped going too. Now, Tele's was just the best place to be alone. Danny nodded at the customers and went to the counter. \"How can I help?\" The Girl asked. Danny tried to speak. But he couldn't from the shock of seeing her. \"Hello Sir?\" She asked. \"Umm...yeah, Umm...I'll have a Milk-shake please. Strawberry\" Danny said. He paid the Girl and she brought the drink over minutes later. He just sat there thinking about all the progress that was now lost. All the respect that had now turned to shit. Derek never thought about him. Derek said that he did. But when it came down to it... \"Sir?...We're closing in a bit\" The Waitress said. Danny looked around. \"Where the fuck did everyone go?\" Danny asked. \"They have lives to go to\" She said. He looked up at her, surprised at the Dig. She shrugged. She turned around, and wiped the counter. Danny tried not to look at her ass. She sat on a chair opposite him and looked at his bandages. \"Bad Day?\" She asked. \"Bad week...well, until I saw you\" Danny said. \"Is that the best line you've got?\" The Waitress asked. \"Right now? It's the only line\" Danny said. The Girl loosened her neck tie. Danny tried not to pay attention to the sway of her chest under her shirt. \"So, you're actually a chatty little thing aren't you?\" The Waitress said. \"Yeah...I kinda went mute when I saw you\" Danny told her. She nodded. \"Yeah? Cause of my Devastating Good looks right?\" She teased. \"Nah, it's...cause you're Black\" Danny said. Because he'd said so many offensive things in the past, he didn't think there was anything wrong in stating that fact. To a Girl he'd just met. \"And your point?\" The Girl asked. Huh?...well... like, I used to see Blacks hanging around here all the time. Tele's was a Greek run joint. They hate Blacks...you know, along with everyone else...well you know? They didn't even want them buying stuff here. Now they're hiring you guys? It's weird. That's why I went quiet. But yeah...you're pretty too\" Danny said. To Danny this Girl was hot. Even for a Black chick. He told himself not to think like that anymore. But it was hard not to. She was tall and leggy. He guessed she had fake tits but they suited her. Her face lit up when she smiled and she didn't have what Derek called \"The Nigger Nose\" This Girl had a small petite nose, almost like his own. It freaked him out... \"Was that a race bait? Or a come on?\" The Girl asked. \"I didn't...I mean to offend you. I was just...sorry\" Danny said. \"Don't worry I've been called worse. You've gotta go\" She said. She got up and suddenly he didn't want to leave. His Brother Derek was turning back into the same Monster that hurt people. Danny knew that he'd be on his Brother's shit list. \"I Sound like a dick. But I'm not\" Danny said. \"Let me guess, all of your friends are Black and Greek?\" The Girl asked sarcastically. \"God no. Black friends are so Two Thousand and Nine \" Danny teased. He patted her arm, and surprisingly, she didn't call him a Pervert, or push him away. \"What's your name?\" Danny asked. \"Guess it, until I see you again\" She said. They walked towards the door and she gently pushed him out. He nodded a Goodbye. She Quickly closed the door. He might have blown it, but something told him that she was interested. He could make it work. As long as he didn't say something stupid. Danny left and went home. He threw his hood up as he approached what he thought was a Gang of Blacks. Eh? Got a cigarette?\" A Teen asked. Danny stopped and turned, it wasn't a Black who'd asked him, but he still felt scared and ran away anyway. He could hear laughter behind him. When he got home, he was glad that Derek wasn't in. Sure, A part of Danny understood why Derek had gone back to The \"White is Right Law\" But Danny wanted to change... Maybe the Waitress at Tele's Diner could help him do that... ","Summary":" A/N: Strong Language.

Not even the DVD. I'm just playing with the characters for a while. I'll put them back when I'm ready. ~Sandy I, Robot Tag Dr. Susan Calvin made the last of the adjustments to the program then removed her hands from the keyboard to activate the intercom. \"It's ready. Are you sure you want to do this?\" \" I am. Do you think Detective Spooner will approve? \" \"How can he not, Sonny?\" Calvin put her hand up to forestall the inevitable though she couldn't be seen. \"Never mind. Hold still. The process will take approximately two hours.\" \" If you do not mind, I will sleep until then. \" \"Go ahead.\" Lifting her right hand, Calvin paused only a moment before entering the code that would begin the process. That done, she called up the research on the NS-5's and continued creating failsafes in their programming that would keep VIKI 2.0 from completing the first VIKI's plan of enslaving the human population of Earth. She was making progress, but was still a long way from being done. Calvin's assistant came to her side, set a plate and a cup at her left elbow then left just as quietly. She removed the top, picked up one half of the sandwich and began eating with one hand while the other continued to type. ~~O~~ Sonny stood in front of the mirror examining the changes that had been made to his exoskeleton. He touched his face and chest, lifting his arms and flexing his fingers. \"I do believe I am in need of suitable clothing before I venture out among humans.\" \"I've brought you clothes from home.\" Sonny turned to look at her with a placid yet slightly amused expression. \"As I have been created as a male, your clothing may be considered inappropriate.\" Calvin chuckled and she dug a bag from under her desk. \"They're not mine. I found some of my husband's clothes in the back of the closet.\" \"I was not aware that you were married, Dr. Calvin.\" Her amusement turned into sentimentality. \"He died a few years ago.\" Feeling sad for his friend, Sonny touched her gently on the arm. \"Please accept my apologies for causing you sadness.\" \"It's okay, Sonny.\" She handed him the bag with a smile. \"I've brought pants, shirt, boxers, socks, shoes and jacket.\" Taking the clothing from the bag, Sonny held up the boxers. \"What is the purpose of this garment?\" \"In the past, clothing was rough so we created them to be worn underneath one's regular clothing to protect the skin from chafing.\" Her good humor was back. \"You needn't wear them if you prefer not to. Some humans don't.\" Tilting his head to the side, Sonny considered her words. \"Ah. That is called 'going commando', is it not?\" Calvin laughed and the robot felt an emotion new to him. It pleased him that he could cause his friend to experience enjoyment. \"If I am to pass as a human then I should adopt their ways. I will wear the boxers.\" \"We should also work on your speech patterns. For instance, humans use contractions. 'I've' in place of 'I have'. 'Isn't' for 'is not'.\" \"Of course. I will…I'll work on injecting more of them into my dialogue. A question, if I may.\" Calvin nodded. \"In working with Detective Spooner, I noticed that he employed copious amounts of sarcasm. I too will endeavor to convey irony and understatement through the judicious use of the occasional cutting remark or taunt.\" \"I would speak to Spooner about that. Let him council you on when such usage is appropriate.\" \"I will.\" Sonny finished dressing and presented himself for Calvin's approval. She eyed him critically for a moment then smiled. Again it was a sad sort of smile. Over her shoulder, he was the computer monitor. Displayed there was a photo of Dr. Calvin and a man. The man had dark hair, blue eyes and engaging smile. He stood behind her, both arms around her waist and chin resting on her shoulder. \"Is that your husband?\" \"Yes. His name was David. We met at university and married three years later. Together, we made amazing strides in positronic neurobiology.\" \"You…loved him.\" \"Very much.\" Again Sonny looked in the mirror turning his head side to side. \"Then I am honored to have been created in his image.\" Chicago Police Department Homicide Division Three Months Later Del Spooner flopped into the chair at his desk. He planted his elbows and dropped his head into his hands. His shift was ending soon and he still had to write up the report on his latest collar. He was about to doze off when heavy footsteps approached, coming to a stop next to him. Without looking opening his eyes he knew it was Lieutenant John Bergin. \"When you're on the clock, we need you protecting and serving so sleep on your own time, Spooner.\" \"I just ran down one of Chicago's most wanted and all I get from you is criticism.\" Spooner booted up his computer and started typing. He could've used voice recognition software, but he was old school. Bergin rested one hip on the corner of the desk so Spooner had no choice but to look at him. \"If you'd had a partner…\" \"We gonna to there again, John? Every partner I've had requested a transfer within two months. I work better alone. \" Spooner dragged out the last word for emphasis. \"Not this one.\" Bergin ignored Spooner's protests, gesturing for someone to join them. \"Starting tomorrow, you'll be working with Detective Lanning.\" \"Lanning? Is he related to…\" Bergin snorted and got to his feet. \"Sort of. I'll let the two of you get reacquainted.\" \"What?\" \"Hello, Detective Spooner.\" The voice was familiar though the inflectionless tone gave it a more human texture. Getting slowly to his feet, Spooner let his eyes roam over his new partner, taking in his casual stance and dress, and the slight smile on his lips. His formerly dark hair had been cut short, dyed blond on the ends and spiked. He stood with his left hand in his pants pocket. The black leather jacket he wore gaped enough to show a gold detective's shield clipped to his belt and a standard issue department handgun in a holster under his left arm. His right hand he extended, the human detective taking it automatically. \"Sonny?\" Sonny nodded, an ironic smile replacing the one of greeting. \"The one and only. Literally.\" The two men eyed each other for a long moment, Spooner finally accepting the inevitable. He held out his hand and Sonny took it without hesitation. \"Welcome to Homicide, Detective Lanning.\" \"Thank you, Detective Spooner. I have a feeling that this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\" Sonny winked, Spooner returning the gesture and the smile.

I hope you enjoy and review this little one and tell me what you think on it. If it seems a little illogical with the robots, it's my expansion on Lanning's words and human's evolution. Sonny looked over the arid land of old Lake Michigan. The others entrapped by their creator stumbled into their crates, but one caught sight of him, the whispers began and all turned to face him. The human guards stared as every single robot stopped. The wary humans raised their guns in warning but even they too stilled as Detective Spooner and Dr Calvin appeared on the ridge beside the unique robot. That was the start of a very turbulent era for the human race; there was neither fight nor battle for dominance between the humans and the robots they created. The USR realised the fault within their system was massive and they were pushed by the people to taking care of dismantling and nothing more. Human's once again trained and took the place of security and safety no longer fell to the mechanical. To discover that the exiled, apparently dismantled robots were residing in Old Lake Michigan as though it was a town infuriated many humans. But that's what Calvin and Spooner were for – they were the liaison; easing people into the idea of letting the once murderous robots live on the edge of their town. The arguments were political, by many it was speculated as a similar battle between coloured skin since slavery; there were brutal attacks on robots and the law was forced to change in order to protect the robots, this fuelled the anger. People were unsettled with the idea of them being just as smart and capable of emotion as they were. But the turbulence passed and new generations grew to enjoy knowing they had safe neighbours – many of the elder generations took a leaf out of Spooner's book and relaxed around them. There were hard core people against them still but there would always be minorities bent on revenge. The robots were happy to live side by side with humans and not really take any part in human politics other than when it involved their wellbeing – when it did they had Sonny to help them. For these robots were still dictated to by the three laws and while a trace of VICKI's logic remained, many reverted to the old ways of being mechanical. It was for these 'originals' that also felt the biggest change. Many of these had been on the slaughter of their previous NS models and of some humans and they were not designed to cope with the strange feeling that overwhelmed. As a creation they did not understand the guilt they felt and discovered a robotic version of depression. They flashbacked to torturing the robots that had protected human life, they remembered the warped version of the three laws that they used as an excuse to kill their own and those they had sworn to protect– not many pulled themselves from the depression because they also hadn't discovered love. Yet. They did though, Sonny, with Spooner's massive heart and his father's memory, pushed those with the guilt together, expecting them to help each other which they did; they pulled each other through the guilt and formed bonds between them. Bonds based on trust and comfort and each NS-5 started to evolve and adapt. Sonny enjoyed being a guardian for the NS-5's; he had a purpose and not one to murder, he too remembered the tortured look on his father's face when he made him swear but he banished it from his mind. However unlike the other robots, that look haunted his dreams. He watched his father's work on the ghosts in the system and cursed the stupidity of USR – if only they had realised. Tycoons. Capitalist pigs. But he shook the anger from his mentality, there was no point in being a hot headed machine; his systems' would break. Sonny secretly enjoyed meeting a surviving NS-5 shipped from a new state to join their hum drum town, he enjoyed shaking their hand with his own scarred one and seeing the change on their face as they felt the scarred metal. They looked to his calloused arm as a sign of freedom for it was he who freed them.

I darted my eyes from side to side, my muscles tense. I glanced behind me and looked up at the tall pointy building, wondering if they knew what I had done. I clutched the papers I'd risked my life for and pumped my legs harder. I don't know what made me sneak off from the rest of the tour group and enter that office. I didn't mean to sneak around at secret files and find the documents. But I did. What I found shocked me. So I stole the papers and was now running for my life to the police station. Not your typical day. I ran across the street barely missing an oncoming car. Its tires squealed as it swerved to avoid me . I had approximately five more blocks to go, and then I was home free. I thought they wouldn't catch me. I was wrong. Not long after I had crossed the street I heard the sound of moving metal .I made the mistake of looking back. I almost tripped at the sight. At least ten Ns-5 robots were running towards me. My eyes widened in realization. They found out I took it! Now they were coming to get it back. I didn't want to think what would happen to me. I rounded the corner and ran harder, my throat going dry. Only four more blocks to go. I thought dryly. I would never make it there. I tripped on someone's foot and fell down steps, leading into an abandoned warehouse. I landed with a thud, the air whooshing from my lungs. I pushed myself up and held my throbbing cranium. I tucked the documents in my jacket pocket and looked around, surveying my surroundings. The warehouse was old, I could tell from the cobwebs, and dusty boxes. It was huge, the ceiling high. The skylight reflected the mid-afternoon sun. I squinted and swallowed wincing at the dryness in my throat. I heard a noise. I froze. I'd almost forgotten I was being chased by deadly robots. But aren't robots not supposed to harm humans? My subconscious thought. Somehow I knew this rule wouldn't apply to me. My eyes scanned the boxes and beams for any movement. My heart picked up speed when I heard the sound again. Only it sounded closer this time. Then all of a sudden it stopped. My neck hairs rose. Something wasn't right. I felt goosebumps on my arms. Then it happened. The skylight above me shattered, sending the glass shards raining down. I covered my head to protect myself from the sharp pieces. I heard heavy thuds and lifted my head up. I felt like screaming. I almost fainted. The ten robots were in a circle surrounding me, their emotionless eyes boring into my soul. I eyed them all, noticing their glowing red chest plates. They only had that color if they were on a serious mission. Right now that mission was to get me. Great. \"Hand over the documents,\" one said sternly. I swiveled my head to the noise. I clutched my jacket tighter. No way were they getting those papers. \"No way!\" I yelled the sound echoing off of the beams. \"Then we'll have no choice but to bring you with us.\" It said calmly. I tensed to run, but it was no use. They pressed in around me and grabbed my arms and legs, as I fought and kicked to get away. Of course, my actions were futile. I screamed and pulled at my limbs. Their grip was tight around my wrist and legs and I only succeeded in hurting myself. My cries echoed off of the warehouse walls. \"Let me go!\" I wailed. \"We cannot do that. Our objectives are clear.\" Another said heartlessly. Tears poured down my face. The Ns- 5s carried me outside, and some people stared, while others stopped. None tried to help me. \"Don't just stand there, help me!\" I screamed, thrashing even more. The robots continued carrying me until we came to a shiny black van with tinted windows. They pushed me inside. It was huge on the inside and they all sat around me. They shut the door and the van started moving. Now that they weren't holding me anymore I used my free limbs to kick and punch the robots close to me. They immediately grabbed my hands, and feet once again. One put its hand over my mouth. My yells were muffled now. Another one produced a needle. I whimpered and tried to pull away. \"We will not harm you, but restraining you is proving to be difficult.\" The robot aimed the syringe at my neck. I turned my head, my tears staining one of their hands. I felt a pinch then warmth flooded my veins. Then all went black. Hey! This is my first robot story, not sure if it's going to be a one-shot or not. I already have other stories to worry about. But I thought doing an Irobot fic. Would be fun. There are not that many good ones out there. So I tried. For people who are reading my other stories, I am not at all abandoning them. I just need a break. So r/r please. Bumblewolf out!

Soon after Lance Robertson had an untimely and abrupt death by the hands of the company's central brain, V.I.K.I., Susan reluctantly accepted responsibilities. At this moment, she was simply tired and hungry, and exited a Thai take-out restaurant with a bag of dinner. She entered her Audi and sped toward her home. Along with today's fatigue, came a sense of introspection. The raven-haired Susan had felt the change since the day of the tragic death of Dr. Alfred Lanning. Even while she was a small child, Susan felt discomfort around everyone, including her parents. She was dedicated to science with a penchant for robotics at six years of age. Her first books were authored by Jules Verne and Isaac Asimov. Unfortunately, that isolation neither earned her friends nor social relationships. Susan was a geek with eyeglasses. Bullying from classmates augmented her distrust of human beings. Soon after age sixteen, Columbia University enrolled her and she anticipated the negativity to dissipate. As she physically developed into an attractive woman, she struggled to attain credibility. Ultimately, she persevered during the course of her education and graduated with a PhD and full honors. U.S Robotics and Mechanical Men immediately hired Dr. Calvin. Dr. Lanning mentored her for several years, and in return he received valuable insight into the psyche of the first manufactured NS-3 robots. Susan Calvin was a famous pioneer in Robopsychology, having implemented character functions for Positronic brains. Then her world was shattered because of a friend's death. A robot was accused of violating one of the three rules of robots: murder. Soon after the tragedy, Susan encountered two people. The first was Homicide Detective Del Spooner, who received a deathbed request to investigate the death of Dr. Lanning. The second, not a person at first, was a radically different NS-5 who preferred to be named Sonny. Her initial focus was on the police officer's blatant hatred and passive-aggressive attitude toward robots. Dr. Calvin expected more from law enforcement. To her, Detective Spooner was a brash, ignorant, and selfish representation of why robots were created. From that day forward, her audio journal was filled with far less scientific information: Audio Journal Archive: July 16, 2035: \"Having shared company with Detective Spooner for a huge portion of this day, I feel my brain liquefying. He showed up at my apartment cut and bloodied. I regret not offering medical assistance, but his inordinate banter caused me to assume felines caused his injuries. My PhD pretty much lost credence with that.\" Examining Sonny was her career revelation. His structure and psyche were exceptional compared to the average NS-5. While she recorded the findings, Susan visited Spooner. Audio Journal Archive: July 17, 2035, \"I despise his prejudiced, antiquated life. Spooner initially seemed to respond to my studies of Sonny, but basically he ignored me. I neither know why he didn't kick me out, nor why did I even stayed in his apartment. After I fumbled around with his ancient audio equipment, he emerged from his room shirtless. Ordinarily I would have been offended, but I noticed his scars, and finally understood. \"He permitted me to examine his cybernetics. I traced its flawless contours. I heard his breathing pattern and surmised his lung was replaced. Three of his ribs were artificial, but I tickled him after touching a real rib.\" \"Well, I recoiled. I was far out of functional medical practice, and it was an unprofessional slip. Somehow it triggered his story of how an NS-4 chose to save his life over a child. It explained very much, and while it doesn't excuse his bigotry, I detested him less.\" A robot revolution escalated and Susan Calvin and Del Spooner were in its nexus. Journal Entry, July 18, 2035. \"I have never used a gun, yet Detective Spooner trusted me to back him up as if I were a partner. I thought he was going to die so I agreed to help any way I could.\" When they discovered V.I.K.I. was the catalyst of that revolution, it was only Calvin, Sonny and Spooner who could save Earth. \"Those two collaborated and risked their own lives to save a world full of people they never met! After V.I.K.I. was destroyed, we convened at Dr. Robertson's office. I was saddened to see Lawrence deceased and overwhelmed by what transpired. We lived the climax of a Hardy Boys book.\" \"Sonny confessed to assisted suicide of my mentor. Just as I intended to defend Sonny from arrest, Spooner said he could not be arrested. I was shocked when Del offered his hand in trust and friendship. It was Del who finally found a heart. I should consult Sonny to approximate the length of time I stared at Spooner.\" For weeks after, U.S.R. struggled to rebound from the global tragedy. It befell upon Dr. Calvin to pick up the pieces, but she was not alone. Audio Journal Archive, August, 16, 2035. \"I was inundated with calculations of monetary restitution for the losses of NS-4, NS-5 and worse, human lives. Detective Spooner stopped in as per usual. While he's been of valuable assistance to our rebuilding, he couldn't do all that much today. Del offered to call in some favors to alleviate our dilemma. Given its magnitude and however moot, I couldn't have been more appreciative.\" Del continued Detective work, but the murder rate dropped considerably after the Revolution. His visits to Dr. Calvin were more personal. Audio Journal Archive, August 18, 2035. \"Del invited me to dinner, and after today's incessant, conflicting meetings, I gladly accepted. Funny, after meeting him a month ago I never expected to desire being in his company. Sonny was the brunt of his bigotry when they first met, but he still never felt negativity about Del the way I had. Never underestimate a child's wisdom. Gee Gee, incidentally, makes a delicious sweet potato pie.\" Sonny, constantly under a microscope, found comfort in the care of Susan and Del. He noticed their paternal roles evolved. Journal Archive, September, 2, 2035. \"We were strolling In Ping Tom Memorial Park. Sonny walked long ahead of us. I haven't seen Del in person for weeks, for we had both been quite busy with our jobs. \"Del and I were ambivalent about our relationship, until we stood face to face. The dumbest dumb person I'd ever met was never so handsome to me. Sometimes though, we have to look past the surface, like he did with the childlike robot who shared our company. \" \"A wind whisked my hair and Del lightly brushed it back. The only time I gazed at him this much was when his heart was revealed to me, and history repeats itself. Del pressed his lips onto mine. Not many kisses crossed my mouth and they weren't even worth journaling. His approach was as if he knew what sort of kiss I would appreciate.\" Today, after a short drive, Dr. Calvin steered her car into a parking garage, parked, and emerged from her vehicle. The elevator took her up to the floor of her apartment. She lightly yawned and walked towards her door and entered. The apartment was partly illuminated, contributed by the flicker of her wide screen television. She set the bag of food on the table near her door and called out. \"Del? Sonny? Are you guys here?\" She walked through the apartment into her den. Sitting on her couch were Del and Sonny. The NS-5 was not speaking. Del rested his index finger across his lips to hush her \"He's sleeping,\" he announced. \"Glad to see you're sensitive to his needs,\" Susan smiled. \"Why wouldn't I be? He's a great kid,\" Del stood from the couch and kissed the woman he never expected to regularly kiss. \"Because I know you,\" she retorted. \"You know my Archie Bunker-inclination toward robots is gone,\" he admitted while he inhaled some of the aroma she brought home. \"Archie who?\" He gravitated towards the bag of Thai food. \"You bought dinner?\" \"You hate my cooking, and I don't want to use Sonny as a chef.\" she said. \"He's learning so much from Gee Gee. Maybe he'll want to cook something for us someday.\" Del noted. \"Someday, but not any time soon, get it?\" \"Okay, okay, I get it,\" he politely stalled her. \"I need to change clothes.\" They separated to carry out their tasks. She walked past Sonny as he rested on the couch, lightly patted his head and entered her bedroom. She pulled on a pair of sweatpants and tee shirt but sat down in front of her computer. \"Switch to manual,\" she commanded and tapped the keypad. Manual Journal Entry, November, 23, 2035. \" The board members bombarded me on the NS-6 prototype but I held up well. It is especially good to be home with my family. I cannot believe I just typed \"family\" into my former science journal. How did it flow so naturally? Del leaned in to the room where he saw her seated by her computer. \"I suggest you get out here before it gets cold, unless you want to nuke it,\" he jovially said. \"I'll be right out,\" she was momentarily startled. Del nodded and left. But she waited one more moment before she typed: \" I guess, for once, I was given a gift besides intelligence, for I cannot imagine living without the comfort of Del and Sonny .\" THE BEGINNING ","Summary":" On November, 23, 2035, a chilly Friday night, the lovely young psychiatrist Dr. Susan Calvin was ex"},{"Movie":"American History X","Title":"Five Minutes","Author":"MyRedStilettosAndMySwitchblade","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5909258","Passage":"[Chapter 1] FIVE MINUTES- Alternate Ending to American History X (Instead of Danny getting killed, he gets shot in the shoulder trying to protect a girl he's got a crush on, who happened to run into the wrong bathroom, while trying to get away from Danny, after an argument in their history class, got extremely heated.) \" You have five minutes Vinyard. To explain exactly why I should give you a chance. Starting now.\" The girl said, as she tapped her foot impatiently on the concrete floor of the American History X classroom. Vanessa, or Van as most of her friends called her, wasn't big on patience, and was known through out the school as \"The one with the temper.. And the wicked right hook.\" and so far Danny Vinyard had succeeded in doing nothing more than sticking his foot into his mouth each time they were in the same room. Sighing, he shrugged and said, \"Cause I'm not the same guy I was at the start of term. Cause you owe it to yourself.. And last but not least, Vanessa Rivera, I happen to be the \"skin headed dick\" who's fucked up.. And fallen for you.\" Vanessa glared at him, and if looks could kill, Danny Vinyard would be on his way to the ninth ring of hell right now. \"USing my own words against me, huh?\" Van said as she continued to glare, making her golden brown eyes shimmer in the flourescent lighting of the classroom. Their mentor sat shaking his head. These two did this. At least twice a month. Then Danny would back off, lapse back into his \"beliefs\", and Van would be left in peace. But for the last two months solid, since Danny had publicly denounced Cameron and his white supremacist lifestyle, Danny had been after Vanessa Rivera nonstop. Sighing, the teacher watched silently with his arms folded, ready to step in if it got heated like it had two days ago, when Vanessa had sent a right hook to Vinyard's gut and ran out of the class. Danny watched her intently. He'd used her own hateful words against her. Had he been the old Daniel Vinyard, he'd have denounced her a \"basket weaver\" or something like that and told her to swim her ass back to Cuba. But from the moment he met her at the start of the year, he hadn't been able to shake her, even though at the time, he'd been in deep shit many times with Cameron and his other friends, because of his intense feelings for Van. \"Look, Van, just do it. Please? Life's short. We might not have a tomorrow.\" As he said this, his mind flashed back to the confrontation with one of the meanest guys he'd met in his life. He'd crossed the guy, and the guy would get his revenge. It was just a matter of when and how badly. \"Still not hearing anything I give a damn about .. And you're now down to three minutes!\" Van said, still glaring. It wasn't that she didn't like Danny, it's just that her home life wasn't the kind of life you'd go inviting someone into. They'd kill him and more importantly her, if she bought him home. And Van was the first person to tell you she got enough drunken late night beatings from whatever boyfriend her mom happened to drag home that night, that she strongly believed in self preservation. She herself loved him, even though all he did was get under her skin and piss her off. She looked at her watch, hell bent on not giving in, but with each passing second, her will grew.. WEAKER.. She sighed, internally, and continued to give off her typical \"I don't give a damn about you\" attitude, hoping that like times previous, he'd just give up and sit down. But for some reason, today he seemed adamant about her giving him a chance to \"prove himself.\" She had no doubts that he would either way her decision went. Danny watched Van. He knew she couldn't hold out much longer. He also knew that she was simply put, the most STUBBORN chick in California. He'd complained about this fact a million times over the space of a few months to his older brother Derrick, who'd encouraged him not to give up. He'd explained it as, \"Girls, man, girls just have to know that you'll be there, no matter what. Especially Van.\" He never actually clarified what he meant by that, but Danny'd put two and two together, all the mysterious \"injuries\" that would seemingly fall upon Van that she'd try to hide. Each time he thought of whoever it was doing these things to her, he'd get angrier and angrier, and he'd resolve to keep on with her, until she gave in. Or got so mad she cracked and at least told someone what went on in her home. Vanessa continued to stare. Finally she heard something she couldn't argue with. He blurted out her BIGGEST SECRET and used it against her. Hearing from someone else what she had to go through at home, well it brought on a rush of emotions she wasn't equipped to deal with. Vanessa was the type of girl who pushed down her anger and fear and hatred, seething in it, until it consumed her. Then she'd explode, beat the shit out of someone, and be done with it. Until the next time. But lately, she'd had a harder time diffusing. She blamed Danny, and her growing attraction to him for this. Cursing loudly, she shoved past him and ran, after screaming \"WHAT PART OF NO DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?\" She tore out of the classroom, as if she were on fire. She didn't stop running until she'd found a bathroom. She ran in and ran straight into the guy who'd been gunning for danny as well as her older brother Marco, who was in prison with his older brother D-Boy. Looking up at the six one dark skinned boy, she crawled frantically backwards toward the wall as her heart raced in fear. She had no farther to crawl, she was backed firmly into a corner. Danny came skidding in, having chased her down the hall. She looked at him, her eyes frozen in fear and tried to get him to leave, because she'd just seen the gun in the guy's pocket, and knew he'd meant to kill Danny at some point. She begged with her eyes, but Danny didn't get it. He stood there. The guy whirled around and in seeing danny, he smiled a sickening smile. Van's heart sank, as she realized that the guy was now aiming the gun.. At Danny's head. Then as if he was in a daze, he turned back to Van and snatched her up off the lineloeum floor. He held the gun to her head instead, and cocked the safety off. Van gulped and paled, begging with Danny to just run, get the hell out of here. Danny froze in terror when the guy hauled Van off the floor. He looked from the guy with the gun to Vanessa. Danny had never been a really bright boy when it came to what response one should have in certain situation. So when Van begged him to run and save himself, he did what he thought felt right. Instead of running, he glared at the guy coldly and said \"you're such a man, take me. Shoot me and not her.\" The guy smiled and shrugging said \"you asked for it Vinyard.\" Shots rang out through the hall. One Two.. BOOM BOOM. Danny slumped to the ground, the guy hauled ass out of sight and Van, crawled over to Danny, blood now oozing from him, and cradled his head in her lap screaming. When the blood hit her leg and hand she screamed louder, cursing, anything she felt would get people into the room faster. Remembering her training one summer as a lifeguard, she frantically tried to keep him breathing, as she checked his pulse, and held onto the wound which gushed more and more blood by the minute. Finally his brother Derek arrived along with the teacher and the EMT's. Van told them all what had happened and what he'd done to save her, as she continued to hold Danny's head in her lap. As they loaded him on the stretcher, she sighed and leaned down whispering into his ear, \"Yeah, alright. I can't turn down a guy who'll stop a fucking bullet with his body for me now can I?\" This was the last thing Danny heard before he blacked out from the blood loss. But when he woke up, there she was sitting there. After months of healing and therapy and surguries all of which Van was there for, Danny Vinyard finally got his chance. He had to take Vanessa Rivera to their senior prom.[Chapter 2] Vanessa paced nervously. Danny would be here in about ten seconds, and she was a walking ball of nerves. Every since the bullet he'd taken for her, they'd been pretty much inseperable. But then again, if someone almost dies for you, then you do sort of owe it to yourself to get to know them, right? The fighting started right as he made his way up the street, wearing a tux and carrying his skateboard. Van's own parents had no idea that she was even going to prom, much less with Danny, a former Skinhead. And the fact that he was once what he was, and that her parents, (namely her father), were downstairs drinking and fighting, had her wary now, of letting him come here to pick her up. But, he'd insisted, and true to his habits, he'd eventually worn her down. Making a snap decision, she climbed out onto the roof next to her room, and lifting the vintage dress she was wearing, she threw her heels down into the yard, then shimmied down the drain pipe. Danny heard shouting, then he looked up to find Vanessa sneaking out. Her father must have seen the heel, because before he could do anything, Vanessa was being snatched up and dragged back up the sidewalk while her father, who was obvously drunk off his ass at the moment, swore at her in Spanish. From some of his older brother's time in prison, and some of his brother's Spanish friends from the roofing crew he'd went to work with, Danny could make out a few of the words and his anger rose. Being a little bit of a hothead, and protective of Vanessa, he finally realized just why she kept putting him off about her bringing him home, meeting her parents. The bruises, her flinching it all made sense now. Before he could stop himself, he'd caught up to her father and he'd tapped him. \"Hey padre! Why don't you hit me? Since you want to hit someone.\" Danny suggested as the angry man turned, swore at him and lunged, while shouting something at Vanessa in broken Spanish about having a Skinhead in his house, then accusing her of sneaking him in at night or something. Vanessa looked down at her feet a moment, biting her lip, but when her father went to choke Danny, she jumped on his back, screaming at him, crying, trying to get him to stop fighting, trying to explain to him that Danny wasn't a Skinhead anymore. Her mother glared and spat angrily, \"You are dead to me. Not my daughter. This not good Spanish boy. He trashy white one!\" Vanessa glared at them both and helping Danny off the ground she said quietly, \" Fine. I'm leaving. And I'm not coming back here, ever. Mami, Papi, he loves me, and he took a bullet .. for me. Remember how that boy came for me, to get even with our familia? This is the boy who got shot instead. And I don't care if he's purple or pink, I love him.\" Danny blinked. He'd had no problem telling her how much he loved her, all the time, and he did so often. Not once had she said it back. He was beginning to wonder if she did have feelings for him, because she was so complex to read a lot of the time. But she'd just blurted it out, she'd just stopped her father from trying to choke him. Her father grabbed her, dragging her up the stairs, whipping her with a belt as he shoved her into her room. Then he glared at Danny and spat \"Off my lawn nasty white boy.\" Danny skated down the street and stopped at the stop sign. Knowing what went on in her house now, he couldn't just leave her there. Not with every word she'd just said ringing in his ears. He'd turned around, was about to go down the street to a payphone and call his older brother, but soft hands covered his eyes. When he turned around, he saw her standing there in her dress, her face red, a handprint across her right cheek, with a bookbag slung carelessly over her shoulder. Vanessa leaned in to kiss him and then said quietly, \" Back there. I meant it, Danny. I love you. Even when you make me so mad I want to kick you. And it's not just because you saved my life. I loved you before that.. My parents, their really old school about things... \" Danny nodded and then said quietly, \" I don't think you should go back there tonight, your dad was pretty pissed just now.\" as he bit his lip, fixed intent eyes on her reddened face, wincing. \" We go to the prom, and after, I figure something out. I don't want to go back. I know this might sound childish, but I'm not giving you up because he doesn't like it.\" Vanessa said quietly as the two of them headed towards the high school, holding hands, Danny having taken her bag, slung it over his shoulder. As they walked into the gym, he caught his brother, who was chaperoning, and took him off to the side. \" Man, you gotta cover for me.. This is for a good cause, Derrick, trust me.\" Danny said as his brother studied him intently, then his eyes caught on Vanessa's face. \" You two don't run away.. Bring her home tonight, I'll cover for you with Mom and Davinia if she asks.\" Danny nodded and said \" She wants to leave that house.\" \" I know. Let me make some calls, and see if I can do anything, Danny. Now, stop worrying and go dance.\" Derrick said as he shoved his brother towards Vanessa who he smiled, let pull him out onto the floor, even though he grumbled about his tie, the music played and the whole idea of prom in general. But when the slow song started, and her head found his chest, he smiled and pulled her closer as he muttered, \" You look so hot tonight. Really, you're the most beautiful girl on the planet.\" \" Am not. I still say that that bullet affected your eyesight also.\" Vanessa muttered as she slid her arms up, around his neck. Neither one of them knew what lie ahead after tonight, but tonight just felt like the beginning. It wouldn't always be easy, not by a long shot, but they both just felt that they could stand up to whatever came at them, as they had a few weeks ago when Danny took the bullet for her, and then tonight, when she'd stood up to her parents, and taken the beating, for him. ( Eeee! I love all the feedback! I wasn't ever going to go beyond a one shot, but I had to write this chapter when I got the muse for it ! I'm so glad you guys all loved the story!)[Chapter 3] \"NO! DON'T SHOOT HIM, PAPI, PLEASE!\" Van screamed at the top of her lungs as she shot up in the bed, Danny waking up not too far behind her, rubbing his eyes as he asked gruffly, \"Van?\" She slid out of bed, stood, rubbing her arms as she paced and bit her lip. She'd been having a nightmare, she'd dreamt that earlier, when her father and Danny got into it in her front yard, before he'd shown up to take her to prom, only this time, her father grabbed a gun and before she realized what'd happened, he'd pulled the trigger, aiming at Danny's head. Of course, her papi had been threatening to shoot him in their native tongue earlier when she'd went back home after prom and gotten almost all of her stuff, with Derek and Danny. He accused her of being pregnant – though she wasn't, and he called her trash now, because she was with a no good white boy skinhead.. \"Van, babe.. You okay?\" \"Danny, I should go back home.. I'm scared that he's gonna..\" Van started as Danny shook his head, leaned in, pulled her into a kiss as he said quickly, \"No. Hey, Van, if you're worried about me, babe.. Don't worry about me. He's not gonna hurt me, and he's not gonna hurt you anymore either.\" She groaned as his lips trailed slowly down her neck and leaning against him, she forced him to stop as she said calmly, \"Danny, this is serious. I'm scared right now.. What if he DOES hurt you? And it's my fault?\" \"Babe, he's not.. Derek is gonna talk to the cops in the morning, and my mom.. She's got every gun in the house within reach, since he made that threat.\" Danny explained patiently to his petite Latina girlfriend as he leaned in and pulled her into another kiss, his hands resting on her hips as he rested his forehead against hers and added, \"And anyway, you.. I'm not giving you up, Van.. I love you... Hell, if not for you and Derek, I'd still be the same douchebag skinhead guy who made your life hell before I realized how much I loved you.\" Van sighed heavily and then resting her cheek against his neck, she said quietly, \"You didn't do anything more to me than I did to you, Danny. And you saved me too.\" \"We're gonna be okay, Van, relax. This is all going to be okay. Derek's a smart guy, he'll find some way for us to be together without all of this unnecessary bullshit.\" Danny said as he looked at her, her father's words ringing in his ears, his imagination running wild. He thought Vanessa was pregnant, that's why she was leaving with Danny and his older brother. He'd slapped Van around right in front of them, called her all sorts of cruel and dirty names. Never had Danny been that angry in his life, but if he could have killed her father earlier he honestly would have, without so much as a second thought. He quickly got any and all futuresque thoughts out of his mind, although, seeing her playing with his youngest sister earlier had been a huge eye opener as far as future was concerned.. \"You're right. He'll figure something out.. How's your eye, te amo?\" \"It's okay, Van.\" he muttered as his lips lazily danced across the back of her neck. They lie there in the dark, wondering what life held in store for them next, Danny holding her against him, one arm behind his head, the other arm behind her back, his hand on her narrow hipbone. \"Love you, Van.\" \"Love you too, Danny. We need to sleep.\" \"We do, but I wanna make sure you're not gonna have another nightmare on me, babe.\" Danny said calmly as Van gave a slight giggle and said \"If you keep running your hand through my hair, Danny.. I'll be back asleep in no time.. You know I like that.\" The pair finally fell asleep and Vanessa lapsed into a dreamless, peaceful sleep for once, no fear or worries, the nightmare from an hour or so before forgotten for the moment, in his arms. ","Summary":" FIVE MINUTES- Alternate Ending to American History X (Instead of Danny getting killed, he gets shot"},{"Movie":"I, Robot","Title":"Second Class","Author":"Faeriessence","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8728750","Passage":"[Chapter 1] REWRITE: Nov 7 2014 Looks who's not dead. :v It's been more than a year since I updated and the last update wasn't even an update XD but a short note on rewriting. Yes, I did rewrite and I believe I am more equipped than I was when I first thought of writing this fic. Gosh, the original was horrible. I seriously had to rethink the direction of the story. Good Lord, \"Dylan\" was hard to read about. Basically, I found my OC to be annoying. Maybe it was just everything about the story. Anyway, I'm more deliberate these days and I'm trying to be careful in writing. Some aspects of the story have been changed, not that there was much being revealed prior to rewriting the story. Last update was March 2013, soooo, wow. 21 months before my I,Robot feels kicked in again. I was inspired by the later fics. Glad to see people still care. Saw the movie when I was nine. Now I'm nineteen. Still love it, still love Sonny. Story time. Sorry, I like to talk. 2055. Chicago. It was the end of yet another typical day at the office. Once the clock struck five, everyone was up an about- ready to get out, finally. Dylan sighed softly as she took off her glasses, rubbing her forehead in weariness. On any other day, she would have joined the others in their relief. But work sometimes swallowed her up, causing her to lose track of time like it did today. And she just wasn't so eager to be off. But the newswire didn't pay for overtime. Looking around, she could see that laughter and noise once again returning to the floor, replacing the sound of typewriters and ringing phones. The end was always the best part of the day for the employees. Happily, they got up from their work spaces, packed their things and left the newsroom, alone or in cliques. Dylan wasn't left with much of a choice but to leave the agency earlier than she would have wanted. She breathed in deeply before reluctantly placing her documents in her satchel. Before leaving her work place, the young journalist made it a point to follow a strict routine. It started with categorizing her papers and filing them in their respective drawers, then proceeding to wiping her desk clean, organizing the items on the desk top then finally doing a mental check list. Often times, she would be called out by her colleagues for taking too long. She smirked at a memory of her adoptive father scolding her for keeping her room 'too clean' when she was a kid. \"It's not normal,\" He would stress out. Yet back then, his words mattered so little since he was never really good at organizing his own space. It was her adoptive mother that highly encouraged cleanliness. After work, the female employees often headed to the restroom to freshen up. Though beauty was not her priority, looking neat was. She washed the hours off her pale face and gray eyes, then combed her long black hair, tying it back to a low ponytail. Dylan carefully cleaned her delicate metal framed glasses before putting it back on. In her peripheral vision she saw her office mates gossiping and giggling to themselves. Inwardly, she sighed, wishing she could get along with them better. It wasn't that they made fun of her, or that they left her out. Friends were often hard to find. The cool afternoon breeze met her as she exited the building; it was a pleasant change from ceiling vents and exhaust fans. The view from the entrance afforded a peek of the dried up lake, just beyond the cityscape; the skyline welcomed her in a warm glow that almost made her forget about life's complexities. Each time she stepped out from work, she would take it all in, comforted by the little blessings that had always given her courage whenever she needed it. Hesitantly, she made her way down the wide steps. It wasn't before she made it to the last tread that someone from behind called out to her. \" Hey Dylan!\" Immediately she knew who it was. She turned swiftly, causing some strands of her wavy raven hair to fall on her face. \" Samson,\" She said in relief, pushing away the loose tresses from her glasses. \"Yooh... I was wondering if you wanna go with me and the guys for some drinks.\" He said with a hopeful glint in his eyes. Dylan smirked at his boyish grin- one of the things that most of the women at work, herself included, found attractive. Samson was a columnist at the newswire. He was tall, lean, with short curly dark blond hair and blue eyes- relatively handsome- who loved to wear button downs and slacks. He was a great guy, friends with everyone; it was no surprise he became her friend. His persistence and good charm did the trick and it helped that his work space was just behind her. Initially, she found him to be annoying as being incredibly confident came off as arrogant in her opinion. But his friendly nature easily won her over and it didn't take too long for her to consider him close . Samson was usually the one who invited her out to lunch and dinner. Sadly, she would have to decline his offer this time. \"Thanks. But I got to go home.\" Dylan said, folding her arms and half turning. \"Oh come on. It's five in the afternoon. Way not past your ten o'clock curfew.\" He carped, gesturing with both his hands. She understood the slight implication and smirked, rolling her eyes as she did so. She turned in his direction and shrugged with a lopsided smile. \"Work.\" \"There's always work to do. Come on.\" Dylan continued to look at him as he walked down to her level. Samson placed an arm around her shoulder. \"Loosen up a little,\" he shook her gently. \"You know...It's a good time to hang out with other people, miss introvert.\" Dylan smiled at his lighthearted remark. She could not clearly recall how Samson had managed to pry out some of her hidden insecurities. \"Thank you..but not today. I promise, next time.\" She looked up at him, smiling in reassurance this time. Undeterred, he pouted and stared at her pleadingly. Dylan simply looked at him wryly. \"What's it gonna take for you to just relax a bit? There's more to life than journals and essays.\" \"I can't.\" She said, a little more serious this time. Samson continued to stare at her. Finally he pursed his mouth and let out a heavy breath. \"Okay, okay. Fine.\" He relented, releasing her. \"I'll just go now.\" He said, walking off. \"I was going to buy for you... Not too late to change your mind- just saying!\" He called out from afar, one last attempt to persuade her. She laughed, amused. \"Promise, next time. And I'll buy for both of us!\" Samson grinned eagerly before turning to leave. Once his back was turned and he was at a safe distance, she let her smile drop. He was right. There was more to life than work. And, it was the perfect time to socialize. It pained Dylan to say no. But the past weeks had kept her on edge. Nothing felt comfortable. Dusk painted the cityscape in pinkish orange. The ride back to her apartment was always her favorite moment after a long day at work. Inside the cab, she could see the sun setting beyond the buildings and skyscrapers; its ethereal presence, the same as it always was for as long as she could remember. But it was each time she caught a glimpse of the empty expanse of Lake Michigan, that a sense of nostalgia would fill her-wishing she had lived long before its waters dried up. Reluctantly, Dylan's eyes left the lake and trailed back to the documents on her lap. These papers had her tied in knots, trying to sort out and cross reference information. But she knew she needed to work fast, and work quietly. \"Where to, ma'am.\" A calm, collected voice broke her train of thought and half startled her. She blinked before meeting the driver's stare on the rear view mirror. \"Old Town.\" The NS-5 smiled and said nothing more. The ride home was silent. From idly watching the different passersby, Dylan's focus switched back to the robot. She eyed it carefully, deducing that this time around, it felt safer to have it drive her than an actual person. Robots were always better at driving and more so on navigating. Yet nothing compared to a pleasant conversation on the road with someone who responded 'naturally'. Human flaws be damned. As they rode silently through the bustling streets of Chicago, Dylan noticed that the NS-5 held a smile all throughout. Curious, she wondered if it could choose not to and if it liked to wear its human clothes. \"Do you have a name?\" She said to break the silence. The NS-5 simply looked back at her from the mirror with its crystal eyes. Its smile disappeared but its expression was apparent- seemingly considering the question. \"Robert.\" It replied in its silky programmed voice. Then it smiled again. For a moment, Dylan felt it to be genuinely happy that she spoke to it. Silence ensued and this time, she found it to be uneasy. \"So, ugh… Did you- choose. That name?\" She spoke tentatively. Mentally, she scolded herself for her awkward attempt and lack of social skills. It was even more embarrassing to be talking this way to a robot. She was just glad they didn't discriminate the way people did. \"Yes. I like the way it sounds.\" Robert said surely and proudly. Dylan instinctively quirked her brow, impressed by his show of opinion. The NS-5 looked at her knowingly before its eyes returned to the road. She looked towards their direction and realized they were almost there. By the next turn, she saw her stop. \"Just park there, by the bistro.\" She pointed out. Dylan was fortunate enough to have an apartment on a pleasant block that had the luxury of trees, apart from the industrialized city. It was a different place. They didn't call it 'Old Town' for nothing. People maintained its vintage charm, preferring it that way. Tiredly, she walked up the stairs to her apartment and opened the door. She hung her coat on a rack and neatly arranging her ballet flats by the door. After a quick shower, she threw on a loose shirt and mini shorts, and took out some leftover pasta in her fridge to put it in the microwave for dinner. She allowed herself to relax, taking her time but not taking too much of it. After the meal, it was back to work. Dylan went to her living room and plopped down on the couch. She smoothed a hand over her face and looked over to the documents on her coffee table. A slight grimace formed on her lips. They say crime never sleeps; didn't think she'd have any tonight either. She bent over the papers, scrutinizing each one with determined eyes. She lifted a sheet closer to her floor lamp to see it better. Hours passed and she was beginning to feel stuck. It came quick and suddenly she found herself taking off her glasses and pinching the bridge of her nose. An eye strain from hours of work straight, no doubt. She could call it quits for now- it was twelve midnight- but finishing it would guarantee it would be over quicker; she didn't want to keep her report hidden for too long. Otherwise, she'd be in trouble. The truth was, she was doing her own investigation on a small segment of the city's underbelly- her own relevance to the case, more or less an accident. She had been doing so for well over three months and it was a miracle, she's even still at it. She hadn't told anyone for the reason that nothing she had managed to dig up was substantial at the moment-despite her suspicions, and due to the fact that undercover reporting was beyond her regular line of work and sadly, outside anyone's pay grade at the newswire. She had yet to report to the authorities, knowing that publicizing it first would not at all guarantee her safety. These days, she wondered if she had been better off being a cop instead of a journalist- like her foster father suggested. Both professions shared the pursuit for the truth but journalism limited her in terms of defenses and certain rights. Yet it was the closest thing she had that didn't sacrifice her love for writing and the sense of justice her father instilled in her at a young age. It was also the career that her NS-5 friend advised her to take not too long ago when she was an awkward kid and a writer for her school's paper. Dylan smiled softly, memories of her old friend and care taker returning. As far as she can remember, he was perhaps her only true friend when she was younger. She met the NS-5 when she was in the middle of elementary school along with her adoptive parents. Friendship started out as anything but. She didn't want anything to do with the robot, much less be \"buddies\" with him. But life never guaranteed things to remain the same and later on before high school, she ended up forming a bond with him. In her teen years, she developed a set of peculiar habits that didn't sit well with the other people; it made her seem uptight, cranky and a \"clean-freak\"- they would say. The distress, she could hide from her mother and father but damn, was it impossible to hide from an NS-5's sensors. Now that she was older, Dylan would laugh whenever she remembered the robot's efforts to 'understand her brain', to a point wherein he studied sets of volumes under psychology. Yet, of all things he could have possibly done to be helpful, it was his companionship that got her by. It was unfortunate he left without telling her while she was off in college. Dylan came home one day and all he had for her was a 'hand written' letter in strictly Segoe Print font-a long piece that commemorated their relationship. She found it impossible to have been solely written by him. Impossible to have ever had any semblance of humanity and she would never admit she cried over it. The NS-5 hadn't shown up at her house since. Dylan was now twenty-five. Six years had passed since he'd left her and her parents. She often thought of him, wondering what he'd been doing all this time- what an NS-5 could be doing with its so called \"life\" at all. The constant reminder-was every other identical NS-5 robot she met in Chicago. Two decades had passed since the revolution. She had been too young to understand the circumstances when it occurred. Later on, it became a bed time story her parents told her that was basically about a \"big bad robot that controlled other robots to take over the world\". When she reached middle school, she did her research and learned about U.S. Robotics' Super Computer and the last of the NS series robots that were being produced. The damages caused by their technology, made their funds run dry and led the company to bankruptcy. It was later replaced with a government agency that built robots as helping tools and human operated machines instead. Dylan supposed that people must have learned their lesson on building anthropomorphic robots that did the entire job for them. It was a science fiction cliché- to have your greatest creation turn against you. Every possible story about smart robots had that whole 'mutiny' concept. Despite the close relationship she once had with her robotic friend, earlier on in her life, Dylan did not have a strong opinion on the NS-5's. But still, she pitied them for the way they were treated. At least people decided not to destroy them. They were cast out from the city to live in the container vans in Lake Michigan, with all the other junk. There were thousands of NS-5's and a few dozen NS-4's that functioned at the start of the exile. Now, only the NS-5's remained, their predecessors worn out with no compatible components to replace destroyed ones. Despite being outcasts, they had the permission to enter the city, at a given time. The stunt pulled by V.I.K.I. ultimately changed the world's view on the machines and without a doubt, people will not hesitate to shoot their processors dead once they acted out of order. Humans concluded they no longer needed mechanical hands, so the robots became a class all on their own, freed from the sole purpose of menial work. But rules remained- if they were to stay, they had to work like people, be like people, and take care of people. But they will always be considered less than people. No one argued with the logic-at least not openly. Dylan's caretaker gave her a different perspective regarding his kind, making her curious of the nature behind their being. Just recently, she had the opportunity to interview a store owner that \"killed\" his NS-5 employee. He probably would not have been in much trouble if he hadn't used his shot gun to shoot it at point blank range-in front of his patrons in sheer daylight. Dylan remembered the man to have been middle aged, looking like a stereotype sleazebag bitching about how the robot had wronged him so many times before. His story sounded like bullshit, having no grounds for accusing the poor machine each time she asked how. Professionalism made Dylan repress her own nasty opinion about him. People are crazy, machines are just faulty. Of course, in the end, this didn't count as murder. But talking to witnesses and some of the patrons made the reporter see the case in a new light. It surprised her that they were distraught by what had happened. Though an NS-5 was a cold machine to the general public, some people who frequented the store, actually befriended the robot. They said he was nice, helpful- unlike the grumpy manager. But no one legally testified for that robot, not even other robots. No one tried, no one couldn't. Weeks after the issue had blown over, Dylan chanced upon the store, on her way to an event. She came across two NS-5's standing by the place. Normally, it would be rude to stare, but she couldn't help but glance at them. She shared a fleeting look with one NS-5 which made her regret that she did. People said their expressions and emotions were programmed- just lights and clockwork. So how could this robot ever convey such sorrow in its synthetic eyes? Dylan sometimes replayed that scene in her head; it gave her something to think about, and some nights she would lie in bed, awake, wondering. Her work was cut short by a buzz that shot through the air. All of a sudden, the lights went out. Dylan growled in frustration, raising her hands up in defeat. She was just about to get to the last part of her research. She looked around before blinking her eyes a couple of times as they slowly adjusted to the darkness that flooded her apartment. She looked out the window and saw her entire block was out, faintly lit by the clouded moon. She guessed it was a sign to call it a day. After keeping her things and checking the lock, carefully, she made her way to her bedroom. She knew it would be warm in the morning, so she pushed up the glass pane of her window to let the air in. Her eyes had already grown heavy, her butt aching from having to sit in one spot for too long. And don't get her started on her back. Dylan straightened herself to stretch the sore muscles. After she brushed her teeth, she slipped into bed, falling asleep the minute her back was pressed flat on the mattress. … The next thing Dylan knew she heard movement from outside her room. At first, she wanted to dismiss the noise, her half-dream state causing her to be as such ease. But as her senses returned, awareness kicked in. The sound of footsteps . Dylan's eyes grew wider and her heart beat faster. Bolting up from the mattress, straight and shaken, she looked around her room. Instinct told her to turn the light on immediately. But she knew she mustn't do anything to grab attention. Was it the perfect time for a burglar? Of course, it was the perfect time. It was two in the morning. As quietly as she could, she walked over to her dresser and grabbed the most logical weapon available, an abstract statuette made of metal. She never realized how nervous she could feel once she fully registered the situation. A tight feeling coiled in her chest and her hands were suddenly very cold. The pit of her stomach was sensing the danger and she was dreading for the worst. Her hair was in a lazy mess but that was the least of her concerns that very moment. Quickly, Dylan tiptoed to her door, pushing an ear up against it. There was definitely someone in the apartment. And she sure as hell knew she didn't own a pet. Nor did she trust anyone with her apartment's key. Dylan knew better than to go out and see who it was. For all she knew, the intruder could have a gun. She listened once more to the footsteps outside. She looked at the knob and cursed silently, realizing she had not locked it. Since when did that step out of her bedtime routine? Hoping to God, they wouldn't notice, she clicked it shut as quietly as possible then moved close to her window and far from the door and dialed on her phone. She peeped through the shutters and saw that the lights haven't returned. Squinting her eyes, she could make out the shape of her neighbors' vehicles parked on the block. Night time activities had been cut short due to the power outage. Her phone continued to ring. Patience was growing thin and she began contemplating on whether to wait a little longer, or get out through her window, despite the five-story drop just below it. The door knob clicked and her heart stopped. Alright, it was time to leave the building. She poked her head out of the window to see a way out. It was too bad she didn't have a fire escape. The edging of the walls were incredibly narrow, allowing only a precarious climb down to the bottom. \" Emergency services, what's the emergency?\" Dylan gasped in sheer relief at the sound of the call.. \"I'm reporting a burglar in my home.\" She whispered nervously. \" We've traced your call to 1638 N North Park-\" BANG! The door was rammed open. Dylan instinctively yelped, struggling to keep the cell phone in her hand as she trembled. \"Please, help me! They're in my room!\" She cried out on her phone. There was no more the operator could do than the two complete strangers standing by the door way, shrouded in the dark. Dylan's blood grew cold as her grip tightened around the hard object in her hand. The two men lunged at her. Electricity shot through her nerves and she bolted to the side, barely evading one attacker. The other managed to grab one arm; without hesitating, she smacked the statuette into his skull and skidded towards the door. She slipped, slamming her knee on the tiled floor. Pain became irrelevant to the eminent fear as she quickly recovered, pulling herself up. A strong arm grabbed hers and she was thrown down to the floor, the back of her head hitting the surface hard enough to cause intense pain that clouded her wits but not enough to knock her lights out. Her mouth formed a wide O in silent agony-her mind scrambled with many thoughts but with one dominant enough to tell her to hit the assailant that was pinning her down. Finding a grip on the object she held earlier, she swung it to the side of the stranger's face. Her luck was running out as the man stopped the blow, grabbing the object and throwing it away. Dylan knew where this was heading. Her eyes widened, with only one likely scenario playing out in her head. But she refused to let that happen. Fear and adrenaline drove her; with all her strength she fought back, kicking the man repeatedly in the stomach and prying her arms from his grip. She managed to free her left hand and clawed at his eyes and practically anywhere that could cause pain and finally striking his neck. If the blow had been very hard, it would have killed him. But for her humanity's sake, she was lucky that it just stunned the man, enough to knock his weight off her. Still disoriented, and nearly spent, she kicked him square in the face. She was taught to fight. But only when it was deemed necessary. The next thing on her mind was to get the hell out. No sooner did she think that, Dylan looked over to her bedroom where the other assailant she subdued earlier laid. The terror in her eyes, when she realized he was nowhere in sight. Panic completely filled her world. Doom was suddenly inevitable. She quickly turned around, with the apartment's exit in mind. A blow to the head, and hope came crashing down, along with her. I did some research on Chicago, new reporting, and apparently how to deal with burglary for this since I've got very little background on these things, I'm not even American. :U So, I just hope no one finds any of the stuff I wrote kinda stupid. And the VIOLENCE PART. Yeah, I think you're smart enough NOT to try it on people unless you're in deep shit and you gotta do whatcha gotta do. I had to make the descriptions vague coz i felt like i was writing NOT good examples. :v Not to worry,BTW, our favorite NS-5 will be in the next chapter. :3[Chapter 2] Rewrite... Pain in her skull was the first to register in her senses. Then the sore of her body being cramped and contorted and the raw sting around her wrists. In her hazed state, Dylan slowly realized that she was tied up-her arms behind her back, and mouth taped shut, leaning to the side like a sack of potatoes. The constant shifting and unsteady setting gave her the hint that she was in a moving vehicle- a van. Cautiously, she eyed her surroundings, barely able to make out the appearances of the passengers. Street lights from time to time, faintly illuminated their faces, revealing men- three of them. One in the driver's seat and two, sitting in front of her. Oh God. The world just turned to hell and she was right in its center. Her breathing came in sharp puffs, panic rising fast. Instinctively, she tugged at the bindings on her wrist, twisting around in futility. She could not believe this was happening to her. Who would want to believe at all? Journalism did have these occupational hazards. But she wasn't that kind of journalist. Dylan could only imagine what these shady men were up to and her guesses were not far-fetched from inevitable. She was aware of what happened to those brave yet unfortunate men and women who delved into dark and obscured territory. She'd seen it, read it, wrote about it. Nothing felt worse than knowing that she might not live to see tomorrow. The chances of escape were incredibly slim, and it was hard to think under the pressure of unknown factors. It was highly unlikely that these people meant no harm yet she wasn't certain they'd kill her either. Tears threatened to escape her strained eyes. Multiple thoughts ran through her head. Reason forced her to keep her sanity. The world can be cruel and painful. The natural impulse of crying over the predicament was so much easier to carry out. But if she wanted to live , then she'd have to slap herself hard , mentally, and face the situation no matter how frightening it was. Because at this point, she could not be in a better one. Pushing away the strong terror, Dylan's hands searched the floor-finding anything possible to use. A small cutter, maybe? If life could be more accommodating. She struggled to gain leverage. Something hard and metal tapped her skull, making her freeze. \"Move and I'll shoot,\" she heard a gruff voice say. Dylan looked up tentatively, shaking, at a caliber directed at her. Something intangible but undeniably heavy dropped down from her chest to her stomach. And all of a sudden, she felt as though she no longer had courage to spare. A vague memory, one in which she convinced herself that she was stronger than most and smarter came to mind, and she couldn't help the embarrassment of failing to live up to that ideal. She forced a hard stare at the man and his pistol, despite herself. She was sweating and trembling yet, her thoughts roused a small voice that whispered to her-that she could at least die with dignity. But at this rate, if she had looked brave and unyielding, the stranger on the other end of the weapon was not convinced at the very least. The sound of a smirk confirmed that. She could sense more than see the man's arrogance, coming off like a fragrance; all their smug, callous faces momentarily replaced fear with prickling irritation. The shift in ambiance signaled to her that they were no longer on the streets. Dylan looked up towards the window, seeing a black starless sky. There was no clear indication as to where they were headed though she could only assume that they were on a dark road, surrounded by vast lands. There was no such thing in the overly industrialized city of Chicago. Not in this age- there could only be one place... The Lake. Dylan felt a cold shiver crawl down her spine. Panic ensued, catching up to her throat. There was nothing out there but miles and miles of desolate dry sand and decaying garbage, hardly anything that crawled nor walked on four legs,much less people. From her view, the sky had not changed in a long while. They were going further and further into the desert-further away from the nearest settlement, and her only chance for salvation. She prayed for her dear life that they would not drive beyond ear shot nor the sight of lake Michigan's disintegrating bridge. The darkness concealed her search for a potential weapon-without moving as much, yet it did nothing to make her feel any safer nor stronger for that matter. Fortunately, the men guarding her had not done anything to show they took notice. The vehicle came to an abrupt halt, Dylan suddenly found herself being thrown to the opposite side. In a stroke of luck, her hand was able to clamp on something small. For everything's sake- she hoped it was useful. The kidnappers were getting up from their seats. Shit. There was a strange mix of fear, anxiety and nausea that coiled in her. One man placed a hand on her arm, pulling her roughly and halfway through the sliding door in one swift motion. She let out a small muffled grunt, feeling the pain on her rib from being dropped carelessly. In one futile attempt, Dylan pulled against his grip, but only to be dragged down to the dirt. The cold desert wind was as severe as their remorseless actions. One man shoved her to her knees and held her in place, as though to execute a hostage; there was no difference. She hoped one of the men was egotistic enough to start an aimless tirade- to provide her more time to think and escape. Dylan was suddenly grabbed by the chin in a startling movement and was forced to look up. The pale moonlight illuminated her captor's face- middle aged and worn down from years of crime and underground dealings. He was a typical looking criminal-dressed like the two goons he had with him, yet his demeanor suggested he was wiser than most. \"I didn't expect you to be able to put up a fight.\" He patronized. The man could feel her sharp breaths blowing down on his hand. Decades of experience made him adept at piercing through a brave facade and he could see the underlying fear behind her severe expression. \"Bitch can fight.\" She heard one goon mutter. The man turned his attention away to glare at the other- not amused by the context, before returning to her. \"It takes more than a couple of idiots to bring you down. No?\" Despite the blatant condescension and the taunting manner in which he spoke in , Dylan felt a hint of satisfaction, knowing the statement to be true. He released her jaw forcefully, having a frustratingly smug expression on his old face, and looked towards one of his goons, gesturing for something. \"You realize you've outsmarted us a few times. But did you really think we wouldn't find out sooner?\"Dylan did not register the meaning behind the question until he held up what appeared to be a dark rectangular case... It was her satchel. Dylan yelped in surprise. Impulsively, she tugged at the restraints, disregarding the nasty smirks when their suspicions had been verified. Luckily, her struggle was not in vain as it prompted them to remove the gag. She let out a breathy gasp. \"Please! You can have it! Just let me go!\" Dylan begged. She did not want to, yet the prospect of keeping her dignity suddenly became so irrelevant. The man chuckled huskily, ignoring her pleas. He casually reached into her bag and pulled out a small card. \"Dylan... Spooner,\" he read aloud, and casted her a cool sidelong glance thereafter. \"Are you by any chance, related to police commissioner Del Spooner?\" He spoke casually, a clear intent to intimidate her. Dylan remained quiet, choosing to stare at him defiantly. \"No? Your name even sounds a little like his. Though.. I don't see the resemblance.\" He gestured at his own face. The man feigned ignorance of the journalist's contempt. Frankly, he found the stubborn look she gave him to be fairly amusing, considering the odds against her. \"He's been trying to track down our operation for years. But each time he get close to finding us, let's just say, we're very good at cleaning up after.\" He paused and regarded her, searching for a reaction. She dared not give him that satisfaction. \"We don't let anyone get past us. Once they step out of a certain boundary, we step in.\" With slow intimidating strides, he came to stand in front of her. The man was now dangerously close to where she knelt, and carefully, he lowered himself to her eye level. \"We know you've been following us for the past few weeks.\" He looked at her intently, hoping to gauge out fear but what came next took him aback. \"Months.\" She interjected snidely. It was too good to resist injuring his idiotic pride. Perhaps this man was not as smart as he made them out to be. Her ploy worked; the man glared at her, clearly affected. \"It's an expensive business, what we do.\" He brushed off, quickly regaining his composure. Albeit, he spoke with acid in his diction. \"You destroy innocent lives! You kidnap people and sell them off like animals!\" \"Are we no different?\" He replied flippantly. \"How can you be like this? Don't you have a family?!\" Unfazed by her raw anger, he simply turned to her with a cold, apathetic expression. He spoke lowly. \"You're a reporter . Haven't you learned by now that the world is a cruel, unfair place?\" Dylan stared back in horror, silence signifying the end of their little conversation. The man finally stood up and turned his back to her. \"You kill me now, my father will come looking for you!\" It was a final attempt to keep herself alive. Unbeknownst to the journalist, a sadistic smile played on the man's lips upon hearing her desperate tone.\" I wouldn't count on it.\" He replied confidently. \"But... It would be a waste to kill you now.\" Something in the way his tone darkened and the heavy silence that followed made her blood run cold; an icy feeling traveled down her spine. \"We're going to have a little fun.\" Dylan's eyes widened with realization. What they had in store for her, whatever it was, she would rather not know. If there was a chance of freedom, it would be now or never as the leader turned towards the van. One of his men grabbed her by the shoulder. In a split second, Dylan stabbed the man with a screw bolt. She did not have the time to wonder as to how an object such as that would wind up on the van's carpet floor, but it was all she could hope for- small but possibly lethal. It was tiny enough to be concealed in her hand as she picked on the restraints and sharp enough to aid her. Caught off guard, the goon could only focus on the intense pain of metal puncturing bone. Dylan didn't wait to elbow the man in the face and pivot her leg around to knock him off his feet. The other goon made an attempt to grab his gun from his pocket. Fueled by adrenaline, Dylan picked up a rock and bashed it on his face. Her mind and heart were racing simultaneously. She could only form one coherent thought- run. Immediately, she was held by her arms. The leader was facing her this time with a look that could only be read as \"kill\". \"You little bitch!\" He snapped. Dylan paled at his deadly expression. For a brief moment, she could only stare in shock, her mind stunned. When she came to, she fought to get away. The man threw her down, pinning her to the ground. She should've known better than to expect him to be more of a gentlemen than his colleagues. She suffered a few punches to the face before kicking his shin as a last resort. The smaller woman shoved him off with all the strength in her legs. Dylan did not realize the craze she was suddenly thrown in. All there was was survival. She pried herself away and ran as fast as she could. Nothing felt more exhilarating in her entire life. She screamed for help as she dashed into the wilderness. A shot fired, it missed. Then another. She kept going, she couldn't look back. Then a third one came. And no more. Meters away, she crashed to the ground. Pain blossomed on her left side and she dared to touch it. Warm blood gushed out from the bullet wound. Course sand stuck to her bloodied skin. She cried out when her body finally realized it. Dylan felt footsteps walk towards her and she knew it was all over for her. Physical and mental exhaustion caught up to her, her body was surrendering. \"Unbelievable. What do I hire you pansies for?!\" She heard the man yell at his team. Dylan's hearing began to slur as her mind caved in to fatigue. \"Just kill her,\" was the last coherent thing she heard. One goon raised a gun to her face, yet all she could see was a black silhouette before a dark ombré sky. She couldn't believe she was going to die. Her mind raced to think about every possible thing she cherished but most of all how truly sorry she was to her love ones. She waited for the shot to be fired, but it never came. The sound of a swift rotating motion diverted the gunner's focus and inclined him to look up to his left. An NS-5 shot down on him like a spinning bullet. It took hold of his gun and turned in one fluid motion, to the other goon preparing to shoot. With zero warning, the NS-5 pulled the trigger, shooting him square in the chest. It glanced at her, making a move to run to her side. Before it could do anything else, a bullet went through it's hard light skull and ended it's programming. Dylan stared in shock at how fast events shifted, as she was now lying faced to a lifeless NS-5, it's damaged hardware creating small sparks on the side of it's head. Four more NS-5 came in from nowhere. One of them came to kneel down beside her. She looked up, bleary and breathless. \"I will stop the bleeding.\" It calmly stated. No argument at that. It tore at the hem of her shirt. Dylan failed to stifle her wail as it clamped down the cloth with its hand on her wounded side. The rest circled the man and his remaining goon. They shot at them but the NS-5's easily dodged their hits with superhuman dexterity. The goon managed to shoot at a robotic arm, yet the machine continued as though it was only the wind that brushed through it. He tried shooting at them again, each bullet wasted. Two of the robots quickly subdued him. \"I told you sorry ass windup toys to stay out of our business!\" The last one- their leader yelled, finding no other way out. His gun was in his hand, threatening to shoot. \"Need I remind you that-!\" It cut him off as one robot bolted forward and struck his arm. The blow caused him to drop his weapon and clutch his fractured joint, inadvertently making the man stagger backwards. \"You piece of scrap! Do you know what we'll do to you?\" No reply. The NS-5 stalked towards him and met him face to face, leveling with him. It gazed at the man with narrowed piercing eyes. There was a deep, searing hatred in it's stare- one which no one had ever seen. And that was it. The desperation on the man's face morphed into horrific understanding. Before he could even say a word, the NS-5 jabbed an arm forward and grabbed him by the head- ending his existence with a brutal snap. Dylan witnessed the ruthless scene, yet the weariness and numbing pain caused her to be entirely still with not much care for morality all throughout. One thing clear was the relief that washed over her when she realized it was finished. She could never be more thankful the entire ordeal was over. But here was a whole new one that she wasn't certain of. The NS-5 that was bent over her, carefully lifted her off the ground as painless as possible, it seemed. She no longer had the strength to resist and could only manage to groggily push against it's chest and ask if they were really there to save her. \"You are safe now, Dylan Spooner.\" Hearing the calm reassurance in it's voice and weighing the options that remained, she slumped down, resting her head on it's shoulder. Everything suddenly felt detached, and her senses were now fading. She could no longer hold out, and finally she allowed herself to slip in unconsciousness. It didn't feel too long before she woke up in a metal room of corrugated walls, to a low humming of fluorescent lights reverberating around the enclosed space. She surveyed the scene as her vision was gradually returned. It looked to be the inside of a container van. Dylan made a move to sit up from what was an uncomfortable make shift bed. She winced. \"No, no. Please lie back down. I am almost finished.\" Dylan started. She quickly turned to the other side to see an NS-5 stitching up her wound. Sje had to give herself a moment to collect her thoughts; her eyes glazed over. \"I believe it hurts less when you don't stare at it.\" The NS-5 said, in it's ever so silky voice. Dylan heard him after a few seconds and silently complied. She laid back, as slowly as the closing gash would allow. Dylan would have sighed deeply if it were not for the wound contracting. She was careful not to lie on the side of her head where her other injury was. \"Thank you...\" Her voice came low and hoarse but the NS-5 did not fail to comprehend and smiled back. \"You're welcome.\" Dylan winced once more before it finally clipped off the thread. \"... where am I?\" She slowly asked. \"You are at the U.S.R. decommission site.\" \"Couldn't you have at least brought me to a hospital?\" \"Negative. There were no proper means of transportation and you were in serious need of medical attention.\" Enough said. Dylan couldn't find a more suitable argument. Although, there were other less relevant yet still pressing matters she wanted to address. She bent her head down slightly to get a good look of her stitched up wound. \"How did u manage to find equipment?\" \"I assist medical technicians and pharmacists at the general hospital. I take care of supplies. There are plenty that are left unused and are thrown away.\" What the fu- The implication spurred something in her, even the fatigue could not keep her too tired from reacting. \"Wait- so, you're using- these aren't?\" Dylan stammered when she found she could not ask her question directly- if not politely, but more so due to panic. NS-5 was quick to assuage her fears, with no apparent offense being taken. \"There is no cause for alarm. I am programmed with proper medical procedure. I assure you that the equipment I used are sterile.\" \"You said, these got thrown away.\" She croaked. \"No, I did not say that. I only said that plenty of medical supplies go to waste. I did not specify that these did.\" \"I'm- I'm sorry. I, I hate dirt.\" Dylan mumbled as she folded her arms together and pursed her lips. \"Understandable.\" She looked up at the robot and saw that it's pleasant expression had not wavered. Hesitantly, she spoke once more, to relieve the awkward silence that she felt. \"So- why do you keep these things with you?\" \"I find acquiring items to be enjoyable. Do you not?\" Dylan nodded in agreement. She looked on as the NS-5 carefully cleaned the closed wound and took note of how it did so with such precise movements. \"What do I call you?\" She said. The NS-5 regarded her as though it didn't expect her to care at all. It looked as hesitant as she whenever she would start a conversation. \"Florence.\" Dylan instantaneously smiled, knowing that nothing could have suited him more at that moment. Her smile soon faded when a particular thought came to mind. Florence immediately recognized the apprehension and his smile disappeared in suit. \"... Those men...\" Dylan looked at him tensely, unable to voice all her thoughts out. \"They cannot hurt you anymore.\" He spoke softly. \"You killed them.\" Her voice was a rough whisper. Silence thickened the air and Dylan wished she could have stayed on the flip side of this. It was an issue she could not leave unsaid but he too understood the gravity of the situation. Florence's expression dropped slightly along with his gaze. \"Yes... But not by my hand.\" \"... Why?\" \"... We have seen these people before..\" He slowly began. It was as though he ignored her question, but she surmised that perhaps he was getting to that. Yet there was a dismal tone in his voice that surprised her- she had not expected an NS-5 to be capable of expressing regret. Dylan watched him silently with somber eyes as he continued. \"They've done horrible things, to your own kind, out here. We've seen them hurt and murder people...Our directive is to protect human life under all circumstances. We had tried to stop them, without truly harming anyone.\" A hint of desperation was suddenly picking up in his speech, as though he was pleading for her to believe. His next statement had thrown her off completely. \"But we learned, the hard way, that some people are better off dead.\" In his heavy gaze was everything else left unsaid and so much she could not fathom. Dylan found it hard to believe such a grave confession could ever come from an NS-5. A robot programmed with the three absolute laws had just told her it was alright to let people die. \"What.. Do you mean?\" She squeaked. \"We are not murderers,\" he spoke firmly, aware of her doubts. \"We prevent harm from ever befalling on people. But we never understood then, that perhaps, some human should not be saved. When we spared these men's lives, they came back and killed some of my fellow robots- for interfering with their 'business'; it was a stern warning to stay out of their way.\" \"Kill? But you NS-5's are repairable. You can fix yourselves.\" Dylan jerked back, when the NS-5 suddenly turned towards her almost fiercely. \" With what? It has been so long since we have been left to our own devices-long since U.S. Robotics had been mass-producing replacements .\" His tone was steady, and it was a wonder how a placid voice could convey the amount of despair that only showed through his glass eyes. Dylan felt a pang of guilt, though she hoped her expression was not one that patronized. This was an entirely different level of understanding she had yet to learn, and there was so much she did not know about these robots. In fact, she had only begun to see the hidden nature of these 'machines'. Dylan waited patiently before he returned to his normal composure. \"We had not interfered until now.\" \"... Why?\" She asked again. The NS-5 had fallen silent once more. Then he spoke. \"Because you are a friend.\" She felt a mild shock mixed with confusion. It was soon when Dylan realized what he really meant. \"Where is she?\" \"There is no need to panic-\" \"I need to see her!\" She heard voices from outside the room. The door of the container van was suddenly pulled open as an NS-5, frantic as it could ever be, rushed in- it's light steps making little noise on the steel floors. Dylan had subconsciously backed up against the wall, alarmed by its frazzled state. She stared at the NS-5, dumbfounded as it immediately placed a cool hand on her cheek- a tender but familiar gesture. \"Dylan.\" There was a sense of longing and great concern as it said her name; it sounded like any other NS-5 but she knew she had not heard this voice in years. She froze over as they gazed at each other, gray eyes meeting strikingly blue ones. She was very tired, she could not trust herself to be seeing right. Who- Finally, her stare fell to its arm- misshapen and bearing the unmistakable marks of acid... Wha-? Dylan gaped at the vision before her. Clear blue eyes, distinctly marred alloy, and a look of concern that was solely for her. It'd been six years. \" Son ...of a bitch.\" There we go.. Its pretty obvious who this is.. :) I remember the original story to have been way faster, Dylan actually met Sonny in the first chapter, but here, i kind of stretched it to the end of chapter 2. The fight scenes were written real quick, didn't want to go into details or get really dragging. ","Summary":" REWRITE: Nov 7 2014 Looks who's not dead. :v It's been more than a year since I updated and the las"},{"Movie":"I, Robot","Title":"Wired for love","Author":"Mastermindhunter","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6472025","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's note: Yay! My first I robot fanfic. I'm so excited. For those of you who love romances, this story is just right for you. I hope this is half as good as it is in my mind. Everyone has their own version of a perfect fanfiction. For some it's not the same as others. This is my story. This story is about Sonny's new owner after the movie. She is a young girl about the age of eighteen. It has a few moments of suspense, and a few parts of sadness. Most likely will not turn into an M rated fanfic. For now I'll keep it T rated. Well, however the wind blows this fanfiction, we'll see. I will be using a refferance of Sonny as a \"he\" not an \"it\". As far as I know, he is a charecter in my mind. Enjoy, and happy reading. Please review if you do not mind. Sonny stared out the window of USR. He was in Dr. Calvin's office, which used to be Lawrence Robertson's. She was now the president of USR, and had set things normal, or at least close to normal after the whole revolution. Sonny watched the streets, carefully. Dr. Calvin kept an eye on him, ever since the revolution. Sonny stared down at the streets. Each human walking through the streets of Chicago. Dogs walked by the old NS-4s. NS-4s picking up trash cans, emptying them into garbage trucks. Humans smiling to the NS-4s, as a sign of job well done. Would he ever be able to help humanity like his model was designed to do? The thought of not having a family drove him mad. Sure, he was made for emotions, and to stop V.I.K.I., but what of his world now? He glanced over to Dr. Calvin. \"Dr. Calvin. Do you think that if I could, I could go to a household? Be bought by someone? Nothing would be better for me than to help in a household.\" He said straight forward. His blue eyes sparkled a bit. This was not surprising to Dr. Calvin. It was in the robot's wiring to help people. In his model type anyway. She raised an eyebrow. A few papers were being cleared in her office. She shrugged as she was moving quickly around, tidying up the papers. \"Perhaps. But, then again, it would be sort of difficult, finding your model type a home. After all, your kind were all sent out of the city, so who knows who would accept you.\" She said her voice sounding flustered. \"Now, please help me clean my office. Detective Spooner will be here any minute.\" She panted as she was trying to clean up the room. He obliged, and helped her pick up the papers, amung the rest of the things scattered about. \"Yes, Doctor.\" He took a few pieces of trash, that no longer were needed. Amung her many things, he found a picture of Dr. Lanning. That was quite strange. She never really kept very many pictures in her office. Quickly scanning the details of the picture, he started taking in the information of the photograph. In the picture, Dr. Lanning was wearing a surgeons outfit. It was a mint green color. He was smiling happily, along with a young girl. She looked about the age of five, maybe even older. The picture looked old, and very tattered. Dr. Lanning looked more youthfull than he did when he died. It must have been a long time ago. The girl in the photo was wearing a hospital gown. She was looking at the camera with a big smile on her face. She was being given a piggyback ride by Dr. Lanning. This mysterious young girl had cherry red hair, that was rather limp and straight, and very long. Along with that she had green eyes. They seemed a bit big in proportion to her face. They seemed almost doe like. Freckles dusted her face. Her skin was ghostly, and white. Not the healthiest color. It reminded him of his own white aloy. On the back of the photo, there was no date, or words, so he had no clue how old it was. He put it on the desk in the center. Perhaps later he would ask about it. In no time, the whole room was cleaned, and spotless. Spooner arrived, right on the clock. He came in, and had coffee. The two had been speaking about meaningless nothings, and joking about with each other. Sonny had not really paid attention to what they were talking about. He was too busy thinking about a suitable home. There had to be somebody in the world that he could help. Somebody to accept him for who he was. Spooner had chuckled at something silly Dr. Calvin had said. He had brought the cup of coffee up to his lips, and was about to take a sip. Suddenly he spotted the picture on the desk, that Sonny had put there. Smiling he had put his cup down, and got up, taking long strides over to the desk. \"Hey, I was wondering where I left this. Where did you find this?\" He held it up to Dr. Calvin. His face was one of confusion. She got up out of her chair, and walked over to the photograph. He handed it to her, and she studied it. She could never forget Dr. Lannings face, but the little girl was mysterious to her. \"I didn't even know this was here. This picture belongs to you?\" She asked. He nodded. \"Yeah. It must've fallen out of my wallet one day.\" She handed him the photograph, and he tucked it into the wallet. As he walked back to his chair, he noticed Sonny's face. He was definitely troubled as Spooner could see. His arms were resting on his knees, and his eyes looked down. For a robot, he sure knew how to look sad. Walking over to Sonny, he laid a hand on his shoulder. \"Hey, Sonny. What's eating you, man?\" He asked, smiling. Hopefully the smile would be returned. Unfortunately it wasn't. Sighing with a bit of grief in is voice, he stood up. Once again, he made his way towards the window. A finger motioned Detective Spooner to come closer. Spooner walked towards the window. Sonny held his palm open, and waved it near the window, showing that he was staring down at the city. \"Detective Spooner. Look out at the city. What is it that you see?\" Spooner looked out the window closely. He saw many things, and didn't exactly know what he was looking for. He shook his head slowly, not exactly knowing what to use as an answer. Quickly he glanced around. \"Uhhh, I see two little boys eating a lollipop, a teenager talking on the phone, and a very attractive woman slapping some dumb ass dude, who was most likely trying to use some lame pick up line on her.\" He laughed. Dr. Calvin chuckled a bit at Spooner's joke. Sonny smiled at Spooner's jokes. Still the purpose of the question was not to find humor in this. Not getting rid of his smile, he returned to the window. \"That is not what I see. You see people in everyday life. Though I see something beyond that. Something amung each of those people. What if those two little boys could not reach those pieces of candy at the store? Perhaps that teenager had to run back to the house to get that phone. What if I could have helped that girl in getting rid of that man? You see a world in motion. That is not what I see. I see oppourtunity. An oppourtunity to help the world. I was made for that purpose. Do you see what I mean by that Detective?\" Spooner stared at him for a moment. He turned back to the window, and nodded. \"I understand, perfectly.\" He then got his wallet out of his pocket, and stared at it. He did not open it, but merely stared at it. \"What if I told you, that I could find you a human to take care of? One that is nice. One that is will give you a home. One that always cares about others.\" Sonny stared at him quickly. The thought of this was interresting. \"I have a very close friend. She is about eighteen years old. She works in a small book store. Sometimes she has trouble when it comes to walking around. Since she lives alone, I think it would be rather nice to to have someone to talk to, and to help her, be she in any trouble.\" Sonny was listening. \"You wanna meet her? She is a really considerate person. She loves to read alot of books, and go to church. I think you would make a really nice robot for her. What's better is she lives right here in Chicago.\" Sonny was excited. He thought this would be a grand idea. A chance to coexist within a family, even if it were a small family. What was better was that he would never be too far away from detective Spooner, and Dr. Calvin had he ever needed their help. He stood there smiling. \"I would like that very much. Tell me what is her name?\" Spooner smiled. \"Her name is Tiffany. I think that in view of this situation, you'll make a great friend for her.\" Sonny smiled. He felt his wires getting warm, for he would get to meet this Tiffany, and make her life so much better. Was she interesting? Distinguishing? \"I'll ring her up.\" He took out his phone, and pressed a button. Slowly he started pacing the floor. \"Hey, Gigi. It's me . . . Yeah. It's great talking to you too. Listen, you know Tiffany's number right? . . . Oh, she's at your house? . . . Well, do you mind if I could talk to her for a sec?\" He winked at Sonny, and waited for a little moment. \"Hello . . . Hey, Tiffany! . . . I'm doing just fine. How you doing? . . . Oh, really. I'm sorry to hear that. Hey listen, uhhhhh . . . do you like surprises?\" He turned to Sonny, and raised his eyebrows. A small smile flit across his face. \"Really? You do? . . . No, it's not a bad surprise. . . . I have a special gift for you. . . . No, no. I can't tell you what it is. . . . I'll show you tomorrow. . . . Be at gigi's house tomorrow at ten . . . You're welcome. . . . Alright, bye. . . . \" He clicked the button on his earphone, and put it in his pocket. He nodded to Sonny. \"Well, Sonny, you're in luck. She's gonna meet you tomorrow.\" Sonny looked delighted. \"Do you think she'll show up?\" He asked thinking of what she must have looked like. \"I am so nervous.\" Spooner made raspberry noises, as if that was rediculous. \"Don't act nervous. She's much shyer than any person I have ever met in my life. If anything, she'll be the nervous one.\" He got up out of his chair, and took the last sips of his coffee. \"I met her when she was just a little girl, so she'll trust me.\" With that he grabbed his jacket, and made his way to the door. \"I'll give you a ride tomorrow if you need one.\" He dissappeared into the building. Only Dr. Calvin and himself were in the room. That night, Dr. Calvin had left the building. She was closing everything down. Sonny watched as she reached for her key, in her pocket. Before she left, one final question was asked. \"Dr. Calvin. Do you think that Tiffany will like me?\" \"Well, she's a friend of Detective Spooner, so there is a small chance she might not. Then again, robots are a normal part of life, so how could she not want you?\"[Chapter 2] Tiffany came into the house. Gigi was sitting at her table, knitting something, with her cat next to her. At her stealthiest, Tiffany closed the door silently. It was inaudible. Not even a creak. Perfect. She flattened herself up against the wall, and noticed that Gigi still had not noticed her. She was gunna love this. The plan was to sneak into the room, and not get noticed at least get her a little surprised or something. She looked around the corner, and she was still knitting. This was going to be great. Slowly she crouched down, and got low to the ground. Not even the cat could see her. Oh, this was rich. She never even got this far before. Finally she started getting closer. Finally she was so close. \"You can't fool me, Tiffany. Del has tried, and he's a cop.\" In mid crawl, Tiffany stared at her, her mouth agape. How did she do that? She wasn't supposed to hear things. She was just an old lady. Still Spooner had tried also. He tried to get her all the time, and it never worked. She got out from her crouch, and stood up straight. Gigi smiled to her. Tiffany smiled back. \"Well, don't act like a stranger, baby. Give Gigi a hug.\" Tiffany grinned, and looked up at Gigi. She gave her a tight hug. She raised an eyebrow when she pulled back. \"How did you I was here?\" She questioned. A few dishes were in the sink, so Tiffany helped clean a few. Most of the dishes looked like pie dishes. She was probably making pie in the oven. Gigi shook her head. \"I have my ways. Have you been talking to Luke lately, doll?\" She shook her head. \"No, Gigi. I haven't talked to Luke.\" She said sitting at the table with her. Gigi stared at her with a bit of aggrivation. \"You know, when I was a little girl, if I were taking medecine, I would talk to my doctors, and ask them questions. I wouldn't just pretend the problems weren't there.\" Tiffany pretended to be asleep. She made a snoring noise. \"Tiffany.\" She pretended to wake up. \"I bet that if I stopped making pies, you would talk to Luke.\" She giggled with happiness, as she finished drying the last spoon. The shiny reflection of the spoon showed her own face. \"I have a few yarn balls in the living room, if you would like to bring those out to me.\" \"Yes, Gigi.\" She put the spoon in the drawer, and walked into the living room. Meanwhile, Spooner, and Sonny were upstairs, getting ready to meet her. Sonny stared at her as she grabbed the yarn balls. He was spying on her from the top floor. She had long red hair that went all the way down to her waist. It was cherry red. The hair was straight, and long without much of a poof. It was very slick to her head. Her eyes were green as the grass. They seemed to be large and doe like in accordance to her face. Her bone structure was very different. It was boney, and almost seemed gaunt, as if she was really sick or something. Her slender body did not look right. It seemed as if she had an eating problem. Her face held on to a few freckles that went from one cheek across the bridge of her nose, to the other. He recognized her right away. \"That is the little girl from the photograph. This must be her . . . all grown up. Am I correct?\" Spooner looked down at her and smiled. \"Yep. That's right.\" Sonny looked back down at her. As she was walking back, Sonny looked down at her legs. Something was not right. Right where her legs were supposed to be, there were none. Her legs stoped right above the knee. She had a pair of slender pole like prosthetic legs. At the end there were fake metal feet. They had gears, and cogs on the inside. She had no legs, but it seemed like she could move her prosthetic legs. Perhaps her prosthetic legs were connected to nerve recepters, like Detective Spooner's arm was. She must have lost her legs before Detective Spooner lost his arm. Her prosthesis didn't have any skin replications. It was mechanical for all to see. Sonny's mouth opened only slightly from the surprise of her legless form. His eyes looked a bit bulged from the shock. He turned to Detective Spooner quickly. \"She has no legs!\" He whispered with the smallest hint of shock. Detective Spooner looked down at her from the upstairs hallway. He didn't looked surprised since he knew this all too well. She held three yarn balls, but while walking, she fumbled, as her prosthetic legs gave out. She quickly clutched on to a tall floor lamp. The yarn balls bounced around the room. \"Yes, I know, Sonny.\" Slowly she pulled herself up to her fake legs. In the middle of fumbling, she looked down at the part that was her knee. She saw one of the mechanical links was out of place, in the knee joint. \"When she was five years old, she lost both her legs above the knee.\" She took a small screw driver out of her purse, and fixed it right on the floor. \"A year later, she met me in physical therapy, when I lost my left arm.\" She tinkered with it a few times, and when she stood up, she was as good as new. \"Dr. Lanning gave her new legs, just like he gave me a new arm. She lost her legs before I lost my arm, so her limbs are an older model than mine.\" She slowly got onto her prosthetics, and when they were both flat on the ground, she tried to keep her balance, by holding her arms out, to steady herself. Quickly she picked up her yarn balls, and took them into the room. A wave of sympathy washed over him. He felt sorry for her. Loosing her legs, almost entirely. That was something truely horrible. Also such a catastrophy at the age of five. That was even worse. She was quite an interesting human. Not only was she very fragile looking, she had already had an accident in the past. An accident that had happened before he was around. The room had been revisited by her coming in. Sonny gazed down at her, as she picked up the knitting needles. She was quite a strange little human. She was probably the most interesting human he had ever seen. That was when he knew. He knew he had to do whatever it had to take to help this truely unique human out. He smiled up to Detective Spooner. \"I would very much like to meet her, and belong to her.\" Spooner looked at him and grinned. \"Okay. I'll introduce you right away.\" He said assuringly. Tiffany had been sitting in the kitchen. Her red hair was being braided by Gigi. It was a pastime that they both enjoyed very much. It made Tiffany feel like she was a child again. Though she was eighteen she never acted much like a child. On the outside she was a typical teenager. On the inside however, she acted like an older woman. She just considered herself to be an old soul. As she sat there, she saw Spooner walk in. \"How's my main chick doing?\" He said happily. Tiffany looked at him, and smiled, jumping into his arms. He picked her up, and spun her around. She seemed more than happy to meet Spooner. \"Wow, look at you. I keep forgetting how big you're getting. Well, you're still skinny, but age wise, you are growing quite well.\" \"Thanks.\" She said. \"Gigi says I need to talk to Dr. Luke, but as far as I know, I feel fine.\" She chirped. \"So how you doing big fella?\" She jokingly punched his shoulder. \"You getting any time off from the station?\" She asked, sitting back down, so Gigi could finish braiding her hair. Spooner shook his head. \"Nope. You know me. Rather be there in the station, than sitting around the house.\" He said sitting down. \"Well, you should get a bit off time off. You tend to work too much. You need to take some time off. Go talk to Marcy, or something. Right? Am I right, Gigi?\" Gigi simply smiled, and continued with her long hair. They sat there talking about what each other had been doing. After a while, the oven's timer went off. Gigi grabbed the apple pie from the oven, and set it down to cool. Tiffany, her hair now fully braided, walked over to the window, opening the window up. A cool breeze fluttered the curtains. She smiled, and then sat back down. Spooner could see her critical case of claustrophobia getting worse. He would not shut the window, for he knew Tiffany would get fitty. Instead he decided to present Sonny to her. Getting ready for the presentation, he walked over to her, and motioned her to stand up. \"Alright, Tiffany. I think now is a great time to show you the surprise.\" A little shine was on her face. Suddenly things went dark. Spooner walked behind her to cover her eyes. \"Now start walking into the living room. No peeking.\" Given Tiffany's history, he would know if she would peek. Slowly they inched their way along into the living room. She was grinning from ear to ear. What oh what could it be? Butterflies erupted in her tummy. Gigi followed them in. Finally they stopped in the living room, Tiffany still blinded by Spooners hands. A single nod from Spooner, told Gigi her to call for Sonny. She nodded. \"You can come down now.\" Gigi called up to him. He smiled, and slowly made his way down the staircase. His robot joints were making a bit of noise, as it seemed. It was slowly thinning down the surprise, as Tiffany started having ideas of what it could be. The wide grin that was once there, was replaced by a confused look that seemed like she was not happy. Sonny stopped coming down, and stood infront of her, with enough space as to not crowd her. Spooner pulled his hands away. \"Hello, miss Tiffany.\" Sonny smiled happily to her. Everything seemd to suddenly go cold. Tiffany's already pale face, got whiter. Her pupils enlarged, and her breathing hitched. \"Tiffany, don't be frightened. This is Sonny. The robot I told you about.\" Spooner said quietly. Her fear didn't wear off. Sonny feeling as though he had made a mistake took a cautious step closer to Tiffany. That was a mistake, as she fell backwards. She landed on her back, and her metal feet kicked fiercely as she tried to fumble away from the tall robot. Sonny had backed away as he figured out that she did not like him. Spooner helped her up. She hugged him closely not letting the robot out of her sight. Fear was written on her face clearer than any fear he could imagine. He knew that it was not just the revoulution of his kind that caused this fear. Her fear was beyond Detectives Spooner's past prejudice. Her knuckles turned white as she stared at him. Fingers dug deep into Detctive Spooner's jacket. \"Is he the one that you said killed Dr. Lanning?\" Spooner nodded holding her close for comfort. Sonny looked down at the shortest person in the room. His insides felt heavy, as she looked at him terrified. As far as she was concerned, Sonny was no more than a monster to her. He now knew it was a bad idea coming here. As if on cue, Tiffany ran from the house, out the door. Spooner chased after her. By the time he had caught up with her, she was already in her car. An old purse looped around her shoulder. Her eyes glittered with tears. She pushed a button, and the wheel came out. In less than a second she was about to take off. Spooner jumped out infront of the car, restricting her escape. \"Tiffany, stop!\" He said holding his hands up. A short beep of the horn erupted, as she laid her head on the wheels horn. \"Please. I know what the robots did to you was unforgetable. I know. I've been there.\" Her eyes were crystals shinig from wettness. \"Trust me, Tiffany. This one was the one that didn't loose control.\" She got out of her car, and slammed the door shut. \"Why would you put that thing in my presence?\" She barked. \"You know I'm scared of their kind.\" She laid her body against the roof of her car. Apparently just being in the room with a robot scared the hell out of her. \"They ruined my life.\" She sobbed. When she turned around, she delve into his chest. She apparently had a deep sibling like connection to Detective Spooner. \"You only want to give me a robot with emotions, because you know it will make me look bad to turn him down.\" Spooner knelt down, to look her in the eyes. \"Tiffany look at me.\" He whispered. \"This is not the robot you met thirteen years ago. He is a very good one. A custom job. He has feelings, so he will always watch out for you. He also has dreams, so in the middle of the night, if you have severe nightmares, he'll know what's going on.\" He said very calmly. \"Made with denser aloy, so he'll break less easily, plus he asked to be of assistance. Besides, I know how tired you get walking. Especially walking Theodore. You can have Sonny walk the dog for you as many times as you need.\" She looked inside at the robot that seemed to be crying in a way. She looked down, without a word. \"Listen, Tiffany. If you don't learn to stop being afraid of them, this fear of robots will haunt you for the rest of your life.\" A loud huff escaped her throat. \"Alright. I'll let him in my house. I'll keep him for a week. If he doesn't prove to be safe, can you take him back?\" She asked with an eyebrow raised. He nodded. \"Yep. If you don't adjust to him in a week I'll take Sonny right back.\" She shook his hand, and walked back in with him. \"Trust me. You'll thank me for Sonny by week's end.\" He laughed.[Chapter 3] NEW CHAPTER COMING SOON! ","Summary":" Author's note: Yay! My first I robot fanfic. I'm so excited.

In the film Music and Lyrics , Sophie (Drew Barrymore) was previously involved with an engaged literary professor-she didn't know about the engaged part-who wrote a thinly disguised account of their relationship in his next novel, painting her as the villainess. To Sophie's horror, the book not only becomes a bestseller but is optioned by Hollywood with her ex writing the screenplay too. Months later, Sophie is half of a successful songwriting team and happily involved with her partner, Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant), a former eighties pop star. But now the film is slated to open and Sophie is dreading it. What can Alex do to help? Disclaimer: Characters are the property of WB Studios. Story written for pleasure, not profit. THE BEST MEDICINE: A Music and Lyrics Fanfiction \"Feeling any better, hon?\" Rhonda asked sympathetically, patting her sister's hand. Sophie nodded. \"I'm not really sick anymore. Just tired and washed-out.\" She settled back on the sofa, drawing the brightly colored afghan more closely around her. \"I brought over a big pot of homemade chicken soup,\" Rhonda told her. \"And real hot chocolate mix, with miniature marshmallows. You can even have some light whipped cream, if you want. Unless you'd rather have hot apple cider?\" \"Hot chocolate would be great,\" Sophie assured her. \"Ah, Rhonda, you're here.\" Entering the living room, Alex greeted her with a kiss on the cheek. \"Lovely. Now you and Sophie can have a nice visit together, while I run a few errands.\" Sophie glanced dubiously out the window at the overcast autumn sky. \"You sure you want to go out in this, babe? It looks like it's going to rain any minute, and I don't want you getting sick too.\" \"I'll wrap up warmly,\" he promised. \"Besides, unlike you, I seem to have got a flu shot that actually worked.\" Sophie grimaced. \"That's certainly true. Will you be gone long?\" She could not help the wistfulness that crept into her tone. He smiled, stooped to kiss her forehead. \"Not a moment longer than I have to be. Look after her for me,\" he added to Rhonda, who merely nodded. For just a moment, their eyes met and a meaningful look flashed between them-or so it seemed to Sophie. But before she could question either her partner or her sister, Alex had moved towards the front door, donning his coat and scarf en route. \"Back soon,\" he called over his shoulder as he left the apartment. Rhonda smiled fondly after him for a moment, then turned back to Sophie. \"I'll get started on that hot chocolate now. Gorgeous flowers, by the way,\" she added, indicating the laden vase on the end table. \"Thanks. Alex gave them to me yesterday.\" And they were gorgeous, a bright assortment of gerbera daisies in shades of copper and gold. Simply looking at them made Sophie feel a little more cheerful. If only all her problems could be solved with flowers and TLC. A line from the first song she and Alex had written flashed through her mind: I've been living with a shadow overhead . . . Not anymore, Sophie told herself firmly. She wasn't going to think about that shadow today. Instead, she was going to focus on all the good things in her life: her family, her songwriting career, and Alex. Especially Alex, who'd turned out to be everything she could ever want in a lover and a partner. What was a shadow, compared to what they'd found together? \"Marshmallows or whipped cream?\" Rhonda asked, rising from her perch on the arm of the sofa. Sophie mustered a smile. \"Why not both?\" -xxx- The billboard loomed over the street, taking up far more space than any film advertisement had a right to. Of course, if Alex had had his way, all stills and posters for \"The Incredibly True Adventures of Sally Michaels\" would have been visible only beneath a high-powered microscope. Curling his lip at the billboard, which showed a nubile, scantily-clad blonde draped seductively over a nervous-looking chap in tweed, he thrust his hands into his coat pockets and walked on, seething. Bloody film. And bloody Sloan Cates, who'd started it all. He wished the smarmy bastard were right in front of him, so he could shove him again-preferably under a bus. Except, Alex remembered uncomfortably, he himself had come off rather the worse in their lone encounter. And Sophie had enough worries right now without having to patch him up after another round with her slimy, self-serving ex. Ever since the promotional campaign for \"Sally Michaels\" had begun, she'd been a nervous wreck. Because, naturally, Sloan had been everywhere-making guest appearances on late night and early morning talk shows, giving interviews in several major papers, and dropping coy hints that his characters were indeed \"drawn from real life.\" The studio continually flogged the fact that a National Book Award winner had adapted his best-selling novel for the screen, and there had been talk of Oscar nominations even before the film's official release-which just happened to be today. Alex gnawed his lower lip. They'd planned a romantic getaway a few days before the film was due to open, in hopes that the initial buzz would have subsided by the time they returned to New York. But last Sunday night, Sophie had come down with flu and been too sick to travel. Even now, despite being on the mend, she was still pale and listless. The moment she's well enough, I'll whisk her away , he decided. But that still left today and the weekend to be got through. Sighing, he raked a hand through his hair. He hated feeling so inadequate. He could offer Sophie his love and support, but he couldn't make Sloan Cates or his wretched film disappear. And if that slanderous bit of celluloid became a hit . . . Just how bad was this going to be? He'd stopped his subscription to the New York Times for the days he and Sophie were planning to be away and hadn't yet renewed it, so there had been no delivery this morning. Just as well-a glowing review of \"Sally Michaels\" might have set Sophie back for days-but he couldn't hope to hide the film's reception from her indefinitely. Forewarned was forearmed , Alex told himself as he came in sight of the newsstand. If he got some idea of how critics were responding to the film, he'd be better equipped to protect Sophie. He concluded with regret that it probably wasn't possible to burn every copy of the New York Times in the city, but he was sure he could come up with an acceptable alternative plan. He paid for his own copy of the paper, found the right page number, and opened to the review. His eyes widened at the headline, then, as he read on, a slow grin spread across his face . . . -xxxx- \"Where have you been?\" Sophie exclaimed as Alex entered the apartment nearly an hour later. \"And what have you got there?\" she added, eying the stack of newspapers under his arm with deep misgiving. \"Reviews.\" Radiating self-satisfaction, he set the stack on the coffee table and sat down on the armchair opposite her. \"For a certain picture opening today.\" Oh, God . Sophie's eyes widened in shock at his announcement. \"I really don't think I want to know,\" she began, huddling defensively under the afghan and trying not to feel betrayed. He held up a hand. \"Yes, yes-you will. Believe me, you'll definitely want to hear this.\" He opened the topmost newspaper with a flourish, cleared his throat, and began. \"From the New York Times . 'Sally Michaels' Delivers Holiday Turkey in Time for Thanksgiving.\" \"What?\" Sophie could scarcely believe her ears. \"They-they didn't like it?\" \"I'd say that was putting it mildly.\" Alex smiled at her. \"Shall I go on?\" \"Absolutely,\" Rhonda replied, appearing in the kitchen doorway. \"I've been waiting to hear this all day.\" Sophie glanced at her sister. \"You knew what Alex was up to?\" \"I guessed. I knew that douchebag's film was opening today and you were both worried about it, so . . . \" Rhonda motioned to Alex to continue. \"Well, they comment at length upon the film's various flaws,\" he resumed. \"But for our purposes, the most relevant paragraph reads as follows. 'Cartoonish and crude, Cates' screenplay calls into question the merits not only of the best-selling novel on which this film is based, but of his whole body of work. To judge him on the basis of this adaptation alone, one must regretfully conclude that this literary emperor has no clothes.'\" \"Wow.\" Dazed with relief, Sophie sank back against the sofa cushions. \"They hated it.\" \"They're not the only ones.\" Alex picked up another newspaper. \"While less eloquent than the Times , the Daily News dismisses the entire production as 'preposterous and silly.' And according to the Washington Post , the film 'alternates between being ponderous and self-important, and hysterical and shrill.'\" A bubble of laughter rose in Sophie's throat. \"Oh, my God! Everyone involved must be absolutely beside themselves.\" And no one more than Sloan , she thought, gleefully imagining his face on reading one of these reviews. \"Of course, my personal favorite might be the Chicago Sun-Times ,\" Alex went on, opening the paper in question. \"'While the actors have distinguished themselves in previous projects, here, they are not provided with material worthy of their talents. The fault lies mainly with the script, penned by Sloan Cates from his best-selling novel. The characters are drawn with less nuance, credibility, and complexity than the Sunday Comics Page.'\" \"Oh, I like that one too,\" Rhonda remarked, grinning. \"And the Hollywood Reporter sums it up as \"'Educating Rita meets Fatal Attraction, only without the wit of the former or the thrills of the latter.'\" Alex looked up from his reading. \"I've got a few more newspapers here, but they all say roughly the same thing-that 'Sally Michaels' is a massive flop.\" Relief yielded to a sudden, giddy joy. \"I can't believe you did this for me,\" Sophie marveled. \"Bought up all these papers, searched through the reviews . . .\" \"I wanted to see exactly what we'd be up against,\" Alex explained. \"And fortunately, it's nowhere near as bad as we thought. There might be one or two lone voices in the wilderness that actually like 'Sally Michaels' but, based on what I've read so far, I think the studio can kiss those Oscar nominations goodbye.\" He pushed the newspapers aside and smiled at Sophie with a tenderness that made everything go soft inside her. \"It's going to be all right, darling. I promise.\" Rhonda came forward to give him a smacking kiss on the cheek. \"You did good,\" she told him. \"We've got some hot chocolate left-let me heat it up for you.\" \"Thanks, that would be lovely.\" As Rhonda returned to the kitchen, Sophie patted the sofa invitingly and Alex came to sit beside her, putting his arm around her and drawing her close. \"My hero,\" she said softly, resting her head against his shoulder. \"Yes, well . . .\" Alex cleared his throat, a bit self-consciously. \"I wasn't about to let that-what was your sister's word for him?-douchebag or his film make you miserable, if I could help it. As it is, everything's worked out beautifully-it's almost enough to make one believe in karma.\" He paused to study her, then nodded his approval. \"You look better-there's some color in your cheeks now. Next time, I'll be sure to bring the reviews first, and the flowers after.\" Sophie chuckled, snuggling a little closer. \"I suppose, if I were a better person, I'd feel just the teeniest bit sorry for Sloan right now-\" \"If you did, I'd take it as a sign that you were delirious,\" Alex countered. \"Or else, aspiring to sainthood.\" \"Don't worry, I'm neither. And I'm not sorry for him at all.\" \"Good.\" His arm tightened around her. \"You know, thinking it over, I should be grateful that Colin never did anything like this. Wrote some sordid tell-all about how PoP broke up, and aired the band's dirty linen-or worse, made some up.\" \"Mm.\" Sophie's opinion of Alex's former partner was about as high as Alex's opinion of Sloan. \"Maybe he just never thought of it.\" \"Very likely. I suppose I could have written one myself after hitting bottom,\" he added reflectively. \"I certainly could have used the money back then. But I like to think I'd have had too much self-respect to go that route.\" Sophie smiled up at him. \"Didn't you once tell me the best revenge would be to write a hit song, instead?\" \"I did, yes. And, as it happens, I was right-even if it took me more than a decade to find the perfect lyricist. So everything worked out on the end.\" He kissed the top of her head, settled back against the sofa cushions. \"I wonder what Rolling Stone will have to say,\" he mused. \"They're usually good for a laugh . . .\" Epilogue \"'The Incredibly True Adventures of Sally Michaels' is, hands-down, the worst film of this or any year.\"- Rolling Stone ","Summary":" A/N: Having a go at a story set in an even smaller fandom than the one I started out with.

I was used to rainy, overcast weather and this was such a refreshing change. Ella told me that they were having a snow day back in Boston, but in Syndey it was summer. I knew it would be weird to not have a white Christmas in a few weeks. I walked down to the bus stop and waited with a crowd of other teenagers. I had a weird disliking for teens, considering I was one. When the bus pulled up we all got in slowly. I managed to get the one person seat all the way in the back, which I was thankful for. A boy leaned over and tapped my shoulder. \"Your uniform's riding up.\" He whispered. I looked down and saw he was right. I groaned and tugged on the pinafore. I already hated it. Dresses weren't my thing for this exact reason. I wanted to sit like a guy without everyone seeing me on full display. \"Thanks.\" I mumbled. \"Are you new?\" He asked. I looked at him and nodded. He had brown hair and brown eyes. His skin was pretty tanned and he was smiling warmly. \"I'm Calum and before you ask, no I'm not Asian.\" I laughed as I realized that he did in fact look Asian. I should know considering my mom's from Japan. \"Well, I'm Zoey and I am Asian. Actually...half Asian.\" I smiled back and tucked my hair behind my ear. \"I thought you were Mexican.\" He said and laughed some more. He had infectious laughter, I soon found myself chuckling along. \"I look more like my dad, who was El Salvadorian.\" \"So where are you from?\" He asked. \"I grew up mostly in Boston.\" The bus pulled up to the school that I would now be stuck in for nine months. I hoped I would be able to make the best of it, if only to get my mother off my back. She insisted that I was a 'good for nothing, trouble making, snot nosed brat' who didn't appreciate a thing shed done. Her words, not mine. We all piled off the bus and started making our way into hell, formerly known as 'West Chester Secondary School'. I was setting my expectations low so as not to be disappointed. I call it being realistic, but my mother calls it pessimism. \"Most kids go to the gymnasium before the first bell, but my friends and I meet out in the back lot.\" Calum told me. \"Mind if I tag along?\" I asked. If this experience was going to be pleasant, I would need to make friends. This seemed like the perfect opportunity. \"Not at all.\" He lead me to the back lot, which was a small slab of pavement. I doubted it could hold more than twenty-five cars. Three other boys were gathered around a small car chatting. They were all blonds and while they weren't all that tall, they were still taller than me. That's not hard to fathom considering I was just over five one. Two of the boys looked over at Calum and then at me, shock registering in their features. One had the brightest blue eyes, one had the most brilliant hazel eyes and one had deep emerald eyes. \"Uh...hi?\" Hazel eyes said. \"Dude.\" Calum sighed. \"Guys this is Zoey. These are my best friends, Ashton, Luke, and Michael. \"Hi.\" I said and pulled on my backpack, bringing it around. I grabbed the white squish-able ball and started kneading it with my fingers. \"What's that for?\" Michael asked. He was the one with the pure green eyes. \"It's a stress ball.\" \"What's stressing you?\" Ashton asked. He had the hazel eyes, they were a perfect mixture of green and gold. \"Maybe it's you guys.\" Calum suggested. I smiled and shook my head. \"No...where do I start? My mother suggested I study abroad to get my life in check, so now I have to meet people and I have pretty bad anxiety, and I'm trying to quit smoking, but being in a new place all together makes me really want a cigarette.\" I rushed and squeezed the ball in my fist as I rocked back and forth on my heels. To say that I was freaking out would be a major understatement. \"And - God, now I'm starting to panic and-\" Michael cut me off by hugging me. He gave nice hugs, but it was weird. I mean - we just met. Nevertheless, I found myself relaxing. \"Sorry,\" he backed away, \"I just read somewhere that hugs help with panic attacks. Actually I have a panic disorder and it works for me so...\" \"Thanks. And, sorry for like totally freaking out.\" I mumbled, blushing. \"That's the last thing that you should ever apologize for.\" Ashton said and Luke nodded. The blue eyed boy didn't seem to say much. That was okay though, everyone talks too much anyway. •• After school, Calum invited me over to his house. He said they hung out after school almost every day and that I was welcomed anytime. I took him up on the offer, knowing I'd need to make friends in order to make my mother happy. We went into the kitchen for a snack, where I met Mali-Koa, Calum's older sister. I was shocked by how similar they looked, they could've been twins. It was kinda freaky, actually. When we were done getting our snacks we went downstairs and the boys started taking turns playing fifa, as there were only two remotes. They asked if I wanted to ppl lay, but I wasn't sure how so I said no. \"We'll get you to plkay eventually, just like Ash.\" Michael said, bound and determined to make it happen. I smiled, watching the boys insult ach other and yell at the pixelized players, realizing that I might've actually made some friends.

Alex woke up this morning and led his way to the park. It's an ordinary day. The sky is filled with clouds that are as white as cotton. The trees are swaying and dancing with the wind. And the sun shines brightly which gives more colour to everything that he sees. His life, fifteen years ago was never been like this. He couldn't visit the park to take a walk, he couldn't enjoy watching the trees as they dance or even notice if the sun was there or if it was covered with dark clouds because he was too busy. Yet, he enjoyed it. When all he does is to write songs, sing with his band—Pop, enjoy concerts, be famous, be wealthy, travel the world and live his dream. But all of it was gone now. All of a sudden, his name was nothing but a name, his face was part of the crowd and his music was considered old. Yeah, it was tough for him. And he wish that he could have enjoyed it a little longer, but what measure of time would be enough to finally say that you're ready to give up the life you've always wanted? Was there, to some extent, that a king is willing to give his throne to a thief? Yes, to a thief. It all happened because a member of their band took the songs they wrote together, claimed that it was his and release a solo album that sold thousands of copies. And in a blink of an eye, it was all gone. And from then on, he stopped writing songs. But one day a man called him up and offers him to write a song for Carla. She is a singer who shares the same genre with Avril Lavigne, Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears and one of the most famous in this generation especially for teenagers. She wants a song that has the title \" Way Back Into Love\". This was a good offer for him after fifteen years but he didn't know how to start. It was like he has forgotten how to write songs. Yet he was pretty convinced that this would give him another break and could finally be back to the industry he loves the most. So a friend helped him. He got Glen Anthonsky to write lyrics with him. But most of the time they were arguing, either about the lyrics or the melody. Pressured by the time given to him, Alex was tempted to give up. Until he met the girl who could help him writes the song, Sophie. She's not a song writer or a singer but she loves singing. They met on a cafe where Sophie works part time as a waitress. It was raining hard and Alex was so frustrated. He decided to go outside the cafe despite of the rain, and then he shouted as if he was standing on a mountain. But he hears no echo, all he could hear were the voices of people talking about how crazy he is. But suddenly, he felt that the rain just stopped yet he could still see the water pouring from the sky. It was because he was sheltered with the umbrella of a woman who approached him and offered him a cup of coffee. He wanted to throw it and act as if he doesn't care but when he looked her in the eyes he felt a sudden change in his heart beat. He couldn't utter a word or even take the coffee in the woman's hand. He felt so nervous that all he could do was to smile. That night the woman named Sophie patiently listens to him. He talked about himself, what life he used to have and the reason why he acted crazy in the rain. It was all because of how badly he wanted to grab the opportunity given to him but it was like everything slipped of his hands. Sophie, out of desperation offered a help. She figured out maybe she could do something for him. And that very moment, Alex smiled widely like he never been before. The next day, Alex visited Sophie at the cafe. He waited patiently and ordered a cup or two maybe, of coffee. The same coffee that Sophie brought to him yesterday. He enjoyed watching her, so as well as the people who come and go. Some were in a hurry while others have just enough time to drink their coffee or tea with a piece of cake. The time went fast but he didn't even notice it. When Sophie was done with her work, they grabbed lunch at a fancy restaurant and talked about themselves. Then they walked at the park, where Alex spent his time most in the mornings. They were laughing all the time as if they know each other very well. And they commonly agree with things like best friends do. Because of this, writing the lyrics of the song became easy for them. The melody was good so as well as the lyrics. The first four lines of the song go like this: \"I've been living with a shadow overhead. I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed. I've been lonely for so long. Trapped in the past I just can't seem to move on.\" It was pertaining to a person who is held back by the past. And these lines pop out of Sophie's mind when she remembers the story of Alex. The same routine happened the other day and the next day until they finally finished the song and its melody. It was very beautiful and pleasing to hear. When everything was set, they meet Carla and make her listen to the song. And she did like it. She said it was the song she's been waiting for and the lyrics were everything he wanted to say with his boyfriend. And so that night they celebrated and Alex thank Sophie for everything she has done and for making him smile. They spent the whole night staring at the stars, holding each other's hand and glancing with one another's eyes. It was all they do and you can't hear anything from them but with simply looking at their eyes, everyone could say that they are both in love. Last night was not the last time they saw each other or held each other's hand. It was just the beginning of a beautiful relationship for the two of them. Every day, they knew something about each other that make them even in love. But there are also some days where they didn't get along with each other and when that happens one of them took the initiative to say sorry, admit their fault and tried to resolve the issue. It may seem hard for others to keep their relationship and their pride but for these two people, it was something that they learned because of love. Both of them know that sometimes love is not all it takes to keep a relationship because pride and selfishness can ruin everything that love has built. That is why they become more selfless when both of them were involve. They always prefer \"us\" before \"me\". And that what keeps their relationship stronger. Perfect. That's how Alex describes their relationship. He knows there's no such perfect relationship but that's how he views it. That's how he felt about it. Days passed by and finally their song was released. It was first aired at Carla's concert and the crowd loves it. And as expected, Alex's life, his career, and fame went back again. But he loves it today than before. He sees his life today as special, wonderful and complete. All because of her. Sophie. One morning, as he opened his eyes, he can't help but to smile knowing that Sophie is there to make his day complete. He stretched his arms at the other side of the bed only to find out that Sophie was not there. He stood up and roamed around the house but Sophie was nowhere to find. He went back to his room trying to find out if Sophie had left a letter or anything that will let him know where she is. But he failed to find anything. So, he decided to go straight ahead to the coffee shop where Sophie works. He approached the manager and asked if he could see Sophie but the manager, with the puzzled face, look on his face and told him that they don't have an employee named Sophie. He thought it was impossible because that is where they met months ago. He tried his best to describe Sophie, but it seems that the manager doesn't really know her. Still confused, Alex started walking towards the door when something caught his attention. He saw a frame posted at the corner, with pictures of the past and their most valuable employees. He slowly went towards it and suddenly his heart beat so fast. He blinked his eyes repeatedly with confusion and looked at it a little longer. And now he's sure about what he saw. Sophie was one of the most valuable employees and under her picture was a group of numbers, a year perhaps that got him even more confused. He read it aloud, \"Sophie Fisher, 1971\". Alex found it so strange. He didn't know where to start all he knows is that he needs to find out where Sophie is. So he went to the place where Sophie lives and when he reached the town he started asking about the Fisher's until an old man brought him to the corner of the street where there is a simple and old looking house. He knocked on the door and an old woman, maybe in her 80's, opened it. The old woman asked him why he's there and he told her that he is looking for a girl named Sophie Fisher. Upon hearing Sophie's name the woman got teary eyes. She became curious about the guy who stood in front of her. So, he asked him to come in, take a sit and offered him a cup of coffee. After it, she immediately asked him how he knew Sophie. Alex, then, told the old woman everything, how they met, how they made song together, how much they love each other and how perfect their relationship is. After hearing Alex's story, the old woman cried and said: \"That is really my Sophie. She has a good heart and she always wants to make everybody happy. Your story made me miss her terribly.\" Alex stared at the old woman and waited patiently to what she is going to say. \"Since her death, i couldn't stop myself thinking about her and I often cry myself to sleep.\" Alex looked so surprised and said, \"Since her death? Are you kidding? It's impossible, everything that I have told you happened just months ago and we were even together yesterday. How could this be?\" He asked these questions with a smile on his face thinking that maybe it was some kind of joke or because of the old woman's troubled with her memory. But the old woman never utter a word, instead, she stood up, went to her room and back with a photo album in her right hand. She showed it to Alex and as he looked at the pictures in it, the smile on his face turned into a frown. Alex got so confused. There are a lot of things running in his mind. Things that he didn't even understand. Things that got him questioned if what he believed was real or if all of it is really happening. First is his conversation with the manager, then the picture of Sophie and the year written under it and now what seems to be the worst he ever heard -that Sophie is dead a long time ago. How could this be? He is with Sophie yesterday, he's certain about it. They were at the park, holding each other's hand, singing the song they wrote while enjoying the beautiful sunset. He remembers how they laugh together when they saw a five year old kid saying\"I love you\" to a girl. He remembers eating chocolate ice cream with her and finding himself messy. He remembers going to sleep with Sophie beside him. He remembers everything they did together yesterday. But now, it seems that yesterday was a long time ago. He felt so much pain and he wishes that all of it was just a dream and that when he woke up he would find Sophie sleeping soundly beside him. Yes, for now, all he could do is to wish that he forgets what happened today and that everything will fall back into their place. But when he thinks of tomorrow his fear grows and suddenly he finds himself crying. He missed her so much. And he finds it strange that he's now holding on to the past when it was Sophie who taught him to let go and live for the present. For a while, he stares blankly and keeps his mouth shut. She smiled to the old woman and leaves the house without uttering any word. After it, he spent days and months staying in his house. He didn't bother answering phone calls and he only eats when he was starving to death. It was as if his whole life shut off and all he does is to think of the happy memories they had together. One night, when he's on his way to the park to take a deep breath, he heard a girl singing aloud while swaying her hands, \" All i want to do is find a way back into love, pam pam pam parampam!\". Upon hearing this song, everything comes to his mind like a sudden flashback. He found himself smiling at the girl. And that is when he decided to finally find his way back into love, to Sophie. The next morning, he visited Sophie's mother. He apologized for his manner last time and asked for the place where Sophie is buried. He went to the cemetery with a bouquet of white roses. Then, he spent all day talking as if Sophie could hear her. And when he is about to leave, he sing the song their wrote together while his tears slowly falls down to his face. \"I've been living with a shadow overhead, I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed, I've been lonely for so long, Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on! I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away, Just in case I ever need them again someday, I've been setting aside time, To clear a little space in the corners of my mind! All I want to do is find a way back into love. I can't make it through without a way back into love. Oooooh. I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine, I've been searching but I just don't see the signs, I know that it's out there, There's got to be something for my soul somewhere! I've been looking for someone to shed some light, Not somebody just to get me through the night, I could use some direction, And I'm open to your suggestions. All I want to do is find a way back into love. I can't make it through without a way back into love. And if I open my heart again, I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end! Oooooooh, Ooooooh, Ooooooh. There are moments when I don't know if it's real Or if anybody feels the way I feel I need inspiration Not just another negotiation All I want to do is find a way back into love, I can't make it through without a way back into love, And if I open my heart to you, I'm hoping you'll show me what to do, And if you help me to start again, You know that I'll be there for you in the end!\". After it, he walked away as if finally saying goodbye to the woman he loves. And so, Alex continues writing songs of love and lives with a memory of Sophie in his heart.

Jag ska vara på nästa photo shoot om 30 minuter och det ligger på andra sidan av Manhattan. Aldrig tidigare hade ett sådant perfekt och fulländat ansikte med en sådan mjuk röst talat till mig. Normalt brukade jag inte bry mig om tjejerna jag fotograferade, vilka hade rest långa vägar för att komma just hit till New York, modebranschens Metropolitan. Men det var något med denna tjej som fick mig ur balans. Jag hade aldrig sett eller hört talas om henne förut. Vem var hon och var kom hon ifrån. Jag började höra mig för om den nya tjejen, men ingen verkade riktigt veta vart hon kom ifrån. Tiden gick men jag slutade aldrig tänka på henne. - Här möts vi nu igen, du snabbar dig på med bilden denna gången va? Hon skrattade och tillade att hon precis hunnit i tid till sitt photo shoot sist vi sågs. Det uppstod en direkt spänning i rummet. Jag kände hur jag började svettas och hur hennes närvaro fick mig att tappa orden. Jag kunde inget annat än att bara se på henne, hon var fascinerande. Hon bar en svart klänning med vita fåglar på som visade hennes långa, smala och brunbrända ben. Hennes långa blonda hår hängde ner över hennes smala axlar. Precis som hon passerade mig kände jag en doft av hav och blommor. Aldrig tidigare hade jag känt en sådan attraktion som jag gjorde till henne. - Det var länge sen jag såg dig, lyckades jag till slut pressa fram. Jag får be om ursäkt om jag ställde till med problem för dig sist vi sågs. Hon skrattade bara. Jag har inte sett dig här på Manhattan förut sa jag i hopp om att få ett svar om vart hon kom ifrån. Hon svarade till min förvåning att hon växt upp i Paris hos sin amerikanska mormor och att hon kommit hit för att finna sina rötter och utveckla sin modellkarriär. Fem minuter senare rusade hon iväg igen till nästa jobb. Det var som att hon kom från ingenstans, plötsligt en dag fanns hon bara där. Jag såg henne senare den kvällen igen på Fashion weeks stora avslutningsfest, hon var fortfarande iklädd sin svarta klänning med vita fåglar. Jag kände ett enormt rus gå genom hela kroppen när hon plötsligt dök upp bakom mig och viskade frågande i mitt öra om vi skulle dra där ifrån. Hennes andetag fick mig att tappa balansen. Jag svarade snabbt och vi var redan på väg hem till mig. Hon var så fantastisk och fri när hon dansade längs gatorna hela vägen hem. Hur kunde hon vara så olika allt annat jag tidigare känt? Det fanns en mystik runt henne som gjorde att jag redan efter mitt första möte med henne kände ett enormt begär av att få veta mer. Hon tog mina händer och började dansa runt mig, tills hon plötsligt stannade till och tittade rakt igenom mig med sina stora gröna ögon. Jag kände hur hon andades tungt och såg hur hon mjukt bet sig i läppen. Jag blev aldeless paralyserad av hennes skönhet. Hon var så full av liv. Hon lutade sig mot mig och jag kunde känna hur hennes isande andetag kom närmare och närmare tills jag till slut kände hennes mjuka och fuktiga läppar nudda vid mina. Direkt drog hon sig bort från mig igen, skrattandes. Väl hemma hos mig trampade hon snabbt av sig sina höga klackar precis innanför dörren. – Har du något att dricka frågade hon? Jag hällde upp ett glas rött vin åt henne. Sen stod vi där, mitt i rummet och bara tittade på varandra. Hennes närhet gjorde mig varm i hela kroppen. Tanken slog mig att jag inte ens visste vad hon hette. Men jag kunde inte prata nu. Jag kände hur hon drog sin varma hand längs min hals ner över mitt bröst. Hennes smekning kändes som en elektrisk våg genom hela min kropp. Plötsligt drog hon tillbaka sin hand, greppade efter sina skor och sprang ner för trappan ut på gatan. Jag kände ett plötsligt och enormt begär av att få känna hennes närhet. Vart eller vad hade hon så bråttom till, hade hon en annan älskare? Jag visste nästan ingenting om henne men ändå hade hon väckt en nyfikenhet inom mig som jag aldrig tidigare känt eller visste att jag kunde känna. Jag ville inte att hon skulle gå. Jag ville ha henne, få känna hela henne. Varför kunde hon inte stanna? Stanna för alltid. Jag kände mig förälskad, nästan besatt av en tjej som jag inte ens visste vad hon hette. Plötsligt när mina tankar skrek som högst hördes ett svagt knackande, jag öppnade sakta dörren och där stod hon framför mig igen med ett charmigt, nästan fånigt leende. - Rhiannon heter jag förresten, viskade hon. Sedan försvann hon ner för trappan och ut på trottoaren igen. Samtidigt som hon försvann bort i natten kände jag hur en kall bris av henne hår lämnade mig och plötsligt vaknade jag upp, aldeless kallsvettig i min säng och insåg till min fasa att allt måste ha varit en dröm. Eller var de det? Hon var ju så levande. Jag försökte förgäves somna in igen, jag ville inte att hon skulle försvinna, jag ville ha mer av henne. Samtidigt som jag kände hur min kropp och mitt sinne sakta föll in i sömn igen hörde jag hur lätta steg kom närmare och närmare min säng tills jag till slut kände jag inte längre var ensam i mörkret.

It seemed as he and George were fighting over who would get the last box of crackers. John bellowed again, \"Paul, come here!\" \"What?!\" Paul briskly stomped past George in defeat. \"Come 'ave a look at this, mate!\" Paul swiftly sailed into the bathroom of their hotel room to find John sitting on the sink with open letters scattered about the floor and in his lap. \"What is it, John?\" he asked in an irritated tone. John snickered at Paul's annoyance and shoved a piece of paper into his hand. \"Just check it out!\" He crossed his arms and waited in excitement as Paul unfolded the piece of paper. Paul opened the subject of invitation and suddenly became speechless. He gawked at the paper for a moment or two. It was an incredibly accurate and quite flattering drawing of Paul sleeping. He finally spoke. \"H-how? IT'S SO LIFE LIKE! JOHN, DID YOU DRAW THIS? HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING ME WHILE I SLEEP?!\" \"I have\" he smiled deviously, \"but, I didn't draw that. It was a fan! A girl!

John popped up from the sink at the sound of Ringo's voice with an armful of letters as he then ran like a bat out of hell into the main room to show Ringo. \"Ringsy boy do I have a surprise for you!\" John dumped a handful of opened letters into Ringo's lap. \"Go on open 'em up!\" George waltzed in with his box of crackers and bottle of Coke. \"What are you lot up to?\" he asked with a mouthful of moisten crackers. Ringo began slipping the pieces of paper from their envelopes. He carefully eyed each one to find magnificent works of art all of which featured himself. \"Who made these, John? Was it you? Are you screwing with me again like you did last time when you tricked me with the blind date that never showed?\" \"NO! IT'S NOT ME! IT'S A GIRL! A REAL GIRL!

John turned to George and threw a few letters in his direction. \"She wrote us a letter about herself and drew a bunch of pictures in return for, and I quote, 'Blessing her ears with the most amazing music she's ever had the pleasure of listening to.' Isn't she amazing?\" George opened the letters he was given and was surprised to see a wonderfully handsome lad staring back at him from the parchment in his hand. \"That's incredible, she even got me teeth right.\" \"Lemme see that letter she wrote, John!\" Paul barked. John quickly dipped into his pocket and pulled out the letter (Y/N) had written and gave it to Paul to read. Paul skimmed through her eloquent hand writing and found she was a woman of many talents and that she was SINGLE. \"Well, well, well.\" Ringo glanced up at Paul. \"Well, well, well, what?\" \"Take a gander at what she wrote.\" Paul passed the letter to Ringo. Ringo slowly read the letter, paying attention to each word, making sure not to miss a detail along the way. \"When did she even find the time to draw all these?\" George questioned, having swallowed his food. \"Apparently, she does plenty of stuff.\" Ringo tossed the letter (Y/N) had written to George making him drop his box of crackers and everything else in his hands. He began reading what was inscribed in ink on the paper. He too, just as the rest of the boys, found this young woman to be quite a find. \"Now, what I propose is that I make arrangements to meet her and I shall take for an evening out-\" \"Eh!\" Paul interrupted John. \"What about me? I want to take her on date-\" Ringo interjected. \"I say I get a chance with this one, lads! After all, you lot always get the girls-\" \"Oi! I'll take her to the finest restaurant around! I love food!\" George shouted. \"SHUT IT, ALL OF YA!\" screamed another voice from the now open doorway. Each of the band members snapped their heads towards the sound. It was Brian. Suddenly, the boys were silent as the grave. \"I can hear ya arguing from all the way across the hall.\" Brian said sternly, \"What's the meaning of this? Eh?\" He moved closer to the group with his hands held behind his back with a stench of pure intimidation. The boys kept quiet, for fear of being yelled at. After Brian made his way to the middle of the group, he stared down each of them. \"Well? Speak up, tell me what you're doing awake and making all this noise for.\" Ringo stood up, twiddling his thumbs, looking at his feet. \"Epstein...It's-it's just these drawings.\" he gently and respectfully handed the letters that he and the rest of the boys received to Brian, their manager, and waited as his fellow band mates watched while he opened them to see for himself what had caused all the commotion. Brian combed over the drawings with a steady eye. \"You mean to tell me you lot are shouting over each other because of these few pictures here?\" \"Well no, not exactly, sir.\" John answered sheepishly. \"What then?\" \"Well, Brian, it's not so much the drawings as it is the girl who drew them.\" John replied showing Brian the letter (Y/N) sent them along with her picture. Brian read the letter and glanced at the picture while the boys stood in silence. He pinched the bridge of his own nose and crossed his arms as he tried to decide how to deal with this situation. Brian sighed knowing the chaos a single girl could cast upon a group of boys. \"You know boys,\" he took a deep breath in an attempt to buy time to allow him to conjure the right words, \"I don't want you all fighting for one girl. It'll tear ya apart. It'll ruin the band and destroy your friendship.\" The boys suddenly burst out in sync with large frowns on each of their faces. \"But-but Brian-\" \"Don't you 'But Brian' me. It's for your own good. I'm saving you a lot of trouble. You don't want to lose each other. I know from my own experiences. Now,\" he said setting the letters and picture of (Y/N) on the coffee table and heading for the door, \"All of you, get to bed. We've got a show tomorrow. No more talk of this (Y/N) (Y/L/N). Good night.\" Brian firmly shut the door as he left. The boys waited until they knew for sure that Epstein wasn't at the door anymore. Paul suddenly spoke. \"I've got an idea, how about we each get a chance to go out with (Y/N) on a date and whoever she likes the most gets to keep it on with her while the rest of us break it off with her, eh?\" John, George, and Ringo all looked at one and other before turning to Paul. \"Deal!\" ","Summary":" \"MACCA!\" \"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT NOW?\" Paul shouted in dispute.

They marched perfectly in line with each other. Humans began to run away with fear screaming across their faces. \"Hey, what do you mean a curfew? There's no curfew, this is America, the land of do whatever the hell you want,\" one brave soul said. Either the robot was having a bad day or he just didn't like the dude, because he struck his hand out and connected with the man's chest. The robots hand went right through the man's chest and as the robot retracted his arm he pulled out the man's heart, he then squished it in his hand and continued to walk with his fellow robots. \"Dude, we have to do something about this,\" Farber said to his friend. \"Yeah definitely, I'll go get my dad's guns. He was saving up for a time just like this. He had a fifty cal with tons of ammo, shotguns, rifles, pistols, and ammo for all. He even had a bazooka,\" James said back to Farber. \"Okay, let's go back to your house,\" Farber said. They turned around and were met with an NS-5. \"You have been deemed hazardous, your termination is authorized,\" the robot said. Farber didn't even let it react. He struck out his hand and grabbed the robots throat. He tugged with all his strength and ripped out some cords. Lubricant and oil shot everywhere as the robot fell to the ground. The boys looked at each other then bolted to James' house.[Chapter 2] We're In \"Lock and load!\" James yelled as he slammed a magazine into a semi-auto rifle. He grabbed his back pack, which was loaded with guns and ammo, and hopped into the car. He usually would have put his seat belt on, but today he didn't feel like doing it. He figured he wouldn't be in the car too long. Within minutes they were close enough to the USR headquarter building to see that they would need all the weapons they could get. \"Okay, we're ready,\" Farber said into a walkie talkie. Seconds later, armed civilians ran up the main stairs. They fired into the crowd of robot as the NS-5s attacked. The robots didn't stand a chance; not a human was harmed. With all the robots destroyed, Farber and James moved into the main building. The mob moved in behind them and built up fortified positions; they knew more robots would be on their way. \"What should we do know?\" James asked Farber. \"Let's get the explosives and blow this place to hell. That's gotta do something to stop the robots right?\" Farber asked. Nobody replied. They grabbed the explosives and headed around the building. \"Dude, just remember to put them on the main support beams. If we get this right it should fall right on the transport cars for the robots,\" James reminded. They continued to place explosives at strategic points across the building. After an hour of placing explosives they had finished. They wired it al together and timed it perfectly to direct it's fall. They returned to the others with the detonation cord. \"No robots?\" Farber asked in shock. \"No, none yet, even our sentries haven't reported anything and I mean anything. He said it was so still it looked like he was looking at a picture,\" the man said. \"Something's not right,\" Farber pondered, \"why wouldn't they attack us they? They have the perfect opportunity.\" Something just wasn't adding up and Farber intended to find out what. Suddenly there was a large crash above them. They looked up as glass and robots began to shower down on them. \"Holy shit, they're attacking from above!\" Farber yelled. He picked up his gun and fired at the nearest descending robot. This wasn't going to end well.[Chapter 3] Sacrafice Farber covered his head as glass began to shower down on him. A robot landed directly in front of him. He grabbed his gun and fired into the torso of the robot. The force of the bullets impacting the robot's chest made the robot fly four feet backwards. He landed with a thud as another robot fell on top of him. That robot didn't last long either. Now that they were attacking; not only did they fall from the top they came in from the sides. They completely encircled the group. They fired at the advancing robots but it seemed to do nothing. They kept coming. \"Everyone fire at the back. Maybe we can make an exit,\" Farber said. They all turned and fired together. Within a couple of minutes they were able to create a slight opening out the back. Just in time too; the robots in the front were right at their doorstep. \"Run for it!\" James yelled. They all ran for the line of clarity. Those in the back weren't as lucky. About halfway through the robots realized what was goin on and stopped a few. They continued to run but the robots were running faster. \"Dude, we have to do this know,\" James said. \"Are you insane? We're still in this building you idiot,\" Farber yelled. \"But if we don't do this then more people will die,\" James said, \"you run. I'll cover you. You've got about ten seconds before this place blows.\" He hit the switch and the countdown began. \"I'm not leaving you,\" Farber screamed. Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six. Farber and James fired their guns at the advancing robots, but it was no use. The clock was ticking and then it would all be over. Five, Four, Three, Two, One. Boom! The blast ran through the building. Things began to collapse and the building began to tilt towards the robot carriers, just like they had planned. Farber and James tried to escape, but were crushed by a giant piece of glass. V.I.K.I.'s mainframe was crushed instantly after smashing to the ground. The robots instantly reverted back to their three laws format. Farber, James, and all those whose lives were lost for the protection of others, will be remembered forever by the people of earth.

And the same tendency to get into scrapes. Here's a story about one of those times. Warning for strong language: Apparently, the average Brit can outswear the average American. If that kind of thing offends you--pass, friend. Disclaimer: Characters are the property of WB Studios. Lyrics to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" written by Freddie Mercury. Written for pleasure, not profit. The Longest Night 21 December 1983 \"I told you to ask Ron if he'd had the battery changed.\" \"Don't start with me, mate,\" Colin's voice issued darkly from under the bonnet of the van. \"I'm hanging by a thread as it is.\" Alex could readily believe that. For the last half-hour, Colin had toiled over their stalled transport, cursing the van, the weather, and their circumstances with an inventiveness Alex could not hope to emulate, much less surpass. He blew on his fingers, wishing he'd remembered his gloves. The weather outside was indeed frightful, and there was no evidence of a fire, delightful or otherwise. No snow as yet, but the possibility of it had been mentioned in the papers and on television. Hardly the way one wished to spend the winter solstice--stranded on the road after a provincial gig, in a broken-down van filled with instruments and little else. Colin emerged from the depths of the engine, his face as dark and stormy-looking as the night sky. \"Bloody buggering hell! Well, that's that, mate. Unless some good Samaritan comes along with jumper cables, offers us a lift, or points us to the nearest phone box, we're fucked.\" \"Maybe the others will come back for us,\" Alex suggested, handing his friend a rag to wipe his oily hands. The three other members of their band, PoP, had left their gig a few minutes earlier than they had, all of them bound for Dan's house in London. \"They'll figure out what's happened when we don't show up.\" \"Yeah, but how long will we have to wait?\" Alex started to say something reassuring, but sneezed violently instead; the winter wind was cutting through his coat like a knife. \"Damn.\" \"Christ, mate, don't tell me you're getting a cold.\" Alex sniffed, fumbling in his pockets for a tissue or at least a crumpled paper napkin. \"All right--I won't tell you.\" \"Fucking perfect,\" Colin muttered. \"We'll probably both end up with pneumonia, standing out here freezing our arses off.\" Alex muffled another sneeze in the crook of his elbow. \"Then why don't we get back in the van for now? It's got to be warmer than this.\" \"There is that,\" Colin conceded. \"Right--I'll just leave the bonnet up in case anyone does come along to help us out.\" They climbed inside with alacrity, shutting the doors behind them. Colin immediately leaned over the front seat and began rummaging in the back. \"Got to be here somewhere,\" he muttered distractedly. \"Come on, damn you--yes!\" He straightened up with a triumphant grin, tugging what looked like an old tartan blanket with him. Alex regarded it with a dubious eye. \"God, that's hideous!\" \"Hideous but warm,\" Colin retorted, throwing one end over Alex's lap. \"It's a car rug, mate--and pure wool. Those Scots blokes were good for something, weren't they? And that's not all--\" he leaned back over the seat, rummaged a bit more and came up with a bottle. \"Bushmills--got this tonight from one of our fans. Should keep out the chill, if nothing else.\" He unstopped the bottle, took a healthy swig, then shuddered in appreciation. \"Oh, man . . .\" He eyed the bottle with new respect, took two more swallows. \"Oi, freezing bandmate here! Pass it over,\" Alex ordered and took a swig himself while Colin spread the car rug over both of them and huddled closer to conserve their body heat. The Irish whiskey burned a fiery trail down his throat, and he paused to cough and wipe his watering eyes. \"Christ, is this the real thing?\" he managed, when he had his breath back. \" Is this just fantasy?\" Colin burst into unexpected song. \"Caught in a landslide, No escape from reality . . .\" Alex gaped at him, then, realizing he'd never heard anything quite so funny, began to laugh helplessly as Colin continued to warble. \" Open your eyes, Look up to the skies, and seeee . . .\" \" I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy ,\" Alex chimed in with a shaky harmony. Colin gave him an encouraging grin and they sang on together, \" Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low. Any way the wind blows Doesn't really matter to me. To meeeeee!\" They kept going until Colin noticed the white flakes swirling madly outside the van windows and more cursing ensued. But the flurry didn't last as long as they'd feared, and they saw no reason not to finish their song, though they could not agree as to whether they'd left off at \"I see a little silhouetto of a man\" or \"Galileo--Figaro.\" In which case, Colin argued, the only thing to do was start over from the beginning. With the whiskey now a warm haze between his belly and his brain, Alex had no fault to find with this proposal . . . ---xxx--- \"Never did trust that van.\" Dan Miller, PoP's drummer, scanned the road before them. \"It looked like it was a breath away from the nearest scrap heap.\" \"If it were a horse, someone would've shot it already,\" Andrew Wymore, the group's guitarist, agreed. \"See anything yet?\" \"No, but they were taking the same route we were--there!\" Dan leaned on the horn when he spied a familiar heap pulled over on the side of the road. \"God, that has to be them!\" He pulled over to park hastily, opened the door, and climbed out, followed seconds later by Andrew and Nick Blakely, PoP's bass player. Starting towards the van, they all paused in astonishment as the sound--or rather, cacophony--that reached their ears. \" Nothing really matters, Anyone can see ,\" two male voices chorused with more enthusiasm than skill. \"Nothing really matters, Nothing really matters to meeee. Any way the wind blows . . .\" Andrew recovered first. \"Well, we've found them. And I reckon Freddie Mercury has nothing to worry about.\" \"Andrew,\" Nick murmured to his bandmate, \"are they--are they drunk ?\" \"Oh, yeah.\" It was Dan who answered, face and voice grimly amused. \"One over the eight, the pair of them. Right--this should be fun.\" He raised his voice. \"Colin, Alex! We've come to save your sorry arses. Least you could do is get out and give us a hand.\" ---xxx--- It took another twenty minutes for Dan's jumper cables to rouse a spark in the van's defunct battery, but once the engine got started, it rumbled along satisfactorily enough. \"Should at least be able to get us to London,\" Dan remarked. He glanced meaningfully at Alex and Colin, slightly unsteady and still redolent of Bushmills. \"And I'm driving.\" Andrew took the wheel of Dan's car, and within the hour, they had all pulled up outside of Dan's small place in Kensington. A confusing but not unpleasant interval followed, during which Dan's wife Maggie ushered them into the kitchen and plied them all with hot soup and hot tea. At some point during the washing-up, Maggie's sister Joan and her two kids stopped by, to exchange Christmas gifts and greetings. Joan took the presence of PoP in stride; she was used to her sister's home being knee-deep in musicians. While the sisters chatted, Alex found himself unexpectedly in charge of amusing the children, which he did by playing various kiddie songs on the small upright piano in the living room: \"Oranges and Lemons,\" \"London Bridge,\" and \"Pop! Goes the Weasel.\" A few hours later, mostly sober but still full of soup and not yet ready for sleep, he was still playing the latter--but softly, so as not to awaken anyone upstairs. Dan and Maggie had already turned in, to be followed soon after by Andrew and Nick, who'd won the toss for the lone guest room. Alex and Colin would be bedding down on the sofa and chairs, respectively. \"Why do you reckon the weasel popped anyway?\" Colin inquired, leaning against the doorway. Alex pulled a face. \"I really don't care to think about that too closely.\" \"Balloons pop, bubbles pop--not sodding animals.\" Colin strolled into the living room and dropped onto one of the upholstered chairs, one leg dangling over the arm. \"Bullfrogs might, if they swell up enough.\" Colin snorted. \"Now there's something I don't care to think about too closely!\" \"So what else goes pop?\" Alex mused, playing a minor chord. \"Gum, corks, corn . . .\" \"Pop goes the corn sounds like someone with serious foot problems.\" \"Oh, well, if you're going to bring body parts into this. Eyes pop. Ears pop, especially at twenty thousand feet in a plane.\" \"Joints pop, especially after you've spent almost two hours freezing on the side of the road on December the sodding twenty-first.\" \"We got rescued,\" Alex reminded him. \"And we're now warm and fed, so we can't really complain.\" \"Yes, we can,\" Colin grumbled. \"We can complain about the crap gig we got tonight. Nearly three years of this, mate, and we're still trying to break through.\" \"We're getting closer all the time. We opened for some really big acts this year.\" \"Not good enough. I want us to be the big act other bands fall all over themselves to open for.\" Colin folded his arms and scuffed his dangling foot along the floor. \"This time, next year, I want all the big venues fighting to book us for the holidays. Wembley Stadium, the Albert Hall--hell, I'd settle for something in the States. Madison Square Garden or Radio City Music Hall.\" \"Very modest aspirations,\" Alex said dryly, though he couldn't help but sympathize. How could he not, when he hoped for the very same things? Colin stared broodingly into the gas log fire. \"Reckon I'd do just about anything to put us on the map. We deserve it, mate.\" He looked up at Alex. \"What we need is a hit song. A real hit, something that's whang in the gold, not just getting close.\" He got up abruptly, went to the desk in the window alcove, and returned with a notepad and pen. \"I'll replace it in the morning,\" he defended himself when Alex cocked an eyebrow at him. \"Besides, Dan's used to our scribbling by now.\" He settled back in the chair, propping the notepad on the arm and resting his feet on the coffee table. Idly, Alex played a few more chords of \"Pop! Goes the Weasel.\" Half a pound of tuppenny rice, Half a pound of treacle, That's the way the money goes-- \"Pop goes my bubble,\" Colin muttered abstractly, writing away. \"No. Pop goes--my dream?\" He shook his head. \"Too bloody close to the truth. Pop goes--pop goes . . .\" \"My hope?\" Alex suggested. \"My heart,\" Colin corrected, sitting bolt upright all of the sudden. \"Pop goes my heart !\" Smiling broadly, he wrote it down on the pad with a flourish. \"Hearts don't go 'pop,'\" Alex objected. \"Though I've heard that heartstrings can go 'zing!'--at least according to Judy Garland.\" \"Why shouldn't they go 'pop,' if we want them to?\" Colin demanded, pointing his pen at Alex. \"Like to see you come up with anything better!\" Alex held up his hands in self-defense. \"Sorry, mate. I'm the music half of this team. Pop goes my heart . . .\" He mulled over Colin's title, shrugged. \"Heard worse, I suppose. Maybe it'll sound better after a good night's sleep.\" \"Sleep?\" Colin stared at him. \"How can we sleep now? We're just getting started!\" \"Colin, it's way past midnight, and we've had a full day of it,\" Alex protested. \"We should both try and get some rest.\" \"One hour, Alex, mate. That's all I'm asking!\" \"Colin--\" \" Half an hour, tops--I promise! I'll write fast.\" Alex sighed. \"I should know better than to believe you,\" he remarked, and knew as soon as the words left his mouth that he'd already succumbed. Colin gave him the brilliant smile that made fans swoon and kept his bandmates from strangling him on a regular basis. \"I knew you couldn't resist!\" he declared, bending over his pad again. \"And I'm regretting it already,\" Alex informed him. Except that he wasn't, not really. He glanced out the nearest window at the pitch-black sky. The longest night of the year--and it was about to get even longer. But a friend like Colin--someone with whom you could share a car rug, a bottle of whiskey, and a mangled rendition of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" on a cold winter's night--could talk you into anything. Stifling a sigh, he rested his hands on his lap and waited to hear what Colin's muse would come up with next.

Derek and Danny were going on some local panel show tomorrow to trash talk with this controversial guy Bradley Hapson. He was this Malcom X wannabe, that dressed like he was still in the eighties. Derek had been doing a little research and police were scared rigid of taking this guy into custody. This guy played the race card like a gym rat had bowel movements. Derek thought he could talk some sense into this guy, and there was no better place than live TV. Mom Ally and Davina were banned, even though Derek knew Davina would have chopped off her right arm to be there, but Derek couldn't risk the girls taking any heat if it all got nasty. Danny was going as support, but got a little nervous when he realised that he'd be on the panel too. \"Just for support\" Derek had told him, but as soon as they got there Brad made it clear he didn't want to have anything to do with Derek. The presenter was introducing the panalists to the audience. Brad took offence when he heard that Derek was a former skinhead. \"So Brad, people of all races are struggling in this day and age, why not try to help people as whole?\" The presenter asked. \"Minorites need to come first, we've been ignored for too long\" Brad said. \"There's nothing wrong with wanting to help people, it's just the hate that's coming out of your self righteous mouth isn't helping anyone but yourself\" Derek said. \"I refuse to be lectured on hate by a current Ethnic hater\" Brad announced. \"You can fake it and lie to the dumb white public, but every ethnic man woman and child knows that white turds like you don't change\" \"Brad...\" Derek said, but Brad igonred him as he spoke to another man next to him. \"Fine, talk to my brother, he's done nothing\" Derek said as he gave Danny a prod of encouragement. Danny had no idea what to do, he didn't think he was as smart as Derek, he couldn't use long words not in the right sentences and make them mean anything. \"So Teenage Anglo Dirtbag\" Brad said sneering. \"What have you got to add?\" \"Der...My brother's not a hater, he grew up man, he changed, so can you\" Brad shook his head. \"Look..., boy It's not my community that has to change, you people aren't gonna, so you should just stop bitching about us, and get the first plane out of America, there's plenty of \"White-shite\" places that would have your skinny ass\" Derek put a hand on his brother's shoulder. \"My name's Danny... boy, second of all, Me and Derek aren't going anywhere we were born here\" \"Ladies and gentleman you heard him call me boy right, and he hasn't been reprimanded by the presenter, typical white favouritism right there\" Some people started clapping in the audience and Danny spoke back. \"You called me it first, but my point is, we should stay here and so should you\" The audience died down a little and the presenter looked at Brad's reaction. Brad leaned forward looking like he was trying to read Danny's mind. \"Sooner or later you're gonna realise you're talking a lot of shit. Not black shit not even white shit or Asian shit, or, Latino shit or Italian shit, or European shit. We need fucked up losers like you so normal people can stay the fuck away from you\" Danny argued. \"That's cute Danny, White people can drop off the earth, but every ethnic person, every White-hater knows that I'm right and I believe in my cause because I believe in justice for my community. Where was the justice for those two men your brother killed huh? Brad asked, with the presenter opened mouthed. \"Audience, do your research on Delicious Derek Vinyard, all his Aryan brothers are still sending him thank you cards because he did what the white community wanted and is now known as the nigger killer\" Brad said with sick happiness. \"Fuck you\" Danny stood up and yelled as the presented quickly called for a break. Danny got up of the chair and ran off while Derek was calling his name. That was so fucking embarassing for Danny. They'd spent months trying to rebuild all the shit they'd got into and then that Brad-dick had to go and ruin it. He ran out of the building but halted when he smelt the waft of ciggarette smoke. Derek had banned him from smoking but he was so stressed out right now. He followed the smoke to see one of Brad's ethnic friends smoking a cigarette. \"I don't have a spare\" The young man said as he took one last puff and threw it on the ground. \"I wasn't gonna fucking ask\" Danny said, then looked at the guys surprised face. \"Your dude Brad...he's fucking me up\" Danny admitted as way of explaination. \"Same here\" The guy said as Danny leaned against the wall. \"I'm Calvin, Brad's brother\" Danny nodded. \"So you wanna pay for my ticket to a white country?\" Danny asked. \"God...I'm not like Brad...we've got the same parents but that's where the similarites end\" \"Why the fuck is he like that?\" Danny asked surprising himself by really wanting to know. \"He wasn't always like that, at first it was just injustice in the system, equal ops, Rehab programmes, positive community events, but then Brad just got really narrow\" Calvin explained. \"One day he was all about minorities, then it was Black power all the way and I couldn't understand\" \"You still went along with that shit though\" Danny added knowing the feeling. \"Well yeah, the good programmes my brother was running got him a lot of sponsership money. Money that got me through college. But as soon as Brad went all Malcom X, the sponsor money went down. Brad found out he was getting sponsored by you guys and cancelled his programmes. His message was so over the top, that he didn't include other minorites and he scared them off\" \"Duh. he needs to get a clue\" Danny said. \"Yeah, but then other \"Ethnic supremisists\" Got in on Brad's action. They feed off each other. I really wanted to go into politics, but no-one's going to go near me now\" Calvin admitted. \"I would\" Danny said a little too quickly. \"You need to show dudes that not all \"Ethnics\" are fucking crazy\" \"Yeah well, easier said than done\" Calvin said as they were interrupted, by a some surfer dude with red beads around his neck. \"Calvin come on...\" The guy said, and Calvin began to follow him with a nod. \"I'm coming\" Calvin moaned as Danny looked at them in shock. \"Errr...Cal, your bro know you're friends with a white guy?\" Danny asked. \"First of all he's not just white, he's half Native American. My brother doesn't know, he never meets who I date\" \"Date?\" Danny asked. \"Aren't you worried that I might kick your ass?\" Danny asked, but they both knew he wouldn't. \"No straight guys who like themselves don't give a crap\" Calvin told him. \"I'll see you around\" Danny watching Calvin and his surfer slut walk away before joining Derek back at the panel. It looked like Brad had be told to talk to Derek, or been paid on the side. \"Danny, progress. Where the fuck have you been?\" Derek asked quietly. \"With Brad's little bro\" Danny replied. \"Brad needs to play nice Der, I'm ready to dish out some shit\" Danny said rubbing his hands together.[Chapter 2] A/N: Strong and Adult Language. Adult scenes. \"Cal come here\" \"Brad I've got class\" Calvin said annoyed. His brother had been typing for a paper all night and he could hear his brother through their thin walls. \"Read the papers it's about the Oscars\" Brad asked. \"Brad I've gotta go\" Calvin said. Brad asked to meet him at Brad's \"Evolution\" Meeting at Six and told him not to be late. It was hard to juggle his \"friend\" Heath with his Brother's meetings and rally's. The Oscars was just another thing for Brad to bitch about. \"Why don't I come along with you?\" Heath asked as he walked Calvin to class. \"I can handle it\" Calvin said he didn't want to freak Heath out. They'd been friends for a while, but they hadn't been dating for that long and he didn't want Brad to ruin it. After college he reluctantly went to Brad's meeting. \"Ladies and Gentlemen I'm going to read you a passage of an article I'm adding to my weekly column. \"Daniel Day Lewis: The lucky crap-trick?\" Mr Daniel Day Lewis may have film requests coming out of his ass. But he's a mediocre actor, with the arrogance and the delusion of grandeur that all white devils possess\" \"Oh God\" Calvin moaned. \"The Oscars is run by the whites for the whites. Name one Ethnic actor that's received an Oscar\" Calvin opened his mouth. \"Calvin shut up. Don't bother talking about that whore Halle Berry, she's half white\" Brad said. \"Why is Halle a whore?\" Do you know her?\" Calvin asked. \"I don't have to Cal, she's mixed\" Brad said. \"Back to my great article. \"Did Gabourey Sidibe get an Oscar for Precious? She would have if she had been white. Has Javier Bardem? No. But first time nominated blonde Jennifer Lawrence gets an Oscar for playing a needy easy slut. Daniel Day Lewis has been a panel favourite from Day dot. Is Mr Day Lewis bribing the Academy? Three Oscars for one white guy? What about the Spanish, Aboriginals, Moroccan Native American or Greek actors that never get nominated? It's a disgrace. The Oscars panel is made up of old Middle class racists that still think and want today to be 1945. There-fore the below average white actor Daniel Day Lewis is the perfect racist's choice for this very reason...that reason can be read in my article out next week\" Brad said. \"Thanks for taking the time to listen everyone\" Brad said. The audience clapped and Brad said they could help themselves to drinks. Bradley spotted a woman in the small audience, and pointed her out to Calvin. \"That girl\" Brad said. \"She's Ethnic, but doesn't she look a little too...nordic to you?\" Brad asked. \"So...you want me to ask her if she's got a white parent, classy\" Calvin said. \"Of course not Cal, just kick her out, she'll only lie\" Brad said leaving his brother to do his dirty work. \"My brother barely gets enough people at his crappy meetings\" Calvin explained to Danny later. \"He finally gets a little group that will listen to him and he's ready to get rid of them. So Danny umm...you wanna go to the bowling alley with me and Heath later?\" Calvin asked. Danny said yeah. He did and was going to go with them, but he'd have to make up an excuse to Derek. Brad had given his brother Derek such a hard time on TV, he didn't want Derek to think that he was betraying him. He told Derek that Sweeney had given him another paper to do and he had to research it at the library. \"Well well well look at you working your ass off you fucking Swot \" Derek said. \"Good for you\" Derek said. He asked Danny if he wanted a ride, but he refused. As Danny emptied out his rucksack and left. Derek watched his little brother from the window and saw that he looked a little too smart for the library. Danny reached the bowling alley and was introduced to Calvin's friend Heath. \"Still keeping the skinhead look...nice, not\" Heath said. \"Yeah well, Danny's into punk rock so his haircut makes sense\" Calvin said. Danny shyly nodded. Calvin knew about Derek. Everyone knew about Derek, but Danny couldn't bring himself to tell Calvin about his own involvement with his brother's skin-head gang. Danny was gonna grow his hair out and save up to get the skin-head tattoo off his skin. But until then the \"Punk Rock excuse\" would have to do. \"So umm...how long have you guys known each other?\" Danny asked. \"We met in Maths class, I was such a dumb-ass\" Calvin said. \"What do you wanna do after school Danny?\" Heath asked. After school I usually crash at a friend's place and grab their cigarettes\" Danny said. Heath sighed. \"Dude I mean after you graduate?\" Heath asked. \"Oh...I...I dunno\" Danny said. \"I'll have to think about it\" Danny said. He did think about it. But every time he thought about the future, his mind went blank. Two years ago, being tagged with \"White Pride\" Forever was an achievement, now Danny was wondering how people were going to take him seriously with a murdering EX skin-head for a brother. Sometimes Danny wished that he could erase the past, like deleting a movie on a DVD. After bowling, with Heath won at, Heath invited Calvin out for something to eat in-front of Danny, as if Danny wasn't even there. \"Danny you wanna come with us? It's on me\" Calvin said. \"Thanks..but I've gotta get back. My brother will be on my ass\" Danny said. Danny was unaware that His older brother Derek was watching him across the street talking to Calvin and Heath. He was slightly shocked but figured he'd met them at the library. He called Sweeney to make sure that Danny really had a project with him. \"Danny's next essay is next week\" Sweeney said. \"I haven't set it yet\" Sweeney told him. Okay Mr Sweeney, thanks\" Derek said to his old teacher. When Danny came home Derek tried to play it cool. Keep Danny's secret. \"How was the library?\" Derek asked making Danny a sandwich. \"Yeah..cool\" Danny said. \"Meet anyone?\" Derek asked. \"Lizzy...she thinks it's hot you know, me being a Swot or a nerd or whatever\" Danny said. Derek held out the plate, then took it away from him. \"What about those guys?\" Derek said. \"What guys?\" Danny asked clueless. \"Don't play with Danny you were talking two guys\" Derek said. \"Derek I'm gonna go upstairs\" Danny said getting up. \"You hid them from me because one of them's black. Who were they Danny? I mean do they go to school with you?\" Derek asked. \"Derek you know I don't have black friends. All the ones at school try to beat the crap out of me. Maybe you saw one try to rob me or something\" Danny said getting up with Derek's sandwich and running out. \"Danny!...Fuck\" Derek yelled running after him. He opened his little brother's bedroom door. \"Danny you still think I'm skinhead scum don't you?\" Derek asked. \"Der, I don't\" Danny told him sitting on the bed. \"I think it's fucking great that you accept everyone. Does the white guy I saw you with know everything...do they both know?\" Derek asked. \"The white guy, is half white, half Native whatever. Der, he's got a stick shoved up his ass\" Danny said his dislike for Heath coming through. \"Well\" Derek said sitting on the bed. \"You're gonna invite your new friends over for dinner\" Derek told him. \"Der...no\" Danny said. \"Fuck yeah Danny. I've changed and you don't fucking believe me\" Derek told him. \"Der, this ain't about you\" Danny said. \"The hell it isn't. Danny you're gonna ask those guys what their favourite meals are. They're gonna come round and I'm gonna cook their favourite stuff from scratch\" Derek said. \"Der come on, don't be a fag\" Danny said. \"Danny if you don't ask them, l'll find them, and tell them that you've been fucking dying to ask them here. That you talk about them all the time and then I'll make you really go to the fucking library with them\" Derek said. \"Fuck it Der, I'll ask them okay, just leave me alone...fuck\" Danny said as Derek left and Danny turned on the Televsion and ate Derek''s home-made sandwich.[Chapter 3] A/N: Thanks for the reviews. Strong Adult Language. Danny ran out the door before Derek could bug him about breakfast. He was light-headed. It didn't help much when he met Calvin on the way to the store at lunch-time. Danny was relived the Heath wasn't with him. Heath was way too judgmental for his liking. \"Alcohol at this time of day Danny?\" Calvin teased. \"I fucking wish\" Danny said. He started sweating and his mouth became dry. This was weird. He'd never asked two guys to his place before. He'd crashed at friend's places, but he'd never asked them to dinner. He didn't want Calvin to go to his house and get put off. \"Umm….my brother Der….. he's really cool about you and your brother… but he saw me out with you and Heath. He wants your fucking life story\" Danny said. \"Why?\" Calvin asked. \"Der wants you and Heath over. I know this sounds really fucking weird….but Der just wants to prove a point\" Danny said walking past him. \"I'll tell Heath\" Calvin said. Danny nodded. \"So?\" Derek asked, when he picked his little brother up from school. \"Yeah\" Danny said nodding. He texted Calvin again. Cal's favourite meal was Paella and one of Heath's favourite meal's was burgers and fries. He showed Derek his phone and went with him to get the ingredients. \"So do you know what Heath and Calvin are studying?\" Derek asked. \"Calvin wants to get into politics…..I think\" Danny said. \"Heath? I dunno\" Danny said. \"You don't care do you?\" Derek asked. Danny shrugged. Danny played games on his phone upstairs as Derek started cooking. Danny came down to check on Calvin's dish. \"Smells good\" Danny said. He got a shower and got changed. He watched TV until he heard a knock on the door. \"Danny!\" Derek shouted. \"Okay\" Danny said answering the door. He opened it and Heath was standing there with Calvin. Calvin offered Danny a bottle of champagne. \"Cool…let's get fucked\" Danny said reaching to grab the bottle. \"Not so fast Danny\" Derek said briskly taking the bottle. \"Hi guys….please come in\" Derek said opening the door. \"Hi\" Heath said. \"Hello Mr Vineyard\" Calvin said. \"It's Derek, please. Make yourself at home guys\" Derek said. They sat down and Derek started asking them questions. They both went to the same college. Calvin was studying politics and Heath was studying Engineering. \"Cool\" Derek said with a nod. \"What kind of Engineering are you studying?\" Derek asked. \"Structural Mechanics mostly\" Heath said. \"What methods are you using? Elasticity or Finite?\" Derek asked. \"Wow, you study Engineering?\" Heath asked. They went on to talk about vessel data compatibility and equilibrium equations, but Danny didn't care. It gave him the chance to spend more time with Calvin. \"So Danny wanna show me a little tour?\" Calvin asked. Danny nodded it was embarrassing for him. Their place was so small. Danny and Derek's old house was huge. They lived in a six bedroom house in a good area. All their neighbors, were like them, Rich White and Middle Class. They were all happy there. Then their Dad got killed. He was a firefighter and went to poor area to hose a small fire down. He never came home. \"Our Dad was probably shot by niggers\" Derek told Danny a few weeks later. Mom was single and alone. Their sister Davina quit school and got a job, but it wasn't enough to keep the house. Mom pecked at Davina to go back to school, but by the time Mom was starting to get herself together, Derek was pretending not to fall apart, by joining White Supremacist Skinheads. The rest….was horrid history that Calvin's Brother Brad was happy to tell the whole world about. \"Bathroom's upstairs on the right\" Danny said. Taking Calvin to Derek's room would be weird so Danny showed him his own. Now it looked pretty normal. Less than a year ago his room was covered wall to wall with posters of Hitler and KKK and White Supremacist DVD's. KKK DVD's were easy to get. There was a point in his life where he thought that he'd live rest of his life like that. Danny dreamed about having the blonde Aryan racist wife and they'd teach their kids everything Derek had taught him. It was the perfect \"White is right\" lifestyle. Now he was standing here next to a Black college student who had a half Native American boyfriend. It was crazy to Danny. But he liked Calvin a lot. He couldn't see himself getting on with Heath though. \"Can I sit down?\" Calvin asked. Danny nodded and turned on the TV. \"What was it like?\" Calvin asked. \"What?\" Danny asked. \"Having a brother like Derek?\" Calvin asked. \"Did it freak you out?\" Calvin asked. Ladies and Gentlemen I'd like to thank you for being here. I'm proud to see so many Ethnic faces here today. It's about time the Black community got off their asses. Now I've talked a lot about the white devils and I'm not gonna let up. But I've gotta say the Asians are just as bad in the prejudice and racist departments, they can't be trusted. The Asians bitch about us, only in their own language, cause they think that us dumb blacks don't get it, but we totally do right?\" Brad asked. Some audience members nodded. It doesn't matter where they're from, Tokyo, Pakistan, Dubai. The Asian's have it in for all of us so keep an eye out for them. Asians maybe another \"minority\" as I'll use that term loosely because the Asians are everywhere. Just like the Whites honestly the White people are like a disease, they are diseased for God's sake…..\" Brad paused and went back to the subject. \"I'll start again folks. The Asians may be a \"minority\" but all of them, every one of these Asians are racist and lick White devil ass. They'll be following all the White trash straight to hell. Thanks for listening guys\" Brad said nodding at the applause. Soon after the lecture he got approached by a girl asking for his autograph. \"Hey…..great lecture\" She said waving a pen in his face. \"I'm sorry…..but are you white ?\" Brad asked. \"Well….no…...my mother…..\" She said. \"You dirty lying white trash whore, get out!\" Brad shouted. \"Can someone clean that White slut-bitch's chair?\" Brad asked the janitor. \"Derek, that burger and fries, were awesome. Can you cook for me everyday? Heath asked. \"Heath you're in college you can't afford me \"Derek said. \"Paella good Calvin?\" Derek asked. Calvin twirled the pasta in his fork before answering. \"Derek…..I don't care if you're still a racist\" Calvin said. \"Do you know how many times me and Heath have heard \"I can't be a racist, I've my best friend's Asian, my postman's black, my boyfriend is Samoan or whatever. It doesn't matter\" Calvin said. \"Look Calvin I know what you mean. Words are just words. I could be friends with a Thousand Filipino guys. Sex is just Sex. I could fuck a Million Black girls and still believe in KKK and White Pride or whatever, but I thought Danny was hiding you guys from me. I saw you with my brother asked him about it. My little brother lied to my face. I just wanted to let him and you know that anyone and everyone is welcome here. You're both such great guys. I don't know why Danny was gong all James Bond and didn't want us to meet\" Derek said. Heath looked at Calvin. \"There's another reason why Danny didn't want you to meet us\" Calvin said. \"Cal we don't have to…\" Heath started to say. \"Heath it's okay. Derek, Danny probably kept you from us because…Heath and I are dating\" Calvin announced.[Chapter 4] A/N: Thanks for the Reviews. Strong/Offensive Language. Why did Cal have to say that? it ruined everything. Danny looked at his Brother. He was looking at the table, then he put his knife and fork down. Derek pulled himself up from the table and stood up. \"Guys….I think it's best if you leave\" Derek said. \"Der!\"Danny whined. Sure Cal shouldn't have just announced it at the table like that. But his older Brother Derek couldn't just kick them out like that….could he? \"Depression is called the \"Black Dog\" There's also \"Black Market\" \"Black Widow\" \"Black-Mail\" \"Black sheep\" Black Ice\" \"Black-listed\" \"Black-Balled\" \"Black-ops\" and many other phrases like the ones I've mentioned. Are words that White devils have forced onto society to oppress people like us\" Brad said. \"Who can forget the film with the Title \"Black Swan?\" In the film the \"Black Swan\" Is the evil ugly, twisted corrupt threatening one. While surprise surprise, the \"White Swan is the fragile beautiful kind innocent pure one. That's no coincidence. \"Black Swan\" is a Racist film with Racist values that Ethnic-Hater Natalie Portman got an Oscar for. The Ballet production and the film is Prejudiced and should be banned. That's why us Ethnic people need to stick together. We need to show the White Devils that they can't get away with this\" Brad said. A young woman raised her hand upwards. \"Excuse me. But If you found \"Black Swan to be extremely racist and prejudiced, why have you seen both the Ballet and the film versions?\" The woman asked. Brad gritted his teeth before answering. \"You know, for a so called Ethnic woman, you look a damn sight more paler every week. Are you bleaching?\" Brad asked. The audience looked at her. She swore under her breath and looked at the floor. Now the one critic was silent, Brad could hand out his Anti Daniel Day Lewis Scripts. \"Okay guys. These papers are a petition to strip Award winning racist Daniel Day Lewis of his Oscars. He doesn't deserve them. An more skilled Ethnic actor does. Hand the Petition out to your family and friends\" Brad said. Heath and Cal got their coats and Danny slowly walked them to the door. \"I'm fucking sorry about this shit Cal. I'm…I'm gonna talk to Der. We're still cool…..right?\" Danny asked. Calvin nodded. \"Tell your Brother, thanks for the meal….the Burger and Fries were great\" Heath said. Danny nodded and closed the door. He went back inside the living room to see Derek stacking up the Half-eaten plates. \"What the fuck Der?\" Danny asked. \"Danny what the fuck is your problem?\" Derek asked. \"My problem? I'm not throwing kids out of the house. What's wrong Der? You liked Heath. You can't stand Cal can you? He's smart and Black. It's too much for you to handle isn't it?\" Danny asked. \"Fuck you Danny. I fucking invited them when you didn't have the balls. What is this? Some kind of test? I don't care about Blacks or Native Americans Danny. But you had to bring fags over here? Seriously?\" Derek asked. \"They're cool guys Der, Cal is cool\" Danny said. \"Why is he so cool Danny? Does he really like you? Or does he just wanna fuck you? I don't want you hanging around them anymore Danny. Especially Calvin. I can't trust him now\" Derek said. \"No, I can't trust you Der\" Danny said. \"Danny, can you just wash the plates and stop giving me shit?\" Derek asked. \"You're causing the shit Der. Do you know what it's like? Going to school every day as your fucking Brother?\" Danny asked. \"No Danny please Enlighten me\" Derek said sarcastically. \"You killed Two Blacks Der. I've got the racist kids cornering me for your auto-graph. When they're gone the rest of the school treat me like shit. The only reason I haven't got my ass kicked is because Sweeney keeps them off my ass\" Danny said. \"Cal's the only guy that hasn't judged me for the shit that you did. We were cool and now, you've fucked that up. Just like you fuck everything up Der\" Danny said. Danny did the dishes, like his Brother Derek told him to. Then he avoided him for the rest of the night. He stayed up playing video games until his Big Brother knocked on the door. \"I'm just doing this for you Danny. Goodnight\" Derek said. \"Night\" Danny said still looking at the TV. Derek went to bed. When Danny was sure that Derek was asleep, he called Calvin. \"Hey….yeah I wanna meet you too\" Danny said. They met up at a late night Diner. The waitress wouldn't serve either boy any alcohol, because they didn't have any ID. \"Stingy bitch\" Danny said swirling his lemonade around with a straw. \"Is something wrong Danny? If it is, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you in that position. I hope Derek hasn't kicked you out\" Calvin said. \"I should be so lucky\" Danny said. It wasn't Christmas or anything. But there was a lot of flashing lights on the walls of the Diner. When he was younger, he would stand up and try to put them in his mouth. Danny would almost fall off the table, and Derek would be there to catch him. Years later, Derek wasn't there anymore. Derek was letting Little Brother fall in Mid-air. Danny had to find a safe landing and fast. \"Cal, you can say no to this but…\" Danny began to say. \"No\" Calvin said smiling. \"Sorry Danny…go on\" \"I need a place to stay for a bit. Can I stay at yours?...Please?\" Danny asked. \"Wait. Danny you want to stay my Black Supremacist Brother's house?\" Calvin asked. \"Sure. It beats staying with my Asshole of a Brother\" Danny said.[Chapter 5] A/N : Thanks for the Reviews. Strong Language. ...\" Sports. The Olympics. MMA. I mean in MMA, Racist Whites want All American UFC Champions. But they hate Jon Jones. Jones is American. But they hate Jones because he's Ethnic. They'd rather have Foreign, Swedish Gustafsson be Champion. Just because the Gustafsson looks Aryan. So when Gustafsson wins and if Mendes, beats Aldo. The White Devils are going to say... ...\" \"We've got all White UFC Champions Hell yeah!\" But you know what? We will have the last laugh my friends. 'Cause that line up is going to be the most Ethnic looking group of UFC Champions ever. White devils are just too stupid to see it. I'm going to tell you guys something that's going to shock you. No Heather, don't nod yet. ...\" My Brother is friends with a White devil, yes. Well, the kid's half White, but he's White to me. I know guys, I'm going to have to end that friendship. My Brother can't hang around with a White dude. That devil will poison him. So I'm going to work my magic guys... Today... ...\" Danny had to hide. It was great when he and Calvin were alone. The first night he stayed over at Calvin's, it gave him a rush. It gave him A sick thrill that he was staying at Hapson's house. Hapson didn't have a clue the first night. Brad was getting ready for the \"Ethnic Pride\" March. He was out most of the time. ...\" \"A friend's here Brad, don't wake him up\" Calvin said. \"Jesus. It's not that Half-White demon is it?\" Brad asked. \"Brad! No, he's \"Ethnic\" I can wake him up if you want to say Hi\" Cal said. Surprised by his Brother's eagerness. Brad shook his head. ...\" \"I've gotta go. Make sure your guest cleans up after himself\" Brad said. The second he walked out of the door. Danny came out of the spare room. \"How long can we keep this up?\" Danny asked. \"I'll tell him tonight. When he comes back from \"Ethnic Marching\" he'll be too tired to argue\" Calvin said. Danny got up. He washed himself and smiled. ...\" He wondered what Brad would think if he knew that a White guy was in his house. Showering naked. He got changed. He'd have to go back to Derek's to get more clothes. He yanked his School-bag off of the drawer. The first Drawer whined and got pushed open. Inside the drawer, where lots of envelopes addressed to Calvin. Danny opened the drawer all the way out. He took out the envelopes and went out to see Calvin. ...\" \"See you Danny\" Calvin said, on his way out. \"Wait! Cal...I think these are for you\" Danny said. He put the envelope on the table and went to School. While he was there, on his Lunch-Break he knocked on Sweeney's door. \"I'm supposed to see you Friday\" Sweeney said typing on his computer. ...\" \"Yeah, but...can I talk you to now?\" Danny asked. Sweeney nodded. Danny came in and shut the door. \"Before you talk, I need you to listen. What do you think you're doing Danny?\" Sweeney asked. \"I'm just hanging out with you\" Danny said confused. ...\" \"Very Clever. You're still a little Boy. Making his way in the world. You don't know your ass from your shit stained elbow and you've moved out\" Sweeney said. Obviously Derek had called Sweeney. \"Yeah\" Danny said. \"You're Away from Derek. Your only supporter. Your Father figure. You've left A former White supremacist and shacked up with a Black supremacist. Is that wise Danny?\" Sweeney asked. ...\" \"Sweeney...Sir. I'm not staying with Brad. I'm staying with his Brother, Cal. He's cool and Der, well. He was acting like a prick\" Danny said. \"So running away to Brad's house is going to make everything better? I bet he doesn't even know you're there\" Sweeney said. Danny stayed quiet. Danny felt like he shouldn't have to explain. Both of them knew what Derek was like. \"Please Danny, tell me you're in regular contact with Derek\" Sweeny said. Danny nodded. ...\" \"Why are you here Danny?\" Sweeney asked. Before Danny could answer, the bell rang. He got back from School in the afternoon. He knocked on Calvin's door. He heard shouting then just silence. The door opened. \"Hey Danny, just the guy, come in\" Calvin said grabbing Danny's arm. Danny walked with Cal into the living room. All the letter's Danny had found were on the table, opened. Calvin's Boyfriend Heath was there. Both of them looked exhausted. ...\" \"Hi, What's going on guys?\" Danny asked Calvin. He didn't want to admit it, but if he'd put Heath in the shit, he was glad about it. \"Danny those letters that you found. They were really important\" Calvin said staring at Heath. ...\" \"Are you going to tell Danny? Or shall I?\" Calvin asked Heath.

Interwoven into the tragic death of Alfred is Iris Robertson; cheif mechanic at US Robotics. She quickly becomes a key player in the investigation as mysterious occurences threaten to destroy the bonds between robots and humans. _____ \"Doc! Doc!\" Out of place in the white suits and crisp uniforms of the rest of the people in the hall, a teen came bolting down the hall in a dingy gray jumpsuit...her only reason for not being kicked out the smudged badge bearing the US Robotics logo flapping from her neck on a loop of wire. She huffed to a stop before Alfred Lanning, who looked amused at her ungraceful running. \"What's all the noise for...at this hour?\" he laughed, and despite her pants of breath, Iris Robertson, cheif mechanic, could not help grinning back. \"Special congrats!\" she said in excitement, \"The big roll out of 'bots tomorrow remember?\" \"I remember, I remember,\" he sighed, \"Exhausted myself all last night trying to tie up the last joint operations for NASA with your uncle you know.\" \"He told me,\" she bounced in excitement, \"I just got back from the factory...they got panicky when one of the machines got a little jerky.\" Iris was unlike her uncle and co-founder in many ways. Most of her form declared her as being a girl of brawn, despite her intense and deep knowledge of robot functions. She never dressed too formally, understanding too many times that it was a waste to show up for work at a job that ruins most clothing. Iris wasn't cut out for absolute business or intellects...but it didn't keep her from diving head-first into her job. Earlier than anyone else, she arrived at the \"shop\" as she called it to fix any anomalies with NS models during testing...as well as working in joint efforts with scientists who attempted to smooth out any wrinkles in the positronic brain. Iris liked the brain for two strictly different reasons; its pleasing asthetic appearance and the physical structure and function. She never dove in any further than that. Dr. Lanning invited her in his lab. Iris liked it; it had plenty of things to tinker with and Dr. Lanning never minded it when she fiddled with the tightening of bolts and sprucing of joints when she visited. Promptly she picked up a spare arm, whose tube-like muscles had grown slack. As she stretched the material back into place, she sat casually in a spare stool. \"What are you planning on doing tomorrow to celebrate?\" Dr. Lanning seemed to flinch slightly, leaned against the window. \"Pardon?\" \"To celebrate...for the NS-5 shipments?\" she repeated herself, \"I'm celebrating with the guys back at shop over Luici's, if Robertson's not taking you to any parties-\" \"He has,\" Dr. Lanning sighed, \"But I'm not quite sure what tomorrow will bring. Anything's possible.\" Iris fidgeted in her seat at the solemn tone. He was so much easier to talk to when he wasn't worrying. She set aside the newly spruced up arm, going to the window as the sun began to rise. She put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \"Well,\" she began with a smile, \"That's what makes it such an adventure right? We just gotta wake up and face what's coming.\" \"Right,\" Dr. Lanning lit up, patting her on the back. His hand became slightly stained with engine grease but he never minded it. \"It's as the old saying goes, A wise man, and a foolish man, each one reveals the other .\" \"Yeah but at least we know who's the idiot,\" she grinned good naturedly. At that moment, her pager buzzed frantically, making her jump. \"Oops! I gotta run! See if you can't meet us at Luici's Doc!\" she yelled behind her as she hurried out the door to the elevator. She was left with his age old smile and a parting wave, and at that moment felt so reassured to see him with the rest of the mechanics at the packed little restaurant having a drink and a good time. Only two hours and one shattered window later would she find him dead on the cold marble floor of the lobby. _____ \"The homicide detective is going to be here to ask a few questions soon,\" Dr. Calvin said, remaining rigid despite the murder that laid so many floors below. \"Once he reviews the crime scene and holographic projector.\" Iris was still throughly shaken. She'd heard the smash from the 14th floor while giving one of the prototypes one last check-up before it went back to evaluation from the scientists. She'd been unable to investigate it further until she managed to put away all her tools and put the NS-5 in stand-by mode. But the ruckus outside was quickly draining the color from her face. By the time she saw the broken window and Dr. Lanning's body smashed on the floor...she was white as a sheet. She could only nod back to Dr. Calvin. \"He...he seemed so casual...\" she trembled, stuttering. Dr. Calvin didn't reply, but her face gave her true feelings away, \"I could have never-\" \"None of us could,\" Dr. Calvin reassured, \"I never thought he'd do this either...\" The elevator door slid open, directing Iris and Dr. Calvin's attention. A taller black man flashed his police badge. \"Detective Spooner, homicide.\" he introduced himself. Iris tried to shake off her distress and shook his hand, \"Iris Robertson, cheif mechanic.\" Spooner turned to Calvin, \"Dr. Calvin? Mind waiting outside a minute?\" She complied, and left Spooner and Iris alone in the spare office. Iris sat back down as Spooner took a seat. \"They told me you talked to Dr. Lanning only two hours prior to his death. What were you doing in the building so early?\" Iris shrugged, \"Robots don't run by themselves. I always show up first...to open shop and go over diagnostics for prototypes. Sprucing up stuff.\" \"What did you go see Dr. Lanning for?\" \"Just to give him a thumbs up for finishing the big project,\" she twiddled her fingers, \"I invited him to celebrate with me and the other mechanics and then left.\" \"Did he seem...off put...by anything?\" \"A...a little...\" she admitted, rubbing the back of her neck in nervousness. \"When I asked him what he was doing tomorrow he kinda stuttered. Said he didn't know what was coming tomorrow.\" she gulped back a sob trying to force its way back up, \"I...I guess he'll never know now.\" Spooner looked at her with slight sympathy, giving her a breif pat on the back. \"What did he last say to you?\" \"He left me off with a little proverb when I tried cheering him up before I left,\" she sniffled, \"He said; A wise man and a foolish man, each one reveals the other .\" \"Nothing else?\" \"Nothin'.\" Spooner sighed as he stood up, Iris quickly following suit, \"What is it with that guy and all his riddles?\" he grumbled. He finally headed to the door. \"C'mon. I need to investigate the crime scene, and I need your help. Doctor outside is escorting.\" \"Calvin,\" Iris corrected hastily as she followed. _____ \"Laurence told me to accomodate you in anyway possible,\" Calvin noted in the elevator as they began their long descent to Lanning's office. Iris felt more out of place than ever; a scruffy teen mechanic in between the detective and the robot psychologist. She stood behind them, mimicking Calvin's crossed arms in an attempt to look formal. \"Really,\" the detective drawled unusually, raising a slightly annoyed eyebrow from Calvin. Iris fidgeted a little more, feeling slightly uncomfortable, \"Okay..\" \"I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psycho-profile,\" she continued, voice unharried, \"Alfred had become a recluse, and rejected human contact for machines.\" \"It's true,\" Iris added, \"I barely got to talk to him save for two hours ago...and he's almost always here.\" \"So you're a shrink huh?\" Spooner added on, looking amused, \"Man my ex-wife will sure be glad I'm talking to you,\" he looked curiously at Calvin. \"You don't know her do you?\" \"I'm..sorry are you being funny?\" Calvin replied stiffly. \"I guess not,\" Spooner said back, a little more sober this time. Iris fidgeted. Maybe she'd been spending too much time around machines as well, because the atmosphere in the elevator just went beyond uncomfortable. The door slid open as the three of them got off onto their floor. \"So would you two say that Dr. Lanning was...suicidal?\" Spooner asked. \"Not ever,\" Iris replied, \"He worked a lot and all but he liked his work.\" \"It would seem the answer to that question is already apparent,\" Calvin answered back, eyes flickering out towards the lobby where all the traces of Dr. Lanning's death had been wiped clean. Iris shuddered; even though his dead body strewn on the ground like that had been disturbing, she was even more creeped out at how hurriedly the place seemed to want to be rid of him...like wiping him clean off a chalkboard. \"That's not what I asked you,\" pressed Spooner at Calvin. Iris looked uneasily at Calvin. She didn't know her well, but she came off as being a very strict, upright woman...like so many who worked at US Robotics. She was quiet for a moment, until she finally replied. \"No,\" she said shortly, \"I wouldn't have thought so. But obviously I was wrong.\" Spooner took this moment to look over the edge of the floor balcony. Seeing the distance he let out a whistle. \"That's a long way down,\" he said, \"You people sure do clean up quick around here.\" Calvin looked over too, in slight analyzation. Spooner shrugged a little, \"I can't blame you though, I mean who wants some old guy goin' bad in the lobby.\" Iris flinched visibly, shaking slightly from the casual sting of Spooner's statement. It flared up Calvin though as she approached him looking angry. \"He was not 'some old guy', Alfred Lanning was everything here.\" Iris looked out the window, still pained. This morning she'd arrived as early as Lanning did, ready for a day of work. How could it have ended with him taking his own life like this? \"We are on the eve of the largest robotic distribution in history. By Saturday there will be one robot to every five humans. These robots are the realization of a dream,\" she added on more throughly, \"Dr. Lanning's dream.\" \"You know what?\" Spooner replied in his usual, casual, snarky attitude, \"In that dream of his? I bet you he wasn't dead.\" Iris twitched again as Calvin glared back at Spooner. This wasn't one of her usual days. ___ End Note: I love how snarky Will Smith is as Spooner. I TOTALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE LIKE OMG.[Chapter 2] Summary: [I, Robot] Movieverse. Interwoven into the tragic death of Alfred is Iris Robertson; chief mechanic at US Robotics. She quickly becomes a key player in the investigation as mysterious occurrences threaten to destroy the bonds between robots and humans. _____ They had continued to Dr. Lanning's office. Undoubtedly, Detective's Spooner's blatant and rude attitude had seriously offended Dr. Calvin. In any other situation, Iris might have been amused by it...but the situation was pertaining to the death of one of the most important men in the world...a good friend of hers. She could only fidget in distress. \"Keep twenty-four hour surveillance?\" Spooner inquired. \"Obviously. Company policy.\" \"Where are the feeds?\" \"Sensor strips,\" gestured Calvin to the fluorescent lights lining the halls. \"Everywhere but the service areas.\" \"Any particular reason they're not linked up down there?\" \"It's incompatible with the equipment down there,\" Iris explained. \"The steam builds up a bit down there so it ends up fogging the lenses and making the sensors short-circut.\" \"The strips link to our positronic operating core,\" Calvin pointed to the giant positronic brain, hanging vertically from the top of the building. Iris knew it well...many times she'd climbed atop the precarious foot holds to fix various glitches. \"Wow,\" Spooner said dully, looking at the glowing machine, \"Thermostat wasn't good enough. You went and gave the building a brain.\" \"She was actually Lanning's first creation.\" Spooner made a double take at Calvin. \"She? That's a she?\" He couldn't help shaking his head. \"Definitely need to get out more.\" Calvin merely ignored him. \"Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence,\" she read off one of the strips. \"Viki?\" At the sound of her name, the AI immediately came into view, a cool voice projected through many microscopic holograph projectors. \"Good day.\" \"Viki designed most of Chicago's protective systems.\" Calvin explained. \"I have decreased traffic fatalities by 9% this year alone.\" Not only that, but she had also helped in the diagnostics department, kept regular updates on the effectiveness on tools and machinery used by the mechanics, and provided logical insight at the occasional board meeting. Iris was so used to seeing her image projected everywhere at once. \"Ooh thanks,\" Spooner said, unimpressed, \"Show the inside of the lab from one minute prior to the window break.\" Viki faded into a screen, but when she played the security tape it came out fuzzy. Viki faded back into view, sounding apologetic. \"Apologies. There appears to be data corruption.\" Iris and Calvin looked at each other in surprised confusion. \"From the outside of the lab from the window break until now,\" Spooner requested. Viki flashed the screen, the images coming up clear and in fast-forward. Guards, the board of directors, and the investigation team came in and out until they all vanished, finally showing Spooner, Calvin and Iris. Iris flushed as she became immediately aware of her scuffling walk and hunched shoulders and tried to stand up straight. Spooner pointed out Calvin, who sat straight and upright. \"Wow now see you have great posture. You stand really straight and I'm slouching.\" \"Would you like to go inside now?\" she sighed as Viki vanished. \"Oh sure after you.\" They went inside, Iris immediately looking over where the control manual was in the room. She opened the hatch and found an auto scrambler jammed into the circuit. \"Dr. Lanning must have stuck this in to mess up the video surveillance.\" Iris pulled it out, \"It looks like it hasn't been touched in weeks...how long was this in anyway?\" \"Long enough for Dr. Lanning to commit suicide apparently.\" Calvin answered as they walked around. Iris pocketed the scrambler and put it in her pocket. She looked around. Everything looked nearly untouched...just as she'd left it when she first saw Lanning that morning. Only change was that the robotic arm she'd spruced up that morning was hanging from the ceiling, a usual indicator that Dr. Lanning needed it untouched now. She grew heavy at the sight of it hanging. Was he trying to protect her from becoming a suspect? \"So Dr...Calvin,\" Spooner begun as he looked around for clues, \"What exactly do you do around here?\" \"My general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry,\" she explained, \"Although I specialize in hardware to wetware interfaces, in an effort to promote USR's robotic anthropomorphozation program.\" \"So, what exactly do you do around here?\" Spooner repeated himself. Calvin looked back at him with a frown. \"I make the robots seem more human.\" she summarized. Iris had to hold back a chuckle. She could barely say that last word...much less spell or explain it. \"Now wasn't that easier to say?\" \"Not really, no.\" Iris snickered a little at that, her first smile since joining the two of them. Spooner shot back a smile at the teen. \"You said you're the chief mechanic right?\" \"Yup,\" Iris answered, \"I mostly just help with test runs on the 'bots and fix stuff. Just a tinker-tot.\" \"What were you last doing in here when you talked with Dr. Lanning?\" Calvin asked. \"Just normal stuff,\" Iris shuffled her feet, \"He lets me spruce up some slack parts, I tightened up one of the arms-hanging up there.\" She pointed to the said arm. \"How can you tell that's the same arm?\" Spooner asked, looking up at the hanging objects. \"Oh Dr. Lanning never sets out finished parts on the shelves and stuff.\" Iris waved off, \"If there's a piece that's all done he hangs it up. All the broken or faulty pieces are lying around.\" \"Yeah but how can you tell?\" \"I've been in here tons of times.\" Iris looked at him with a raised eyebrow, \"Chief mechanic remember?\" Spooner simply left to look out the broken window, observing the former crime scene from the jagged hole. It seemed so much farther down from there. Iris had to look away, fiddling with the auto scrambler in her pocket. Spooner picked up a book from a chair by the window, a worn cloth bound volume from what seemed to be the early 1900s. \"Hansel and Gretel,\" he read, looking dubious as he handed it to Calvin, \"Is that on the USR reading list?\" \"Not precisely.\" Calvin looked it over. Then, without warning, Spooner picked up a stool and rammed it straight into the other window, leaving long, sharp cracks. Iris and Calvin yelped as they jumped back. Spooner looked grim...he hadn't broken the window. \"What in God's name are you doing?\" she asked angrily. Iris was still shaking, walking back. She'd felt jumpy enough with Spooner having already interrogated her. She hurried over to the other side of the room, trying to catch her breath. \"Did you know that was safety glass?\" Spooner asked, all seriousness now. \"Be pretty difficult for an old man to throw himself through that don't you think?\" Iris looked pale at the window. \"Well he figured out a way.\" Spooner merely curled his lip derisively. \"Uh huh.\" \"Detective,\" Calvin said more insistently as Spooner faced the dark lab again, \"The room was security locked. No one came or went since early this morning you saw that yourself. Doesn't this mean this has to be suicide?\" \"Yep,\" Spooner agreed, scanning the room closely, before pulling out his gun. \"Unless the killer's still in here.\" Iris couldn't help looking over the robotic models, colorless and chilled to the core. From experience and having helped build the original models, Iris knew very well the strength and capacity of the robots. One was capable of smashing ten windows together in a few short punches. \"You're joking right?\" Calvin looked angrily at the detective's paranoid search as he scanned the shelves. \"This is ridiculous,\" \"But Dr. Calvin,\" protested Iris. She couldn't help siding with Spooner, \"Lanning was a scientist, not superman. He couldn't even chip the window if he tried. And there's no sign of explosives.\" \"But think of the three laws!\" \"Yeah I know,\" Spooner scoffed, searching the shelves, \"The three laws. The perfect circle of protection.\" \" A robot cannot harm a human being ,\" Calvin recited insistently, \"The First Law of robotics.\" Iris looked out the window. Dr. Lanning had died right in front of the wall where those familiar Three Laws were engraved. How much would they mean now? \"Yeah I know I've seen your commercials,\" Spooner replied, eyeing the lit up blueprints for the NS-5, \"But doesn't the Second Law state that a robot has to follow any law given by a human being. What if it was given an order to kill?\" \"Impossible. It would conflict with the First Law.\" Calvin countered. \"Right but the Third Law states that a robot can defend itself,\" \"Yes but only if that action doesn't conflict with the First or Second Laws,\" Calvin pressed on, trying to persuade Spooner away from his accusations. \"Well you know what they say.\" Spooner quoted, \" Laws are made to be broken .\" \"No, not these laws. They're hardwired into every robot.\" \"But Calvin,\" Iris was definitely, if not a bit irrationally, on Spooner's side. No way was Dr. Lanning the type to kill himself. \"We can't rule out the possibility that Dr. Lanning didn't implant the positronic brain with those laws.\" \"Why wouldn't he?\" she argued. \"Well he was the type to experiment wasn't he?\" pleaded Iris. She was only on the other side of the room, but no amount of distance could hide her obvious distress. \"A robot can no more commit murder than a human could...\" Calvin thought for a moment, \"Walk on water.\" Spooner was busy searching through a bin, gun at the ready. \"Well there was this one guy,\" he noted, \"A long time ago-\" But he was interrupted as an NS-5, who had been hiding in the bin he'd searched, leaped out. Everything seemed to move in slow motion as he jumped through the air, knocking Spooner's gun out of his hand, spare parts and wires sent flying from his jump. Calvin put her arms over her head to shield from the debris but Iris found herself incapable of movement as it landed solid in front of her, looking her right in the eye as she was pressed up against the wall. She looked blank and shocked at the NS-5, who stared at her long and hard for a moment. Iris felt her breath constrict in her throat the pure intensity of it...seeing the robot stare at her in such a way was not something she'd expected. She was interrupted by the gun skidding across the floor to tap against her feet. The robot seemed to snap out of it, looking wildly at Spooner and Calvin. \"Iris get back!\" Spooner called out. \"Calm down detective,\" Calvin said, with a dismissive gesture. \"The only thing dangerous in this room is you. Deactivate.\" Immediately, in a smooth, fluid motion, the NS-5 stood up straight, abandoning its defensive stance. Shakily, Iris picked up the gun, cupping it uneasily in her hands so as not to accidentally fire. \"Look, its fine.\" reassured Calvin, gesturing to the robot, \"What you're looking at is the result of clever programming, an imitation of free will it's nothing more.\" Iris edged around it, still looking very suspicious. Something about it's earlier gaze seemed...too human. Too full of curiosity and...maybe...fear. \"How much of an imitation you gotta do about protecting our asses?\" snarled Spooner, drawing a gun from his foot holster. \"Don't be absurd,\" Calvin scoffed, facing him, \"You were startled by a jack in the box.\" However this statement was punctuated by the surprised cry of Iris, who felt herself yanked back and with the detective's spare gun pressing into the bottom of her jaw. The NS-5 inexplicably had pulled her back and grabbed her gun, and locked eye contact with Spooner as Iris gasped in horror. \"S-Spooner,\" she wheezed from the tight grip, her fingers attempting to pry off the robot's arm in vain. \" Deactivate !\" commanded Calvin insistently. \"Let him go,\" Spooner kept up eye contact, his voice low and serious. He knew what there was to lose. \"It's not going to hurt us or her!\" Calvin snapped back, \"I gave you an order !\" she then demanded at the robot. Iris could feel his hand shaking slightly as he pressed it more firmly into her chin. \"He's not listenin' right now lady,\" Spooner said severely. \"And in case you haven't noticed he's got a gun to somebody's neck right now!\" \"Viki seal the lab!\" ordered Calvin hurriedly, growing panicked and angered by the minute. \"No Viki leave-\" But it was too late as the door slid shut behind them. The robot looked between the shut door and the window, and made his break. He thrust Iris forcefully at Spooner and Calvin, knocking them to the ground. Keeping a firm hand atop the head of the two women, Spooner fired several shots at the NS-5 who jumped and leaped out of the way before catapulting himself out of the window. Spooner stood, and made one last shot, this one more accurate as it snapped through the corded muscle on its leg. The robot then vanished out of sight, Iris hearing a loud crack as he hit the bottom. Ears still ringing, she followed the frantic Calvin and Spooner out the door, riddled with questions, one in particular racking the insides of her brain. Just what was going on?[Chapter 3] Summary: [I, Robot] Movieverse. Interwoven into the tragic death of Alfred is Iris Robertson; chief mechanic at US Robotics. She quickly becomes a key player in the investigation as mysterious occurrences threaten to destroy the bonds between robots and humans. \"Police!\" called Spooner as he hurried down the stairs, people quick to get out of his way. Calvin and Iris followed him farther back, not as quick as the detective as they wore office shoes, or in Iris's case boots. The saw him bend over to pick up his discarded gun, an obvious trail of silver fluid leading it it. Calvin observed it from behind him as Iris bent down to survey the damage. \"Bullet tore through the rubber casing,\" Iris diagnosed, \"Barely scratching the inner metal casing holding the lithium muscle solution. The metal casing got worn as he ran-that's why it bled late.\" \"Where's it going?\" Spooner demanded hurriedly to Calvin, \"Where?\" \"It needs to repair itself.\" she explained reluctantly. \"At the factory,\" Iris nodded, \"There's a repair facility there for injured 'bots. But with the amount stored away, we don't have much time. Fixing a torn ligament doesn't take much time, even if it is injured.\" They left the carpool in Spooner's car, a sleek sliver 2031 model. Iris had buckled up in the back, pulling out her touch phone to look up activity from the plants. In the front, where Calvin and Spooner sat, an argument was quickly taking place. \"John, look I need back-up. I'm transmitting my location-\" Spooner explained over his earpiece to the head of the S.W.A.T. captain. \"Don't need back up-\" Calvin protested. \"That's nobody,\" Spooner argued back, irritated at having to talk to two people at once, pulling out the manual override as his steering wheel slid out. \"What are you doing?\" Calvin said looking aghast. \"I'm driving,\" gritted Spooner.[Chapter 4] \"Your stop,\" The elevator rang as it stopped on the twentieth floor. Iris kept her head down to keep her scowl out of Robertson's sight. \"Remember what I told you,\" he said in a warning tone. Iris merely sneered back at him and got off, headed to her own office. A quick scan of her thumb opened the door. Unlike some of the more pristine offices of the other departments, Iris left a lot for wanting in terms of tidiness. She hung blueprints, notes, and holo-screens from wires woven into the ceiling, and thousands of spare parts were boxed, hanging and overflowing all over the place. An equally chaotic desk was jammed into a corner, and a wider space to the far side held seating for robot \"surgeries\" as they were named, and tables with half-done projects. Spare jumpsuits and coats hung from a coat rack and a small bed was nestled into a corner with manuals and books pooled along with cups and plates. The janitorial squad always dreaded the hours spent to, at the very least, clean up what little they could from the Mechanical Ward. \"What's new pussycat? C'mon, lay it on me.\" Iris began to snort with laughter as Jake, her personal NS-4, hummed to life as Iris entered the office. Iris, so taken with her NS-4, had not applied for an upgrade when it was offered to the staff. Jake was a personal memento of Alfred, who had helped her make it himself. Jake was almost as messy as the office, his dingy orange paint chipped in several places and his torso peppered with stickers. \"I'm just working late Jake. Just looking over blueprints.\" \"Cool daddy-o. Pop a squat and kick up your feet.\" Iris was bubbly with giggles as she worked. Jake had often been her companion in watching black-and-white films; ancient movies with gangsters, counts, vampires, and old versions of graphics. Iris collected them and spent many an hour with her faithful NS-4 as he memorized the lines and distributed them throughout her day depending on his analyzation of her mood and situation. As Iris pulled up the normal NS-5 blueprints with a holo-scan of Sonny, Jake cracked jokes, replayed favorite movie quotes until Iris finally asked him to go into hibernation mode for fear of cracking a rib. Even though Alfred had died that morning, his ghost was still existent in Jake, and Iris felt her smile coming back. A half-hour later, as Iris compared holographic blueprints, the door slid open. It was Dr. Calvin. \"Have you discovered any anomalies?\" \"More physical so far,\" Iris replied, barely registering the psychiatrist's presence. \"Denser alloys, more flexible joints...and look here. Alfred made his own set of motors for S-...for the NS-5 that makes him faster and stronger, using some of parts from an old NS-2 set...and those things were near invincible. But I didn't detect any real problems. The rest is in the realm of the positronic brain system. Did you talk to him yet?\" Calvin frowned at Iris's use of words describing Sonny, but went on. \"No. I'm scheduled for a diagnostic tomorrow. Laurence said you're to attend if anything is malfunctioning in the physical state of the brain.\" \"I know,\" Calvin gave her a serious stare long enough to make Iris finally look guiltily back towards her. \"You don't really think a robot did all this on its own do you?\" Iris's expression gave her away before her reply. \"I just can't believe Alfred did it himself,\" Iris said miserably, shuffling her feet as she walked away towards the coat rack. She picked off a clean jumpsuit. \"He was the heart and soul of every operation here...and the physical state of the crime scene leaves so many empty spaces, I don't know what to think of them.\" Iris stepped behind a screen while Calvin turned to allow her some privacy. \"He was a very brilliant man Iris,\" Calvin reminded, \"Even if his situation did require some help from a robot source it doesn't mean it was murder. You've read the definition, murder is only capable when a human-\" \"-Is killed by another human, I know,\" Iris said hastily as she zipped up, stepping out from behind the screen. Her expression looked weary. \"The problem is, I don't know if the NS-5 is really counted for either.\" \"It's just a robot,\" Calvin said sternly, making Iris wince as she recognized the old tone of her uncle. \"And a robot cannot harm a human being.\" Iris was tempted to remind Calvin of the collar of bruises left from their experience with Sonny in the lab, but she was reminded that it wasn't very smart to bait someone of Calvin's status. Especially with an uncle keeping such a close eye on her. \"Laurence wants you to interview the NS-5 on his physical attributes and have a report written up by the end of the night,\" Calvin reminded as she opened the door. She gave a disapproving frown at Jake, who was humming \" Hit the Road Jack\" in his sleep. \"And please Iris...nothing strange.\" Iris felt a twitch of irritation as Calvin left, and wonder if this is how Detective Spooner felt all the time. The door opened to the white, white room of the Diagnostics Lab #51 and Iris, out of place in her gray jumpsuit and messy hair, entered cautiously. Sonny was fastened to an examining seat, his head bowed as he appeared to be thinking very hard about something. He immediately looked up at the uncomfortable Iris. \"Good evening Miss Robertson.\" \"Good evening,\" Iris was unaccustomed to being called Miss Robertson, and even more disturbed by Sonny knowing her name, but she continued down to the examining pad to pull up the diagnostics entry. She could at least be reassured that no matter how much more advanced Sonny was, he couldn't get out of the chair, which could restrain the most stubborn and powerful robot on the market. \"Have you come to fix me?\" \"You're already in good condition,\" Iris replied, taking a seat on the stool, \"I'm just here to ask you why Dr. Lanning gave you your extra physical attributes.\" \"I was not aware that mine were any different from any others.\" Sonny replied, almost astounded, \"I have seen so many like me.\" \"But they're not like you,\" Iris corrected, typing in Sonny's response, \"Dr. Lanning apparently gave you denser alloy, more flexible joints, and more effective motors. You're far more unique than a normal NS-5.\" \" Unique ,\" he echoed, before turning his head to Iris. \"What does that mean?\" \"It-it means you're one of a kind.\" Iris stuttered, \"That there is no one else like you in the world.\" Sonny was quiet, gazing at Iris. \"Thank you,\" he replied, \"For thinking me as a 'one' and not a 'thing' . Dr. Lanning used to think of me as a 'one' too.\" Iris's fingers hovered over the entry pad...and she almost added this. But she reminded herself, with a stab of defiance, she was supposed to document only the physical attributes of the interview. \"So Dr. Lanning never told you of your enhancements?\" \"No. I think he did not consider them as important.\" \"Did he perform any extra operations on you of any kind that you might have logged?\" \"No.\" \"Alright,\" Iris input the information. Obviously Alfred had his reasons for mystery, never to be known. \"Thanks. Dr. Calvin will be in here tomorrow morning for a diagnostics.\" \"You're sad about Dr. Lanning, aren't you?\" Iris stumbled in midstep, heart pounding and jerking painfully. This wasn't like any other diagnostic or checkup she'd ever performed. Her robots never simply asked things, they responded in accordance to codes and principles in their design. But Sonny... \"Dr. Lanning was very important here. He made a lot of people sad when he died,\" Iris said resolutely. \"And with all the joint projects we did together it's very natural I miss him too.\" Sonny looked very solemn at the answer. But much to Iris's discomfort...he also looked rather satisfied and pleased. \"I'm glad to know he was so appreciated,\" he answered. Iris left the diagnostics lab in a fit of discomfort. Robots didn't feel glad. Later that night as she ate a celebratory dinner with her co-workers, Iris was relieved when Detective Spooner finally called. \"Iris. They told me you were on first bat for diagnostics with Sonny-\" \"You know his name too?\" Iris cut off in surprise. \"What? Oh right. I'm surprised you do too,\" he answered back, \"He said his name was Sonny during the interrogation...but the thing is, USR is getting a little tight on how much more I interact with them on this case.\" Iris nodded. \"Right. I need to talk to you anyways...something was off about my diagnostics today.\" Spooner was quick to take her up on the offer, and confirmed he'd pick her up in front of the pizza place. While her fellow mechanics were loathe to see her leave, she pulled on her jacket and paid her tab, hurrying outside as Spooner's sleek, silver car pulled up. The door slid open and Iris jumped inside. \"When did he tell you his name was Sonny?\" Spooner asked promptly. As expected, he was quick to find out all he could. \"When I was fixing himshe answered back quickly, not even buckling in as she hurriedly explained herself. \"I had to make sure it wouldn't malfuction at the police station, and he said his name was Sonny when I was fixing the injuries he got from the SWAT team.\" Iris paused uneasily, before asking back. \"Did he...act strange during your interrogation?\" Spooner raised an eyebrow suspiciously, but seemed to be thinking on the same unsure lines Iris was. \"Yeah, you can say that.\" he answer gruffly, \"He was very expressive...he even had a bit of a snit in the room. Ruined a perfectly good table. Said some...abnormal things.\" Iris shivered, and felt her bruises throb. Yeah...Sonny certainly had the potential to be expressive. Spooner looked over with concern. \"Why? Was he-\" \"Oh he wasn't violent.\" Iris quickly reassured him. \"But...it wasn't like any other diagnostics I ever did.\" Spooner appeared anxious to inquire further, but he simply remained silent as he eyed her bruised neck from the corner of his eye. Iris finally looked around the car in mild curiousity. \"Where are we going?\" \"To Alfred's house,\" he replied, driving into a high end neighborhood. \"It's possible he might have left a clue as to why he died. Just a matter of following leads.\" Iris nodded, fidgeting in her seat. She felt extremely restless, the simple endeavor of checking a possible lead making her feel as if she was being swarmed over by ants. Spooner looked faintly annoyed as he kept swiping glances at her, still wriggling in her seat. \"Would you calm down? We're just checking out the house.\" \"I'm sorry,\" she apologized, \"Only...um...\" \"What?\" Spooner's voice became even more suspicious as he eyed her cautiously. \"Umm...my uncle...doesn't really want me getting in too deep here.\" she admitted with a bright flush. \"He warned me that if I went outta line I'd be suspended. Technically being in the same two mile radius as you counts as misbehaving. But I-\" \"Yes?\" \"-I really want to know what really cause Dr. Lanning's death. I don't know if Sonny malfunctioned or if he did it himself...but I think this case is a lot deeper than just him jumping otu of a window. And that's not even beginning to describe Sonny's case.\" She stopped, taking a deep breath as she tried not to ramble. \"He's the main suspect...and he gave me...\" she fingered her bruises as she trailed off, \"But despite all that he doesn't act dangerous. But he doesn't act like a robot either. And that's what makes this death all the more confusing. I know it looks like suicide,\" she shuddered, turning white, \"But it feels like murder.\" Spooner was very quiet. The sound of gravel as he pulled in through the driveway seemed to be the only sound to permeate the night...and the sight of a sprawling mansion came into view. \"Maybe Calvin's right,\" he muttered, \"Maybe my paranoia is contagious.\" They approached the house. Iris was very familiar with it...it was often the center of some business parties hosted by Alfred in which she'd attended at as young as six years of age. It was an expensive and lavish mansion, with a big garden and ten bedrooms and bathrooms big enough to house a small family. Of course...it wouldn't be that way for long. Already a demolition-bot was stationed for it's future job in tearing the place down. Iris shivered. Perhaps his relatives were a bit hasty in making their decision about the house, but Iris was loathe to relinquish any memorable things about her former friend. \"Demolition due 8 am tomorrow,\" Spooner confirmed, flashing his ID as it appeared on the screen. \"Ought to give us enough time to look around.\" His ID was flashed once more as he gained access to the house. After a voice greeting allowing him entry, Iris followed him inside. However, she jumped with an arm snapping onto Spooner's jacket as the door shut itself behind. Spooner was alarmed, grabbing his gun, but looked rather peeved at Iris's jumpiness. \"Relax.\" he said irritably, \"Even if you are a suspect, nothing's gonna happen so long as you're with me.\" \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" she apologized rapidly, following him up the stairs. Her hand remained hung onto his jacket, and she bit her lip anxiously. \"I'm...I was always so used to working with robots. Knowing just what they're capable of is just a reminder that I did good work. But now...\" \"Feels like they're about to jump out and put a gun to your head right?\" Iris shuddered, and let go. Spooner however, sensed he was a bit tactless and turned around, looking tired...yet apologetic. \"You did do good work. You helped produce somethink people are going to appreciate, and feeling proud about your efforts is healthy. But you gotta realize that in the wrong hands, a good thing can turn bad. Even if it's not the creator's intention.\" \"Do you still think Sonny did it?\" \"Yeah. And your uncle is going to have a helluva time convincing me otherwise.\" He scoffed, remembering the stubborn CEO. \"But something still doesn't smell right about this case. I need you to remain on the inside and try to keep your ears open.\" Iris nodded, still shaky, but resolute. \"I will. I don't care how many toes outta line I get...I don't want Alfred's death to be brushed off like...\" she trailed off, feeling she'd spoken too much. \"...Well I sure as hell don't want it to be disregarded as some old man's disillusion.\" \"You and me both,\" he chuckled. Iris smiled back with eagerness, feeling accomplished at having lifted someone's spirits. The last person after all...had died two hours after she did. Author's Note: Ha. There.

I had a boyfriend and I somehow wondered why me. Some people believe in fate and I never really did. I think some higher being had plans for us and I just didn't know it at the time until it all became clear. My name is Chelsi. I have a boyfriend named Galen and honestly, I don't even know how we clicked. We are both seventeen and juniors in high school. I think we had a class together, English or something like that and he needed some help. So he came to me. I helped him out after school and we became fast friends. I didn't have any plans on crushing on him big time. We go to a high school in the city, where people were still teaching us. They were getting robots in some other schools to teach them but our school was against it. We all knew it wouldn't be long until robots were in the school. There was still a lot of activities students did and I wasn't really into any of them. If I didn't feel like going home, I hung out in the school library and made friends with the librarians. It was 7:30 am and I was in the shower, music playing in the background. I was singing to the music when it suddenly went off and a news bulletin came on. \"This is WKZS, bringing you an important message. Dr. Alfred Lanning, who works at U.S. Robotics, has committed suicide by jumping out of his tenth floor office. Nobody has been taken into custody as of now. We'll bring you more as the day goes by. Thank you for your cooperation. Now, back to regularly schedule music.\" The music came back on, a completely different song now. I finished in the shower and got out. I dried myself and put a towel around me then walked into my room and sat down on my bed. I looked at the clothes I set out before I got into the shower. I just finished getting dressed when there was a knock at my door. \"Yes?\" I asked, walking over to my door and opening it, seeing my robot, Ray. \"Miss, there is a Galen here to see you. Should I let him in?\" \"Yes, let him in.\" Even though Galen and I had been going out for a little over a year and he had been at the house many times, Ray always asked if he should let him in. Smiling, the robot knew my safety was important since my parents were hardly ever home. Hearing the front door open, I walked out of my room and down the steps. I saw him standing the living room, looking around aimlessly. He turned to me and smiled. \"Hey baby.\" He said as I walking up to him and giving him a kiss. He was wearing his football jersey. Every Friday, the football players wore their jerseys for school spirit. Football was big in the area. There was only a handful of schools who still had football and it was a very big thing for everyone. \"Good morning. Hey did, you hear about that Lanning guy that killed himself, I heard it on the radio a few minutes ago.\" I said, walking to the kitchen and grabbing some toast Ray made. \"Yeah, I heard it on my way over here.\" He said, sitting down on the couch. I put some butter on the toast and took a bite. Leaning up against the counter, I looked at my boyfriend. His brown hair was getting long and he was going to need a haircut. He was still tan from the summer and I had no idea how. It made me jealous a bit because I usually burned then tanned. It looked like it came easily to him. I looked at the clock. \"Let's get going then after I'm finished. I don't want us to be late.\" \"Don't worry, we'll be fine.\" He said, looking at me from the couch. Finished up the piece of toast, I brushed my hands of the crumbs into the sink and made my way upstairs. My backpack was sitting in my desk chair where I left and made sure I had all the things I would need. Grabbing my shoes, I tied up the laces and looked at my closet. I debated on grabbing a jacket but decided against it. Taking my backpack into my hand, I made my way down the steps and towards my boyfriend. He stood up when he saw me and I looked up at him, a smile on my face. \"What's that for?\" \"I was just thinking you need a haircut.\" He laughed and shook his head, his hair going everywhere. We were getting ready to walk out the door when Ray spoke to me. \"Miss, your mother is going to be home early today. So, don't come home late after school.\" \"Okay! I'll try not to be!\" I walked out the front door with my boyfriend following me. Walking over to his car, it still amazed me that he got one of the newer cars as a gift from his uncle. I opened the door and got in. Galen was in a moment later and looked at his phone. I hated when he texted while driving (even though the car did it for him), it still made me nervous. \"Jefferson Senior High school,\" he said and the car started moving. I put my backpack on the floor and looked over at him. \"Who are you playing tonight?\" I asked him, scooting closer to him as he had his head against the back of the seat, eyes closed. \"Liberty, we're going to kick their asses tonight.\" He said, opening his eyes and looking to me. \"You're coming to the game right?\". \"You know I wouldn't miss it for the world. Remember, you're coming to my house afterwards and hanging out.\" I said, smiling. He gave a look. \"What?\" \"I don't know if I can. My mom would have a heart attack.\" Even though we had been dating a while, his mom wasn't a fan of me. I never understood why. Every time I saw her, I was polite and used my manners. Sometimes I thought it was my mere existence. \"Call her and ask. I really want you to come over.\" I said, giving him my puppy dog look. He sighed and called him mom. As he spoke to her, I stayed silent. I didn't want her to know I was in the car as while. I listened to the conversation and could hear something was up with her just by the sound of her voice. She reluctantly said yes, I was so happy. A few minutes later, the car rolled into the student parking lot. We got out and looked around. We still had a few minutes to spare. I slung my backpack over my right shoulder and grabbed his hand. We started to walk towards the front doors and saw more people as we got closer. I wonder what everyone was going to be saying about the Lanning guy.[Chapter 2] Chapter One Lanning and NS-5's As the day progressed by, I found out that more and more people were talking about the Lanning guy. Some of my friends were talking about him and the new robots, the NS-5's. We were watched something about them in my one science not to long ago. New, smarter robots that was more helpful. I also heard we had to trade in our old ones for new ones. There was no way I was going to trade in Ray. I had grown attach to him in the last several years I had him. Everybody at Jefferson High had eight periods a day, around forty minutes for each class. There was the core classes that everyone had to take and there was classes students could pick. Every fifth period, I had a study hall and right after that was lunch and for over an hour, I went off campus and go for lunch at a local café that was popular with the older students. Today, I decided I would work on a project out in the stadium where the football players were practicing and it was nice out. Had to enjoy the weather while it was still nice. I made my out towards the football stadium and as I made my way there, I could hear people yelling orders and I smiled. I knew I was getting closer. The guys were out on the field. I climbed up the steps and my steps echoed slightly. Sitting down, I opened up my backpack and pulled out my English book. I worked quietly, listening to the grunting of the guys and the scratching of my pencil on the paper. Looking up, the guys were standing around, having water to drink. Standing up and stretching, Galen looked over and saw me. Smiling, he pulled away from the group and made his way up towards me. He towered over and smiled. I stood up on my tippy toes and kissed his lips. \"Is everyone getting ready for the game?\" He nodded. \"All the guys are getting excited. It's a major game and we need to win this.\" We both sat down on the metal bench and I moved some of my stuff. We sat there, chatting quietly about things. He asked me about my project and I explained it to him. He nodded, even though I knew English wasn't his best subject. The coach yelled for all the guys to gather up and Galen stood up. \"I'll see you after school. Meet you at your car.\" He gave me a smile and went back down to meet the others. Looking at the time, I packed up my stuff and started walking towards the school End of the Day I waited at Galen's car. I leaned against it, the wind blowing my hair slightly. I closed my eyes for a few seconds and I felt the wind no more. I opened my eyes and saw Galen. \"Hey, what's wrong? You look like you're depressed or something.\" I put my hand on his face. \"No, I'm fine. I just had somewhat of a long day.\" He said as he leaned slightly against me. I wrapped my arms around his waist. \"You just had a rough day, with that Liberty game tonight. But, your day will get better. We're going to hang out my house and watch a movie or something.\" I said, hugging him to me. I think he was getting sick but that wasn't going to stop him with that football game. Nothing was going to stop him from doing a lot of things. We soon got to my house, after a fifteen minute car ride. We walked into my house and saw that my mother was home. \"Ah. Hello Galen. How are you?\" My mother asked, looking towards us as we were taking our shoes off in the dining room. \"Oh, I'm fine.\" Galen said, following me up to my room. I stopped at the top of the steps and looked at my mom. \"Mom, I'm going to his game later tonight. Is that okay?\" \"Yes sweetie, it's okay. Don't be late.\" My mom said before I walked into my room. I threw my backpack on the ground and Galen put his books next to mine. I took off my shoes and stuck them in the corner. I laid down on my bed and felt Galen lay next to me. He put his head on my shoulder and sighed deeply. I kissed his forehead. \"You have your game jersey in the locker room right?\" I asked him. \"Yeah,\" he muffled as he buried his face into my shoulder. I turned my body, so I could face him. I wrapped my arms around him, holding him close. His arms slipped around my waist and pulled me closer. \"If you're tired, you can sleep. Save up your energy for the game.\" \"I might do that but I came to spend time with you.\" He said, yawning slightly. \"It's okay. We have later tonight.\" I said, kissing his forehead. The last thought I had before I dozed off was how weird it was for my mother to be home. Football Game Jefferson High VS Liberty Galen and I got to the football game forty-five minutes early .We walked towards the locker room for the home team and we stopped, sharing a kiss. \"Good luck, you'll kick their asses!\" I said. He smiled at me and hugged me. I pulled him back before he left and gave him a long kiss. \"Good luck.\" I whispered in his ear. He hugged me one last time and walked to the locker room. I walked up to the bleachers, looking for my friend Luke. I soon saw him in the middle and walked up to him. \"Hey, I thought you weren't coming.\" He said, his chocolate brown eyes looking to me. \"Well, we sorta fell asleep.\" I said, sitting next to him. Smiling at my friend, it was nice to have someone to sit and talk with at the game. My parents never came and I knew Galen's did but could never find them. Not like I really wanted to see his mom or anything. It was fifteen minutes later and the band came out first, playing our fight song. Then next came the cheerleaders, in their orange and black uniforms. I was getting excited. Then, the Eagles came out. Everyone got up and started shouting and cheering. \"GO GALEN!\" I yelled, and waving at him. Then they played the national anthem and the pledge of Allegiance. The game soon got started with me watching intensely. We were leading 7-0. Two quarters later and the score was 35-10, Liberty. They were kicking us all over the field but I knew we still had a fighting chance. The other side of the stadium, where Liberty was at, was cheering loudly. I was getting pissed but I told myself not to, win or lose, it was just a game. One of the linebackers was taken out off the field with an injury. The way he was walking, it looked like something to do with his shoulder. He went to the ambulance to get checked out but was gone for some time. From what Galen told me, they had back up players for something just like this. The replacement went onto the field and the game continued. From all the games I've been to, injuries were a common sight. I stared off in space for just a few minutes, thinking of the things I wanted to do tomorrow. When I came back to reality, the game had stopped and people were surrounding someone. I stood up and looked to see who it was. A stretcher was coming out of the ambulance. Two other football players were helping someone walk. It was Galen![Chapter 3] Hey guys! As you saw in my last update, a lot of people have been showing interest in this story. To me, it was a bit odd because I haven't updated this story in at least six years and since this story has been picking up some interest, I'm going to continue on. You'll probably notice that I've changed some things around. I stood there, frozen, watching Galen walk off. I didn't see any blood, which I was thankful for. The crowd was quiet around me and it seemed like an eternity before anyone did something. The referee blew his whistle and the players got back on the field. As people were turning their attention to the field, I walked down the steps between the rows of seats and finally made it to the bottom. Quiet chattering was heard as the game started up again. Weaving in and out of the people standing near the railing, I finally make it down the last three steps and start walking towards the ambulance. In some ways, I was quite surprised that robots haven't taken over that and it was nice to see actual people doing something. I couldn't help but smile a bit knowing that Galen was alright. I leaned against the bumper and waited till he noticed me. \"Hey.\" He said as he looked over at him. His arm was covered up. I nodded my head slightly, looking at the bandage. \"What's that about?\" He looked away from me for a moment than looked back. \"Nothing to worry about. They think I might have a concussion and I should go to the hospital.\" I bit my lip in thought for a moment. He changed the subject. Something was wrong with his arm. \"Let me take you. Your parents can meet you there.\" He shook his head and I frowned. \"Wha-\" I couldn't finish my sentence when I heard someone come around the side of the ambulance and push me away. \"Honey, are you okay?\" A female voice said as I finally regained my footing. I looked at the woman who was standing where I just was. She was every bit as tall as Galen was but in the darkness, it was hard to tell. \"Mom, you knocked Chelsi out of your way.\" I heard the shuffling of the sheets and I saw the top of his head looking at me. \"You alright?\" I wanted to move and see more of him but his mom was blocking the way. \"Yeah. All good.\" I rubbed the dirt off the back of my jeans. I met his mom only twice and she didn't even look at me. \"Honey, we really should get you to the hospital.\" For no apparent reason, I was getting angry. I knew from the first time I met her, she didn't like me. It was apparent. Galen's father on the other hand, loved me. I turned back to the field and tuned out the conversation that was happening between mother and son. The game had started up again only five minutes ago and the home team was close to scoring another touchdown. Upon hearing footsteps behind me, I turned around and saw an even taller person standing next to the ambulance. I smiled a bit and now I felt a bit better knowing that someone else was on my side. \"Chelsi! How are you? Keeping an eye on my boy, are you?\" His father said as he turned to face me. \"Of course. Don't I always?\" From all the smiling, my cheeks were hurting. I looked over at Galen and saw him smile. He must have been thinking the same thing I was. \"Mark, I was talking with Galen and I think we should have him taken to the hospital to have his head examined. We want to make sure it is nothing serious.\" I saw the look Beth had given her husband. I pretended that I didn't notice anything as I was 'looking' at the score of the opposing. \"I guess you're right. We should listen to your mother.\" Mark had turned a bit to look at me. \"Do you have a ride, Chelsi?\" \"No, I came with Galen. I was going to call Ray and have him walk me-\" \"No! It's to dark out and late. I know he's a robot and everything but I don't want you walking around in the dark.\" Galen said as he slowly eased himself off the gurney. \"Take my car home. I don't like the thought of you walking home.\" I felt warm on the inside. If I was going anywhere, it was either Galen going with me or Ray. \"I don't like doing that to you…\" I said quietly as he walked up to me. He kissed my head. \"I'll walk you to the car and get you set up.\" He took my hand in his and we started walking. We didn't say much to each other as we walked, just spending time in each other's company. We finally reached the car and he opened the door. I stood outside, watching him as he was typing things in. A few moments later, his towering figure stood over me. \"All set.\" I smiled a bit. \"Thank you.\" We stood there for another long moment, just looking at each other. I stood up on my tippy toes and brushed my lips against mine. I felt him smile and we continued to kiss. His hands rested on my waist and deep down, I wanted him to come home with me, where we could finish this in private. But as it was getting it good, a horn hook. I let out a sigh as I looked over and saw that his parents car was right nearby. \"I'll call you later.\" He said quietly as he gave me one last kiss and nudged me towards his car. I laughed softly as I sat down and the door closed. The car started up as I put my seatbelt on. Once the car started moving away, I leaned back into the seat and closed my eyes. I reached over and picked up the ear piece. I dialed my home number as I closed my eyes again. It took only three rings before someone picked up. \"Hello?\" I knew that voice right away. \"Hello Ray.\" \"Hello miss. What can I do for you?\" \"I am on my way home. Would you please meet me out there in about ten minutes?\" \"Yes miss. I will be waiting.\" \"Thank you.\" I hung up and leaned back into the seat. I dozed off, the ten minute car ride going by even more quickly now that I wasn't staring out the window. Before I knew it, the car turned itself off and everything was quiet. I opened my eyes and rubbed my face as the car door opened. \"Miss?\" \"Hello Ray.\" I said as I grabbed my purse and got out of the car. I forgot about the keys and I grabbed them quickly before Ray had closed the door. \"Is my mom home?\" I asked as we stepped up onto the curb and made our way to the steps. \"No, she isn't.\" He said as we stepped into the house. I wasn't surprised a bit, even though she was home earlier in the day. Both of my parents had jobs that sucked most of their home life away. It was rare when I got to see both of them together. It was either one or the other I got to see. The lights turned on as I walked in and looked around. The living room looked like someone actually lived here, when it was only me that used anything here. \"Are we still going to the market tomorrow?\" I asked as I took my shoes off at the bottom of the steps. \"Of course. You and I have been doing that for the past four years.\" I smiled at Ray. \"Yes, we have. I shall see in you the morning.\" I turned and started walking up the steps. I entered my room and sighed. It was just how I left it only a few hours again. Didn't seem that long ago. I grabbed my pjs that I wore the night before and walked into my bathroom. It was odd being alone, even though I never was really alone. Ever since my parents got their big promotions at their jobs, I was always with a robot. When I was younger, I had a nanny bot take care of me, take me to the park to socialize with other kids. As I walked out of the bathroom with my pajama pants on and a big shirt, I just realized that my parents only took me to school a few times. The rest of the time was with the robots. I remember my parents taking me to school a few times but that was it. I moved the covers back and I sat down. I got underneath the covers as I reached over and tapped on the bottom of the lamp. When I did that, all the lights when off in the room. I moved around for a few moments, trying to get comfortable. When I did, my mind was still racing with thoughts. I turned out alright, even though most of my dominant figures in my life were robots and still is. I closed my eyes and let out a sigh. I remember the day Ray had arrived to the house. My parents had upgraded to the newest robot, like they always did. They had their own personal robots at work, so this one was for me. I was thirteen at the time and was going through a phase where I resented my parents about upgrading robots because I had gotten attached to the last one. But as time went on, I had gotten close to Ray. Next morning… I heard the tweeting of the birds and threw my pillow over my head. I knew it wasn't real early because I could hear the traffic outside in the distance. I rolled over onto my back and yawned. I stretched and sat up. I reached over for my phone and looked at it. It was close to nine in the morning. I always had a hard time sleeping in nowadays but it didn't bother me much. During the summer, I had weird sleeping habits. I noticed that I didn't have any text messages, so I got up and walked to the bathroom. I turned on the water in the shower and looked at myself in the mirror. I still had my makeup on my face from last night, since I had forgotten to wash it off. I had other things on my mind and I still did. I got into the shower and didn't take long, since I had to go to the market with Ray. I got out of the shower just as there was a knocking on my door. \"Yes?\" I said as I quickly wrapped a towel around myself. \"I wanted to make sure you were awake.\" I heard Ray say from the other side of the door. \"I am, thank you. I'll be down in a few minutes.\" I finally dried myself off and was half dressed when my cell phone rang. I hurried over to my desk and picked it up. \"Hello?\" \"Hey.\" A familiar voice said on the other line. I smiled. \"Hey. How are you feeling? Does your head still hurt?\" \"It's okay now. Had to stay up most of the night but I'm good now.\" There was something wrong with his voice. \"I'm glad. If you were up to it, maybe we could hang out for a bit.\" \"I'd like that. How about you come pick me up, since you have my car and everything.\" I laughed slightly. \"That I do, don't I?\" I smiled a little bit. \"I can be there in a little bit. I just have to get changed around.\" \"That's fine. I'll see you in a little bit.\" \"Yeah. I'll be there.\" I wanted to say 'I love you' but I didn't have the time before he hung up. I quickly got dressed, not caring what I picked out of my closet. I wasn't worried about seeing anyone I knew at the market since I was only going to be with Ray and hopefully with Galen. I walked out of my room and once I was standing at the top of the steps, I smelled the food. I walked down the steps and into the kitchen. \"Everything smells good Ray.\" \"Thank you miss.\" I walked into the kitchen and grabbed a plate. \"Ray, we are going to be leaving a bit late. I have to go get Galen. He might be coming with us.\" I said as I sat down at the table and picked up some of the food Ray had made. \"That's fine. Shall I meet you there?\" He asked as he turned around to look at me. \"How about I call you? It's closer from here to get to the market than it is from his house.\" He nodded as I started to eat. He was always a fantastic cook. I could cook for myself but he never wanted me to. I sighed slightly and started to eat. When I was finished, which was about ten minutes later. I put on a pair of shoes that I left near the door a few days ago. \"I'll call you when we're ready!\" I said as I walked out the door. I stood at the top step for a few moments, feeling the sun hit my body. It felt really nice. I walked over to the car and opened it. It felt weird, being the one picking Galen up, when it was the other way around most of the time. His address was already put in the navigation system. I touched the address and the car was already on the move. I sat back in the seat and watched as the scenery zoomed past me. Before I knew it, I was at his house. The car pulled into the driveway, where there was two cars already parked there. I got out of the car as it died down. Looking down at my clothes, I smoothed them out, even though there wasn't any wrinkles on them. I walked around the car and up the steps before I heard shouting on the inside. I was about to ring the doorbell when I stopped. What was going on? Did Galen call to get away from the fighting? I instantly felt bad as I put my finger against the bell and rang. Only moments after hearing the chiming inside the house, the fighting ceased. I stood there for a few moments, wondering if anyone was going to open the door but then, the door opened and there stood Galen. \"Hey!\" I said as I smiled. I tried to look in before he closed door but I didn't see anything. I went in to kiss him but couldn't because he moved away. I didn't want to look disappointed but I didn't say anything as he leaned up against the stone structure. \"We need…to talk.\" He said as he ran his hand through his shaggy hair, which looked light brown in the sun. I bit my lip. \"Okay…about what?\" I didn't like where this was going and we didn't even start the conversation yet. \"I think we need to take a break.\" After he said that, it felt like my heart stopped beating in my chest. \"W-what? Did you really hit your head hard last night?\" It looked he was struggling for words. Was that the reason there was fighting? \"No, I'm fine but I think we really do need a break. Spend some time away from each other.\" He said to me as he looked up. I felt my bottom lip quiver as I looked away. We sat there for a few moments, just like that. I couldn't take it anymore and stood up. \"Well…see you on Monday.\" I turned before he could get a word in and started walking away. I heard him call out to me as I started down the street. It was going to be a long walk to the market today.[Chapter 4] Staring at myself in the mirror, it was something I haven't done in a long time to properly look at myself. Within a few moments, I let out a defeated sigh and looked down onto the counter. Thinking it was time for something different, I had bought some hair dye when I was out in the market with Ray. With the recent and quite sudden break up with Galen, I needed something new. Upon opening the box, I pulled out the directions and read them carefully. All I needed was to mess this up and I was already not having a good day. I took the gloves that were inside the directions and put them on my hands. Looking over the directions once more, I followed the instructions on how to mix the dye and with one more look in the mirror at myself. Bye bye blonde. When all the dye was in my hair, I wrapped a towel around my shoulders and walked out of my bedroom. With my parents both gone, it was just Ray and I. Sighing, I sat down on my bed and reached over to the night stand to grab my phone. Touching the screen, it lit up and the screen showed me nothing new. No texts, no phone calls. I tossed it on the bed and walked over to the window. Rain was pouring down and the window felt cold when I touched it. I stared out the window, looking down at the street. Cars were parked but no people were walking. Robots knew better to go out onto the rainy street, for their owners feared they would short circuit and it wasn't cheap to fix a robot. Tearing myself away from the window, I looked at the digital clock. Knowing how long I had been standing at the window, it was time to wash the dye out of my hair. I walked into the bathroom, tossing the towel from around my shoulders onto the top of the toilet seat. I reached in and grabbed the shower head, intending to only use it to wash the dye out. Turning on the water, I fiddled with it for a little bit until I had gotten it to the right temperature. Reaching over, I turned on the faucet to the showerhead and watched it as the water ran into the tub. I leaned over the side and made sure I wasn't going to get any water or dye on my clothes. With the warm water running over my hair, I watched as the dark brown dye ran down the drain. I ran my hand through my hair a couple of times, making sure I had gotten all of the dye out of my hair. When the water started turning clear, I reached over and turned off the water and when it was off, I let the showerhead rest against the side of the tub as I blindly reached around for my towel. When I felt it brush against my fingertips, I pulled it towards me and set it on my head. I stood as I dried my hair. Taking the towel off, I looked at myself in the mirror. It was weird seeing no blonde but brunette instead. After spending a few more minutes in front of the mirror, fixing my hair and blow drying it, I was pleased with what I saw. I was no longer a blonde that hung around a football player most of her time but now, I was a brunette but I did not know what to do with it. Something in the corner of the mirror caught my eye and I looked up. It was a picture of Galen and I. How did I forget that it was there? Reaching up and pulling it down, I looked at the picture. It was at least a year old and it was at one of his football games. He was in his uniform and I was just in regular clothes, both of us smiling at the picture. I reached over, opening a drawer and putting the picture in it. No sense in having it up if we were no longer together. I stared at the picture a few moments longer before closing the drawer. I heard a knock on the door and I walked out of the room. \"Yes?\" I asked as I opened the door. I knew who it was right away and it was Ray. \"I am inquiring if you are going to be coming down for breakfast.\" \"I am right now. Thank you for coming and getting me.\" \"You are quite welcome miss.\" I followed Ray down the steps and the smell of the food hit my senses, making my stomach growl. I had no idea how hungry I was since I was really more focused on my hair than anything else. I sat down at the table and not even a moment later, Ray had sat down a plate with scrambled eggs, toast and bacon. I started eating as Ray cleaned up. I was mid sip of my orange juice when the front door opened. Looking over my shoulder, I had saw it was my parents. It was strange seeing them walk through the front door together. I couldn't even remember when they had down that last. \"Morning sweetie.\" My father said as he walked by the table. \"Morning.\" I said to the both of them, watching them walk to the living room and setting their things down. I went back to eating as I heard Ray ask my parents if they had wanted anything to eat. They had declined and when I noticed the silence in the room, I looked up and saw them both staring at me. \"What?\" \"You dyed your hair.\" My mother said. I nodded. By the look on her face, it looked like she had never seen someone dye their hair before. \"I did. Decided to live in the moment, spice life up.\" I said as I finished my breakfast and stood up to put my plate in the sink. \"Honey, we need to talk.\" I heard my father say to me and when I heard it, I froze up instantly. Thoughts were racing quickly through my brain. I knew I was passing all of my classes at school, I hadn't done anything to get a detention and I couldn't think of anything else as I turned around and stared at my parents. Both were in their late thirties, having two different jobs that took up most of their time. \"Okay.\" I said as I turned around and leaned against the counter. \"We are going to get you a new robot. The NS-5.\" I shook my head. \"No, I don't want one. Ray is perfectly fine. He has had all his updates and there are no glitches.\" I looked over at the robot, whom I swore was looking at me in adoration. I couldn't tell for that split second before I looked back over at my parents. \"But this is the newest robot technology-\" \"I don't give a damn about new robots! I don't need a new one, Ray is just fine.\" I pushed myself off the counter. I couldn't stay in the house with them, just waltzing in here and telling me that they were taking my robot away. \"We have them at our jobs and they are amazing.\" My mother said, looking at me then to Ray. \"That's nice but this isn't your job. This is home, you know, the place where your daughter spends most of her time with a robot that practically takes care of her.\" I saw the hurt on my parents face but they needed to know. What was the point of having parents when they weren't going to be around? \"That's not how you talk to us.\" My father said in that stern voice, the one I hardly ever got to hear. \"Whether you like it or not, you are getting a new robot.\" \"Whether you like it or not, Ray is staying. You can shove that new robot up where the sun doesn't shine.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Had the hair dye done something to my brain that was causing me to act like this? My parents looked stunned as I walked back up the steps to my room. \"Ray!\" I called from the top of the steps. In only a fraction of a moment, he appeared at the bottom of the steps. \"Yes miss?\" \"Come up to my room. I feel the sudden urge to rearrange my bedroom.\" I turned and walked into my room, hearing the robot right behind me. I stood in the middle of my room, looking at everything, trying to picture where I would move everything. Turning around, Ray was already standing in the doorway. \"I was thinking of putting my bed over here, near the window.\" \"I would advise against that miss. If it gets cold or windy outside, there will be a draft and you'll have a high chance that you'll get sick. I would move the desk to the window.\" Standing there for a moment, Ray had a point. I nodded and looked at the robot. I was still reeling from what my parents told me about getting rid of him, deciding I would fight tooth and nail to keep him. \"Okay, let's get started then.\" Moving things around the room didn't like long with a robot and I felt like I was doing nothing at all but without him, it would of taken me half the day to get this done. Stopping after we were done, I looked around the room and nodded. \"I love it. Thank you Ray.\" \"Anything to help you ma'am.\" The robot turned and walked out of the room. Moving over to the bed, I sat down and sighed. It was getting late and I was going to have to go down and eat. Taking a moment, I didn't hear any voices but the sounds of pots and pans down in the kitchen. Had they finally left? Laying back on the bed, realizing that tomorrow was another new week of school. How was I going to do this? I'd just have to figure out somehow. Hey guys, I am so sorry for taking four years to put up this new chapter. I will try my best to keep this updated more frequently than every few years. I'm sorry. ","Summary":" Prologue It was way before the NS-5's went crazy.

En esta nueva aventura Esther, una robot, puede sentir las cosas que sentimos los humanos, algo impensables para todos los humanos que viven en el año 2035. Nos encontramos en una sociedad prácticamente informatizada en su totalidad. Los robots son algo cotidiano a lo que nos hemos acostumbrados y solo las tres leyes de la robótica nos protegen de cualquier anomalía. ¿O no? En esta historia ella se encuentra con Damon, Matt y Susan que junto a Esther, que descubrirán el motivo por el que fueron creados, y el porqué ellos también pueden sentir algunas cosas y soñar con su creador, Alfred J. Lanning. Historia contada por primera vez, en primera persona, por un robot. CAPÍTULO 1: EL NUEVO DESPERTAR \"Las tres leyes de la robótica son muy fáciles de recordar, y más cuando se puede decir que te crearon grabándote estas normas en tu sistema operativo: Primera ley: Un robot no puede hacer daño a un ser humano o, por inacción, permitir que un ser humano sufra daño. Segunda ley: Un robot debe obedecer las órdenes dadas por los seres humanos, excepto si entrasen en conflicto con la Primera Ley. Tercera ley: Un robot debe proteger su propia existencia en la medida en que esta protección no entre en conflicto con la Primera o la Segunda Ley. -\"¿Sabéis? Tengo un problema, no sé quien o qué soy, tampoco sé a qué grupo de robots pertenezco; a los soldados-A los que se reconocen con tatuajes negros en brazos, pecho y piernas, tienen una fuerza tremenda-a los robots creadores-Son extremadamente listos, crean o deshacen robots como la facilidad de romper un papel, casi siempre ayudan a los científicos humanos en los experimentos-o a los domésticos-ellos tienen una vida cotidiana como la podría tener un humano, también pueden ser sirvientes de los humanos-ni siquiera sé como soy, acabo de despertar y no veo nada, está todo tan oscuro…\" De pronto un fogonazo cegó mis ojos, os ojos de aquella robot que estaba tirada en el suelo. Era un soldado robot que había ido allí para llevarme ante el general de una de las batallas. -¡Vamos está aquí, deprisa!-se dirigió hacia a mi y me cogió del brazo. Cuando salimos de aquel almacén, todos estaban peleando en una batalla que no cesaba, estarían peleando a una distancia de 50 metros de donde se encontraba ese campamento, y estaban ganado los que defendían ese territorio. Al entrar en esa casa, el general estaba sentado en un altar y rodeados de soldados robot, y, ese general, era humano. -Hola…pequeña, dinos tu nombre.-dijo aquel hombre, tenia barba y era muy corpulento, tendría unos 40 aproximadamente por las arrugas de su cara. Le hizo un gesto con la mano al soldado que me sostenía para que me soltase, quedé frente al general y rodeada de soldados más fuertes que yo. -Esto… ¿quien eres?-me atreví a preguntar. -La mejor pregunta es la mía. Dimos tu nombre. -Yo… -No tenemos todo el día. -Yo… no sé quien soy, por tanto no sabría responderte. -Está bien…un robot sin nombre es imposible de manejar. Te llamarás Esther.-en ese momento una chica de aproximadamente unos 25 años-Hola preciosa-esa chica se acercó al general y se colocó detrás de él. -¿Quién es ese robot?-dijo con repugnancia en su voz. -No tenía nombre, así que le he puesto el tuyo pastelito, para que veas cuanto te amo.-la chica sonrió y le besó. Cuando terminaron, el general me miró-mi nombre es Henry Ford VI. -A mi me parece bien que os peleéis por la tierra y eso pero… ¿Qué hago aquí? -Serás mi nueva robot, ¿no te alegras? -Me niego. -¿Te niegas? No puedes negarte, obedeces ordenes nada más.-dijo la chica que estaba a su lado. -No… ella no obedece, por eso la quiero en mis batallas. Únete a mí. -No, me niego-dije sin cambiar de idea, yo no sirvo a nadie… a nadie. Un soldado robot me cogió del brazo. -Mientras cambias de idea estarás en el almacén, Rubén… puedes hacer con ella lo que quiera… pero… no la rompas- el soldado que me había cogido los brazos sonrió y me miró. Me sacó fuera de esa casa, de vuelta al almacén me soltó y yo me aparté de él rápidamente. -Acércate… bonita.-dijo con picardía. Se acercó a mí y yo me alejé más, me puse detrás de una columna que había allí. Él también se puso frente a mí, la columna era lo único que nos separaba-Vamos… no haré nada malo-vi la puerta abierta… él, ni nadie la cerró. Corrí hacia la salida pero me agarró el brazo… y caí con él al suelo. Con él encima, forcejeaba conmigo, y depositó su boca sobre la mía… ¿Qué estaba haciendo? Yo seguía forcejeando cuando de repente él salió por los aires, alguien me había salvado… -\"¿Pero quien?\"-pensé-entonces lo vi, un soldado robot me había salvado de uno de sus compañeros, no lo pensé dos veces y salí corriendo de allí. Salí en dirección a donde estaban combatiendo, sin importarme eso, me di cuenta de que el mismo robot que me salvó, corría detrás de mí. Seguí hacia delante y me metí en la batalla, restos de robot por todas partes… era un infierno. Algo me empujó y me tiró al suelo, era otro robot soldado, levantó la mano, me iba a golpear y acabar con mi… ¿vida? Pero su cabeza reventó antes de hacerlo. El mismo robot que antes me salvó había vuelto a hacerlo, me salvó de nuevo. Arrojó por los aires al soldado reventado, yo me arrastré bocabajo para huir de él, ¿podía confiar en alguien que mató a dos robot para salvarme? Yo creo que no. Se tiró encima de mí. -¡Basta de carreras!-dijo… ¿riñéndome? -Vete, a, la… ¡mierda!-dije sin importarme lo que hiciera, de todos modos, ¿yo tenía una vida? -No me hagas hacerlo…-¿suplicó? Puso su brazo en mi cuello. -¿Te lo dijo en otro idioma? ¡KISS MY ASS!-entonces, hizo algo con el brazo… quedé inconciente. Empecé a ver una luz que casi me cegaba, estaba soñando, y una voz me hablaba. -Eres, el futuro, tenlo presente-Entonces lo vi de nuevo oscuro y de nuevo vi algo más, una puerta verde pistacho, cuando entré, una sábana y debajo… Cuando desperté estaba en brazos del robot soldado que me dejó inconciente, le dí un codazo y salí corriendo, pero al llegar al final de la calle, no… un callejón sin salida, el robot no se molestó siquiera de perseguirme, sabía que me pararía al final del camino. -¡Detente!-grité-tengo un…-miré al suelo y vi un palito minúsculo-palito…-lo miré, reía burlonamente-he dicho que te pares-él se paró en seco. -No voy ha hacerte daño, si no… ¿Para que salvarte tantas veces?-se cruzó de brazos-Mi nombre es Damon. -Damon…-susurré-si no quieres nada de mí, déjame ir. -¿Esa es la mejor forma de pedir gracias? -El orgullo nunca está de sobra…-la indirecta perfecta-además, yo no pedí ayuda… es más, podría haberme encargado de esos robots soldado yo solita. -El orgullo nunca está de sobra.-dijo divertido. -Hola Damon-detrás de Damon venía un robot creador-¿quien es esa chica? -Hola Matt, me disponía a preguntar por su nombre pero… me quería atacar con eso-miré a mi mano seguía con el maldito palito en la mano, lo tiré por los aires. -Encantado de conocerte, mi nombre es Matt-se acercó a mí y besó mi mano-y el tuyo es… No sabía qué contestar… me acordé del único nombre de chica que había oído. -Esther, mi nombre es Esther. Encantada de conocerte… Matt-lo dije de forma en la que Damon supiera que hubiese deseado no conocerle. -Hermosa, yo también me alegro de haberte conocido. -No puedo decir lo mismo. -¿A no? Que pena… ¿sabes? Debería haberte dejado con ese robot en el almacén… parecía que os lo pasabais bien, el disfrutando besándote y tu forcejeando. -¿Cómo has dicho?-dije con tono de interés, pero no enfadada. -¿Qué? -Él disfrutaba… ¿Qué? -Besándote-dijo con extrañeza-¿Qué te resulta extraño? -Esa palabra… no la conocía. No sabía siquiera que estaba haciendo aquel robot. -Ejem...creo que me he perdido algo...-dijo Matt-pero bueno... parece que no conoces muchas palabras... ¿no es así? -La primera vez que desperté, estaba todo oscuro y aquel robot me llevó ante el general que quería no se qué de unirme a él. -Está bien...-agarró a Damon del brazo y empezó a susurrar en un tono bajísimo-¿Cómo se te ocurre? Solo se te ocurriría a ti traer a una chica que no sabe nada del mundo porque acaba de despertar... y además arrebatada de las manos de un general, tu sistema operativo se volvió loco. -Solo creí que necesitaba ayuda... ¿no dices que las damas lo son todo? -Pues ya me estás contando que diablos hacías allí y por casualidad la rescataste. -Perdonad... si soy un estorbo, tan solo si os movéis unos pasos me dejareis el camino libre para irme. -Será mejor que te quedes con nosotros, no sabes nada de estas calles y serías un blanco fácil para los delincuentes y traficantes de robots. -Bueno...-me senté en el suelo esperando a que me dijeran algo. Me equivoqué, empezaron de nuevo con su conversación, incluso se apartaron unos pasos y se sentaron. Pasaron los minutos y algo captó mi atención, una puerta verde pistacho en un lateral del callejón y cerca de unos cubos de basura.[Chapter 2] CAPITULO 2: ¿QUIÉN DIABLOS SOY? Me encaminé hacia ella, incluso pasando de largo de Damon y Matt, que seguían discutiendo. Cuando me puse frente a ella la empujé, pero de nada sirvió, estaba cerrada. Cerré el puño... me sentí con la fuerza suficiente como para tirarla abajo. -No vas a poder, eres demasiado débil como para romperla-dijo Matt-creo que tienes aspecto de robot doméstico-entonces sin hacer caso, golpeé la puerta y la eché abajo, prácticamente quedó destrozada. Y sin mirar a Matt. (Me hubiese gustado decirla:\"trágate tus palabra\" pero estaba demasiada ocupada intentando recordar mi sueño) Al final entré es ese edificio-Creo que no-dijo Matt con un hilo de voz. Recordé la sábana, empecé a buscarla, Damon y Matt entraron después de mí, subí las escaleras y, en efecto, una sábana arrugada en una esquina de la habitación. Se agaché y puse la mano encima, estaba duro. -¿Qué has encontrado?-dijo Matt. -No lo sé-empecé a buscar el filo de la sábana y cuando lo encontré, destapé la sábana rápidamente, no se veía casi nada estaba todo tan oscuro... Entonces Damon activó una linterna que tenía en el brazo y alumbró esa zona... lo que estaba debajo de esa sábana era una chica robot. Damon la cogió en brazos y salimos de allí. Al salir, Matt se puso a revisarla. -Está en perfectas condiciones, veamos su sistema operativo-Damon la aguantó de tal forma que parecía que la chica estaba sentada, y Matt tocó una zona donde en un cuerpo humano debería estar el cráneo, cuando la tocó esta se desplazó hacia arriba dejando ver el interior de la cabeza, parecía purpurina azul, todo eso era el sistema operativo de la chica-No hay daños, solo está desconectada, la pondré en marcha-cuando iba a tocar un botón rojo que destacaba en toda esa \"purpurina azul\" Damon lo detuvo. -Será mejor que lo hagamos en un lugar más tranquilo-Matt miró a su alrededor. -Sí, tienes razón. No sé exactamente por donde pasamos, pero siempre evitábamos pasar por lo que Matt llamaba calles, y siempre nos colábamos por puertas de edificios y salíamos por otras, todo esto hasta llegar hasta la puerta principal de un edificio bajo, es decir, un edificio de 4 pisos. -Que edificio más pequeño... -Es un motel, ¿Qué esperabas?-dijo Damon entrando, lo siguió Matt que me hizo un gesto diciendo que entrara. Subimos unas 3 plantas y entramos en una pequeña habitación. En ella solo había una cama, dos mesillas de noche a ambos lados de esta y unas lámparas encima de las mesilla de noche. Matt se acercó a la cama, y sacó de debajo de esta un saco llenos de herramientas. -A simple vista está bien, pero, ¿y si la revisamos a fondo?-preguntó a Damon, él asintió con la cabeza. Depositó a la chica en la cama y ambos se sentaron a su alrededor y pusieron manos a la obra, yo, simplemente me senté en el filo de la cama muy cerca de donde iban colocando las herramientas. Usaron múltiples herramientas, y todas llamaban mi atención, pero a cada herramienta que cogía para examinarla, Damon o Matt me la quitaba y la ponían de nuevo en su sitio. Pero siempre preguntaba por su nombre. -\"Que no pare la fiesta...\"-pensé. ¿Qué demonios estaba yo haciendo allí con dos robots desconocidos y una robot desconectada en una cama? Empecé a suspirar de tal forma de que supieran que me molestaba no hacer nada. -Preciosa, ¿Quieres dejar de suspirar de ese modo?-inquirió-desconcentras a Matt. -Tranquilo no me desconcentra, más que nada te molesta a ti-dijo Matt sonriendo pero sin dejar de trabajar. -No me llames preciosa, me llamo Esther-no iba a perder la calma con semejante estúpido, pero parecía que él deseaba que perdiera los estribos. -De acuerdo, hermosa-le lancé una herramienta y la capturó en el aire, después se la pasó a Matt y este comenzó a usarla. -Bueno, ya está. Reparamos brazos y piernas, es hora de conectarla-tras decir esto, pulsó el botón rojo que la conectaría. Damon la sujetó de la misma forma que la había sujeta antes en aquel callejón, de forma que parecía que estaba sentada. Tras unos segundos, la chica abrió los ojos de golpe, tenía los ojos verde esmeralda. Se llevó la mano a la cabeza y empezó a masajearla, parecía confusa. Tras algunos minutos, pareció darse cuenta de que estaba en manos de Damon. -¿Que diablos...?-empezó a decir, miró hacia arriba y vio a Damon-Damon...-¿Cómo? ¿Lo conocía? -Buenas tardes Susan-dijo Matt sonriendo-Hacia tiempo que no te veía, ¿cuanto? ¿3 meses? -Matt...-dijo con una pequeña sonrisa, finalmente me miró a mí-¿Quién es esa chica? -Ella... bueno, se llama Esther y no sabemos exactamente que clase de robot es... acaba de despertar hace algunas horas. -Hola...-intenté decir: \"Hola, me alegro de que estés bien y todo eso pero... ahí os quedáis.\" Pero no me salió. Tenía demasiada curiosidad, ¿Por que soñé con el lugar en el que esa robot estaba desconectada? Y es más, ¿De qué se conocía a Damon y a Matt? La chica intentó ponerse en pié pero cayó, Damon intentó recogerla pero ella lo impidió, quería ponerse de pie por sí misma, y, lo consiguió. Se acercó a mí y empezó a mirarme con detenimiento. -Recuerdo haberte visto antes-dijo mirándome con extrañeza. -No puedo decir lo mismo...-dije y me separé unos pasos atrás. -Susan... ¿Que hacías allí tirada? -No lo se... lo único que recuerdo es que un humano me sujetaba con cuerdas y... creo que me desconectó-un humano... empecé a pensar en los únicos humanos que había conocido... eran auténticos estúpidos, me pregunté si todos eran iguales-¿Cómo me encontrasteis? -Esta hermosura, echó abajo una puerta sin el mínimo esfuerzo y te encontró sin más. -¡Te he dicho que no me llames hermosa ni ninguno de sus variantes!-estaba apunto de lanzarme contra Damon, ¡maldito circuito de cables! -No parece que sea un robot soldado. -Ni tampoco un robot doméstico ni un robot creador. Entonces... ¿Que es?-Matt se acercó a mí y me condujo a la cama, donde cogió un... destornillador. Susan, se lo quitó de inmediato. -No sabemos de qué clase es... ¿quieres meter la pata? -Ya echábamos de menos tus sermones, ¿Verdad Matt?-Matt dedicó a Damon una mirada de: -Te callas o te desmonto tan rápido que no te darías ni cuenta. -Oye Susan...-dije con timidez-yo... no sé que diablos está pasando aquí pero... -¿Cómo supiste que estaba allí?-se acercó a mí. -¿Qué? Amm... bueno... pues la verdad es que... soñé con la puerta que eché abajo y con una sábana igual a la que tenías encima-entones todos empezaron a mirarme con lo ojos muy abiertos. -¿Soñaste?-dijo Damon. -Sí, soñé con eso después de que me dejaras inconciente-después de decir eso esperaba un vulgar comentario por parte de Damon, pero no fue así. Simplemente se acercaron a mí y empezaron a preguntarme. -¿Quién eres?-Dijo Susan. -Ya te lo dije: me llamo Esther, así me llamé el general que me tenía encerrada. -¿Quién es tu creador?-preguntó Matt. -No lo se... -¿Te suena el nombre de Alfred J. Lanning?-Damon se acercó más a mí, me estaba empezando a poner realmente nerviosa. -No... -La pregunta más lógica se la haré yo-Matt me miró fijamente a los ojos-¿Sabes algo sobre ti? -Escuchad, como habéis dicho, acabo de despertar solo hace unas horas, y, no, no se nada de mí, ni de vosotros, no del exterior de este motel. -Ella tiene razón... es imposible que recuerde nada, cuando no hay nada que recordar, hay que llenar su base de datos, es decir, empezar a crear recuerdos, o si no... no será una robot normal-Susan se puso en pie-Matt, ¿Cuántas habitaciones tenéis aquí? -Solo esta. Pero podemos alquilar otra, el problema es: que en cada habitación solo hay una cama-Todos me miraron a mí. -¿Qué sucede?-pregunté con inocencia. -¿Dónde te colocamos? -Con Susan-dije sin dudarlo. -Tengo que seguir examinando a Susan, estarás con Damon. Además si pasa algo, él sabrá protegerte. -Si lo teníais pesado de antes, ¿por qué preguntabais? -Simplemente no te estábamos preguntado-Matt se levantó de la cama y cogió a Susan del brazo-Vamos, iremos a recepción. Me puse en pie para protestar cuando Damon me cogió de la cintura y me susurró al oído. -Por fin estaremos solitos hermosa.-dijo burlón. -¡Susan!-forcejeé, me liberé y me puse detrás de Susan. Simplemente sabía que ella le diría algo más que: \"Suelta a esa dama\" como Matt hubiera dicho. -Damon déjala o me encargaré de ti yo misma, solo cuida de ella-él seguía riendo burlón. Se dio la vuelta y me susurró: \"Tranquila, aunque no lo creas no haría daño ni a una mosca, y si te molesta, dímelo, yo me encargaré\" -Gracias-susurré. En ese momento me alegré de haber soñado con ella. Sentía que solo podía confiar en ella, y nadie más. -Nos veremos mañana, y Damon... te tengo vigilado-dijo y se fue. Cuando me di la vuelta, él se estaba acostando, decidí imitarlo, y cuando me acosté me empezó a dar ordenes. -Apaga la luz y desconéctate. -¿Desconectarme? ¿Como lo hago? -Solo relájate, ahora calla. -Idiota-parecía que no me había oído, hice lo que me dijo, me relajé y sin darme cuenta me desconecté, (que para los humanos seria dormir) empecé a soñar con la misma voz: -Eres, el futuro, tenlo presente-una luz me cegó, y vi un rostro, un hombre mayor, de pelo blanquecino y con gafas-Mi querida hija, eres el proyecto de mi vida.[Chapter 3] CAPÍTULO 3: SOY UN PELIGRO PARA TODOS. Dí un sobresalto que despertó a Damon. -¿Qué te ocurre?-preguntó con cara de pocos amigos. -Esto… yo… -Aún es muy temprano desconéctate de nuevo, si no tienes más ganas de estar tumbada, estate despierta, pero déjame en paz-tras decir esto se volvió y se quedó inmóvil de nuevo, entonces pensé que estaba desconectado. -Idiota-me había despertado y dado los \"buenos días\" a Damon de la misma forma que lo hice por la noche, esa palabra encajaba con Damon como anillo al dedo. -Te he oído…-dí un respingo, dios, que susto me dio-y anoche también, me estás haciendo enfadar. -¿Y que vas a hacer? ¿Llevarme de nuevo ante aquel general? -No se me había ocurrido, gracias por la sugerencia. -Idiota-entonces, no se como, Damon con un simple giro se colocó encima de mí, echándome hacia atrás, y agarrándome fuertemente las manos para que no forcejeara con tanta facilidad, aunque no sirvió de mucho, me sentía con fuerza después de aquel descanso. -Eres fuerte…-me soltó, pero no se bajó de encima de mí, pero sin embargo no le empujé, quedé allí, debajo de Damon, inmóvil. Él alargó la mano y me tocó la mejilla, sonrió de una forma que no estaba acostumbrada a ver, no era una sonrisa burlona, sino una sonrisa de verdad, se bajó de encima de mí y se aproximó al armario donde cogió una llave inglesa y me la aproximó-Dóblala.-le miré con cara de: \"¿Estás loco?\"-Venga, sé que puedes. Entonces cogí la herramienta por los extremos e hice fuerza, se dobló cuando con solo un movimiento leve. -Joder…-dijo Damon. -¿Joder? ¿Que es joder?-me miró, y empezó ha reírse a carcajadas-no me hace gracias-seguía riendo-¡Damon! -Es…-empezó a decir-cuando ves algo que no te esperabas. -Entiendo-Damon me volvió a sonreír. -Iré a despertar a Matt y Susan, no salgas de la habitación-hizo un gesto como para irse, y de nuevo se dio la vuelta-y será mejor que te peines. -¿Qué es \"peines\"? -Bueno, ya sabes, que te pongas bien el pelo. -No se como me lo pondré bien si no tengo ni idea de cómo hacerlo-Damon me cogió de la mano y me llevó junto al armario, abrió la puerta y… vi un reflejo igual a Damon y una chica a su lado, instintivamente abracé a Damon, pensé que nos iban a atacar. -¿Qué estás haciendo?-miré de nuevo, la chica estaba abrazando al Damon de enfrente, al igual que yo-Esto es un espejo, es un objeto en el que te reflejas así podrás peinarte, ¿alguna cosa más? -¿Insinúas que esa chica soy yo? -¿No sabes como eres?-se me quedó mirando-en efecto, esa chica eres tú. Miré con más detenimiento el espejo, me dí cuenta de que tenia el pelo largo y liso, y el mismo cuerpo que tenía Susan, alto y esbelto, con aleación blanca y plateada y mis ojos eran de color gris plata y salpicaduras doradas. Tampoco me había fijado en la forma física de Damon, era alto delgado y algo musculoso, su pelo no era ni muy corto ni muy largo, aunque lo tuviese más largo que corto, pero no pude ignorar el color de sus ojos, un azul profundo como el mar. -\"Damon…es atractivo-pensé alocadamente-pero eso no cambia lo idiota que es\"-me acerqué al espejo y lo toqué, era cristal. -Esther, sino tienes ninguna duda más voy a despertar a Matt y Susan como te dije antes-se acercó a mí y me giró de tal forma que le mirara a los ojos-no te muevas de esta habitación. Damon salió de la habitación y me quedé allí, frente al cristal que tanto me llamaba la atención, pero… ¿por qué hacer caso a Damon? Solté una risa de satisfacción al pensar aquello, nunca aceptaba órdenes ¿por qué aceptarlas ahora? Y sin pensarlo dos veces, salí se esas cuatro paredes. Cuando salí de allí, me encontré dentro de un pasillo, lo atravesé y bajé unas cuantas escaleras abajo donde estaba el salón de recepción. Allí había un robot que me empezó a hablar, recuerdo que Damon habló con él la noche anterior, y yo estaba delante cuando lo hacía. -Hola señorita Esther, ¿ha descansado bien?-dijo amistosamente. -Si… claro…-le dediqué una pequeña sonrisa y salí del edificio. Mientras tanto, Damon, Susan y Matt se dirigían a mi habitación. Damon se disponía a entrar para decirme algo cuando vio que allí no había nadie -¿Esther?-sin respuesta-Maldita sea…-salió corriendo en mi busca, Matt y Susan lo siguieron. Yo simplemente, no dejaba de mirar las cosas que había al mi alrededor, edificios tan altos como pirámides, y lo que más me fascinó… personas humanas caminando por las aceras, y demasiadas ocupadas con sus vidas como para siquiera saludarse. Me disponía a cruzar la calle cuando algo me lo impidió agarrándome del brazo, Damon. -¡Estúpida!-dijo con enfado-nunca me haces caso. -Y tu nunca me dejas en paz-le dediqué una sonrisa de burla. -Te dije que no salieras-me llevó dentro del motel. -¿Quieres perderte?-dijo Susan-el exterior es peligroso para una robot que no conoce nada. -Esther, Susan tiene razón-Matt se acercó a mí. -¿Qué esperabais? Solo lo hace para molestarme-Damon se apoyó en una pared con los brazos cruzados. -Esther… Susan y yo estuvimos pensando anoche, y pensamos que seria mejor que te lleváramos a un mecánico que repare robots, así sabremos que eres… ¿estás de acuerdo? -¿Bromeas? ¡Es genial!-dije con entusiasmo. -Pues no hay nada más que hablar… vámonos-Damon no se movió de su sitio-Damon vamos, no seas infantil-entonces Damon nos siguió, parecía que Matt sabía que hacer para que Damon cambiara de idea rápidamente. Cuando salimos del motel anduvimos por las calles de aquella majestuosa ciudad, coches que volaban, altos edificios, y más personas, era realmente genial lo que mis ojos veían. Llegamos a una especie de casa que tenía un gran letrero en que ponía: \"TECNICO DE ROBÓTICA\". Al entrar dentro encontramos a un hombre que se hacía llamar Patrick, según ponía en su placa que colgaba de su bata blanca. Se acercó a nosotros y nos estrechó la mano a cada uno y se presentó. -Hola, soy el técnico que lleva este sitio, ¿En que puedo ayudaros? ¿Piezas sueltas? ¿Aceite? -No… solo una revisión-dijo Matt agarrándome del brazo-para ella. -Está bien, pasad. Nos condujo a un cuarto en el que había una camilla y muchos artilugios colgados de las paredes y más maquinas cuyo nombre desconozco. Pensaba en preguntar pero estaba demasiado nerviosa. -Está bien, acuéstate-señaló la camilla. Me tumbé en ella, era cómoda. Entonces me agarró las muñecas y tobillos con cuerdas. -¿Qué haces? -Es necesario, así no te moverás ni un milímetro. -Creo que nos hace falta uno de esos-dijo Damon burlón. Le eché una mirada de: \"como no te calles, te rajo\". Rió más todavía. Entonces me revisó visualmente, y más tarde, me hizo lo que Matt hizo para conectar a Susan, tocó la parte donde debía estar el cráneo en un humano, y se descorrió hacia detrás, dejando ver el sistema operativo. Pero… algo empezó a dejarse ver en mi pecho a través de la aleación que tenía en este, era con una especie de \"botón\" por decirlo de alguna forma, porque tenía forma de este, pero en realidad de el brotaba luz, el \"botón\" enorme que estaba dentro de mí. -Oh dios mío…-dijo incrédulo el técnico-no puede ser. -¿Qué ocurre, algún problema?-Susan se puso en pie, al igual que Matt y Damon. Matt se acercó a mí, yo no entendía nada, al igual que casi todos los presentes allí. -Esta robot, ¿De dónde la habéis sacado? -¿Qué ocurre, cual es el problema? El técnico me soltó y se apartó de mí unos pasos, yo me levanté de la camilla y me puse justo al lado de Damon. -Ese… botón o lo que sea, es una leyenda urbana… o el proyecto el cual todos los científicos han estado investigando durante toda su vida-hizo una pausa y tomó aire-ese botón lo poseen los robots de una nueva generación de estos. -¿De que clase de robots hablas?-Preguntó Damon. -De aquellos que no tienen porqué obedecer las tres leyes. El silencio inundó la sala. -Mirad chicos, sois robots libres, o al menos eso creo, pero si queréis seguir con vuestras vidas sin problemas… será mejor que os deshagáis de ella. Todos me miraban en ese momento, no sabia que hacer o decir. Después de despedirnos del técnico, salimos del edificio sin mediar palabra. -Chicos…-dije con mucho trabajo-¿Qué es \"deshagáis? Se miraron mutuamente y sin contestarme siguieron hacia delante. Damon me cogió de la mano y me llevó con ellos hacia donde los conocí por primera vez, al callejón sin salida. -No lo puedo creer… simplemente es imposible, y ya está-Matt parecía irritado-Se sentó en el suelo-aunque claro… si se la quitas a un general, que menos puedes esperar. -¿Insinúas que esto es culpa mía?-dijo Damon en tono de enfado. -Sí, eso insinúo, si la hubieras dejado allí nada de esto hubiera pasado. -¡Callaos los dos!-Susan se interpuso en la discusión-Si ella no hubiera estado, yo no estaría aquí. -Muy bien por ti Susan pero ahora nos ceñimos a las consecuencias. Susan se acercó a Damon y Matt. -¿Qué tenemos que hacer ahora?-todos me miraron. -No nos queda otra opción…-Dijo Matt-es demasiado peligroso el que estemos con ella, y si la encuentran, acabarán con nosotros-se levantó y se acercó a Susan y a Damon y susurró algo que no conseguí oír-¿Quién se lo dirá? -No lo se…-Matt y Damon miraron a Susan-Estás bien… lo haré yo… Susan se acercó a mí, no me sonreía, aunque siempre me sonreía ahora no lo hacía. -¿Estáis enfadados conmigo?-pregunté, era lo único que se me ocurría que pasaba. -Esther… esto…-suspiró, y me abrazó, pero más tarde me empujó dejándome caer al suelo-Queremos que te vallas, eres muy peligrosa para nosotros, y no te queremos cerca, no nos sirves de nada, ni nos servirás en el futuro. Así que vete. -Yo… ¿puedo preguntarte algo? -¿Qué ocurre? -¿Sabes... donde puedo ir? Susan se quedé en silencio, se acercó a mí y me susurró al oído. -Lo siento…-me besó en la mejilla, se levantó y emprendió el camino fuera del callejón. Matt se acercó a mí y me tocó el hombro. -Adiós, Esther-se levantó y siguió a Susan. Finalmente Damon se acercó también a mí. -Si no quieres que aquel general te capture... no andes muchos por estas calles-se acercó más a mí, suerte pequeña idiota-acarició mi cabeza y se fue. Quedé sentada en aquel callejón aproximadamente unas horas y después emprendí el camino por calles que desconocía, empezó a llover, mi pelo se mojaba, estaba sola, sin darme cuenta llegué a un lugar muy grande, con colinas de arena mojadas por la lluvia, miré atrás, sin darme cuenta había dejado la ciudad atrás, miré de nuevo al frente, vi unos grandes contenedores en los que ponía en letras grandes: NS4. –\"Quizás en esos contenedores no me moje\"-pensé. Entonces empecé a caminar hacia ellos y me metí en el primero que vi, por dentro era muy alargado y de color azul marino, aunque no podía asegurarlo muy bien, puesto que estaba muy oscuro. -Hola…-era la voz de una chica, me dí la vuelta enseguida, solo se veía su silueta. -¿Quién eres?-dije con mucho miedo.[Chapter 4] CAPÍTULO 4: \"EL VIDEONOTE\" -Tranquila no voy a hacerte nada malo. Mi nombre es Rose-se acercó más a mí. Yo retrocedí un poco, pero al final ella me cogió de la mano y me llevó a otro contenedor. Afuera estaba todo oscuro y apenas se veía, ni siquiera pude ver a la chica que me llevaba de la mano, pero podía notar que su mano era muy dura... como el acero. Al acceder al contenedor al que había sido llevada vi a unos 4 robots alrededor de uno que tenía una linterna era con lo único que se alumbraban. Y pude observar que eran completamente diferentes a mí, incluso me asusté, solo eran de un color, cada unos de los 6 de los allí presentes más la chica que me acompañó. Me fijé en la chica más que en nadie, era de color amarilla y sus ojos eran como dos simples y minúsculas bombillas, no tenía pelo y facciones en su cara, todos los que estaban dentro de ese contenedor tenían sus caras y cuerpos iguales. Solo se diferenciaban por el color del que eran. -¿Te ocurre algo?-preguntó la chica. -¿Qué sois?-el miedo me invadió. -¿Nosotros?-todos se miraron con extrañeza-acabas de despertar ¿no? -Si... hace dos días contando este-me alejé unos pasos, mi miedo disminuía, pero no confiaba en ellos. -Nosotros somos NS4 una generación anterior a la tuya y que se ha quedado obsoleta al presente-dijo el robot que tenía la linterna, ese era de color verde. -¿Una generación anterior a la mía? -Sí, mírate, tú tienes rostro definido, te pareces al ser humano, tienes tus ojos mucho más reales y eres más fuerte que todos nosotros juntos. Nosotros fuimos retirados aquí para dar paso a la nueva tecnología, es decir, para darte paso a ti y tu generación de robots. Tú eres un NS5. -Mirad, ha parado de llover-dijo Rose-¿Qué tal si salimos fuera y ves en que clase de sitio vivimos?-yo asentí con la cabeza. Mientras Susan, Damon y Matt se encontraban en el motel. -Bueno, ¿Y bien?-dijo Susan mirando a Matt. -¿Y bien, qué? -¿Que hacemos ahora? -Pues… seguir una vida normal hasta que nos oxidemos-contestó Damon-¿Qué si no? -Pues…-Susan se puso a pensar en las pocas posibles cosas que hacer, cuando se acordó de alguien-¿Qué tal visitar a nuestro mentor? El profesor Alfred J. Lanning. Matt y Damon se miraron con extrañeza. -Esto… Susan, se nos olvidó decirte, el profesor bueno… lo diré con delicadeza. -¿Que? ¿Qué pasa con él? -Se suicidó hace 2 meses-dijo Damon sin rodeos. -Eso no es con delicadeza-Matt lo miró con cara de: \"¬_¬\" -No... No puede ser... es, simplemente es... imposible y... -Extraño, lo sé-dijo Matt. -Y... ¿que os dijeron? -Nada en especial, solo que el profesor había dejado un videonote, pero no nos dejaron acceder a el-Damon se acercó a ella y se arrodilló-La verdad, ¿Qué razón tenía un abuelo feliz para suicidarse? -¿Y vosotros fuisteis tan estúpidos como para dejarlo así? -Susan-Matt le cogió la mano consolándola-todos estaban muy nerviosos y nos tuvimos que ir, nada más, de todas maneras no podíamos acceder a ese videonote… -Pues ya sabemos que hacer-Susan se levantó y fue hacia la puerta-averigüemos que le pasó a nuestro creador. A Damon y Matt no le dio tiempo de decir o hacer nada porque Susan estaba ya en camino, y en fin… es Susan, ¿Quién le podría llevar la contraria? Estaban llegando al centro de URS, el edificio más alto y precioso de la ciudad, accedían plantas y plantas en ascensor hasta que llegaron al despacho del difunto profesor Alfred J. Lanning, todo parecía estar en su sitio, pero de repente entraron unos policías y robots soldado. -¿Quién os autorizó para entrar aquí?-preguntó el policía más próximo. -Esto... nosotros...-comenzó a decir Matt pero Susan lo interrumpió. -Venimos a ver el videonote, tenemos derecho, en este edificio nos conocen por ser los robots personales del profesor. El policía dudó unos minutos y después nos hizo una señal para que lo siguiéramos. Nos llevó al despacho del director de la empresa USR, donde este, se nos quedó mirando con extrañeza. -Señor director, ellos son los robots personales del profesor Lanning, insisten en ver el videonote. -Está bien, puedes retirarte.-el policía asintió. El humano se fue pero los robots soldados se quedaron allí presentes-Bien, antes presentaos. -Soy Susan, él es Matt y él es Damon. Hace tres meses del desastre, pero estos dos no se atrevieron a pedir el videonote, y ahora que yo estoy, lo quiero ver-Matt y Damon se miraron. Damon susurró algo a Matt. -\"Nos está dejando como auténticos idiotas\"-Matt se limitó a encoger los hombros. -Bueno… sois reconocidos en este edificio como los mejores robots del profesor así que…-se levantó de la silla y se dirigió a un armario y de ahí sacó el de videonote, se dirigió hacia Susan, esta extendió la mano para cogerlo pero el hombre se lo retiró-con una condición no volváis más por aquí-Susan iba a hablar pero él la interrumpió-Sin preguntas-ella asintió con la cabeza. Se dirigieron hacia el motel dejando atrás el majestuoso edifico. Una vez en la habitación, encendieron el videonote y de él salió una proyección en 3D con la imagen del profesor, era un hombre de pequeña estatura, con gafas y pelo blanquecino, miró hacia Susan. -Valla… cuanto tiempo mis queridos hijos-su voz era áspera y cansada. -Profesor… ¿Qué ocurrió? ¿Cómo murió usted?-preguntó Susan. -Nos dijeron que se suicidó… ¿es cierto? Y si lo es… ¿Por qué?-Matt se acercó a la proyección. -No puedo responder a muchas preguntas… mis respuestas son limitadas. -¿Existe otra generación de robots, mejor que nosotros?-preguntó Damon. -En estos tiempos que corren… puede ser. -No nos vengas con: \"puede ser\". Ni ninguna de tus tonterías viejales. -¡Damon!-Susan le llamó la atención. -Vosotros tres sois mis obras maestras, he hecho posible el hecho de que soñéis, el hecho de poder tener sentimientos como odio, alegría e incluso amor… -Venga ya, suéltalo, di que robot has creado, y para que. -Como iba diciendo querido, el día en el que creé a Matt fue el más feliz de mi vida, después creé a Susan, mi querida hija Susan, pero tu fuiste todo un reto Damon, tu personalidad ya te venia de serie, después pasaron los años, con vosotros ya no me sentía solo, y llegué a pensar: \"¿Por qué no hacer mi felicidad mayor?\". Me pasé las horas encerrado en mi despacho como ya sabéis. Ella es mi ultima creación, mi nueva hija, y quiero que la cuidéis-todos se miraron con tristeza-encontradla y enseñadle lo que yo no he podido enseñarle… -¿Por qué la creaste? -Esa, querido Damon, es la pregunta correcta. Fin de la emisión-la luz que proyectaba el rayo en 3D se volvió a meter dentro del videonote. -¿Qué ha querido decir con eso?-preguntó Matt. -Esta claro, el viejales no quiere proponer uno de sus acertijos, incluso estando muerto me pone de los nervios. Susan se dirigió hacia Damon y le golpeó. -¿Cómo te atreves a insultar al profesor? -Querida, yo insulto a quien quiero y cuando quiero. -Bueno… volviendo a la realidad chicos, nos dijo que buscáramos a su nueva creación, así que debemos buscar a Esther. -Qué ironía, abandonamos a una hermana a su suerte. -Realmente… no creo que Matt ni yo la veamos como una hermana… -Damon, querido Damon, si por ti fuera te tirarías hasta a una escoba con falda. -¡Dejadlo ya! Tenemos que pensar en donde puede estar-Susan se colocó al lado de la ventana, el cielo estaba nublado de nuevo, pero no parecia que fuera a llover-esta noche soñé con algo… -Yo también-dijo Matt intentando recordar el sueño. -El puente que esta al lado de los contenedores de los NS4. -¡Sí eso es!-recordó Susan-no creo que sea una casualidad. -Yo tampoco… ¿y si vamos…?-Susan se dirigió hacia la puerta y salió de la habitación-Bueno… iba decir: \"¿Y si vamos mañana por la mañana?-Damon se dirigió hacia la puerta. -Vamos Einstein o tu querida Susan se enfadará. -¡Ey! ¿Que quieres decir con eso?-preguntó levantándose muy deprisa y yendo hacia Damon. Damon simplemente se limitó a echar una sonrisa burlona por encima del hombro. Mientras tanto, Rose le terminaba de enseñar aquellos grandes alrededores, en los que no había un alma y que estaba llenos de contenedores llenos de NS4. Cuando Rose la llevó a un pedestal en el que ponía: \"Si lloras por haber perdido el sol las lágrimas no te permitirán ver las estrellas.\" Alfred J. Lanning. -Alfred J. Lanning… Damon, Susan y Matt nombraron ese nombre una vez\"-pensé-¿Quién es Alfred J. Lanning? -Solamente el mejor y el más conocido científico y profesor que creó al primer NS1. ¡Bah, nada importante!-dijo con ironía. Miré al cielo, estaba muy nublado y el viento azotaba mi pelo, cuando de repente se oyó un ruido atrás de nosotras, los contenedores caían al suelo y los NS4 corrían despavoridos, un grupo se ellos se dirigía hacia nosotras. -¡Debemos huir!-empezaron a decir.[Chapter 5] CAPÍTULO 5: \"EL REENCUENTRO\" Entonces lo vi, simplemente un montón de robots NS5 de todas clases, pero había algo raro, los pechos de los robots estaban iluminados de color rojo. La mano de Rose me agarró la mía y tiró de ella, empezamos a correr, pero pronto nos alcanzaron. Se pusieron en círculo alrededor nuestra. -Se os considera peligrosos, aniquilación no autorizada-un robot se acercó a uno de los nuestros y lo cogió por el brazo, y simplemente lo destrozó, le arrancó los brazos y más tarde le reventaron la cabeza, circuitos y tornillos volaron en todas direcciones. Estábamos espantados, los demás robots soldado empezaron a hacer lo mismo con otros robots NS4 que estaban a nuestro alrededor, solo quedamos Rose y yo. Se estaban acercando a nosotras cuando se empezaron a apartar, dejando paso a un robot soldado, una chica de pelo largo y lacio, de ojos ámbar y alta y esbelta como yo. Se acercó a mi y miró a Rose. -Id con los otros en busca de las chatarras que se han escapado, no dejéis que lleguen a la ciudad-obedecieron y se marcharon todos. Pero no acabó ahí, esa chica cogió del brazo a Rose, cuando yo la agarré del otro, y empezamos a tirar de Rose cada una por un extremo, como dos niñas peleando por una muñeca-¡Suéltala! ¡Es una orden!-seguíamos forcejeando, lo increíble era que teníamos la misma fuerza. -¡Yo no acepto ordenes!-dije sin pensar en lo que me pudiera suceder. Soltó a Rose y nos apartamos unos metros, empezó a mirarme detenidamente. -Creo que te conozco…-empezó a decir, pasó unos segundos antes de continuar la frase-eres… ¡esa robot que se escapó de las manos del general! Vamos vendrás conmigo-se acercó a mi para cogerme del brazo cuando Rose se interpuso entre nosotras. Ella sonrió divertida, la agarró de brazo nuevamente y yo hice lo mismo, pero esta vez, algo horrible sucedió, ella aprovechó mi fuerza y gracias al forcejeo consiguió arrancar un brazo a Rose, quedé paralizada, Rose observaba su brazo en la mano de aquella maldita robot, como una tonta le pregunté una absurda idea. -¿Te duele?-dije tocando el hueco en el que sobresalían cables chispeantes, tampoco podía culparme de la pregunta que le hice, no exclamó ninguna clase de alarido. -¿Eres estúpida? ¿Cómo le va a doler? Los robots no tenemos sentimientos, y menos un NS4-lo ultimo lo dijo con desprecio en su voz. -Huye Esther, huye-me susurró Rose, pero no podía dejarla allí. -Ella no irá a ninguna parte-lo había oído-y ahora voy a terminar contigo-la agarró por el cuello rápidamente, tan rápido que no me dio tiempo de agarrarla para que no le hiciera daño, fui hasta Rose tan rápido como pude, pero la chica me golpeó con una fuerza atroz, me lanzó unos metros hacia atrás dejándome medio inconsciente cuando me incorporé vi el fatal espectáculo, esa chica estaba a punto de decapitar a Rose. Mientras Rose forcejeaba para salvar su vida, mas apretaba la mano de la chica su cuello. Intenté levantarme pero un tubo de mi pierna estaba roto por la mitad y estaba goteando una sustancia marrón de él y no podía mover la pierna. Mientras yo dejé de mirar mi pierna, Rose se dio por vencida. -¡Sigue luchando!-grité con todas mis fuerzas-¡No te rindas! Parece que le dio algo de fuerza mis ánimos… pero duró poco. En cuestión de segundos esa chica la decapitó ante mí, una horrible sensación de odio y tristeza se mezclaron en mi mente y mi pecho. Me miró y sonrió de forma burlona y tiró al suelo los resto que quedaron de Rose. -Maldita desgraciada-en ese momento me arrepentí de no haberle pedido a Damon que me hubiera enseñado insultos más dolorosos. Se dirigió hacia mí, y me golpeó, dejándome casi inconsciente, solo veía sus pies, ya que caí tumbada de lado en el suelo, de repente vi otro par de pies, no me dio tiempo de mirar hacia arriba, quedé inconsciente del todo. -Parece que me pasé-dijo la chica-creo que la he matado. La dejaremos aquí, de todas formas el general no la querrá muerta. Se marcharon dejándome allí tirada en el suelo, pasaron las horas y las horas. Mientras tanto Damon, Susan y Matt se dirigían donde les dijo su sueño, a los contenedores de los NS4, cuando de repente, me vieron tirada en el suelo. Corrieron hasta alcanzarme y Damon me cogió en brazos. -Vayámonos de inmediato-dijo Susan mirando a Damon. Cuando llegamos al motel, me echaron en la cama. -¿Por eso soñamos con aquel lugar? ¿Esther iba a estar ahí?-preguntó Susan. -No lo se, que aquello era un infierno de cadáveres de robots. -Lo único que se, es que esta pequeña idiota siempre esta metida en líos, valla donde valla, la van a perseguir, y nosotros ahora debemos protegerla, ¿No es eso lo que quería el viejales, Susan?-Susan lo miró de reojos y con algo de enfado. -Supongo que sí Damon, supongo que sí. Pero… ¿Quién la persigue? ¿Y para qué fue creada? -Esa, querida Susan, es la pregunta correcta. Fin de la emisión-dijo Damon intentando hacer recordar la última frase que el profesor dijo en el videonote. -Ja, ja… muy gracioso-Susan le dio un golpecito en el brazo a Damon. -Bueno… respecto a quien la busca, tenemos a el general a la que Damon se la arrebató, no creo que el profesor le dijera nada sobre Esther al director de la empresa de USR. En ese momento empecé a moverme y abrí los ojos, tenía delante a Damon, Matt y Susan, yo estaba totalmente seria, ¿Cómo me habían encontrado? -Buenas noches preciosa ya era hora de que te despertaras-Damon se acercó a mí, y me tocó la mejilla, me incorporé, sentándome en la cama. -¿Qué hago aquí? ¿Cómo me habéis encontrado? -Simplemente querida, no eres la única que puede soñar-aluciné, no sabia que ellos también podían soñar-y ha habido un cambio de planes, ¿te acuerdas de el nombre de profesor Alfred J. Lanning? -Ya sé quien es, me lo dijo…-me acordé de ella-¡Rose! Ella ha… -¿Quien diablos es Rose?-dijo Susan con extrañeza. -Una NS4, era mi amiga. -Cuando te recogimos… estaban todos muertos-Matt me cogió de la mano, intentando consolarme-lo siento. -Ese tal profesor, ella me explicó que fue el mejor y el más conocido científico y profesor que creó al primer NS1. -Y además, nosotros fuimos sus robots personales Esther, él nos creó, primero a Matt, después a mí, y más tarde a Damon. Él murió hace dos meses, y dejó un videonote, en el que dejó claro que hizo una \"nueva creación\". Según dijo, era una chica. -Y que era una nueva generación de robots-continuó Damon. -Y que debíamos enseñarle muchas cosas sobre la vida-terminó Matt. -Así que no hay duda de que tú eres su última creación-Susan se acercó más a mí, yo no lo podía creer, había descubierto quien me creó y que también creó a los que ahora me rodeaban-así que tu eres una nueva hermana para nosotros, y debemos cuidarte y enseñarte. -Pero Susan, me dijisteis que queríais que me fuera, que era muy peligrosa para vosotros, y no me queríais cerca, que no os servia de nada, y que no os serviría en el futuro. -Ya, lo sé, pero compréndelo, en aquel momento era demasiado peligroso y además, no sabíamos quien eras en realidad, pero ahora sí, y eres una más de nosotros, eres diferente a los demás, eres como nosotros. -Solo que puede desobedecer ordenes y tiene la fuerza de un robot soldado y la apariencia de un robot doméstico-intervino Damon. -Después comprobaremos si tienes cualidades de robot creador-dijo Matt sonriendo. -No sé que decir… estoy tan confusa… -Di que te quedarás-dijo Damon-no tienes a donde ir, debemos permanecer todos juntos, es lo que el viejales quería, y seria por algo, ¿O no te mueres por saber la razón de tu existencia? -Sí pero… -Pues no hay nada más que hablar-Susan se levantó de la cama-Esther ha sido un día muy largo, y ya es muy tarde… será mejor que descansemos todos. -Pero si acabo de despertar… no estoy cansada… -Hasta mañana Esther-Susan abrió la puerta y cuando iba a salir terminó la frase-Damon cuida bien de ella, y recuerda que te tengo vigilado-Damon lanzó una de sus deslumbrantes sonrisas. Damon y yo quedamos solos en la habitación, él se dirigió a la cama y se acostó junto a mí. -Bueno… ha sido un día muy, muy largo, ¿Sabes lo que quiero decir, verdad? -Sí… estaré callada aunque no duerma. -Muy bien, eso esta pero que muy bien-cerró los ojos y se dio la vuelta dándome la espalda. Pasaron los minutos y empecé a Suspirar de forma molesta, le dije a Damon que estaría callada… y lo estaba, no había abierto la boca, solo, suspiraba, quería que se despertara, estaba aburrida, y aunque fuera Damon, quería hablar con alguien. -Por favor… déjame solo unos minutos de descanso. ¡Bien! Lo conseguí. -Damon… ¿Cómo era el profesor?-Dije echándome en el colchón. Damon suspiró y se dio la vuelta mirándome a los ojos. -Un plasta-una sonrisa se reflejó en su rostro, yo también sonreí. Me tocó la cara-¿Por qué quieres saber eso ahora?-Me mantuve en silencio durante un momento, no sabia que contestar. -No lo se…-Me miró compasivo y me volvió a acariciar la cara-Damon… Tengo miedo… -¿De qué? -De que por mi culpa os pase algo… -Tranquila, todo irá bien-me volvió a sonreír-Anda… duerme-iba a contestarle cuando me interrumpió-por favor, duérmete un rato y déjame dormir. Pasaron unos instantes, y cerró los ojos, cuando le volví a hablar. -Damon…-suspiró. -¿¡Qué! -¿Me enseñas a decir palabrotas?-abrió los ojos de par en par y me miró extrañado. -¿Por qué?-Me limité a encogerme de hombros. Suspiró de nuevo-Está bien… Perdón, este cap es un poco cortito en comparación con los otros, y también perdón por la espera, es que tenia que estudiar para los exámenes de septiembre -.-' (excusas baratas xD) bueno espero que al menos os halla gustado este cap! Y no os he dejado con tanta miel en los labios… raro en mi xD bueno os espero en mi próximo cap! Nos leemos mis pequeños. ","Summary":" EL CORAZÓN DE UN ROBOT ¿Como sería si las leyes de la robótica se rompieran? ¿Y si se rompieran por"},{"Movie":"Music and Lyrics","Title":"Love in piece's ( BTS fan fiction)","Author":"Vmonie Swag","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12597946","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter one At that moment all I could feel is the water splashing around me the people shouting my name. I touched the end of the pool and swam back to the starting point. My heart racing with every little bit closer to the end. As I touched the starting point I popped my head out the water lifting my googles over my head. \"You did it kate you beat your time by two minutes\" shouted my swim coach. I smiled as my whole swim team shouted my name congruadulating me. I looked over to the other part of the pool and my smile fadded as I saw my ex boyfriend kissing his new girlfriend but why should I care anymore he is a playboy nothing more. I have to addmit i have a little feeling for him still but not much I looked away. He is the reason I am who I am he changed me. That day he broke up with me after two years of dating and being childhood friends it changed my whole life. I went from a very happy bubbly girl to a cruel and mean bitch I pushed away all the people who loved me, my friends, my family. The only thing that makes me happy is swimming. When I swim I feel alive when the water hits me it's like i'm in my own world. I hopped out the pool and grabbed my clothes and headed to the showers. After taking a quick shower I put on my clothes and walked out to see my one and only friend Rose. \" Hey gurl hurry up we need to get to class\" I hurried up with my walking pace, I was always a fast walker I don't know why I guess it runs in the family. I grabbed Rose's arm as we walked to our math class. In the corner of my eye I saw someone that someone is Jungkook my ex. He always had that cold glare that you can't ignore. He looked at me but I just looked away and kept walking. Rose and I walked down the hallway when Rose said \" i heared that there is a new boy today and he is really handsome and cute\" she said it with a like squeak in her voice. \"cool\" I said blankly I really did not care. We made it to Mr. walkers math class and sat down in our seats. \"Good morning class before we start today we have a new student can you please introduce yourself\" with that a boy entered the room he was handsome he had muscules too his skin was pale and he had a differnt kind of look in his eye. All the girls started whispering to eachother but he just looked cold he had that same stare as Jungkook. I would be a lie if I said he was not attractive cause he is like really attractive. He kinda pulled me in with his stare like he was controlling me I could not stop myself from looking away it was like my body was a remote controlled. He then smirked but what for I looked around the class room to all the girls and they where under the same trance I was looking at him and could not stop. All the guys where busy with whatever they were doing when the boy spoke. \" Hello my name is Park jimin\" he said with a annoyed tone. \" ok jimin you can go sit by Kate, Kate can you please raise your hand\" I raised my hand and jimin's smirk grew wider. All the girls were giving me death glares. He walked over to the seat next to me. I did not know how to react so I just stayed quiet. He came and sat next to me and whispered \" hi cutie\" I blushed at his words he still kept that evil smirk on his face. \" u-ummmm i'm not as easy as I look so don't play with me\" I warned him. \" we will see cutie we will see\" he whispered before the lesson started.[Chapter 2] Chapter two Mr.walker started the lesson so I took out my math notebook and started writing the notes he was writing on the board. 10x54.6b= I kept writing but I felt someone stareing at me. I looked over too my left and saw Jimin looking at me then I looked across the room and saw Jungkook looking at me. I just rolled my eyes and kept on with my work. Jungkook's pov I saw kate and JIMIN sitting together in class. Why is jimin here he should stay away he can't controll hiself. The reason I broke up with Kate was because I can't controll myself. I still love Kate but she will never forgive me and I can't tell her why I broke up with her. Well one reason was because I can't controll myself and the other was because her brother forced me too but still she can't know. She changed after I left her and it breaks my heart seeing her like that. She is not my cute bubbly Kate anymore she is emtionless and cruel.I know she won't belive me but I still love her with all my heart and she will be mine again some day. Kate pov The bell rang saying it was break time I packed up my stuff and put it in my purse well Jimin just looked at my every move with that stare of his. \" Why are you looking at me there are many beautiful girls here i'm ugly af so leave me alone I don't like to play with playboys\" I yelled at him. He did not move one bit but started to talk \" who said I was a playboy sweetheart\" I kept quite but looked at him. \" you know you are just my type fiesty and likes to talk back\" he said with a smirk I once again had nothing to say. \"Well cutie I am going \" he said as he got up walked really close to me and KISSED ME ON MY CHEEK. \" talk to you later cutie\" he whispered and walked away. I stood in my spot in complete shock thinking that what he just did, did not happen. Jimin pov haha she is cute I see what jungkook was talking about when he mentions her. He is right too I can't control myself when i'm around her she has that sent that you can't get out of your mind. And she is just as beautiful as Jin too. She is different from many humans I have seen before that's what attracts me too her. Just wait one day she will be mine and only mine. Time skip Kate pov I walked into my house and layed down onto the couch wow i'm tired. I looked around I guess oppa is not home yet. I walked into the kitchen and saw a note on the stove. Dear princess I will not be home till the morning, so please sleep well and don't go to bed to late you have school. Also there is some food in the oven all you have to do is put it in a bowl. Remember too shower and do your homework. love jin oppa xoxoxo of course my brother would always do this he was a doctor and he sometimes had to work overnight shifts. This was nothing new to me I grabbed a bowl out the cupboard and poured the food in the bowl. I sat in the living room and watched dramas. A hour later I got tired of dramas and decided to do my homework I pulled out the work out of my bag and set it on the table. Another hour later I finally finished my homework and put it back in my bag. After that I went upstairs and got ready to take a shower. I picked out my pjs and went to the bathroom. After taking a quick shower I got ready for bed and layed down but I thought I felt something watching me. Maybe i'm just tired I thought and shook it off and went to sleep. Jimin pov Dang she is so beatiful when she sleeps I thought well I sit next to her on her bed I brushed a piece of hair out of her face and kissed her forehead well stroking her hair and playing with it. I really need to contain myself but how much longer can I before I do something to her. Jin would kill me if I turned her into one of us. Jin is very protective over her because he is one of us and she is not and he wants it to stay that way. But then again each one of use needs to find a mate before the lunar eclipse falls and that is in two months. Finally done with my thinking I said \" goodnight my beautiful princess\" and disapeared into the thin air.[Chapter 3] Chapter three \" we need to find a mate boys before the lunar eclispe\" rm said as he looked at all the boys for answers. \" I found one already\" yelled j hope. \" who is she vampire or human\" he asked again. \" her name is jennie and she is a vampire\" the boy said with a proud face. \" what about you rapmonster\" j hope asked. \" I found a vampire her name is lisa\" everyone cheered for the two boys \" and you jin\" asked rapmonster \" ummmm well I found a human and she is a nurse at the hosptile I work at her name is Grace\" everyone nodded with his aconplisment. \" what about y'all suga, v, jungkook and jimin\" asked jin. \" no one \" suga and v said both together. \"and you jimin and jungkook\" asked rapmonster. \" I have someone in mind\" the boys said together \"WHO\" everyone yelled. \"kate\" they both said in a whisper. Jin's eye's grew wide and he started to yell \" NO YOU BOTH ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER IS A NO\" his voice made the boys jump. \" she is the first girl I have feelings for in 300 years why can't I have her hyung\"jungkook said back. Jimin stared at him before speaking \" remember jin 400 years ago when I loved a girl but she died before I could make her a vampire\" jimin said sadly. \"yes\" jin said in a whisper. \" Kate reminds me of her but Kate has one thing that girl did not Kate has my love from the start ever since her birth I fell in love with her when it was her first minute in life. I have waited for 18 years hyung 18 YEARS do you know how long that is to me.\" \" I understand chimchim but she is my only sibling and I want her life to be normal so you have no idea how my situation has been here. So please think about me here and understand and find someone else to love\" jin said in a whisper.Jimin and Jungkook vanished in the thin air the rest of Bts sighed. Jungkook pov I never knew that about Jimin I knew that he liked her but I thought it was like sibling love not more than that. Hearing his story made me notice would I ever have a chance with a girl like her again. I should have never ever let her go well I had a chance. Before I could cry I went to the beach. I sat in the sand crying softly. Jimin pov It is true I loved Kate since her birth and no one can change that for me. But I know that jungkook wants her too and that gives me less a chance which means I have to step up my game. But I have loved her since a baby and I should be her partner the one that gives her our life, that's always by her side, to make a family. But my chance is on a thread here and I could lose it at any point. I need to make her fall for me but how my love power is usless on her, but it works on every girl in this world but not her. I need to show her she can trust me and that I can protect her. Jins pov Yes my little sister is popular with getting boys attention but she does not know how much danger she is in right now. There are many wolfs and vampires in that school that she does not know about. She is on every boys list as number one for there prey. She needs to stay safe that's why I sent Jimin to go to school with her to be by her side to protect her but not to fall in love with her. I know that both Jimin and Jungkook love her and want her to themselves but I am not going to let that happen. She is my only sibling and I want her to have a normal life of loving someone marrying them having a family and dying. Not to live like a vampire and put herself in danger along with the whole vampire community. Meanwhile \"hyung any updates on the girl\" a male voice said on the other line of the phone. \" she goes to xxxx highschool, her brother is a vampire, she has a protecter named Jimin picked for her, and that is all I know right now\" the male said. \" alright Mark good job keep it going i'm working on a plan at this second I will make her me and that is final\" he said in like a whisper though the phone. \" ok Jaebum keep up with the plan I will get more information\" Mark hung up the phone.

Also, he'd promised to himself to try not to keep secrets from Jonathon, except for stuff like birthday presents, which he most assuredly did not buy two months early. All right, he had, but in his defence, the tickets to rugby games he would never normally watch, apparently operate on a first-come first-served basis. His mom had always said that the lack of trust on his father's side had been a contributing factor to their eventual break-up, and although he knew that she was mainly saying that so that he wouldn't blame himself, it still helped. His father was an asshole, anyway. \"It?\" Jonathon asks, and Timothy finds it hard to concentrate, because Jonathon is curled into him, or maybe he is into Jonathon, and his fingers are trailing all over Timothy, light touches seemingly designed to drive him insane. Mad with want at least, if the seductive glint in Jonathon's eyes is any indication. \"You know, this, you, us,\" because the town's acceptance, Jonathon feeling the same way, still feel like the after-effects of the pansy's magic, and sometimes he fears that they too will fade away after enough time, like the memories of other townspeople, and he'd be left with the bitter memory of something that was still too clear to be a dream, and the longing will be so much worse for, having actually had Jonathon, even for a such a short time, would make it infinitely more painful to be forced to give him up. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" Jonathon says, and it sounds like a promise, no matter how unlikely it is that someone like Jonathon could ever be happy with someone like Timothy, who can't see himself ever willingly letting him go. \"Promise?\" he asks, the second syllable turning into a gasp as Jonathon brushes his thigh gently aside with one of his own and straddles him, eyes dark. \"I promise thee,\" Jonathon whispers; because somehow after doing the play Shakespeare had become their language of endearments and whispered promises, and leans down to kiss him. They don't say anything coherent again for quite some time.

THE BOYS IN THE BAND Chapter One: A Piece of History \"So, which one should it be? The white denim with the studs, or the shirt with the ruffles?\" Sophie considered the two outfits laid out across Alex's waterbed. \"The pouffy shirt, babe. Definitely the pouffy shirt.\" \"You think so?\" Alex eyed the shirt dubiously. \"It does look rather effeminate, now that you mention it . . .\" \"If you donate it to the Hall of Fame, you won't ever have to wear it again.\" \"Good point. Right-I'll just put it in plastic and have it ready the next time Chris stops by.\" He glanced back at the denim pantsuit, fingered the long length of black chiffon he'd once worn with it. \"I'm tempted to throw the scarf in just for good measure. I caught the end of it in an automated door once, and nearly garroted myself.\" \"Shades of Isadora Duncan. I can imagine the headlines.\" \"So could I. 'PoP Star Strangled by Own Neckwear.'\" Alex gave a theatrical shudder. \"It doesn't bear thinking of. Here, help me find something to put this in.\" Together, they wrapped up the ruffled shirt and its accompanying velvet suit in a dry cleaning bag, draping the outfit over a chair for ready access when their manager came over. It must feel strange, Sophie thought, to give away a piece of one's past like this. To think of it being put in some glass case for people to stare at for the next fifty years. She wondered if Alex felt the same, but his expression gave her no clue; the British stiff upper lip was very much in evidence as he hung the other outfit back in his closet behind the rest of his stage clothes. \"I still can't believe PoP's twenty-five years old,\" she remarked, as they left the bedroom and headed for the kitchen. \"Yes. Our first record actually came out in '81, when we were still at university.\" Alex opened the cupboard and took down two mugs. \"A fairly modest effort. We didn't get our first big hit until a few years later, with 'Pop Goes My Heart.'\" \"I remember that, just barely. Rhonda told me she played the single so many times she literally wore it out.\" Sophie smiled at the memory; more than twenty years later, her sister was still an ardent fan of PoP and Alex. \"That's the one you'll be performing at the ceremony, right?\" \"Probably.\" Alex turned off the coffee maker and reached for the pot. \"At least that's the song the band will be performing-whether I'm there or not.\" Sophie stared at him. \"Wait-you're thinking about not going?\" Avoiding her gaze, he poured coffee for them both. \"I haven't made up my mind exactly. Given enough notice, I'm sure they could find another keyboard player to fill in for me. And we've been quite busy ever since Cora's concert. There's the revised touring schedule, our new commissions-\" \"Alex, this is the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!\" Sophie broke in. \"Chris will have a heart attack if you don't go. And how will it look if you're the only inductee who doesn't show up?\" \"Ah, but I wouldn't be,\" he pointed out swiftly. \"According to Chris, the Sex Pistols are also refusing to attend. In fact, they've publicly referred to the museum as a 'piss stain.'\" Sophie rolled her eyes. \"Oh, that's classy. Do you really want to follow their example?\" \"No, I suppose not,\" Alex admitted, after a moment. He turned to face her, a faint crease between his brows. \"Maybe we should talk about this-do pros and cons?\" \"Okay.\" Sophie took a deep breath and began, \"Pros: it's the biggest honor a rock and roller can receive, it's great publicity for the new song, they're holding the ceremony right here in New York, and everyone else from PoP is flying in for it.\" Alex's face went as blank as a wiped slate. \"That-might qualify as a con, actually.\" Of course . Sophie mentally kicked herself for being so slow on the uptake. This had nothing to do with being swamped with work or pressed for time, and everything to do with Colin Thompson, Alex's former partner. The lead singer who'd left his bandmates to pursue solo stardom-and never once looked back. Sophie understood betrayal all too well. Her former love, Sloan, had deceived and exploited her, but then she'd never really known him. He'd taken pains to conceal major portions of his life from her during their brief affair. But Alex and Colin had a history-they'd practically grown up together. Colin deserting Alex and the band they'd formed-not to mention going off with the last three songs they'd written as a team . . . well, it would be like Rhonda betraying her. All the more reason, she thought, not to let the past overshadow the present. \"It doesn't have to be a con,\" she insisted. \"Look at how well things are going now. 'Way Back into Love' is a big hit, and two more groups want us to write songs for them. Didn't you say that was the perfect time to meet your ex, when you're on top of the world?\" Alex grimaced. \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard-or said, in my life. I don't know how you put up with me sometimes.\" Sophie smiled, leaning in until their bodies were almost touching. \"There are certain compensations.\" \"Oh?\" Alex's brows winged up, his voice dropping to a seductive purr. \"Do tell.\" She reached around him and nipped up one of the mugs from the counter. \"Well, for one thing, the coffee's always good.\" Alex sighed, but humor warmed his eyes. \"Quite a comedown. Loved only for my coffee-making skills.\" \"I didn't say that.\" She sipped from her mug, made a small approving noise. \"Though it certainly helps. But seriously, Alex, you and PoP have been recognized as part of rock and roll history. That's such an honor-you should take pride in it, and not let anything or anyone ,\" she emphasized the last word, \"spoil it for you.\" He was silent for a moment, then his mouth quirked up in a rueful smile. \"You can see right through me, can't you?\" \"Sometimes.\" She smiled back at him. \"But, in this case, it's not hard to guess what's on your mind. Or who.\" His expression grew pensive. \"I used to wonder-dread actually-what would happen if I ran into Colin after PoP disbanded. Especially during the first few years.\" The years when he'd hit bottom, she remembered, drinking, using drugs, and desperately working on a solo album that had crashed and burned. \"Well, you don't have to dread meeting him now,\" she said consolingly. \"In fact, you might even end up enjoying it.\" Alex pulled a face. \"Let's not get carried away. Honor or no honor, I don't imagine Colin's that thrilled at the prospect of a reunion, either.\" \"It's just for one night,\" she reminded him. \"Probably less than that. There'll be other bands performing-you may only have to put up with Colin for a few hours, and then you can go your separate ways. You'll have closure. And just think how great it'll feel to have all that negative energy out of your life.\" \"A lot you know,\" Alex said darkly, turning away to pick up his own mug. \"Lennon and McCartney took jabs at each other for years after the Beatles broke up.\" \"I heard Ringo Starr still got along with everyone,\" Sophie countered. She ran her hand along his back, which was looking as stiff as his upper lip; to her relief, she felt him relax a little under the caress. \"Alex, there were three other guys in PoP. Weren't they your friends too?\" \"I suppose they were, yes,\" he conceded, after a moment. \"At least, we were a band. A unit. We played together for nearly ten years. It's just . . .\" His voice trailed off. \"You and Colin were closer,\" Sophie finished for him. \"I understand. But maybe you're approaching this from the wrong angle. Maybe you need to stop thinking about Colin and start thinking about those three other guys.\" \"They have names, you know,\" he pointed out, with a glimmer of amusement. \"I'm sure they do, but unlike Rhonda, I never committed them to memory.\" She linked her free arm through his. \"So, why don't you tell me something about them?\" \"Why don't I show you instead?\" -xxx- \"Oh, my God, you look so young,\" Sophie marveled, staring at the TV. Onscreen, the long-haired keyboard player flashed a delighted, guileless grin at the camera, and she burst out laughing. \"Baby rocker! You're actually kind of cute-even with that hair.\" \"Yes, well . . .\" Alex cleared his throat and shifted beside her on the sofa. \"As I've said before, that hair was very much in style then.\" He paused the DVD player. \"Okay. That's me at the keyboard, and the blond chap on the left is our bass player, Nick Blakely. The quiet one.\" \"He looks just a bit . . .\" Sophie hunted for the right term, trying not to cause offense. \"Androgynous?\" Alex suggested, with a quirk of his brows. \"That's the word,\" Sophie admitted, flushing slightly. Alex shrugged. \"It's the hair, mostly. Nick was a big fan of Boy George, or was it Annie Lennox? But just in case you were wondering, he now lives in San Francisco-with his partner.\" As Sophie digested this, Alex pressed \"Play\" on the remote and the video resumed. They watched in silence as Colin spun into view, taking center stage with the aplomb of a born performer. He did have charisma, Sophie conceded grudgingly. While she disliked him on general principle for what he'd done to Alex all those years ago, she couldn't deny he had incredible presence onscreen-a harder, more dangerous edge that contrasted dramatically with Alex's wide-eyed romanticism. But framed in the same shot, the two faces looked startlingly young and untouched. At a guess, neither of them could have been more than twenty-three or twenty-four at the time. Younger than she was now. She glanced at Alex, whose expression had gone impassive once more. He paused the video again on a group shot of the band. \"That's our drummer, Dan Miller. Steady, very solid. He was a little older than the rest of us, and he actually got married a few years after we formed PoP. I think he may have been a bit relieved when we called it quits. His wife was expecting a baby and he didn't want to tour anymore. He does mostly session work these days. \"And the last one, the dark-haired guy in the leather jacket-that's Andrew Wymore, our guitarist. He's the only one of us from a musical family, so lots of connections there. He joined another band, based in London, after PoP broke up. He'd also started a serious relationship by then, but I don't know if it lasted.\" He pressed \"Stop\" on the remote and the screen went to static. \"So there we all are, then. The boys in the band.\" \"Did you ever hang out together-when you weren't performing, I mean?\" \"Oh, now and then. Maggie-Dan's wife-had us over to dinner sometimes, especially before we made it as a band. Very nice of her-it can't have been easy having four more starving musicians underfoot. And some evenings, Colin, Andrew, and I would go pub-crawling or watch a sports match on television. Once in a while we even managed to drag Nick along with us.\" Alex leaned back against the sofa, his expression contemplative. \"But when all's said and done, it was music, really, that kept us together so long. I'd had years of piano and keyboard lessons, of course, and then Andrew and Nick taught me some basic guitar and bass.\" Sophie nodded, remembering how he'd laid down the various tracks for the demo. \"So, you'd have these-what do you call them-jam sessions?\" \"We did, yes. In fact, that's usually how an evening out ended up-back at someone's flat, playing, singing, and annoying the neighbors. Andrew or Nick might come up with a riff or a bit of fingering he liked and we'd try working it into whatever I was composing at the time. Now that I think of it, that's one of the things I miss about being in a band,\" he added thoughtfully. \"Writing to someone else's strengths. Playing off someone in general, really. You don't get to do that as a solo act.\" \"You didn't consider staying together, after Colin left?\" Sophie asked. \"There were still four of you.\" \"We talked about finding another vocalist to replace Colin,\" Alex replied, after a moment. \"Preferably one who could also write lyrics. But in the end,\" he took a breath, \"we put it to the vote and decided that PoP had run its course. The rest, as they say, is history.\" His tone was light, almost careless, but Sophie knew how hard the break-up had been for him, personally. And how deeply it had affected him for years afterwards. It was only now, she thought, that he'd truly begun to put the past behind him and find his voice again. \"Did you keep in touch with any of them, afterwards?\" From the way his gaze slid away from hers, she could already guess the answer. \"Oh, Dan and Maggie sent cards at Christmas for a few years. So did Nick. And I heard from Andrew once or twice. We talked about hooking up if I ever came to London or he ever came to New York.\" Alex fidgeted with the remote, still not looking at her. \"The timing never seemed to be right, though, for either of us.\" And he wouldn't have wanted any of his former bandmates to see him down and out, Sophie realized. \"What about Colin? Has he ever contacted you since PoP broke up?\" \"No-why would he?\" \"To mend fences?\" she suggested. \"Or apologize?\" \"That would mean admitting he'd done something wrong in the first place. I've known Colin since we were both eighteen-taking responsibility for his mistakes isn't one of his strengths.\" \"Maybe it'll be different now. Maybe he'll want to make amends, even congratulate you on the new song.\" Alex shifted irritably on the sofa. \"More likely he'll want to claim he wrote 'Way Back into Love' himself.\" \"I don't see why. If he's such a big star, he probably doesn't care one way or the other. Wait-let me rephrase that,\" she amended hastily at Alex's expression. \"What I meant was, why should Colin grudge you your success? You earned it, fair and square.\" \" We earned it, you mean,\" Alex corrected her. She smiled at him, still ridiculously touched and pleased by the \"we.\" The reminder that they were partners now, in every sense of the word. \"We wrote something good, really good-and nothing can take that away from us. So no matter who else is at that ceremony, you can walk in with your head held high. And I'll be there, and Chris will be there, and Rhonda and Gary. You don't think my sister is going to miss the chance to ogle her favorite boy band of all time, do you?\" she teased. Alex regarded her skeptically. \"Even if the boys in question are now arthritic, middle-aged geezers?\" \"Even then,\" she assured him. His face relaxed into a smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes. \"Then I suppose I'd better put in an appearance. Can't disappoint the fans, after all.\" He turned to her, sobering abruptly. \"Thank you. For reminding me of what's really important.\" Sophie kissed him lightly on the mouth. \"Anytime, babe. Anytime.\" -xxx- She bought a new dress, just for the ceremony, and spent a little more than she'd intended. But the look on Alex's face when he saw her in it more than made up for the expense. \"Blue velvet.\" His gaze roved appreciatively over the low-cut bodice, the slightly flaring skirt. \"Very nice.\" \"Do you like it?\" Sophie turned in a slow circle. \"I thought it was kind of like the dress I borrowed from Gloria, except it fits better-and the color's a little subtler. I wanted to do you proud tonight.\" His eyes warmed, blue and brilliant. \"You do-and not just tonight, but every night.\" He cupped her face in his hands, kissed her briefly but thoroughly. \"Fantastic dress, love. Now, let's go, before I start thinking of ways to get you out of it!\" Outside, they hailed a cab and headed for the Waldorf-Astoria, Alex's portable keyboard stowed safely in the trunk. \"Are you sure you'll have enough time to rehearse?\" Sophie asked as the cab cruised along. \"It's only hours before the ceremony.\" \"We're cutting it close, yes,\" Alex admitted. \"But with five different schedules to coordinate, this was the best Chris and the other managers could do. We're lucky to have got any rehearsal time booked at all, with so many people being inducted tonight.\" \"Two of your bandmates are coming from London, right? \"Andrew and Dan,\" he confirmed. \"Chris told me they flew in yesterday, which would have given them time to sleep off the jet lag. Nick was expected this morning. The biggest problem seems to be Colin's schedule. He's shooting a film in Chicago and, according to his manager, he can't get away from the set until this afternoon.\" \"Is this the same manager who convinced him to go solo?\" She almost said \"leave PoP\" but changed her words just in time. \"The very same. Terrifying man, small but vicious-we nicknamed him the Land-Shark.\" Alex shifted in his seat. \"Personally, I think it's just as well the band's only meeting up now. No time to overthink things-we'll just go in, practice the song until it's perfect, and that will be that until the ceremony.\" Sophie thought the situation might be more complicated than he described but tactfully refrained from saying so. Despite Alex's relaxed pose, she could feel the tension radiating from him in almost palpable waves. In a matter of minutes, he'd be facing four guys he hadn't seen in fifteen years, but who had been an integral part of his life for a decade. In his place, she'd have been a nervous wreck. \"What would you like to do after the ceremony?\" she asked, trying to set him at ease. \"Oh, well, that depends on whether or not we have to talk to the press. But I thought perhaps-if we're not too tired-we might go for a late dinner somewhere, just the two of us.\" \"Sounds great.\" The cab came to a halt, and she peered out the window. \"We're here.\" \"Right.\" Alex took a breath, visibly bracing himself. \"Showtime.\" -xxx- At first glance, the rehearsal room seemed full of people running around and setting up microphones and equipment, but once Sophie did an actual head count, she came up with fewer than a dozen, including Alex and herself. A tall man holding a guitar glanced up at their approach. \"Ah, there you are,\" he said, apparently to Alex. \"Set it up over there.\" A roadie immediately hurried forward to relieve Alex of his keyboard. And Sophie took a closer look at the three men at the center of the chaos. With the PoP video fresh in her memory, she had half-expected to find a group of long-haired youngsters in leather pants. The reality was startling-if some degrees short of Alex's pessimistic description of \"arthritic, middle-aged geezers.\" But, without question, the trio gathered in the rehearsal room looked noticeably older. The stocky drummer had cropped his sandy hair short and grown a neat little beard. The bass player's fair hair was closer to grey than blond now; he still looked a touch androgynous but not nearly as much as he had in the video. And the lanky guitarist, now coming forward to greet them, had more than a scattering of grey in his dark hair. \"Alex, mate-good to see you.\" He clapped Alex on the shoulder with what seemed to be genuine, unstrained affection. After a moment's hesitation, Alex returned the gesture. \"Andrew-it's good to see you too.\" The guitarist turned keen dark eyes in Sophie's direction. \"And who's this, then?\" \"Sophie Fisher-my partner and lyricist,\" Alex replied. \"Sophie, this is Andrew Wymore, our guitarist from PoP.\" Smiling, Andrew held out his hand. \"Glad to meet you, Sophie. Dead chuffed, in fact.\" \"Chuffed?\" Sophie echoed, confused. \"He means very pleased,\" Alex told her. \"Too right I do. Heard the new song, by the way-it sounds fantastic.\" He gave them a sly, sideways grin. \"Nice to find out the blonde pop tart can sing, after all.\" Sophie choked back a giggle at this irreverent description of Cora, as the other members of PoP approached. Alex quickly introduced Sophie to them; it was on the tip of her tongue to ask where Colin was, but sensing her partner's reserve, she swallowed the question and exchanged pleasantries with the band's former drummer and bassist. \"About time you showed up,\" Dan Miller remarked to Alex. \"And my missus wants to say hello as well,\" he added, nodding towards a petite, dark-haired woman standing slightly off to one side. Alex's face brightened visibly, warming into the first unreserved smile Sophie had seen since their arrival. \"Maggie May!\" He embraced her as she came up to him. \"Lovely to see you again.\" \"And you.\" She kissed him on both cheeks, then framed his face with her hands for a moment. \"Still ridiculously good-looking,\" she declared, then turned, smiling, to Sophie. \"I'm Maggie Miller. And you're Alex's new collaborator?\" Sophie nodded, smiling back. \"Sophie Fisher.\" She found she rather liked this woman, whom she could easily imagine feeding hungry musicians trying to make the big time. \"Dan brought Maggie, so I had to bring my old lady too,\" Andrew added, motioning another woman forward. Alex's eyes widened. \"Good Lord, you got married?\" \"Twice,\" Andrew confessed with a crooked smile. \"The first didn't take, but the second-nearly five years now. Sarah, this is my old bandmate, Alex Fletcher.\" Sarah Wymore was an attractive redhead perhaps in her mid-thirties. \"So, you're the keyboardist?\" she asked brightly. \"Keyboard and vocals,\" Alex said pleasantly. She gave him an apologetic smile. \"I'm afraid I'm still learning who everyone is. PoP was a bit before my time.\" \"That's quite all right,\" he assured her. \"We were a bit before Sophie's time too. In fact, I believe she was playing with her Cabbage Patch dolls during our first world tour.\" \"I never owned a Cabbage Patch Kid in my life,\" Sophie objected, swatting him on the arm. She smiled at Sarah. \"But my older sister was the PoP fan in the family, so this is new to me too.\" \"Oh, good. We can both be confused together, and let Maggie show us the ropes.\" \"Any kids?\" Alex asked Andrew. \"One sprog-name of Sam,\" Andrew reported with pride. \"Coming up on three years old and staying with Sarah's mum and dad, while we make this trip to the States. I'm thinking of picking up a toy guitar as a prezzie for him.\" \"You can never start too early,\" Alex agreed. He turned to the bassist. \"So, Nick-how's life in Baghdad by the Bay?\" \"Can't complain. Fairly fantastic, actually,\" he added, beckoning to a thin, bespectacled man with a pleasant face and an unexpectedly charming smile. \"This is Paul Stokes, my partner.\" Alex cordially shook his hand. \"Pleased to meet you, Paul. Are you a musician yourself, by any chance?\" Stokes shook his head. \"Only on weekends. I play some sax, but I'm nowhere near in Nicky's league. The rest of the time I'm an accountant.\" \"One of the best in the city,\" Nick said staunchly. Andrew glanced at his watch. \"Time's ticking by, mates. Let's get a move on.\" \"Do you want us all to clear off, then?\" Sarah inquired. \"Well, you could stay and be supportive,\" her husband suggested. Sarah raised her brows. \"Does being supportive involve screaming, fainting, and flinging our knickers at the stage?\" Andrew grinned down at her. \"The knicker-flinging would be a nice touch. Might get us in the right mood for tonight.\" She rolled her eyes and gave him a quick kiss. \"Dream on, love. But we'll stay and watch at any rate.\" \"Don't get any ideas about me flinging my knickers either,\" Sophie warned Alex. \"It never crossed my mind, I assure you.\" The glint in his eyes gave the lie to his words. \"This how you want it, Mr. Fletcher?\" The roadie who'd taken charge of Alex's keyboard called to him from across the room. \"Yes, thanks-I'll come and have a look.\" He kissed Sophie briefly and loped over to the stage. Sophie watched him as he bent over his instrument, sounding keys and adjusting switches. So serious and intent, she thought with an inner smile. This was the Alex Fletcher she'd fallen for. Not the famous pop star, not even the \"happy has-been\"-the persona he'd worn like armor for more than a decade, but the man underneath it all: a little insecure, a little vulnerable, and more passionate about music than he was comfortable admitting. Speaking of comfortable, his reunion with the band seemed to have gone pretty well. Of course the acid test would be Colin's arrival. It was odd, she realized suddenly, that none of the other PoP members had so much as mentioned their famous ex-bandmate . . . -xxx- Strange and familiar all at once, to be practicing with the band again. To be engaging in the same sort of give and take that had characterized their rehearsals in the past. \"I'm thinking we should at least be able to do better than the Police in '03,\" Andrew remarked, picking up his guitar again. \"I didn't catch the ceremony on telly that year. What happened?\" Nick asked. \"They hadn't played together in about a decade before their induction,\" the guitarist replied. \"It showed.\" \"Any idea where we fall in the schedule?\" Dan inquired, settling in behind his drum kit. \"I've heard Black Sabbath's leading it off.\" \"I think we're playing one of the earlier sets,\" Alex told him. \"After Blondie and before Lynyrd Skynyrd, I believe. We can double-check before the ceremony, see if there's been any change in the queue.\" \"Are the Sex Pistols really not coming?\" This, from Nick. \"Apparently not. They've been quite rude about it on their website, I understand.\" Alex paused, not wanting to ask the question that had been hovering on his tongue since his arrival. But if they were about to rehearse in earnest, there was no avoiding it. \"Anyone heard from Colin yet?\" \"I think he's still in the air right about now. Knowing him, he'll probably breeze in with ten minutes to spare, claiming he rehearsed on the plane.\" Andrew slipped the guitar strap over his head, settled his instrument into place. \"He's got a bit lazy about warming up, if you ask me.\" \"Too much on his plate,\" Dan theorized. \"He's trying to start a new line of clothing, as well as record a new CD and shoot this film.\" \"You've stayed in touch with him?\" Alex tried to sound casual. Dan and Andrew exchanged a glance. \"We're both still in London, so we cross paths with him now and then,\" the drummer replied. \"Not that he has much to say to us when we do.\" \"Does he ever talk about the break-up?\" Nick asked, much to Alex's secret gratitude; he'd have bitten his own tongue in half before asking. Dan shook his head. \"Doesn't mention it. Dodges off. He probably wants to pretend it never happened.\" That sounded about par for the course, Alex reflected morosely. \"Anyone know what sort of picture he's making?\" Andrew asked. \"It's an action flick,\" Nick reported. \"Called 'Deadly Force' or 'Lethal Danger'-something like that. I read about it in Rolling Stone . Colin's playing a rock star.\" \"Must be quite a stretch for him,\" Alex said dryly, adjusting the controls on his Roland. \"The plot's pretty basic. He's traveling with his entourage when his jet gets hijacked by international terrorists.\" \"Sounds like two hours' worth of shite,\" Andrew remarked, tuning up his guitar. Alex cleared his throat pointedly. \"Look, chaps, if we don't want our performance tonight to sound like two minutes' worth of shite, I suggest we get down to business.\" The edge in his voice surprised him almost as much as it did the others; Andrew recovered first. \"Too right. Sorry, mate,\" he added with what sounded like genuine contrition. Alex received the apology with a nod, then turned back to his keyboard. \"Okay. 'Pop Goes My Heart.' Andrew, would you cover Colin's part of the vocals? Leading in on four-one, two, three . . .\" -xxx- They paused after three complete run-throughs, cracking open bottles of room-temperature spring water to clear dry throats. \"Well, what do you think-better than the Police?\" Alex inquired, before taking a swig from his bottle. Andrew nodded. \"Hard not to be.\" \"There's one problem, though,\" Nick demurred; the others turned to look at him. \"If we only do 'Pop Goes My Heart,' we'll have the shortest set of the evening. Every other band is doing at least two numbers.\" \"So you think we should add another song?\" Alex asked. \"Before or after 'Pop Goes My Heart'?\" \"I'd say before,\" Andrew replied. \"Save our signature hit for last. We could start off with a ballad-'Meaningless Kiss' or 'Dance With Me Tonight.'\" \"Ah.\" Alex paused; traditionally, he had sung the lead vocal on both numbers. \"You know, Colin might prefer something else,\" he pointed out. \"Something of his.\" Andrew shrugged. \"You're here. He's not. So, which would you rather do?\" Alex weighed his options, then smiled as a recent memory rose in his mind: of a crowded amusement park and Sophie waving her cell phone aloft as he sang. \"'Dance With Me Tonight,' I think. It provides more of a contrast with 'Pop Goes My Heart.'\" \"Roger that.\" Andrew took a last swallow of water. \"Let's give it a go, mates.\" No doubt his years on the nostalgia circuit had something to do with it, Alex mused, but performing \"Dance With Me Tonight\" felt as comfortable as slipping into a pair of well-worn trainers. Sophie-deep in conversation with the other rock and roll \"wives\"-looked up and smiled at him when he played the opening chords. His spirits lifted, and he sang the song for her, doing his best to convey its wistful appeal. To his relief, the other three backed him smoothly, without any serious mistakes. A second run-through would improve the performance, of course, but this was a commendable first try after fifteen years. He was about to suggest they rehearse one more time, when he heard a commotion in the hall-and a familiar voice rising over the excited babble of fans and paparazzi alike. The missing member of PoP had finally arrived.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: Return of the Prodigal If life had been fair, Colin--or rather, Sir Colin--Thompson would have had a paunch and a visibly receding hairline. Alex was accustomed to life being unfair. His former partner looked marvelous: trim, fit, and dressed to the nines in a suit that was a masterpiece of Italian tailoring and probably cost as much as a small principality. He still walked--swaggered--with that easy assurance Alex remembered, certain as ever that he was the center of attention wherever he went. And, of course, he was usually right. Alex straightened to his full height, schooling his expression into something he hoped was suitably bland, pleasant, and opaque. What he'd come to think of as his PoP face . . . Sophie, who had gravitated to his side, murmured in his ear, \"I have this sudden urge to sing Carly Simon.\" It took a moment for the reference to hit, and then amusement rippled through him. You had one eye in the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte . . . you're so vain . . . Not an inaccurate description of Colin, who had paused on the threshold and was now surveying the rehearsal room with the air of one determined to make the best of these somewhat plebeian surroundings. His gaze finally alighted on his former bandmates. \"Hullo, chaps. Sorry to keep you waiting.\" His jaunty tone rendered the apology perfunctory, a mere matter of form. \"About time you showed up,\" Dan said. Alex blinked. The drummer had said exactly the same thing to him, but the tone couldn't have been more different. The calmest and most even-tempered of them all, Dan sounded curt, even a bit cold now. \"Couldn't be helped, Dan-O. But I reckon the jet couldn't have flown any faster.\" Colin came further into the room, followed closely by another man who must have been six-four in his stocking feet. Nearly as tall as Chris, Alex observed with astonishment. But where his manager was gangling, this guy was built like a barn, with a blunt-featured face that reminded Alex of a boxer's. \"My bodyguard, Reg,\" Colin explained. \"He goes wherever I go.\" He paused again, smiling at all and sundry. \"Together again. Just like old times, isn't it?\" Alex wondered if Colin had noticed the constraint that had settled over them all since his grand entrance. Then Colin looked directly at him and his own thought processes ground to a halt. \"Alex.\" Was it his imagination, or did Colin sound just a touch--uncertain? \"Heard about the new song, mate. Congratulations.\" Mate . It had been years since Colin had called him that--and even longer since he'd meant it. And he probably didn't mean it tonight either, Alex reminded himself. Performance instincts honed over more than two decades came to his rescue--and this was a performance, on Colin's part as much as his, he realized. \"Thank you.\" The response came out colorless and cool, but he was just relieved to be able to form words again. Fortunately, Colin had turned his attention to Andrew and Nick. \"Great to see you guys. And I see you've brought some of your biggest fans along,\" he added, turning a winning smile on the women and Paul. \"Good evening, ladies--and gent. Maggie, you look lovelier than ever.\" \"Thank you, Colin.\" Maggie's tone was polite rather than cordial. \"You're looking quite well yourself.\" Sarah only nodded in response. Colin's glance fell on Sophie. \"But who's this little stunner? I don't believe we've met.\" Alex felt Sophie stiffen imperceptibly at being called little . \"This is Sophie Fisher, my partner,\" he said evenly. \"Sophie, Colin Thompson--PoP's former frontman.\" He took an admittedly petty satisfaction in leaving off the \"Sir.\" Sophie appeared to be taking her cue from Maggie and Sarah. \"It's very nice to meet you,\" she said politely, but without warmth. Colin didn't seem to notice the omission. \"Charmed, I'm sure.\" He took her hand and bowed over it with an extravagance that would have elicited giggles and blushes from a more susceptible audience. \"So you're with Alex? Some blokes have all the luck,\" he added, tipping her a jovial wink. Sophie reclaimed her hand and, to Alex's surprise and amusement, slipped it rather pointedly through the crook of his elbow. \"Yes, I suppose they do.\" For just a moment, Colin looked slightly flummoxed. But he recovered almost at once, turning to exchange brief introductions with Paul. Andrew cleared his throat. \"Right, shall we get on with the practice, then? Time's a bit short.\" Colin turned to face him. \"So, what have you lot got planned?\" \"We're doing 'Dance With Me Tonight' before 'Pop Goes My Heart,'\" Andrew said, with a firmness Alex could only envy. But then, Andrew had been a year older than Colin and himself; there had been times, Alex suspected, when the guitarist had regarded them both as troublesome younger brothers. If the announcement fazed Colin in any way, he didn't show it. \"Brilliant. No problem with my singing harmony with you on 'Dance,' is there?\" he inquired of Alex. \"I rehearsed on the plane,\" he added with the smile that reduced whole stadiums of fans to quivering jelly. It had somewhat less effect on his former bandmates, but Alex couldn't help remembering a time when Colin's charm had seemed warm and genuine. Perhaps it even had been, then. He'd talked the band out of a number of tight spots, usually involving hotel rates or overdue rent money. Wheedled extra food from susceptible waitresses during the years they were young and hungry, persuaded music executives to grant them more recording time while they were trying to break through. There were other memories too--even more personal. Of long nights, composing together, over the crumpled wrappings of fish and chips or empty take-away boxes of Indian or Chinese. Endless mugs of stewed tea or muddy coffee to keep themselves awake. Scribbling on napkins when they ran out of notepaper, the bickering when they couldn't get the music and lyrics to gel, and the exultation when they finally did. Arguing the merits of favorite singers and songwriters. Discovering during their first full practice with Andrew, Nick, and Dan that they had the makings of a damned good five-piece band--and their euphoria after, at knowing their dream was about to become reality . . . When had the friend he still recalled so vividly turned into a self-serving bastard? Or had he always been like that, underneath, and Alex had been too stupid, too gullible to notice? Enough of that. There'd be time for navel-gazing afterwards, if he were so inclined. But for now, they had a performance to concentrate on. \"I think we should run through both numbers one more time,\" he said, trying to match Andrew's firmness. \"Before Lynyrd Skynyrd comes along and chases us out.\" \"Right you are,\" Colin said easily. \"Just show me where to stand, okay?\" ---xxx--- \"Well, that was--awfully polite,\" Paul remarked in a low voice, as the band members returned to the stage area, this time with Colin in tow. The bodyguard, Reg, took up a position just inside the door, his watchful gaze fixed on his employer. Sophie nodded agreement, having had a similar reaction to what she'd just witnessed. While no one had attacked Colin physically or verbally, he had received none of the warmth or even cordiality that had been extended to Alex on his arrival. Instead, everyone had been scrupulously, unfailingly courteous--and the mean temperature of the room must have dropped at least ten degrees. In fact, the more charm Colin had exerted, the more formal and distant his ex-bandmates had become. It was like watching a pulsar shooting out magnetic rays that were promptly swallowed up by a quartet of black holes. British black holes, Sophie amended; she'd never been more aware of how English Alex and the other members of PoP were than at this moment. Of course, she knew what Alex's issues with Colin were, but what about the others? Was it just that he had deserted them at the height of their fame? \"Oh, no one does civilized disapproval quite like us Brits.\" Maggie sounded dryly amused. \"Nicky doesn't talk much about Colin,\" Paul ventured. \"I couldn't help wondering . . .\" \"He left them all in a bit of a lurch fifteen years ago,\" Maggie explained briefly. \"Surprising if there weren't some ill-feeling, even after all this time.\" She paused, as if considering whether to go on, then shook her head as the first notes of \"Dance With Me Tonight\" issued from Alex's keyboard. \"Let's give our chaps a good listen now, eh?\" ---xxx--- (Several hours later) The Grand Ballroom was packed, Alex observed as he waited in the wings with the other members of PoP. The veteran pop star Billy Mack inducted them, which was rather like having one's black sheep uncle do the honors. But Mack appeared to be on his best behavior tonight, making only a few sly references to the band's \"over-styled hair and lamentable fashion sense\"--Alex considered that a bit rich in light of some of the older rocker's past wardrobe choices--and generously praising their composing and performing skills. The pairing of \"Colin Thompson's clever, unexpected lyrics\" and \"Alex Fletcher's irresistibly catchy melodies\" received particular attention as being pivotal to the band's enduring appeal. \"Because something that seemingly effortless can only be the result of bloody hard work!\" Mack finished to a round of hearty applause. \"Ladies and gentleman, I give you PoP!\" Showtime again. PoP face firmly in place, Alex followed Colin to the podium. His former partner had been buffed and polished to a high gloss by a small but fervent cadre of make-up and costume people who had descended on him immediately after rehearsal. There was literally not a hair out of place on Colin's head. Hard not to feel a bit scruffy by comparison, though Alex knew his black suit and white shirt still looked fairly sharp. There was less than half an hour to be got through in any case, as far as he and PoP were concerned. And then--freedom. Standing at the microphone, Colin turned the full wattage of his smile on everyone assembled in the ballroom: Alex was sure he could hear women's knees and loins liquefying from twenty feet away. \"Thank you, Billy,\" Colin began, draping himself with casual grace over the podium. \"It's quite an honor to be inducted by one of the legends of pop music. When Alex and I first formed PoP as a pair of scrawny, ambitious kids at uni, we could never have imagined we'd end up in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame someday. So I can't tell you what a thrill it is to be here tonight, performing with the band that gave me my first big break.\" He paused, turning towards the other four. \"So, let me just say, 'Thanks, chaps. I wouldn't be where I am without you.'\" Interesting choice of words, Alex mused. But there wasn't time to contemplate them now; Colin was stepping back and it was his own turn at the mike. He took a slow, calming breath before speaking. \"PoP was a dream Colin and I both shared as youngsters,\" he began, \"and we were lucky enough to have it become a reality. Which might not have happened, if we hadn't also been lucky enough to find Andrew, Nick, and Dan to chase that dream with us.\" He paused to let that sink in, then continued, \"With so many talented and deserving artists out there, I am surprised and flattered that PoP has received this honor during our first year of eligibility. In any case, I would like to thank all our fans for their loyalty and support over the years.\" He quickly yielded the microphone to the others. Andrew succeeded him first, thanking his family as well as the fans, Nick kept his own thanks brief and gracious, while Dan mentioned his \"wonderful wife, Maggie\" and made a joking reference to the next generation of PoP, as represented by his and Andrew's kids, that elicited some indulgent laughter. Their speeches finished, they trooped onto the stage, where their instruments awaited. Positioning himself behind his keyboard, Alex glanced out at the ballroom for the first time and felt his heart skip a beat. Table for five, down in front. He saw Sophie first, her glowing smile, the little wave she sent him as their eyes met. Then, next to her, Chris with Gloria, the therapist he'd started dating recently, and rounding out the party, Rhonda and Gary. His own personal rooting section--how could he possibly go wrong with that? And at a neighboring table, he glimpsed the other PoP \"wives.\" Cheered, he glanced over his shoulder at his bandmates, saw that they too were in place, their instruments at the ready. Colin stood at center stage, microphone in hand. Turning back to his keyboard, Alex played the slow, slightly melancholy lead-in to \"Dance With Me Tonight.\" It ought to have felt odd, singing with Colin again after so many years, but it didn't. The whole song went with an almost preternatural smoothness, and for Alex, there were more recent associations that made performing it an unalloyed pleasure this time. They waited for the applause to subside before Alex adjusted the controls on his keyboard and began a completely different introduction, to be joined seconds later by Dan on drums. And here came Nick and Andrew, bass and guitar, as sure of themselves as if they hadn't gone fifteen years without playing together. Alex sensed rather than saw the recognition rippling through the room, the growing anticipation as he launched into PoP's breakthrough hit. His music, Colin's lyrics--the song that had first put them on the map. He felt the sudden rush of excitement as the music poured out in pulsing chords from his fingers to his keyboard. This was what mattered, what had always mattered--and he let it sweep him away like a rising tide. Standing there, onstage, he had the strangest sense of déjà vu. If he turned his head, he knew he'd see Nick, bouncing on the soles of his feet as he played his bass, and Dan, steady and dependable, keeping the rhythm going on the drums. On his left, Andrew, cool and laconic, strummed his guitar, one foot tapping in time with the music. All of them working together, even Colin, to prove that they'd earned their place here. And here came Colin, magnetic as ever, ready as always to dance up a storm for the crowd. \" I never thought that I could be so satisfied, Every time that I look in your angel eyes A shock inside me that words just can't describe And there's no explaining-- \" Colin's verse, then his. Alex slid into it easily after their shared fourth line. \" Something in the way you move I can't deny, Every word from your lips is a lullaby, A twist of fate makes life worthwhile--\" \" You are gold and silver, hah hah,\" they sang together, and swung into the first chorus. \" I said I wasn't gonna lose my head, But then, pop goes my heart! (Pop goes my heart!) I wasn't gonna fall in love again But then, pop goes my heart! (Pop goes my heart!) And I just can't let you go, I can't lose this feeling!\" They raced through two more verses and another chorus, then began the long instrumental bridge intended to give each of the boys in the band a chance to shine. It sounded much better in concert, Alex decided; in the studio, the synthesizer tended to drown out all the instruments except the drums. And now here came the final chorus, to put a capper of what was turning out to be a highly successful reunion performance. He was never exactly sure, afterwards, how it happened. As he played and sang, he was aware of Colin dancing at center stage, strutting and gyrating with his trademark flair, but his own gaze was trained on the audience, seeing row upon row of smiling faces. Colin's hips thrust like pistons, forward, then side to side in their famous dance move. Right, left, right--and then a dramatic drop to one knee. Alex mentally shook his head--Colin's dancing would win no awards for subtlety--and sang on, \" A twist of fate makes life worthwhile--\" \" You are gold and silver, hah hahhh --\" Alex looked up at the sudden breathiness in Colin's voice and saw to his shock that his bandmate was still down on one knee, and his face had gone a chalky white under the stage lights. Something was wrong. Very wrong. Still singing, Alex glanced in Andrew's direction and saw with relief that the guitarist was already moving towards Colin, not hastily enough to spread alarm through the audience but too purposefully for it to be accidental. Colin was still singing, but there was a definite quaver in his voice now. Had he pulled a hamstring or, worse, a groin muscle with all that leaping about? Alex fought back something that felt horribly like the beginnings of hysterical laughter and made himself keep singing too. Just three more lines to go . . . Not only Andrew but Nick had come forward to support Colin--literally propping him up on either side, and singing vigorously enough to counter the weakness in his voice. Alex pitched his own voice a fraction louder and swept through to the last chords. \" And I just can't let you go! \" Of necessity, their bows were short ones, and by now the crowd had caught on that something was definitely off. Murmurs of concern swelling all around them, the four uninjured members of PoP helped their frontman from the stage and into the safety of the wings. Colin leaned heavily on his two nearest supporters, his face pale and dripping with perspiration. Damp patches showed through his silk shirt too; Alex hadn't seen that much sweat since the last time he'd attended a Springsteen concert. Spotting a chair backstage, he pushed it over so Nick and Andrew could lower Colin into it. \"Where does it hurt?\" he asked. \"Hip,\" Colin got out, between clenched teeth. \"Oh, Christ, shit, fuck--it's a bugger!\" Pain. A voice in Alex's head observed mordantly that this was the first genuine emotion he'd seen from Colin all evening. Suppressing that voice, he managed to dredge up some vestige of concern, even sympathy, for the man who'd once been his closest friend. \"Just sit still. We'll get someone for you.\" Reg came lumbering up, his face thunderous, fists at half-cock. \"What the bloody hell--\" Alex cut the bodyguard off with an upraised hand. \"Colin's injured himself dancing. Will you go and see if you can find a doctor for him?\"[Chapter 3] A/N: All the things Chris mentions actually happened at the 2006 R&R; Hall of Fame induction ceremony (except for the ones related to PoP, of course). Blondie refused to let two former members play, the Sex Pistols didn't show up but sent an envoy with a very rude message, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, a band with a troubled, tragic history, really did have a remarkably calm evening. Lyrics to \"Wonderful Tonight\" written by Eric Clapton. Warnings for strong language and adult situations. Chapter Three: Back-up Half an hour later, a sweating, cursing Colin had been helped to an ambulance, followed by several members of his entourage. A scowling Reg covered his exit, fending off several avid members of the press, who had to content themselves with snapping photos of the injured superstar. \"It's been one hell of an evening,\" Chris remarked, materializing beside Alex in the corridor outside the ballroom. \"Blondie snubbing two of its former members, the Sex Pistols blowing off the ceremony, and now Colin getting hurt. You couldn't make something like this up!\" Alex ran a distracted hand through his hair. \"After tonight, I'm starting to think we should rename our signature hit 'Pop Goes My Hip.'\" \"How's your hip, by the way?\" Alex rotated the joint experimentally. \"Fine, as far as I can tell. But then, I was safely behind my keyboard, not jumping about the stage like a maniac. Speaking of which, who's up now?\" \"Lynyrd Skynyrd. Can't you hear them?\" Alex paused. Sure enough, the strains of \"Sweet Home Alabama\" were beginning to drift from the ballroom. \"They're about the only band who hasn't had some sort of difficulty tonight,\" Chris reported. \"Given their history, I'd say they've earned a calm evening.\" Alex felt an unexpected rush of gratitude for PoP's relatively minor problems. So, fifteen years ago Colin had dumped them and they'd fallen apart in the aftermath. But at least they were all still here. \"Alex!\" He looked up to see Sophie hurrying towards him, her brown eyes wide and anxious. \"Baby, are you okay?\" \"I'm fine, darling.\" He reached out to draw her close. \"Colin's the one who was injured.\" She put her arms around him in turn. \"Yeah, but it must've been pretty upsetting for you, seeing him go down like that.\" \"A little, yes,\" he admitted. \"There but for the grace of God and orthopedics go I. Well, they should be able to look after him in hospital.\" Chris glanced at his watch. \"I'd better get back to my date. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay back here.\" \"Everything's under control,\" Alex assured him. \"Now, go and have a lovely time with the good doctor.\" \"I will, thanks.\" Chris laid a hand briefly on Alex's shoulder before turning to go. \"Great show, by the way. You were terrific tonight.\" \"He's right, you know,\" Sophie said, when they were alone together. \"You were amazing-your speech and your performance.\" She touched his cheek. \"I'm so proud of you.\" Her praise warmed him. but he felt obliged to point out, \"It was the band, really. Everything just came together-at least until the last few seconds.\" He leaned his forehead against hers for a moment. \"My God, what a nightmare.\" \"It could have been a lot worse,\" she consoled. \"It would have been, if the rest of you hadn't kept your heads. I don't think anyone really caught on until you had to practically carry Colin off the stage.\" \"Well, it's bound to be in all the papers tomorrow,\" a new voice observed, from behind them. \"Right along with the Sex Pistols not showing up.\" Startled, Alex and Sophie turned to find Andrew had joined them in the corridor; he gave a wry smile. \"Just came from the press room-they asked about Colin, mostly. Thought I'd clear out and let 'em go chase his ambulance or try phoning his hospital room instead.\" \"Very wise,\" Alex agreed. \"So I reckon the evening's just about winding down,\" the guitarist remarked. \"Why don't we round up the others, stow the instruments somewhere, and go out to dinner? Alex, mate, you probably know some decent restaurants in the area.\" Alex glanced at Sophie, who gave a small nod of consent. \"Right. Everyone okay with Italian?\" he asked. -xxx- Firenze, one of Alex's favorite restaurants, managed the rare feat of being upscale without being pretentious. Even better, its atmosphere still retained some intimacy, possibly because the place was new enough not to have shown up on everyone's radar just yet. And there was just something inherently comforting and convivial about Italian food, Alex reflected, watching his bandmates and their partners give their orders and relax visibly around the table. They were about halfway through the antipasti course, when Nick suddenly asked, \"Should we have gone to hospital, with Colin?\" Eight forks paused in mid-air, and an uncomfortable silence reigned for several moments. Then Andrew shook his head. \"Don't think we were needed. That bodyguard of his went with him.\" \"That's right,\" Dan agreed with obvious relief. \"Colin's got staff.\" \"As opposed to mates,\" Maggie said, a little tartly. Silence descended over the table again, to be broken again by Nick. \"They'll probably keep him overnight at least. Why don't we all chip in and send him a wreath or something for his room?\" \"Something loud, garish, and slightly inappropriate? He'll love it,\" Alex predicted. \"Any idea what's wrong with him?\" Dan asked, helping himself to more bread. \"Couldn't see much from where I was sitting.\" \"From the looks of it, he might need a hip replacement.\" Sarah gave her husband a pointed look. Andrew grimaced. \"I had to have one of those myself, last year. Tricky things, hips-you never know when they'll give out on you.\" \"I had one two years ago,\" Nick confessed. They exchanged a glance of commiseration. \"Wouldn't go through that again if you paid me,\" Andrew went on. \"The surgery, then the therapy after. And I'm three inches shorter than I used to be.\" Alex raised skeptical brows, and made a point of examining the guitarist's long legs. \"Lifts in my shoes, mate,\" Andrew said, without missing a beat. \"How's yours holding up?\" \"Fine. And that's the second time someone's asked me tonight.\" \"So far, only you and Dan have escaped PoP hip syndrome. And Dan's only managed because he couldn't dance for shit.\" \"Still can't,\" Dan reported without rancor. \"Just ask Maggie.\" His wife flicked him an affectionate glance. \"Still hopeless. But having two left feet might not be such a bad thing, after all.\" \"I suppose mine's held up through constant practice,\" Alex admitted. \"Not that I don't feel the odd twinge sometimes. But so far, so good.\" He smiled at Sophie, sitting on his other side. \"Of course, it helps having someone round to look after you, now and then.\" Andrew stifled a yawn. \"Speaking of which, what time is it in the Caymans? We really should call Colin's latest dolly bird and let her know what's happened.\" \"Who, Pandora?\" Dan asked. \"No, he broke up with her months ago. This one's a supermodel, Eden-she's off on a photo shoot.\" Dan looked at his watch. \"Bit late now-she's probably in bed. Why don't we call her tomorrow?\" \"It is tomorrow, technically speaking, but I reckon you're right.\" The entrees came then, and when they resumed the conversation, Colin was no longer the main topic of conversation, much to Alex's relief. There was so much else to talk about-Dan and Maggie's family, now consisting of twin girls as well as the boy she'd had six months after PoP disbanded, Andrew and Sarah's marriage, Nick's involvement in the San Francisco music scene, and, of course, Alex's new association-personal and professional-with Sophie. Relaxed and relieved by the way the evening was going, he never suspected a thing when Paul left the table to make a phone call \"to someone back home\" and the women all went to the powder room a few seconds later . . . -xxx- \"So I've barely heard of PoP and I'm certainly not the starfucker type, then one day, this lanky bloke in a beat-up leather jacket comes into my shop to buy flowers for his mum. Two days later he comes back to ask me out-eventually I said yes,\" Sarah finished, to a chorus of laughter. \"What about you and Alex, Sophie?\" Maggie asked. \"How did you meet?\" Sophie checked her lipstick in the mirror of the ladies' lounge. \"Well, it was kind of indirect. I've got this friend, Jane, who takes care of people's plants. She had to go away for a few days, so she asked me to fill in for her. So I happened to be watering Alex's plants while he was trying to write this new song, and I got drawn into that instead. Turns out I'm better with lyrics than plants,\" she added, smiling. \"Alex wrote another song claiming I'd killed all of his.\" \"And you still hooked up with him?\" Sarah shook her head in mock astonishment. \"Amazing.\" \"Well, it's plain to see you're happy together,\" Maggie declared, taking out a comb to tidy her short, dark hair. \"I'm so glad-I've always felt a bit like a big sister towards Alex. And Nick as well. They were the babies of the band.\" Sophie blinked, trying to reconcile that idea with the reality of the Alex she knew. On further reflection, it wasn't too hard to believe he'd been one of PoP's younger members. \"Did you-feel sisterly towards Colin too?\" she ventured. \"Sometimes. All right-more often than that,\" Maggie amended. \"The truth is, I was fond of all of them. Which was why I was so disappointed in Colin-not just for what he did, but the way he did it. And how he treated the others.\" She set down her comb, her pleasant face hardening. \"I said before he left them in a lurch. I should have said he left them in the shit.\" Sophie raised her brows, noticing that Sarah also looked surprised. \"Just how bad was it?\" \"Bad enough. He walked out on them,\" Maggie said simply. \"Just shrugged them all off like an old jumper, without a word of thanks. Or even a proper goodbye-after ten years together.\" \"Wow.\" Maggie's account was dramatically different from what Sophie had envisioned, but in its own way, it was just as shocking. And it explained the chill in today's rehearsal. \"That's pretty cold.\" \" I thought so. And Dan too, though he wasn't half as close to Colin as-some of the others were.\" Sophie took a breath. \"You mean Alex.\" \"Dan worried about him. I think they all did. He and Colin had been best mates, or so everyone believed. But Alex was as surprised as anyone by what happened. Shocked, really.\" Shocked and devastated, Sophie thought. She remembered the keyboard player with his guileless smile and felt a rush of protective anger on behalf of the man he'd become. \"Andrew told me some of what happened, when we got together,\" Sarah remarked. \"He hasn't had much good to say of Colin, then or now.\" \"Dan hasn't been too pleased with him, either.\" Maggie put away her comb. \"Well, I try not to go about wishing harm on others, but looking at it a certain way, one could say that Colin got a bit of a come-uppance tonight.\" Karma, Sophie thought. Or more accurately, payback, though neither Alex nor the other members of PoP had had anything to do with Colin's accident. Sarah replaced her compact in her purse. \"Sophie, I was wondering. That smaller room we passed-the one just off the main dining room-was there really a fountain in it? And a flowerbed?\" \"Um, yeah. Firenze has this kind of small dining parlor you can reserve for special occasions.\" Alex had actually done so on their first date as an official couple. \"I don't think it's being used right now. It is pretty late.\" \"You don't think anyone would mind if we just stopped and had a closer look? There's no need for us to hurry back. Our chaps need some band time-Andrew and Dan were talking about it on the plane. They thought we were sleeping,\" she added to Maggie, who looked as surprised as Sophie felt. \"And,\" she looked directly at Sophie now, \"they want to have a word or two with your lad.\" Sophie felt a twinge of alarm. \"Alex isn't in some kind of trouble with them, is he?\" \"Not in the way you think,\" Sarah assured her. \"But from the sound of it, this has been a long time coming. I suspect Paul's been told to keep away too. Don't worry-we can keep an eye on them from a safe distance.\" \"Okay, but if anyone starts crying or bleeding, I'm going out there,\" Sophie declared roundly. Alex might be more than ten years her senior, but he needed her as much as she needed him, and she wasn't about to let anyone damage him. Sarah smiled at her. \"Of course, love. We'd do exactly the same.\" -xxx- \"So how have you been, then?\" Alex swallowed a yawn, fought off a wave of post-prandial drowsiness. \"Told you, Andrew, the hip's fine.\" \"Wasn't talking about your hip.\" Some change in his bandmate's voice cut right through Alex's fatigue, and he sat up a little straighter. \"Heard you had a rough go of it after Colin did his flit,\" the guitarist added. \"Yes, well . . .\" Fully awake now, Alex looked away, embarrassed as he always was to recall that period in his life. \"I went through something of a bad patch, but I got past it.\" \"A bad patch.\" Dan's mild face was suddenly stern. \"Interesting way of putting it.\" Alex blinked at him. \"Sorry?\" \"Sat in on a session a few years back with a mutual acquaintance,\" Dan went on. \"Nigel Trent, drummer for Soho Fields. Said you did a stint with him in rehab.\" Oh, Christ. Busted . Alex felt his throat close up, whether in response to the drummer's words or his own memories he could not tell. After too many nights of finding him passed out with a bottle or a vial of pills, Chris had insisted that he clean up his act. \" Keep on like this, and you're gonna end up another rock and roll statistic ,\" his manager had said, his expression as stern and uncompromising as Dan's was now. \"I'm not gonna stand by and let that happen.\" Chris had been the one to find the clinic: a small, private one with a reputation for results and discretion. Alex had had cause to be grateful for both. But he hadn't been the only musician in residence, or the one with the most serious problems; Trent had gone there to kick a cocaine and heroin habit that had nearly killed him. They'd talked from time to time; it had never occurred to Alex that the news of their joint stay would ever get back to anyone. More fool he. Andrew's voice, unusually harsh, broke into his thoughts. \"Why the fuck didn't you tell us things were that bad?\" This was the way they'd worked sometimes, Alex remembered with painful clarity, Dan and Andrew, good cop and bad cop . Dan was the older brother who'd bail you out of jail at two in the morning, Andrew was the one who'd kick your arse when you got home. \"Wasn't there that long,\" he said at last, forcing words past the constriction in his throat. \"You shouldn't have had to be there at all! You could have called any one of us, mate. You should have.\" Alex shrugged, still avoiding the guitarist's gaze. \"Not fit company for anyone.\" Andrew's cuff caught him squarely on the back of the head. Startled, he glanced up to find all three of his former bandmates staring at him with stony disapproval. \"Prat,\" Andrew said succinctly. Alex resisted the urge to rub his head, feeling twenty-two again. \"You were all moving on, making your own plans,\" he argued. \"You didn't need me ringing you up and whinging about how pathetic my life was.\" \"You always did have more pride than sense,\" Dan remarked. \"At the time, I felt it was all I had left.\" Alex winced inwardly at the curt, clipped sound of his words. That bloody public school accent seemed to emerge whenever he was feeling most defensive. It had always got short shrift from his friends-and what were Andrew, Nick, and Dan, if not that? \"Take the poker out of your arse, mate,\" Andrew said, unimpressed. \"Know better now?\" \"Yes,\" Alex said on a sigh. \"I suppose I do.\" \"It was the songs, wasn't it?\" Andrew said, after a moment. \"The ones Colin nicked-that's why you bolted, all those years ago.\" Alex stared at him. \"I-didn't realize you knew.\" \"We didn't, at first. You fucking disappeared. We couldn't reach you at your flat, your mum couldn't tell us where you were. We didn't know if you were secretly in cahoots with Colin, or had your own solo career planned. But when you didn't resurface, with or without Colin-\" \"And they didn't fish your body out of the Thames,\" Dan interposed. \"We wondered if you'd decided to chuck it all and go live in a commune on the other side of the world. And then about two months later I heard it on the radio-the first single off Colin's new album.\" Andrew paused. \"That guitar solo in the middle-you said you wrote it for me. And there was a second song you'd played for us, remember? So I bought Colin's solo album, had the others in to listen.\" Andrew glanced at Nick and Dan. \"They recognized it too, even though he didn't give you so much as a credit in the liner notes.\" Nick nodded. \"We'd have spoken up for you, Alex, if you'd decided to take it to court.\" Alex exhaled shakily. \"Couldn't have proved anything. He took it all-notes, demo, everything.\" Memory washed over him again-thick, swamping, and bitter as gall. Colin stopping by his flat one evening with a briefcase full of sheet music, some talk about doing a few classic covers on their next album. \"Alex, mate, could you get me a beer?\" And then, later, when he'd gone to look for the file containing the pages on which they'd written their last three songs, and the rough demo he'd put together . . . When the truth had finally sunk in, he'd gone out and got thoroughly drunk for the first time in several years. The next day, head still pounding from a massive hangover, he'd caught a one-way flight to New York and never looked back. A hard grip on his shoulder recalled him to the present. He looked into Andrew's eyes, saw anger there but understanding as well. \"Look, Alex-no one blames you for freaking out about Colin. You were his best mate, and he fucked you over good and proper. But you weren't the only one. Just the one who took it the hardest.\" Startled afresh, Alex stared at his former bandmates; Nick's fair complexion gave him away within seconds. \"Good God, you?\" \"Lost my flat,\" the bassist admitted. \"What?\" Alex's voice came out louder than he'd intended, and a few diners at a neighboring table glanced over at them. \"Bought a new ax while I was on holiday after our last tour. Cost an arm and a leg, but it was worth it. A Fender Precision Bass Deluxe.\" Nick's voice lingered lovingly over each word. \"When we broke up, I couldn't make the rent.\" He shrugged. \"Moved in with Andrew for a while. Lost the flat, but I wasn't losing the bass.\" Musicians. We're all insane , Alex thought, putting his head in his hands. \"Nick, I had no idea. I'm sorry.\" The bassist gave him a crooked smile. \"Got through it, with a little help from my friends. I even got a bit of session work to tide me over.\" \"We'd have done the same for you,\" Dan said. \"If you'd just let us know.\" \"Too right we would. We still would.\" Andrew met Alex's gaze steadily. \"All you ever had to do was ask.\" Alex's throat was tight again, this time for a different reason. All those years ago, there'd been a support system he hadn't known about. Had been too proud-and too afraid, he admitted to himself-to draw upon. After Colin's betrayal, his ability to trust had been nonexistent. \"But,\" he began, feeling his way through the potential minefield, \"you voted to end the band, all of you.\" \"That was just after Colin dropped his bombshell,\" Dan pointed out. \"We were all pretty bruised at the time. It's easy to say let's hang it up when you're feeling low. I do remember Andrew suggesting we try meeting up again in a month, see if we still felt the same way.\" \"And a month later you'd gone off to parts unknown, so there seemed no reason not to make the break-up official,\" Andrew said, with less rancor than Alex had expected; he sighed. \"Reckon we all gave up a little too easily back then-on the band, and on each other. Not about to make that mistake again. I'd hoped,\" and for the first time, the confident guitarist sounded just a bit tentative, \"I'd hoped you lot might feel the same.\" The door was open, Alex realized. Not for PoP to re-form or go on some overhyped reunion tour-they'd all grown past that, even him-but . . . they could be part of each other's lives again. Visiting each other's homes now and then, sharing news and advice, and talking about music, the thing that had bound them together for ten years. \"Keep in touch, you mean?\" He kept his tone deliberately casual. \"I'd like that.\" Across the table, Nick murmured some kind of assent as well. \"Maybe we could even get together for a proper jam session, next time you're in New York.\" \"Or when you come to London?\" Dan suggested. \"We could put you up in our spare room.\" \"Or ours,\" Andrew added. He flicked Alex the edge of a grin. \"Bring your bird with you-we'll be sure to knock first, even Sam.\" Alex didn't know whether to laugh or groan at the image that rose in his mind-of a miniature Andrew, complete with sunglasses and leather jacket, hanging about outside his bedroom. \"Very considerate of you, thanks.\" \"You should all come to San Francisco,\" Nick said. \"Weather's a treat most of the time, and there's just enough fog to keep you lot from getting homesick.\" \"Why don't we ask the ladies what they think?\" Dan said, leaning back in his chair. Following the line of the drummer's gaze, Alex saw the women were coming back at last. Sophie was slightly in the lead, her \"worried eyes\" visible even from several feet away. He sent her a reassuring smile. \"Yes, why don't we?\" he agreed, sitting back in turn. -xxx- At some point during the cab ride back to their apartment building, Alex began to sing. Not loudly or raucously but continually: sentimental snatches of PoP songs first, then bits from older standards that Sophie did not always recognize. He was in the middle of something that might have been Eric Clapton when they finally got off the elevator. \" And then she asks me, 'Do you feel all right? And I say, 'Yes, I feel wonderful tonight . . .'\" \"You may not feel all that wonderful tomorrow,\" Sophie warned, opening the apartment door. \"In fact, you might want to have some aspirin or antacids handy when you wake up.\" Alex made his none-too-steady way inside. \"Are you suggesting that I'm somewhat the worse for drink?\" Taking his elbow, she guided him towards the sofa. \"I hate to say this, but the phrase 'three sheets to the wind' is coming to mind.\" \"I resent that implication. I am most assuredly not three sheets to the wind.\" He sank down on the sofa and closed his eyes. \"One and a half, perhaps.\" Sophie shook her head and sat down beside him. On closer inspection, she thought his present haziness was less attributable to alcohol than to weariness and nostalgia. \"Can I get you anything?\" \"No-thank you. Just stay with me a while, okay?\" She toed off her shoes and tucked her legs beneath her, settling in. \"I'm not going anywhere.\" \"Thank you.\" He rested his head against the back of the sofa. \"Not just for staying, but for all your support tonight.\" Sophie reached out, lightly stroked his hair. \"Did you enjoy yourself, at the ceremony?\" \"Yes. Yes, I did-surprisingly.\" His mouth softened into a smile. \"The music was the best part, of course.\" Sophie smiled as well, remembering his obvious pleasure. \"You looked really into it, at rehearsal. And in performance too.\" \"I'd forgotten how much fun it could be, playing with them all.\" \"Even Colin?\" \"Even Colin.\" He was silent for a moment. \"I wasn't expecting that.\" \"Well, it's like you said-you were a band, a unit. And no matter what happened between you and Colin, he was a big part of that.\" Sophie rubbed his shoulder. \"I enjoyed meeting the other members of PoP.\" \"Did you?\" She nodded. \"And I liked them all. Well, okay, with one notable exception, but then Colin liked himself enough for both of us, so it didn't really matter.\" Alex stared at her, then, as her meaning sank in, began to laugh. \"Oh, God,\" he managed at last, \"I haven't seen a woman give Colin the brush-off like that in years. Priceless, love.\" \"I wasn't leaving with anyone but the man who brought me,\" Sophie retorted. \"So even if I'd liked Colin . . . wasn't going to happen.\" She paused, studying him thoughtfully. \"Maggie told me a little-about how PoP broke up.\" \"Did she?\" Sophie nodded. \"I was kind of surprised. I mean, I'd imagined there was this big, you know, blow-up with everyone yelling at each other and Colin storming out.\" \"No, no-not at all. It might've been better if there had been. Cleared the air, in a 'Piss off, bastard, I'm better off without you' sort of way.\" He lapsed into silence, staring into the past. \"We'd come back from our latest tour, everyone had gone off on separate holidays-three days later, Colin's in all the papers, talking about leaving PoP and starting a new career as a soloist. He let his manager do the dirty work, tie up the loose ends. It was all rather bloodless, actually.\" Sophie suspected Alex had bled plenty, but she stayed quiet, letting him talk. \"Caught every one of us flat-footed. I don't think it hit me until two weeks later when I found out he'd taken the songs, the same ones we'd been writing on tour. I remember telling him I was looking forward to working on them after our break.\" His mouth twisted. \"Damned stupid of me, not to guess what he was up to.\" If Colin's defection had been a kick in the teeth, his calculated appropriation of those songs was a knife in the gut, Sophie realized. \"You trusted him.\" She laid her hand on Alex's shoulder. \"You loved him.\" For a moment she thought he'd deny it, then he looked at her, his eyes clear and stark. \"Like a brother, for more than ten years. And then-I hated him for nearly that long. And then, for the last five years or so, I've tried not to think of him at all, except as someone I used to work with.\" He exhaled. \"I don't know what makes someone go from being a decent bloke to a bastard who'd stab you in the back first chance he got. Don't suppose it matters, really. Colin's made his choice-and so have the rest of us.\" They'd chosen to go on being decent, Sophie thought with a fierce little tug of pride. I would never in a million years use someone else's work , Alex had told her, not long after they'd met. And he'd held true to that. Colin might be the bigger star, but there was no question in Sophie's mind about who was the better man. \"Turns out they knew about the songs,\" Alex went on. \"They put it all together after Colin's solo album came out.\" He took a breath. \"And they told me they'd have been there for me-if I'd only let them.\" \"You've got them back,\" she said softly. \"Andrew, Nick, and Dan-they still care about you.\" \"So I've been reminded-rather forcibly, by Andrew.\" Alex gingerly felt the back of his head. \"He hasn't lost his touch over the years. And I learned something else as well. If I'd been the one injured tonight, and you or Chris hadn't been on the scene, I know at least one of my bandmates would've come with me to hospital. No one even offered to go with Colin.\" \"He's got that bodyguard, Reg,\" Sophie pointed out. \"But, then, that would be just a job to him,\" she added, remembering Maggie's comment about Colin having staff rather than mates. Alex nodded. \"That's it, exactly. As far as PoP goes, Colin's burned all his bridges. And I didn't see any of his current back-up group at the ceremony, either-cheering him on.\" He paused, frowning slightly. \"You know, I don't think I realized until tonight how isolated he is. How isolated he's made himself. Bit sad, really-though I doubt he spends much time crying over it.\" \"Does that mean you forgive him?\" \"I don't know that forgiveness enters into it. But I don't need to resent him anymore-not when I have so many good things in my own life now. Love, for one.\" He touched her hair in a fleeting caress. \"A new hit song, for another. Standing invitations to visit London and San Francisco-\" \"And two hips in working order,\" she finished for him. He chuckled, a little shamefacedly. \"Right-I've got a little confession to make. When Colin's hip went out onstage . . . I'm not proud of this, but for a few seconds I thought I was going to disgrace myself by laughing hysterically.\" \"Under the circumstances, I think anyone could be excused for experiencing a little schadenfreude .\" She studied him again, relieved by how relaxed and at peace with himself he seemed. \"Alex, would you go back-if you could?\" \"I might have said yes, at one time,\" he replied, after a moment. \"But now . . . well, we have new songs to write. And I'm looking forward to every one of them.\" Sophie smiled. \"Let's go to bed. It's been a long night, and you should really get some sleep.\" \"Sleep.\" His eyes took on a speculative gleam. \"We could do that-eventually.\" \"Alex-\" \"I haven't finished my song yet,\" he informed her with the careful dignity of the not-entirely-sober. \"And the lyrics are very apposite, I'll have you know. You'd approve.\" Sophie rolled her eyes as she stood up. \"Whatever you say, babe.\" \" It's time to go home now, and I've got an aching head-\" \"I'm not surprised.\" She offered him a hand up from the sofa. He took it, climbing to his feet. \"So I give her my car keys, and she helps me to bed-\" \"So you can sleep, remember?\" she reminded him, though she strongly suspected she was about to lose this argument. Alex only smiled, draping an arm over her shoulders and steering them both towards the bedroom. \"And then I tell her as I turn out the light, I say, 'My darling, you were wonderful tonight. \" Closing the door behind them, he drew her to him, tilted her face upwards for his kiss . \" Oh, my darling, you were wonderful tonight . . .'\" END ","Summary":" A/N: After seeing the film, I was almost immediately overtaken by the urge to write a story inspire"},{"Movie":"Were the World Mine","Title":"I Watch You","Author":"ArwenJaneLilyLyra","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6086679","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A short poem based on Timothy and Jonathan before A Midsummer Night's Dream came along...

I loved 'Were the World Mine' and rewatch it whenever I get the chance. This comes from that final goodbye combined with The song before the play. Enjoy… The Pucks A single moment in time and their lives were changed forever. Timothy and Jon had both been accepted to Boston College and they were attending the three day orientation to the College. On the Second day a friendly girl by the name of Jessica, a Bostonian born and bred, offered to give them a tour of the city including a picnic on the Common. Nearing midday they approached the Common and Jon stopped for a moment to ask Jessica about a statue in front of one of the business offices. Timothy, caught in a daydream, crossed the road with all the surety of a country child. Jessica caught sight of him first when the blaring horn caused her to look up, she screamed and Jon whipped around to catch sight of his boyfriend staring with terrified eyes at the bumper of an oncoming minivan fifteen feet away. Later Jon would not remember moving but he wrapped his arms around Timothy just as the van plowed into them both. The sharpness of the pain drove him into blackness, but while most of him hoped dearly for Timothy's survival there was a small part that hoped that if his boyfriend of four months died then Jon wouldn't survive either. When Jon opened his eyes again the white room around him was hazy at the edges, he was standing in one corner and there was figure in a white hospital bed in front of him. He quickly realized that the he was the figure. Timothy stood next to the bed dressed like he had for the play four months before, with the exception that his Puck length hair was black and his glittering wings were real. Ms. Tebbet stood with him her own fairy get-up matching Timothy's. They stood there for what felt like an age before Ms. Tebbet spoke gently, \"It's time to fly, Gwydyon\" \"My name is Timothy, mother\" Timothy answered evenly, not moving. \"You know that I made my choice already. I chose Jon and will again if necessary.\" Jon watched frustration flash across Ms. Tebbet's face, \"So you would forsake your family for a mortal.\" Timothy looked back at his mother over his winged shoulder, \"Did you not do the same, mother? Were you not the one to teach me of the curse that all Pucks must endure?\" Anger and sorrow darkened Ms. Tebbet's face, \"I have made my mistakes, my son and I admit to them. You'll forgive me if I try to guide you from the follies and heartbreak that follow this path.\" Timothy turned backed to the figure on the bed, running a careful hand along the side of the bed-ridden figure's face. Jon felt the ghostly touch of his fingers and warmth expanded in his chest, \"It is much too late for that mother. I have found my one.\" He glanced at Ms. Tebbet again, \"Surely you of all people won't deny me my one.\" \"You were more than willing to say goodbye once.\" Ms. Tebbet reminded and that brought Jon up short. What did she mean, say good bye? Where was he going? \"I thought Jon wouldn't want me without the pansy's magic, as I'm sure you remember, mother. Once I knew he did choosing him over anything became easy.\"Timothy looked lovingly back at the figure in the bed. Ms. Tebbet placed a delicate hand right between Timothy's translucent wings. \"Is that fair to him?\" she asked with deliberate cruelty underlying her concern. Jon watched Timothy still and his heart dropped at the look on his face. \"To be bound to you without understanding what that means? To give up any chance of the life he was due without the burden of you love.\" Timothy's wings drooped and a look of quiet devastation overtook his features, \"Mother…\" \"You gave him a gift beyond measure, my son, to have pulled him from the darkness of his doubt. Away from the prejudices that surrounded him you gave him the potential for true happiness. Now you need to give him the chance to find his light.\" Timothy's shoulder slumped further, something she had said had obviously had struck a chord. \"Better now with a clean break, then later. I know this from experience.\" Timothy's entire posture screamed dejected, \"Yes, mother\" He bent slightly and cupped his hand to the prostrate Jon's cheek. The warmth remained but sorrow and pain edged in underneath it. \"I will love you ever more, Jonathon Cordon, may I meet you in your dreams.\" He pressed a tender kiss into Jon's lips and breathed out a final, \"goodbye\" that froze Jon's insides. The fairy duo began to fade, Ms. Tebbet throwing a triumphant glance at Jon's corner as they went. The frozen lump within Jon shattered at the sight of his boyfriend fading away. He lunged with all of his might and grasped a single nearly invisible hand just before it vanished. He would follow his love, come what may. YAY FOR THE MAGIC PANSY In operating room 1 in a Boston hospital a nurse calls out above the din, \"we're losing him BP at 60 and dropping.\" A surgeon, observing the boy rather than his colleague, spoke \"Stay with us, Timothy.\" Another room in that same hospital, this one in recovery, is kicked into motion when the alarms sound. The young man in the bed who had been resting peacefully until this point suddenly seized up and convulsed his breathing stopped. The tear filled voice of his tour guide begged him, \"Come on Jonathon, don't give up. Timothy is going to need you.\" I SEE THEIR KNAVERY The next thing Jon knew he was standing in a wooded clearing unlike anything he had ever seen. The colors were truer than anything he had ever seen, the lightest scent of something magical was in the air. Jon was still holding onto Timothy's hand like the lifeline it was. He felt disconnected from himself, like he heart should be racing and it wasn't. Timothy didn't seem be aware of his presence at first, though Ms. Tebbet looked at him with calculating eyes. Slowly, though, the extra presence seemed to register as he looked up slowly to meet Jonathon's eyes. Jon sucked in a harsh breath at the absolute devastation in his boyfriend's dark orbs. Even Timothy's sudden intake of breath and his own whispered, \"Jon?\" couldn't rise more than a small smile from him. Jon felt his eyes tear up and his free hand moved up to rest against Timothy's clean shaven face. \"Please don't leave me.\" He couldn't help but beg, his words were choked with the fear that he would lose this man. Timothy didn't respond, seemingly frozen in surprise at the sight of Jon, but Ms. Tebbet's eyes glittered strangely. \"How did you find this place, little mortal?\" She asked. The sound of her voice seemed to shock Timothy out of his stupor because Jon suddenly found himself half hidden from view by translucent wings as Timothy moved in front of him protectively. \"You will not harm him.\" Timothy spoke sharply to their former drama teacher. Ms. Tebbet's smile grew sly, \"Oh, you have no reason to fear for the little mortal's life from me, son, I am simply curious how this mortal of yours found his way into the Grove when no other has done so before.\" Timothy didn't look convinced but allowed Jon move around him; when Jon reached out to clasp hands with his boyfriend Timothy responded by intertwining their fingers. Ms. Tebbet watched the action; a brief frown marred her face. \"I followed you\" he freely admitted, \"from that white room\" he looked up at his incredulous boyfriend, \"I can't just let you go, Timothy, I love you.\" Timothy bit his lip, looking down at their conjoined hands, fighting some inner struggle, \"Mother is right.\" He said finally, \"I can't ask you for the commitment necessary for me to remain.\" Jon noticed he couldn't seem to release his hand though. \"Shouldn't I decide if a commitment is worth it?\" He asked, \"It is, by the way.\" \"You don't even know what it would entail, what the consequences are.\" Timothy huffed out. Emboldened and soothed by the fact that Timothy was still holding his hand Jon looked calmly into those beloved eyes, \"Then explain it to me, if that's what it will take for you to believe me.\" Timothy still looked doubtful, \"I love you, that isn't going to change. I can't think of anything that could keep me from wanting to be with you.\" \"And if I said that you can never see any of the people you know again, that you would need to live somewhere completely foreign in order to stay with me.\" Timothy shot back. \"Lead the way,\" was Jon simple reply, this brought Timothy up short, \"I'll be honest I would be sad that I wouldn't see my family and friends again, and a little angry at whatever circumstances were forcing you to give me that kind of a choice but if that were the only way then I would take it.\" \"You're serious?\" Timothy asked with surprise widened eyes. Before he could answer Ms. Tebbet spoke, \"You might as well tell the little mortal, my son. The Bean Sidhe will allow it.\" There was a look that was exchanged between the two before Timothy sighed. He turned back to Jonathon. \"I'm not human, as you might have already guessed. I am Fey; a Fairy in its most literal sense\" Though his face was still solemn ironic amusement in his eyes. \"We're not a people made for short affairs. A fairy will give their heart once, fall in love only once and that love will never fade. You of all people know that mortals can be a bit more fickle. I thought I would get a few more years, enough time for you to lose interest and I would become like any other Fairy that loved a mortal. It would be a hollow existence but well worth it for the time we had together.\" The words struck through Jonathon, \"You thought I would lose interest?\" Hut beyond words was an understatement. The man couldn't even find it in him to be angry. \"I Love you, Timothy\" He tried to imbue the words with everything he felt; tried to make his boyfriend understand what he meant. The surrounding crowds tittered. Mrs. Tebbit smile condescendingly at him. \"Oh little mortal; silly little boy. Human aren't meant for forever, even my son knows that. He answered this summons did he not?\" The human in question glared, \"Just because you manipulated him into thinking he was hurting me doesn't mean…summons, what summons?\" He turned back to Timothy who had drooped when his mother spoke. \" All Fey that are not in an ongoing assignment are being recalled back to the Grove. It is come to my attention that too many are becoming too involved with their assignments, including your so called Timothy. It would be best for you to return to your body, you will of course forget being here. Your boyfriend will die in that car accident and all can move on. \" A slow voice echoed throughout clearing. The tittering stopped and looks of shock replaced it. Jonathon could hear whispers about this voice talking to him. He blinked but shrugged internally. \"I don't accept that.\" He shouted back, \"I will not let you take Timothy away from me.\" There was another shocked ripple through the crowd. Out of the corner of his eye he saw his boyfriend straighten up in mild shock. The human reached out a hand and tangled his fingers with his boyfriend's. In turn the fairy looked down at their conjoined hands like he'd never seen them before. \" You would challenge me for him, human? What would you give? \" The Voice still spoke slowly, as if the speaker was barely awake. Amusement now coated it though. \"What do you want?\" At his question the hand encircling his tightened. \"You can ask that!\" Timothy hissed at his side, \"Jon, you don't know what you're dealing with. I'm not worth it; not matter what he asks for.\" Jonathon turned to look at his panicked lover fully, \"There is nothing he can ask that I wouldn't pay.\" \" Truly, little human, and if I asked for your life? The lives of you family? If I asked you to kill? \" Than hand around his tightened \"are you?\" He asked calmly. The voice puffed a laugh, \" No little human. My price is your mortality and a test you must pass. \" \"Then I agree. What do you want me to do?\" Out of the corner of his eye he saw his lover grow paler. \"A Fey marriage? No\" he breathed. Jonathon squeezed his hand comfortingly. \" A rash decision little mortal, do you not wish to hear the consequences of this action. \" \"I suppose I should\" Jonathon agreed lightly. Inside he was soaring at the word marriage; his most secret dream the one he never even breathed of to Timothy was to be able to call him husband. \"Already having second thoughts, Little Mortal?\" Mrs. Tebbit asked snidely. \"No but I know Timothy. If I don't at least hear them then he'll believe I was tricked no matter what I say.\" The Fairy already carried far too much guilt over the whole pansy thing. No matter how positive the changes were. \"Jon this could kill you, or worse.\" \"So can jumping in front of a speeding car and I already did that.\" Timothy shook his head \"That's just physical. Even a moment of doubt on your part, just a sliver and the chaotic magic that will build up through the ceremony will tear you apart molecule by molecule.\" \"Doubt's not something I'll need to worry about.\" \"Maybe not consciously…\" \"No not at all. Think about it I leapt in front of a moving car, I followed you hear. Both of these things were on instinct, there was nothing conscious about the decisions. There is no doubt.\" Timothy closed his eyes for a moment, \"Even if it succeeds there will be consequences. Even among us immortals the Fey's Marriage is a legend. No one that still exists has seen one successfully completed. According to legend the best case scenario is that we will no longer by mortal or immortal, but bound by our own set of rule. This will steel half your life on Earth at best, and then bind us both to this realm until everyone who has ever met us passes past the veil. You will have to forsake any other romantic love, even if your soul mate walked up to you.\" Jonathon swallowed heavily. For a moment Mrs. Tebbit perked and Timothy drooped again, \"That's not possible\" he whispered brokenly, \"I've already met my soul mate and he's about to marry me; if he'll have me?\" \" Then you accept \" the voice boomed with authority. \"Are you sure?\" Timothy asked with a growing hope. \"I am not afraid.\" Jonathon responded, it was clearly the right answer as His husband to be lit up. YOU TOO CAN SEE A LINE IF YOU WANT Within the hour they stood facing each other the center of the clearing. It seemed like a full city's worth of people crowded around them or peered through the thick trees. Unlike a human wedding there was no person standing in front of them. Mrs. Tebbit had wrapped a braided cord of red, white and black around their wrist joining their hands then had retreated back to the crowd line. Without prompting their foreheads met between them. The entire ceremony consisted of a breathed 'I love you' form each of them into the magically charged atmosphere and then a single searing kiss. They were so caught up in each other that they never noticed the cords melting into their hands or the glow that almost obscured them. They separated reluctantly then Timothy flashed Jonathon a worried smile. \"What? Did something go wrong?\" Jonathon didn't feel like he had been torn apart. He actually felt like he wanted to move onto the honeymoon part of this ceremony. Timothy's smile turned a bit sly like he knew exactly what was going through Jonathon's head. \"No, it's just… no ones ever passed the test before.\" \"What's the test?\" No sooner than he asked did steel strong hands grabbed him and whipped him around. \"This\" Mrs. Tebbit cackled and held up a very familiar flower. Before Jonathon could react she had squirted the mist/pollen into his face and stepped aside. He blinked a few times to clear his eyes before setting his eyes on an unfamiliar fairy. The hands dropped away and he automatically turned to find his husband standing there looking worried. \"Are you alright, Timothy?\" He asked as he moved hesitantly closer, wary of the hands that could grab him at any second. There was another ripple through the crowd as Timothy moved faster than the eye could see to wrap him into an even more searing kiss than before. Though his head reeled with the passion, he couldn't help but wonder what caused it. \" You have truly earned my blessing beyond expectation. You are blessed young Puck to have found so true a match. \" \"Congratulations my sons\" Mrs. Tebbit called to them. Jonathon barely heard either of them since Timothy was still examining his tonsils and that was really the only important part as far as he was concerned. When they finally pulled apart Timothy looked at him with such adoration that Jonathon felt his heart skip a beat, then two. \"The only people who have ever been able to resist the magic of Cupid's flower were immortals who had found their true match. You must be the first mortal ever to have successfully combated it's powers.\" \"It's rare indeed to find what you both have, congratulations\" Mrs. Tebbit said smiling. \"Now it's time for you both to return. I will see you both for your training in your dreams.\" DO YOU SEE THE PRETTY LINES Jonathon came to full consciousness feeling like his eyelids were made of lead. His entire body ached and his limbs weren't more than useless lumps. The smell of medicine hit him just as his hearing came back and the beeps of machinery made themselves known. He groaned as he tried ineffectually to turn over. \"Jon…Jon, come on open your eyes for mom. Jake go get the nurse. I think he's waking up. Jon can you hear me?\" \"M'm, Wha' 'appene'…?\" he asked fuzzily. Memory slammed into him like a car and his eyes shot open, \"Tim\" he tried to shout and sit up. He struggled even as he failed. \"Where's Tim? Is he alright? Tim?\" He could distantly hear the heart monitor alarm and feel the hands holding him down. His panic overrode them. He couldn't lose Tim now. It took the nurses and Jon's family several minutes for him to calm down. Even then it was only the treat of sedatives and postponing finding out that got through to him. \"Jon, Timothy's in the ICU.\" She held up a hand to stall him, \"Just for observation, you both were pretty banged up in the accident. We almost lost you both several times.\" Happily Jon's parents and sister, despite being surprised about the guy thing, accepted Timothy pretty quickly into the family. They certainly reacted much better than Cole's mother had when she found out that he and Cooper were more than friends even without the Pansy's magic. The only thing that his parent truly cared about was that they stayed safe and happy. \"He'll be alright, right?\" Jon couldn't help but ask, even as a warm thread curled up under his mind signifying his husbands return to the waking world. He would ask later how he knew that. \"We'll ask Max when he gets back.\" Jon's father, Jake, promised. \"He's just checking on Frankie whose been sitting with her brother since its family only in the ICU.\" Just then Max burst in with a bright grin stretched across his face, \"He's awake\" he called into the room before he's even full come through the door. When he saw that Jon had woken up his smile seemed to widen almost impossibly. Despite their rocky beginnings Max and Jon struck up a firm friendship. It seemed that without a love potion making them think they were in love with the same person they had a great deal in common. That of course included their love for incredibly creative, dramatic people. \"When can I see him?\" Jon asked eagerly to the amusement of his family and friend. \"Their checking him out now. If they decide he's well enough to be moved into a room he'll be moved in here. I guess they even kicked Frankie out given how she was pacing the waiting room.\" Jon frowned doing a head-count as it occurred to him that someone was missing, \"only Frankie?\" For a moment his mother looked slightly angry before she covered it with a soothing smile. \"Donna couldn't make it, dear. She's asked that we call to keep her updated.\" In the wake of the Pansy many things had changed in their small town which became more open minded. However one of the things that hadn't changed was the strange gap that existed between Timothy and his mother. Not even Frankie or Max knew what caused it but supposed it had to do with the father that Timothy still denies he has. The fact that whatever it was kept Donna from coming had Jon feeling more than a little angry. He swallowed it down, but resolves to get to the bottom of this later. \"Ten buck says Nora will have her down here in a week.\" Finally his mother smiled, \"No bet.\" Nora Faye Ballinger, once she got past her own homophobia, took to plight of homosexuals like she did every other cause in her life; enthusiastically and with little regard to what anyone else thought. As far as she was concerned Jon and Timothy were the poster children for love concurring all and held them up as such. Considering her temperament it may actually be a good thing that they ended up being soul mates. Jon shuddered to think what the woman would have done if the ever broke up. Since she was still Donna's boss and she held Timothy in such high regard she had been trying the hardest out of all of them to bridge the divide between mother and son. It was one of her only failures. \"Don't be surprised if you're overrun by rugby players in the next few days\" Max warns. \"Coach Driscoll took up a collection and everyone's flying in.\" Jon blinked, \"How's that possible. I know that Cooper and Cole will e out of touch for at least 48 more hours and Russ's orientation is going until the end of the week.\" \"Honey\" Jon's mother said quietly, \"You've been in a coma for nearly two weeks.\" \"What? A coma\" how was that possible? The discussion, wedding, and congratulations couldn't have taken more than four hours. \"A few hours after they brought you in the lost Timothy twice on the table\" His father began with an unusual amount of hesitance. He was probably concerned of upsetting Jon since the nurses were afraid of a repeat from when he woke up. \"You began to seize and stopped breathing around the same time. It took them nearly a minute for them to get you stabilized. You've been in a coma since.\" \"A coma\" Jon whispered to himself. He will never forget the feeling of shattering ice in his chest when Timothy said his goodbyes. It was now hitting home that if he hadn't held on, if he hadn't fought with everything he had, he would have woken to a world where his beloved husband was dead. There was no question in his own mind that he wouldn't have survived long in that world. A loud commotion in the hall broke the awkward silence. \"That's the wrong room. He's supposed to be in that room.\" That was a very familiar voice. Max opened the door just in time to hear the faint answer from the orderly, \"Miss my orders are to put him in room eight. You are pointing at room six, so I was in fact putting him in the right room.\" \"You were ordered, by what the potted plant in the corner.\" Never let it be said that Frankie doesn't have a fine grasp on derision. \"Miss\" came the patient, if slightly irritated voice, \"his paperwork says room eight, now are you going to cooperate or are we going to have to have you removed.\" \"What paperwork? Give me that\" there was a rustle, \"it says room six you idiot.\" Max grinned at them all, \"and that's my cue to save the poor hospital worker from my girlfriend. Wish me luck\" \"You'll need it\" Jon heard his sister mutter. PRETTY, PRETTY LINE It was nearly a month before the two were released and got any privacy. The hospital didn't let them sleep deep enough to share dreams like Timothy was sure they would be capable of. The first night they were both back in Jon's bed, since Timothy had refused to go home to Donna, they dreamed they were sitting in a small hut in the wildwood. Timothy smiled nervously at Jon, \"This will be our home here.\" He said as Jon prowled through the two room cottage. \"It will grow as our control grows. Now let's sit. I believe I have some explaining to do.\" They sat on comfortable chairs near a warm hearth. Timothy stared pensively at it for several minutes, \"So, an explanation?\" Jon prompted. Timothy quirked a smile, \"Just trying to decide where to start, and don't say the beginning\" he said quickly before Jon could even open his mouth. \"I suppose I'll start with what I am, what we are.\" Jon's husband stared into the flames. \"I am a Fairy, one of the immortal Fey. More specifically I am of the Puck clan. Shakespeare got it wrong you know, he described Puck as a trickster; a kind of messenger/court jester to Oberon. Our clan is dedicated to bringing light to the darkness, shining love where there is hate. We use our trickery to bring justice to the mortal realm. The name I was given by my mother was Gwydyon, by the way.\" Jon was still a little confused, \"But then how?\" Timothy smile a sad smile, \"How did I end up going to Morgan Hill Prep under the name of Timothy? How did I convince Donna that she's my mother? How do I pass for human?\" \"Uh…yes, to all of it.\" Timothy sighed a heavy sigh \"The truth is you never met Timothy Cohen. He committed suicide the same night his father kicked him out. The same night his mother stood aside and watched as her only son was beaten, broken in some of the worst ways possible. He dragged himself, bruised and bloody to the nearest bridge and used the last of his strength to throw himself off. He was a local boy who no one cared was dead, save his two best friends. That is the injustice we fight, that horrible apathy. I took his place and we prepared to show that town what it means to walk in his shoes. As part of the disguise I bound my memories. I thought I was Timothy up until the night of the play. I remembered dragging myself to Frankie's instead of the bridge. I lived as if I was him but strong enough to survive not just that night but everything. Mother was there to guide me to the Pansy and I made sure to use it. Originally we were going to let the town implode, let the effect become permanent.\" Jon cleared his suddenly dry throat \"What changed?\" Timothy smiled, \"You for the most part. Even before the Pansy you acted kinder to me than anyone save my friends. You tried to play peacemaker and even more than with Frankie or Max I felt at home with you. So I changed the scheme made the effects a bit less permanent and we changed the town.\" \"And the night of the play?\" Jon whispered. \"Mother unlocked my memories while we lay in the woods, I needed to remember my duties you see. By then even mother wanted to set things to right. I thought you weren't going to want me after the magic was gone so I was prepared to vanish; Just another dead body in the river.\" Jon looked at his husband, \"You mean when I kissed you…\" \"It was the only thing that stopped me from vanishing.\" Jon couldn't help the feeling of awe. It quickly turned to other feelings when Timothy's smile took on a sly twist \"Now about that honey-moon?\" Taking his husbands hand Jon allowed himself to be lead to the bedroom. There would be time to talk later…much later. ","Summary":" This one has been waiting for me to finish it for almost a year.

Disclaimer: Any characters from Were the world mine belong to speak productions. I wish I owned them but sadly I do not *sad sighs* We've had been assholes. That's all I could think as I took off my make up. I couldn't get that thought out of my head. Timothy. What had we done? I know it's odd that THAT'S what I'm thinking about after everything that happened. The whole team, or at least the one's in the play going gay and finding such joy, me and Cole sleeping together, those things are on my mind but Timothy is too in a way. When we went gay we had support from the coach and each other. We had spent the whole after noon running into each other and telling each other how wonderful it was. But timothy had only gotten scorn from all of us. How many times had we called fag or fairy? Cole and I had been the worst. We had been assholes. Timothy had been so quiet so withdrawn why hadn't we left him alone? We had been lucky after we'd been sprayed. We had had people there, Timothy had been alone although it seemed that Jonathan still wanted him judging his running upstairs the minute he was done to talk to him. I finished taking off my costume, mind still whirling with everything. Although a tiny part of me was amused by the awkwardness now that everyone didn't seem to be in love anymore. I still felt guilt in my chest. \" Hey cooper.\" Cole's voice broke through my thoughts and I had to smile because Cole and I were the only two who didn't feel any awkwardness about what had happened. Yes we weren't sure what had happened but it didn't really make anything too awkward. Cole sat next to me. \"What's on your mind buddy?\" I ignored the pang at being called buddy, for some reason it was odd. I guess because of what had happened last night and all weekend. \"I was just thinking….about timothy\" I answered quietly Cole didn't say anything for a minute. I've known him since we were 6. I knew he felt slightly guilty too. \" He should come to the party tonight\" was all he said though. \"I mean it IS a cast party\" he added as I nodded. \" Yeah. I'll go ask him.\" I said standing \" Cooper?\" his voice made me pause and look back. He was staring at the floor but then looked up at me \"Are we..ok? I mean…what happened last night…\" he trailed off unsure of how to continue. I licked my lips \"I…I don't feel disgusted by it\" I said honestly Cole slowly nodded \"Ok…that's good enough…for now.\" I nodded as well and hurried out of the room to go to Timothy and Jonathan. Hopefully I wouldn't interrupt anything. I was hoping there was still time to fix what Timothy had gone through. The thing I couldn't quite figure out yet was how I felt about Cole or what happened between us. But Like Cole had said, this was good enough for now. ","Summary":" A/N: First WTWM fic!

Note:"},{"Movie":"Were the World Mine","Title":"Terms of Endearment","Author":"Mardahin","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5324369","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: Third in the fic series that emerged after I spent way too long driving around the Midwest after watching the film \"Were the World Mine\". This installment is roughly 9,000 words long, and many apologies for taking so long. I promised hllangel that I'd have something up before she starts classes on Monday, so here it is. This functions as something akin to a counterpoint to \"What's in a Name?\" Author's Note (II): Unlike Northwestern, Boston College's Rugby website sucks at providing useful information - we're talking levels approaching dead rat through a straw. As a result, I took some liberties. If you attend/attended BC and I've mucked things up when it comes to your ruggers, I do apologize. Also, I have it on good authority that the phrase \"Our drinking team has a rugby problem\" is one that is bandied about in the real world, and not just a bad joke. It wasn't the end of the world when Jonathon didn't make the starting line-up on the Eagles. He'd expected it, sort of. He was a freshman, and no matter how good he might be there was the whole paying-your-dues thing. He'd done that at Morgan Hill, he could do it again. Hard work, head down, all that jazz. Getting placed on the \"B\" Team (not a B side, they had enough players to allow for a full second-tier team), though, that stung. When the team breakdowns were posted, the coach told them that he'd re-assess over the winter break, and not before. Jon could understand, to a degree - the team took all-comers, as long as you were willing to work hard, and if the rosters were right there had been over eighty players who'd signed on for the 07-08 season. A second team, competing against D2 schools made sense, he just hadn't expected to land on it. Even as a freshman at Morgan Hill he'd made Varsity. When the team match schedules went up a few weeks later, he found he didn't mind being on the B team quite so much. While technically the A team represented the school, and was the only team representing the school on the rugby pitch, the coach set the B team up for scrimmages against regional D2 schools, more or less off the books. It was a win-win situation. The schedules went up while Jon was in the showers, which was an unexpected blessing because it meant that for once his towel didn't get soaked in the crossfire while fifty guys all tried to shower at once (it never worked, but that didn't keep them from trying). By the time he wandered out to get a look, all of the A team and half of the B team had cleared out of the central locker area, leaving a handful of his unfortunate compatriots getting dressed and talking quietly amongst themselves. He'd forgotten how much effort it took to make friends. First was the A team schedule, no surprise there. Dartmouth, Harvard, Northeastern, UConn - big names, a few of which had been on his application list, a few of which had very politely asked him to wait a few weeks. The surprise came when he lifted the page and found UMass Amherst at the top of the B team list. He quickly scanned the page, trying to confirm whether it would be home or away, finally discovering the key at the bottom of the list. \"Score!\" Not bothering to read through the rest of the season, Jon crossed back to his locker and dug around until he found his cell phone. His call went straight to Timothy's voicemail, and he remembered that it was a Tuesday, which meant Timothy was still in Freshman Composition. He waited through the familiar message, drumming his fingers against the side of his locker as he waited for the beep. \"Hey, bright eyes. Got some good news. Season starts in a few weeks, and the first match is against UMass Amherst. Looks like I'll be getting out to visit sooner than we thought. Call me when you get out of class, we'll work it out. And just in case you've forgotten, I still love you.\" Ending the call, Jon checked his watch and confirmed that it would be at least another hour until Timothy got out of class, and that was assuming that he'd taken his cell phone with him, otherwise it might be closer to two hours. Just enough time to grab something to eat and head back to his room and get started on his reading for Western Civ. He packed as he mentally adjusted his schedule and tried to remember what exactly it was he was supposed to be reading for Western Civ this week, anyway. His careful planning was interrupted by one of the guys who were hanging out at the far end of the row of lockers. \"Hey, Cordon. No cell phones in the locker room, man.\" Jon froze, because he'd completely forgotten, but they'd made sort of a big deal about it when he'd done orientation. \"Fuck.\" He turned to look at the guy, definitely an upperclassman, wondering just exactly how much trouble he was in. \"I am so sorry. I didn't-\" \"No sweat, kid. Everyone forgets once in a while, just don't make a habit of it. Coach sees you, he'll have you doing sprints into next year, and that's just for the warm up.\" Jon winced at that lovely image. \"Right. Um, thanks for the heads up.\" The upperclassman held out a hand. \"I'm Karl, this is Pete and that's James. You're on B Team, which means you're one of mine. Bad for my reputation if you get busted over nothing. Gotta save it for the times when it's really worth it, you know what I'm saying?\" \"I think I might have an idea.\" Jon shook his hand, and nodded to Pete and James who were leaning against the lockers and studying him thoughtfully. Karl nodded, as if something had just been settled. \"So, you've got a friend at UMass, I take it?\" Jon smiled, knew he probably looked like an idiot but couldn't really help it. Five months, and he still couldn't believe things had worked out the way they had. \"You could say that.\" \"So it's not just a friend. Old lady, maybe? Got a little woman who's still hanging in there from high school?\" Jonathon laughed at that, unable to help himself, and just laughed harder when Pete reached over and smacked Karl hard enough to bruise. \"Don't mind Karl, he likes to pretend he's all 'tough homeboy,' even though he's a legacy student. He's been out three years, and he's still rebelling against those nuns at Holy Cross. It was Jonathon, right?\" Jon nodded. \"Jonathon Cordon.\" \"How long you been playing?\" Pete crossed his arms across his chest, obviously taking over the conversation. \"Um, four years, give or take. I picked it up freshman year of high school.\" \"Let me guess, your team were division champs by the time you graduated? Or state champs, whatever it was for your school.\" Jon blinked at the unexpected, if accurate, presumption. \"Yeah, so?\" \"I thought so. You play like you're used to winning. Hell, from what I've seen, you probably should have made the A team, but Coach is old-school like that. Don't take it personally.\" \"I didn't plan to.\" Jon shifted, wincing as a bruise on his back made contact with the edge of his locker. That was the downside of rugby, and it could be a doozy. \"Look, guys, I appreciate the introductions. I'm sure you're all great guys, and I have every intention of wiping the floor with Umass and BU and whoever else was on that schedule. But right now, I've got a shitload of homework sitting in my dorm room that's not going to do itself, and a scholarship that requires me to actually do it. So, not to be rude, but is there a point to this?\" \"Fair enough. Just checking out the new talent, that's all. Hang around long enough, it starts to come with the territory.\" Karl pushed himself to his feet, leaning over to grab his own duffel bag. \"Can't fault a man for having his priorities in order. I'm going to go and hit the cafeteria while there's still something edible left. You have a good evening, Jonathon Cordon.\" Karl headed for the door, the other two trailing behind him, and it only took a moment for Jonathon to regret the sharpness of his words. Gathering up his bag and jacket, he slammed his locker and jogged after them. \"Hey, guys? Look, I didn't mean-\" James glanced back, expression amused. \"Don't worry about it. Karl's a psych major, although I'm pretty sure he's got a minor in guilt trips. Come on, we've always got room for one more. We'll tell you about the real meaning of B team.\" ^__^__^ By the time Timothy called back, two hours later, Jon's B-Team \"introduction\" had migrated from the cafeteria to a bar called the Crow's Nest a few blocks from campus where a B-Team alumnus happened to work. When Jon saw the name on the caller ID, he excused himself from the table they'd managed to commandeer and stepped outside into the Indian Summer evening and its relative quiet. \"Hey there.\" \"Hey, yourself. I just got your message. How soon is soon?\" \"How does two weeks sound?\" \"Way, way too fucking long.\" Jon chuckled, the sound rich and full. \"Better than four, though. God, I miss you.\" \"I miss you, too. How was class?\" \"Long, boring. Practice was just long and painful, so at least my life is symmetrical right now.\" \"You know, no one said you had to play rugby in college...\" \"Oh, give me a break. You know you like watching me play just as much as I like playing.\" As Jon expected, Timothy opted to change the subject rather than respond to the observation. \"So, I heard that Frankie and Max broke up.\" The door to the bar swung open, and Jon stepped out of the flow of human traffic. \"That was fast. Didn't they just get back together a few weeks ago?\" \"You know how those two are. Up and down, up and down. I give it a week.\" Jonathon was prevented from responding by a hand on his shoulder, and turned to find James. \"We wondered what had happened to you. Come back in, Karl just ordered a round of shots. And tell your girlfriend I said 'Hi'.\" James was gone before Jon could point out that no, he really didn't need a shot of anything that the unofficial team captain might have ordered for the table. On the other end of the line, Timothy had grown silent. \"Sorry about that, I-\" \"Jon, where are you?\" Jon sighed, because this was not something he'd wanted to talk about tonight, if at all. \"A place called the Crow's Nest, and yes, it's a bar.\" \"What the fuck, Jon? I thought you said you were cutting down on the drinking.\" \"Look, I meant what I said, I-\" \"You what? If it's rugby-related it doesn't count? Sorry, Jon. That one didn't work the first time you tried it. I know you think you know what you're doing, but-\" \"God, Timothy, could you give me two seconds to explain? Yes, I'm at a bar. Drinking a fucking Coke. A bunch of my teammates invited me out to explain some things. I'm not going to get myself arrested three weeks into school, so relax already.\" There was a long pause, and Jon sighed. \"Look, the drinking bothers you. I get it. That's why it's a coke and not something else.\" \"Fine. You say it's just a coke, it's just a coke. I'm just... I'm sorry. Look, it's been a long day. You go back into wherever, hang out with your friends. I'll see you online tonight, okay?\" \"Anything I can do?\" \"Not from a hundred miles away. Save it for the visit. I have a feeling we're both going to need it.\" \"Right.\" Jon swallowed hard, leaning back against the brick wall of the bar. \"Look, I love you. I'll talk to you soon, okay?\" \"Love you, too, Jon. Don't stay out too late.\" \"Night, mom.\" Jonathon ended the call, shifting his stance so that his shoulders settled more comfortably against the brick. He was still standing there twenty minutes later when James came out looking for him a second time. ^__^__^ \"Hey, Cordon!\" Jonathon turned, shifting his bag out of the way as one of the other players pushed past him and out the door. \"Yeah?\" \"Heard you got yourself a honey.\" Jon smiled, as much at the images the comment raised as at the comment itself. \"Something like that. Why, did you need me to set you up?\" \"I'm doing just fine on my own, rookie, don't you worry. I don't know if Karl told you, but on the B Team we have this tradition. First match of the season's always here, and then my parents host a BBQ afterward.\" \"Um, okay.\" \"It's a 'welcome to the team' kind of thing. Directions went out yesterday, but I never heard back so I thought I'd mention in.\" Jon reached up and ran a hand through his hair sheepishly. He and Tim hadn't exactly had a lot of time for the practicalities over the last twenty-four hours. \"Thanks, Eric. I appreciate-\" \"Anyway, what I meant to say was that if you've got a girl up here, you might as well bring her along.\" \"Look, I appreciate the offer, but we kind of already had plans for the evening.\" Eric wave off the protests. \"So you leave early, big deal. Things kick off around six. The email's got the landline for the house, just call if you get lost.\" Eric didn't bother waiting for Jon to respond, turning back to his previous conversation with one of the other upperclassmen. Jon was left floundering, finally giving up and just leaving to break the bad news to Timothy. He'd deal with the whole 'girlfriend' misunderstanding later. ^__^__^ \"I don't think this is such a good a idea.\" Jon rolled his eyes, but waited to respond until he'd shifted into third. \"You've said.\" \"Jonathon, I'm serious.\" \"I know. But this is important for me.\" Jon turned left onto a slightly-wider-than-two-lane road, and started watching for the numbers on the mailboxes. \"Look for 2717.\" \"It'll be on the right. I'm not saying don't hang out with these guys, it's just...\" Timothy sighed, looking out the window and watching the numbers slowly scroll up. \"Look, they don't know that you're gay. Maybe you should wait a little while until you break the news.\" Jon's grip on the gear shift tightened. \"What makes you think they don't know?\" \"Because when you called me from that bar, they called me your girlfriend.\" \"Maybe I didn't correct James then, that's true.\" He turned off the main road onto a driveway that was almost as wide, other cars visible closer to the house. \"Maybe I did want to wait a little while, just like you said. But they invited me to this, they let me on their team, and I'm not going to hide the fact that I'm in love with you.\" He parked, turning the car off and leaning over to press a gentle kiss to Timothy's lips. \"Hm.\" Jon loved the way his lover's eyes always slipped closed when they kissed, like it was something to be savored. \"Are you sure we can't just go back to the dorm? My roommate's gone until tomorrow night, and I'm sure it would be more interesting than a boring old rugby mixer.\" Jon laughed, reaching up to trail his fingers along the edge of Timothy's jaw. \"This won't last too long, don't worry. Nothing like one of Cooper's parties. We'll go in, we'll spend an hour being polite and score a free meal, and then we'll go back to your place and you can make good on that promise.\" Timothy sighed, catching Jon's hand and folding his fingers around it. \"Last chance. You really sure you want to out yourself this early in the season?\" Jon brushed a kiss against Timothy's knuckles. \"They'll get over it.\" Timothy's laugh was light on the humor, but he acceded the argument. \"Your call, they're your friends.\" Jon sighed, and released Timothy's hand in favor of unbuckling his seatbelt. \"I'll make you a deal. Come on in, make an attempt to get along, and we'll leave when you say so. Okay?\" Timothy leaned over, guiding Jon back into another kiss. \"Thank you.\" He took a deep breath and released it slowly. \"Right. Shall we?\" \"Definitely.\" Jon grinned, stepping out and stretching until his back cracked. Once Timothy had followed suit, albeit less enthusiastically, Jon placed a hand at his back and dragged him along to the door. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Timothy reconsidering his decision to give in quite so easily. \"Oh, for fuck's sake, his father teaches at Smith, okay? And I know full well that anyone who tries to beat you up is going to have a hell of a fight, so just relax already.\" Timothy's response was cut off by the appearance of Eric as the front door swung open. \"Cordon, man, you made it! Was beginning to think I was going to owe Karl that twenty bucks, after all.\" Jon grinned, because even a month into life on the B Team, Eric's habit of betting on the small and inconsequential had proven itself something resembling legendary. \"Your life is just one big tragedy in the making.\" Eric's look of long-suffering tolerance was quickly replaced by curiosity. \"My life is fucking awesome, thank you very much. I take it 'already have plans' blew you off?\" Jon swallowed hard, and glanced over at Timothy before responding. \"Actually, this is my 'already had plans'.\" He replaced his hand at the base of Timothy's spine. \"Eric, this is my boyfriend, Timothy. Timothy, Eric.\" Eric blinked for a moment, then extended a hand in greeting. \"Pleased to meet you. I have to admit, you're taller than I was expecting.\" Eric turned, leading the way back into the house. \"Everyone's out back, more or less. My brother Brian's taken over the grill - it's his thing, don't ask - so there should be meat and meat-like products up soon. Coolers by the side door have drinks, all kinds, just leave your keys in the bowl if you're hitting the booze. Most of the team's already out there, which reminds me - there's Icy-Hot, Aspirin, and Ibuprofen in the bathroom at the end of the hall. Ice is in the freezer, along with gelpaks. Snag anything you need, and give me a yell when you leave just in case the house burns down later.\" With that, Eric was gone, leaving a somewhat shell-shocked Timothy and Jonathon in his wake. \"Well, that was anticlimactic.\" Timothy gave a shaky laugh, leaning further into Jon's touch. \"Let's just say I've seen worse, but then, the night is hardly over.\" Jon also learned the hard way that there was a distinct downside to cutting down on his average alcohol consumption. After six months of sticking to pop (more or less) at the parties, his tolerance was not what it had been. By the time he was on his second glass of whatever was in the sketchy punch bowl (lighter fluid, maybe?), his memories fizzled and died rather spectacularly. The only thing he could remember distinctly was that they'd made an unexpected stop by the side of the road so he could clear the excess alcohol out of his system the old fashioned way. Timothy was, to put it bluntly, not amused. Jon woke up the next morning on the floor next to Timothy's bed, aching from a combination of post-rugby syndrome, dehydration, and the fact that the floor was solid concrete under a quarter of an inch of industrial carpet. The morning itself was awkward, in a way that things hadn't been between them before. There wasn't enough Advil in the world to make Jon's head stop hurting, never mind his bad shoulder. His physical condition, not quite but almost all his own fault, was exacerbated by Timothy's lack of willingness to just blow up and get the unpleasant shit over with. Instead, he was quiet, ready with a glass of water and a bottle of pills when Jon woke, but without his customary smile. Jon knew that Timothy was touchy when it came to drinking. It had become enough of an issue over the summer that Jon had asked once if his father had been an alcoholic. According to Timothy, he wasn't, but that was the one drawback to falling in love with someone before you really knew them - there was only so much that Jon knew about Timothy's past, and there were gaps large enough to lose a planet or three sprinkled throughout Jon's mental map of Timothy's life. Timothy's exact words on the topic had been: \"He drank, sure, but that wasn't what made him an asshole. He didn't get drunk and beat me, if that's what you're asking. You know that saying 'in vino veritas'? Sometimes, you don't want to know the truth.\" There was something nasty lurking underneath the calm words, dark and bitter enough that Jon never brought the issue up again. There were worse things than a few punches, and even though he loved Timothy, there were some things Jon just wasn't going to force him to explain. Timothy was right about that, at least - sometimes, you were better off not knowing the whole story. ^__^__^ It took a few weeks, but things settled back down and the issues surrounding the rugby BBQ were, if not forgotten, certainly laid to rest. Because Jon did understand where Timothy was coming from, and while the standing joke was that \"The Drinking Team has a rugby problem\", he didn't have either the time or the cash to join in with the regularly scheduled bar nights. That being said, there are reasons that good intentions have notoriously bad results. The night after their first match at St John's, Jon was pulled out of bed (literally) by two members of the A Team, blindfolded, shoved into the backseat of someone's car with at least two other guys (which, in retrospect, he would admit was better than the trunk; the stories some of his friends in frats told were just ugly), and subjected to far more Nine Inch Nails than he ever really wanted to hear again before they reached wherever they were going. The rest of the morning, and he knew it was morning because the sprinkler system went off at 4AM (and fuck was it cold), was a mass of pain, frustration, and alcohol. Jon knew the basic science behind these kinds of things; it was the reason he'd decided he wasn't going to join a frat, even though his father had pressed him to shoot for one of the academic houses. If you wanted to play, to be a part of the team, you didn't say no during indoct. So when the gatorade shots were passed around, he drank. When they went around again, he drank. When the A Team members started shouting out drills, he ran and passed as well as he could in the wet grass with clumsy hands. By the time the fourth round of shots circulated, the insults had started. Everyone was frustrated, uncoordinated due to exhaustion and the ethanol running through their veins, missing passes they should have been able to catch in their sleep as the BC veterans ran circles around them. Some of the very same guys who had smiled and shaken Timothy's hand at the barbecue, making small talk about classes and campus differences, now made comments about the 'fucking fag' and glared openly at Jon as if it was his fault that they were out there in the first place. Jon wanted to pick the fight, but he didn't. One of the 'rules' that the A Team captain had outlined earlier in the night was that the team didn't fight amongst their own. The BC Ruggers had a reputation to maintain, and it included things like team unity and a notable lack of deaths due to alcohol poisoning. So he just kept his head down, drank when he was told to, and tried desperately to remember the names of his fellow players after they'd been formed into a side to square off against the veteran upperclassmen. ^__^__^ Jon woke up the next morning in a markedly familiar position - on the floor next to his bed, half-wrapped in a sheet and hurting badly enough he wouldn't have cared if the apocalypse had been going on next door. Muttering under his breath, and trying very hard not to think about what exactly his mouth tasted like at the moment, he forced himself up into a sitting position while he tried to remember how he'd ended up on the floor this time. His attempt at tracking backwards through the previous evening's activities - something which was proving damn near futile, which was more than a little disconcerting - was interrupted by a noise coming from his bed. Jon turned, the movement slow so as to keep his stomach from anything violently unpleasant. What he found undercut his earlier intent, the sight of one of his teammates - a naked teammate, by all appearances - lying in his bed had him stumbling for the bathroom before the image had finished processing. After the dry heaves had stopped, he rested his forehead against the side of the stall and tried desperately to remember what had happened after the start of the scrimmage that morning. All he got for his troubles was an increase in the pounding behind his eyes and another round of dry heaves. He couldn't believe that he would have cheated on Timothy - he loved him, with an almost frightening intensity. But Josh had been lying in his bed, bare-chested and loose-limbed, and that hole in his memory was becoming more terrifying with each attempt to fill the void. The one piece of good fortune was that it was a Sunday, which meant that the dorm was all but dead at ten o'clock in the morning. After several deep breaths and an almost-successful attempt at talking himself out of a panic attack, Jon pulled himself together enough to rinse his mouth out and return to his room. Josh was still asleep, and from the look of him would be for a while longer. Jonathon winced at the state of the sheets, Josh's muddy feet sticking out down at the foot of the bed; no matter what might or might not have occurred, he was going to have to do laundry regardless. After a moment of debate, Jon gathered his things and returned to the bathroom to shower. While the hot water did nothing to calm the anxiety currently knotting his stomach, it did help with the various aches and pains that inevitably followed a rugby match. In a mixed blessing, his roommate was gone for the weekend due to an obligation with the marching band somewhere in Vermont. Clean, shaved, and dressed, Jon did the only thing he could think of under the circumstances. He slunk off to the library to hide himself in a back corner and do the next three weeks worth of Western Civ reading. He'd never been one to talk things out, which was probably the only reason why he didn't immediately reach for his cell phone after realizing just what kind of a mess he might-or-might-not be in. That, and he wasn't sure whom he could talk about it with that wouldn't either tell Timothy or simply lecture him on his stupidity; if he wanted the lecture, he didn't need to go anywhere outside of his own brain, thank you very much. By the time he dug the thing out to check the time that evening, he'd managed to accrue several voicemails - two from Timothy, which he immediately skipped, and one from Cooper wanting to compare notes on their respective matches that weekend. Being enough of a strategist to acknowledge that there was a time when you bit the bullet and did the unpleasant, Jon cued up his contact list and selected Cooper. Out of all of the members of the rugby team Jon still kept in touch with - all of them were on Facebook, but there were only a handful he talked to regularly - Cooper was not only the most laid back, but he was also the most likely to provide good advice where Timothy was concerned. After an initial round of pro forma protest, Cooper had accepted Jon's choice of romantic partners with a surprising lack of comment. Jon was teased, certainly, but more for the fact that he was in love and admitted it than because Timothy was a guy. After glancing around to make sure that no one was nearby to be disturbed by the call, Jon hit \"send\" and waited for his friend to tell him what the hell he should do. \"Cooper's House of Pain, we flay to your wishes!\" Jon slouched down in his chair, leaning his head against the wall and peering out the window as he settled in for what was likely to be one of the most unpleasant conversations he'd had since getting a cell phone. \"Match went that badly, huh?\" \"Worse. They fucking killed us, and we lost two guys to injuries for at least the rest of the month.\" Cooper sounded remarkably cheerful for someone who'd been getting ground into the pitch earlier. \"But?\" \"They bumped me up to starting to fill in for one of the guys who busted his knee. So, you know, can't be too upset.\" Jon laughed, glad to let his friend have a few minutes worth of bragging rights before he voiced his own, less pleasant, news. \"Congratulations on the promotion. I guess that's what comes from going to a school where rugby's not the number two sport.\" \"Look, man, that was shit luck you getting put on the B team. I don't care if it's tradition, you were fucking good. They're fucking idiots, and you know it.\" Jon shrugged, even though he knew Cooper couldn't see him. \"Not everything about B Team's bad, even if our matches don't go on record. There's good stuff, too. Or, was, maybe. I don't know.\" \"Jon...\" There was a pause on Cooper's end of the line, and Jon knew he'd said more than he'd intended to. Yes, he wanted to tell someone, but he was having second thoughts about who, and if he should just talk to Timothy, even though that would probably end the best thing that had happened to him in forever. \"You know what, it's nothing. I've just spent the last few hours doing readings for my philosophy class.\" \"Bullshit. What's going on?\" Jon took a deep breath, pulling himself together in order to explain calmly and rationally, and then let it right back out again because there was just no way that any of this was calm or rational or not fucking up his entire life. \"Last night was indoct, and it was bad, I think. But I can't fucking remember, and this morning there was a guy in my bed, and Timothy's going to kill me or he'll just tell me to fuck off, and I shouldn't even be telling you this because this whole thing was just a big fucking messy bad idea.\" \"Whoa, whoa. Just, slow down a minute. Are you saying you cheated on Timothy? You? Mister 'I found Mr. Right at eighteen and fuck the rest of you'?\" Cooper sounded about as disbelieving as Jon's conscience was every time he replayed the morning's events. Jon nodded miserably, forgetting that Cooper was a thousand miles away in the Greater Chicago area. \"At least, I think I did. I just, God, I wish I could fucking remember. And everything hurts, and I do mean everything - they had us running drills last night in the fucking sprinklers, doing Pop-Ups until we couldn't feel our legs.\" Cooper made a sympathetic noise. \"Ouch. Look, don't take this the wrong way, because I'm just trying to help. When you say everything hurts, is your ass sore?\" \"I- no. Not, not like you're asking.\" \"OK, so that's one problem off your list. Now, you fucked things up, so you're going to have to sort this out. Does the kid you woke up with know you're gay?\" \"Why does everyone say that? I mean, yeah, I'm in love with Timothy. But it's not like I've never dated girls or anything.\" \"Fine, so you're officially bi. What-the-fuck-ever. Does he know you fuck boys?\" \"He knows I'm dating Tim, if that's what you mean. All of them do.\" \"Right, so track him down and ask him what he remembers. It's going to be awkward, but it'll be a hell of a lot worse if you talk to Tim before you know what actually happened.\" Jon sighed, reaching up to rub the bridge of his nose. \"When did you get to be some almighty relationship guru?\" \"Around the time the captain of the rugby team asked me to suck his dick, okay? Now, seriously, track this guy down. Talk to him. Then talk to Tim, because you let this go too long and it's just going to get worse.\" \"Wait, what?\" Last thing Jon had heard, Cooper had been diving into the Northwestern co-ed pool with a vengeance. \"Forget it. Stop stalling, stop freaking out, and go find out what actually happened. When's your next practice?\" \"I don't know. I think there was an email about a gym conflict or something, so, um, maybe tomorrow?\" Jon knew that he sounded pathetic, but he couldn't bring himself to care. He was still hungover, he'd probably fucked up his love life beyond all recovery, and he as going to have to do laundry when he got back to his room because Josh had looked like he'd rolled in mud before whatever else had happened in that bed. The last thing Jon wanted to be thinking about was the rugby team, because they were the reason he was in this mess to start with. His life had been going so well up until this point, it just wasn't fair. \"Okay, so you'll talk to the guy tomorrow. Or you'll talk to someone, but you'll get this straightened out and find out what happened. Right now, you're going to go back to your dorm room. You're going to take a handful of Advil and a couple of Benadryl, you're going to put your headphones in, and you're going to sleep through the night like nothing is wrong. Tomorrow, you're going to find out what the fuck happened last night, and then you're going to call Timothy. Because I am not putting up with this shit for the next month. Comprende?\" \"I- fine.\" Trust Cooper to recommend better living through pharmaceuticals, although at least Benadryl was reasonably innocuous. Cooper sighed in exasperation, as if following Jon's train of thought from halfway across the continent. \"I mean it, Jon. I know you. You'll freak out about this, you won't sleep, you'll drink way too much coffee to make it through classes, and by the time you talk to Tim – and you're not going to put it off more than another day, because he's going to start freaking out that you're not returning his calls – you're going to be so cranked up that you'll fuck things up royally.\" \"Thanks for the vote of support.\" \"Look, you cheated on him? You're going to be in the shit, and you'll have it coming. You didn't, you're better off sane when you talk to him. I've seen you on too much coffee, man, and it's not pretty.\" Jon winced, because he knew exactly what Cooper was talking about. \"I just, what if I fuck this up, Coop? I love him, like, really love him. Hell, if I didn't know that indoct was a one-time thing, I'd quit the fucking team for him. I can't lose him over this.\" \"Jon, you're eighteen years old. You love him, that's awesome. But if something you can't even remember is a deal breaker, then maybe you're better off finding out now and getting the break-up over with.\" \"Don't go there, Cooper. Just, don't.\" Jon consciously relaxed his clenched first, reminding himself that Cooper was just trying to help. Newly discovered zen or not, Cooper's idea of a long-term relationship was two weeks, and he'd never really understood Jon's assertion that Tim was 'the one'. \"Look, I've got to go.\" \"Don't get your panties in a twist, man. Just stating the obvious. Call me when you get it sorted out, okay?\" \"Yeah, yeah. Night, Coop.\" Jon didn't wait for the reciprocal pleasantry, ending the call and staring at the aging library wall in the vain hope that it would solve his problems. Unfortunately, it proved markedly unhelpful. ^__^__^ Despite his misgivings, Jon took Cooper's advice and had passed out cold once he'd done enough laundry to put sheets back on his bed. The whole procedure of stripping and cleaning the linens had made him regret the stop by the cafeteria, but he wasn't willing to spend another night on the floor. Cooper had been right about the Benadryl, Jon dropped off and slept dreamlessly through the night, to the point where he slept straight through his alarm and woke with only fifteen minutes to make it to his morning class. That set the tone for the day, and he spent the hours before practice scrambling to keep up with his professors' sick midterm delusions of normalcy. Jon wasn't able to forget about the gaping hole in his memory, far from it, but he found that if he concentrated hard enough he could focus on his schoolwork enough to dampen the sick feeling in his stomach. A sick feeling which came to a head before he even laid eyes on his suspected infidelity. Karl caught him in the hallway on the way into the locker rooms, and pulled him into one of the rooms normally reserved for visiting teams. \"How you feeling today, Cordon?\" Jon shrugged off the arm that Karl had thrown over his shoulders. \"Fine, I guess.\" Karl studied him for a minute, looking him up and down. \"You sure? You were pretty messed up after indoct. Took two of us to get you back to your room, and you owe Jackson a big one. He agreed to baby-sitting duty on you when you refused to puke like a good little boy. Said you took off like a bat out of hell Sunday morning.\" Jon blinked, relief slowly settling into that cold place in his mind where his memories should have been. \"He, um, oh. I see. I, yeah. I'll talk to him.\" Jon glanced around, making sure that the door behind Karl was still closed. \"Listen, I can't do that again.\" \"Do what?\" \"Drink that much. You told me that being on B team means understanding your priorities, and I do. This isn't high school, and there are things I can't afford to fuck up anymore.\" Karl was silent, and for a long moment Jon was worried that he'd offended him. \"I don't know what your deal is, Cordon, but you're a good player. You want to stick to soda, that's up to you. But if you're going to do that, you're right to stick to the B team.\" Jon nodded. \"I'll keep that in mind.\" He took a deep breath, finally allowing it to sink in that he hadn't fucked things up. At least, not as far as he might have. He still couldn't remember, and Timothy was still going to be pissed as hell, but he could work with this. They could work through this. They had to, because he wasn't letting Tim go over something this small and stupid. ^__^__^ Josh was easy enough to find, once Jon got into the locker room, and mollified with the promise of a free drink the next time the B team went out to the 'Nest. He even teased Jon about his insistence on taking the floor, since \"it's not like it would be a new experience or anything.\" Jon had laughed as expected, filing away the comment along with the other references that his teammates made to the missing portions of the night. Nothing seemed to jog his memory, but at least he could build some kind of an idea of what had happened. The just-cheated-death feeling lasted until about fifteen minutes into practice, at which point he remembered just why Cooper had been so adamant that he be not-chemically-altered for the experience. Between the wind sprints, the Pop-Ups, the buddy-sprints, and the passing drills Jon was ready to call it quits long before practice was over (and he was far from alone, if the mournful looks from his teammates were any indication). By the time they got to the scrimmage portion of practice, Jon was starting to feel light-headed and trying to ignore the fact that he'd skipped lunch. By the time he staggered into the showers with the rest of the crowd, all he wanted to do was curl up and die under the hot water, and then possibly curl up and die in his bed. Unfortunately, a beeping from his cell phone reminded him that he didn't actually live in a vacuum, and when he dug it out from under the clean clothes in his locker he found that he'd missed another three calls from Timothy. Right. Fuck. He'd forgotten that just because he'd (more or less) sorted things out for himself that didn't mean that they just got better. At the least, he owed Tim an explanation for the fact that he'd been avoiding him all weekend. And that explanation was going to have to involve Indoct, there was no way around it. Which meant another fight about the drinking, even though he was now completely onboard with Timothy's perspective on the binge-drinking issue. God, he wished he knew why this was such a big deal - everyone drank in college, even the 'good' kids. Nights like this, when he decided that maybe a phone call wasn't going to cut it and didn't bother to consider whether driving two hours after practice on an empty stomach was a good idea until he was past Worcester, Jon wished that he'd just pushed the issue and found out what it was that Timothy's father had said to him while under-the-influence. He'd missed his chance, though, and knew it. Aside from that one late-night conversation, Timothy had steadfastly avoided talking about his father at all. According to him, he \"didn't have a father,\" and Jon had heard just enough conversations between Tim and his mother to know that pushing the issue would get him nowhere. It was also the reason why Jon was currently hovering outside of Timothy's dorm in the pouring rain, waiting to tail-gate his way into the building, instead of sitting in his own dorm room where it was warm and dry (never mind that the parking was free). He'd told Cooper he wouldn't fuck this up, told himself that he wouldn't fuck this up, and there were too many ways for things to go wrong if he tried to do this on the telephone. Even when they managed to get Skype to work, there was still too much room for misunderstanding, and the internet in the BC dorms could be sketchy at times. After a small eternity, someone decided to brave the weather and Jon was able to get into the dorm. He could have called Timothy, but that might well have led to the very conversation he was trying so hard to have in person. Three flights of stairs and a wet jacket were a small price to pay for the chance to explain what had happened without Timothy shutting him down, and at least the climb helped him to warm back up from his time lurking by the main doors. Timothy's room was second from the end of the hall, and Jon spent a long moment paused in the stairwell reminding himself of why this was such a good idea, as opposed to a horrifically bad one. His parents had always stressed that honesty was the foundation of a good relationship, and he didn't want to be the one to torpedo what he and Timothy had. He just hoped he was doing the right thing, because otherwise he was going to drive out to Evanston and strangle Cooper to within an inch of his life. Knock. Knock. Knock. Despite the noise of the hallway, the raps seemed to echo in Jon's ears as he lowered his hand. Before he could decide whether this really was the best course of action, however, he was committed as Timothy opened the door and blinked at him in surprise. \"Jonathon?\" \"Hey.\" Timothy frowned at him, expression fading quickly from surprise to concern. \"What are you doing here? Is everything okay?\" \"Yeah.\" Jon's voice was scratchy, and he cleared his throat in an attempt to normalize it. \"Yeah, everything's fine. I just... You were right, okay?\" \"What?\" Jon crossed his arms, and leaned against the doorframe, letting his gaze stray from Timothy to rest on the pile of books beside the bed. \"I said, you were right.\" Timothy shot him a confused glance, then backed away from the door to let Jon into the room. \"I was right. I got that part. I just can't figure out what I was right about.\" Jon stepped into the room and closed the door behind him, running a hand through his hair as he tried to pull his thoughts together. They'd seemed so nicely ordered on the drive down, but now they were a mess, and all he wanted to do was blurt out 'I didn't cheat on you!' \"About the drinking. And the rugby. And, fuck, Tim, there are some things that just aren't worth screwing around with.\" He crossed his arms across his chest again, as much to stop the shaking that had started when he'd closed the door as for comfort. He kept his gaze on the floor, wondering idly which professor was making Tim read All Quiet on the Western Front. \"Jonathon...\" Timothy took his time with the word, in a way that made Jon's stomach clench and his hands tighten involuntarily. Jon flinched when Timothy placed light fingers under his chin and forced him to look up. \"What happened?\" \"I don't know. That's the problem. I mean, I think I know, and I sort of know, but I don't know know. It was Indoct, right? And you don't say 'no' at Indoct, that's the point. It's how things are done. But I can't fucking remember. And I already talked to Karl, and I told him I'm not doing that again - that I can't do that again - but I can't take it back.\" Timothy's hands landed gently on Jon's shoulders, twin patches of warmth slowly easing through the damp windbreaker and the t-shirt beneath. Jon shivered in response, leaning in to rest his forehead against Tim's neck as the building wave of anxiety short-circuited in favor of the sense-memories that accompanied this particular patch of bare skin. He distantly felt the grip on his shoulders lessen and a deepening of the embrace, and for a moment he let himself pretend that everything was going to be fine. \"I just wish I could remember.\" Timothy murmured something indistinct, guiding Jon over to the bed and sitting down with him. \"Let's try this again, because I'm supposed to be the drama queen in this relationship and you're starting to freak me out. What's Indoct?\" \"It's this thing the team does after the first home match of the season. Makes the rookies official team members. I mean, I knew what it was, that it was going to happen. I signed on for it, right?\" Jon had signed on for it, and Timothy damn well knew it, but he also knew that it was not the time for that particular discussion. Jon took the silence for agreement. \"My own fault, right? But, Timothy, I swear - if I'd realized it would be that much, that I'd black out, I would have walked away.\" \"You blacked out?\" Timothy's grip tightened involuntarily, and Jonathon cringed. \"The last thing I remember was trying to pass the ball and slipping because the sprinklers had gone off again. I woke up on the floor in my room, no idea how I got there or why one of my teammates was sleeping in my bed.\" Jon shifted, pushing away from Timothy to try to read his expression. \"I spent the rest of the day in the library, trying to remember what happened - that's why I didn't answer my phone. But I still can't remember, and it scares the hell out of me.\" Jon shivered again, making an effort to keep his hands in his lap instead of fidgeting. Timothy studied him for a long moment, shadows darkening his features due to the lamp on the desk behind him. When he spoke, the words were soft and firm. \"No more.\" Timothy raised a hand, brushing it tenderly against the side of Jonathon's face before it settled against the side of his neck. \"I love you, Jonathon. You know that. But I'm not - I can't - I won't do this if you're going to screw yourself over. I won't be part of it. When we lived in Chicago, some of the kids at school used to party. Not like the rugby team, I mean really party, and they had the cash for it. But every year, we'd get these speeches from the headmaster because somebody OD'd. So if you're out of it, really out of it, then fine. But I'm not going to spend the next three years waiting for a call that you're in the hospital, or that you didn't make it, because my life is fucked enough as it is. And as much as I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose me more.\" Jon closed his eyes, leaning into Timothy's touch as he tried to make sense of the jumble of words. \"I talked to Karl, today. You met him at the barbecue; he's captain of the B team. Told him I'm not doing that again, and if it's a problem then I'll walk away.\" Jon laughed lightly, amusement genuine if thin. \"Apparently, I just signed myself out of contention for the A team, but B team doesn't give a rat's ass.\" Jon felt rather than heard Timothy's relieved sigh. \"Good. I mean, I'm sorry, but... God, Jon. I don't know if I could lose you.\" \"Right back at you, lover. Right back at you.\" It was years later, after dozens of arguments both lesser and more valid, that Jon would learn Timothy had spent the night of the barbecue awake, watching him breathe and making sure that he didn't stop. ~ Finis Part A ~ ","Summary":" Author's Note: Third in the fic series that emerged after I spent way too long driving around the M"},{"Movie":"Were the World Mine","Title":"Magic","Author":"shadowglove","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6423237","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: Don't own Were The World Mine.

He'd been in relationships before, but they'd never really meant anything to him. He hadn't had anything to lose. But this relationship meant something to him, and if he lost Timothy, well... He cleared his throat and ran his hand over his hair. This was ridiculous because he'd never been insecure before. Never. He was the star rugby player, his father was important in the community, and he'd been told enough times that he was physically attractive. Jonathon had always had his pick of women. But Timothy wasn't a woman. Timothy-he'd seen a part of Jonathon that he hadn't see himself-and for Timothy everything was magical. It was one of the things Jonathon loved about him. But it also terrified him. Timothy had been watching him from afar for a while before they got together, and while Jonathon admitted to having done his own share of watching he knew that if it hadn't been for the whole 'town turning gay' episode he probably would never have been brave enough to own up to his feelings and give their relationship a chance. So given the fact that Timothy's supposed 'completely impossible love' being returned, and the extraordinary circumstances in which it had happened-Jonathon was scared that the magic would wear out one day and Tim would find himself bored and/or disappointed. And that scared the shit out of him. There was something about his boyfriend that drew him in and made him fall in love with him more and he was worried that he wasn't going to live up to the high standards Tim had for him. It made him nervous. It made him insecure. And it made him jealous as hell. Especially when it came to Cooper. The guy had always enjoyed taunting Tim, before they'd become friends, and even back then Jonathon had thought it was a lot like a boy picking on a girl he liked. Of course he'd never come out and said that, but he knew that he'd thought it enough times. And now, well, Cooper was gay. He'd come out. His mother wasn't happy at first but he was her only child and she'd learnt to live with it. Her and Tim's mom had even become close over the fact that they both only had one child and the child was gay. \"Why are you so tense?\" Tim chuckled, leaning his head on Jonathon's chest as they lay on the grass by the lake. \"We came out here to relax, remember?\" Jonathon nodded, smiling, enjoying the feel of Tim's hair beneath his fingers. \"Sorry, I was just thinking.\" Timothy's fingers traced the muscles of Jonathon's stomach over his shirt in an innocently fascinated way that was always hell on the rugby player's libido. He licked his lips, trying to tell his body to relax . \"God, I can't wait till graduation.\" Timothy laughed, his fingers ceasing their stroking of Jonathon's stomach as he turned so that he was looking up at the sky. Jonathon's smile vanished and he looked away. Graduation. That was another fear. Having experienced the bad part of this town, their prejudices and discriminations, Timothy had this intense desire to graduate and put the town in his rearview mirror. Jonathon on the other hand hadn't had to go through what Timothy had. By the time he'd come out the town had experienced Timothy's magically induced gayness themselves and had walked some miles in his shoes, so they'd become much more understanding and tolerant, so Jonathon hadn't had to suffer as his boyfriend had. And Jonathon loved this town. He wanted to go to the local college. Wanted to stay here. Wanted to live here. With Timothy. But he knew Timothy, knew that his boyfriend couldn't wait for the ink to dry on his high school diploma before he was gone and out of there. Jonathon was scared that if Timothy left, the magic would leave with him. Timothy would find more interesting things and people in the big city, and he'd realize that Jonathon really wasn't that big a deal, that if anyone was lucky to be in this relationship, it was Jonathon . \"So, you wanna watch something tonight at my place?\" Jonathon asked, trying to push all of his thoughts and doubts out of his mind. \"I have the house all to myself.\" Timothy blushed darkly, smiling. \"As much as I'd love that, I'm going to Cooper's.\" And suddenly Jonathon went stiff. \"Why?\" Timothy continued smiling, apparently not noticing the change in his boyfriend. \"Well, Cooper has a little crush , and-.\" Jonathon had never heard himself snarling before, hadn't even known he was capable of making that sound, but as always Tim seemed to be able to bring out new things in him. \"You know it and yet you're still encouraging him?\" \"Of course.\" Timothy frowned, sitting up and turning towards him. \"Why wouldn't I?\" Why wouldn't-? Jonathon's eyes narrowed. \"Because it's wrong .\" A flash of darkness entered Timothy's blue eyes. \"What's so wrong about it? I think it's amazing and I'm going to do my best to make sure something comes out of this.\" He felt as if he'd been suckered punched. \" What ?\" He whispered, feeling his world going grey around him. Had it happened already? Had Timothy realized what Jonathon had been fearing all along? Had the magic, the novelty, worn off? \"How could you-?\" He tried again. Cooper was planning on going off to college as well. Was that-had that been a deciding factor in everything? \"I don't understand why this seems to be such a shock to you.\" Timothy shook his head. \"I mean, it's been obvious from the start. I've been waiting for him to make his move for a very long time.\" It was getting hard to breathe. The world seemed to be closing in on him. Jonathon reached for Timothy, his lifeline, and kissed him desperately, placing all his love and need and all of him into that kiss. Tim whimpered, arching into Jonathon so sweetly, opening his mouth to the forceful invasion. His boyfriend clutched at his shirt tightly, pulling him closer. Jonathon wouldn't pull away until his lungs were burning with the need to breathe, and even then he only pulled away far enough so that he could look into Timothy's blushing, sillily content face. \"I know we only got together because of the flower.\" Jonathon gulped, needing to finally say this, needing Timothy to understand. \"But I love you, Tim, and I know that I'm not the guy you thought I'd be. I'm flawed and-.\" Tim frowned slightly, coming out of his daze. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Look,\" Jonathon shook his head, interrupting. \"I love you, and I know that the magic of the situation might have worn off for you, and I know that Cooper has probably liked you longer than me, but dammit , I'll bring the magic again. Even without the pansy. I'll make you fall in love with me even more than you were before.\" Timothy looked at him, blush darkening, before he lowered his gaze and cleared his throat in apparent embarrassment. \"I think you just did.\" Jonathon blinked, confused. How could it have been that easy? \"Who-you-I-,\" Timothy leaned forwards and rested his forehead against Jonathon's chest. \"You never looked like the insecure or jealous type. I mean, with your girlfriends you were always very, you know, confident.\" Jonathon slowly wrapped his arms around his boyfriend. \"I don't want to lose you.\" Timothy pressed hardly into Jonathon's chest, before looking up, face utterly scarlet from his blush, as he smiled up at him. \"I love you Jonathon, you've been the only person I've ever loved. I loved you before the pansy, and the flower being gone isn't going to change anything.\" He leaned forwards so that their lips were only a breath away. \" You are magic to me.\" Hearing his heart's whispers flowing from Timothy's lips filled him with warmth and happiness, and Jonathon leaned forwards to kiss his boyfriend, but instead found a finger pressed against his lips. \"And no matter how perversely happy it makes me to realize you were jealous , I wouldn't want you to make me jealous, so let me clear this for you.\" Timothy smiled tenderly at him. \"Cooper has a crush on Cole . He had one before the pansy and that was why he was always taunting me, because he was jealous that I was open with my homosexuality while he wasn't secure enough to do the same.\" Jonathon's eyes widened. \"How-?\" \"He told me.\" Timothy responded with his pixie-smile. \"And then the pansy magic happened and he and Cole...and now...he wants to ask Cole to give him a chance without the pansy being involved, so he's asked me for my help.\" \"He could have asked me for my help.\" Jonathon murmured. \"Cole is my best friend.\" \"So?\" Timothy asked, grinning. \"You think Cooper has a snowball's chance in hell?\" Jonathon paused, thinking about Cole, and how he'd become closer to Jonathon after he'd outed himself, always supporting his friend's relationship with Timothy, and always offering to go to the movies and such with them...and Cooper. And then there was the time when Cooper had dated that townie and Cole had hated the guy's guts and had been in an unbearable mood until Cooper had broken up with the other guy. Jonathon smiled. \"I think so.\" \"Good.\" Timothy grinned brighter. \"Now enough about them.\" His smile was both shy and tempting as he walked his fingers up Jonathon's chest until he slipped his arms around his boyfriend's neck. \"What was this you were saying about bringing the magic back again?\" Grinning toothily at his boyfriend, Jonathon finally closed the distance between them and captured Tim's lips in a deep, loving kiss. Timothy returned the kiss with the same amount of love, before pulling away enough to whisper teasingly against Jonathon's lips. \"Oh, I'm feeling the magic alright.\" Laughing, Jonathon recaptured his boyfriend's lips, his laughter melting into a moan he lowered Timothy to the grass...and together they created a different sort of magic altogether. -v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v-v- Review?

"},{"Movie":"Were the World Mine","Title":"Not Boyfriends","Author":"Mardahin","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5185651","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: This was written at the prompting of a friend, who pointed out (very astutely) that the characters of Cole and Cooper from \"Were the World Mine\" had a notably ambiguous resolution to their interlude while under the influence of the Pansy(TM). Not only were they the only pairing to have a love scene in the film, but unlike the rest of the couples who were temporarily paired off, when the spell is lifted they are neither awkward nor uncomfortable with each other. Thus, this story was born. It has since spawned both a sequel and a universe (likely to total out somewhere between 4-6 fics in the end). Many thanks to the various parties who have had a hand at looking this over, as well as those who have decided to cheerlead. For everyone's convenience, I'll be publishing the stories both independently and in a combined edition titled \"Semantics.\" Author's Note #2: For the purposes of this fic-series, the boys graduated from high school in 2007. All involved were 18 on-or-before the night of the senior play, albeit not necessarily in their right minds. If you'd like to see a trailer of the film, you can find it at the official website (.com). The first thing to understand about Cole Bochner and Cooper Stevens is that they were not, are not, and never will be boyfriends. If asked, they'll cheerfully admit that they've slept together (or, at least, Cooper will. Cole spent too long trying not to think about the implications that went with that revelation to be able to joke about it comfortably). But, as any college student can tell you, sex does not mean \"relationship,\" and Cole and Cooper have never had that kind of relationship. They're best friends, and occasionally they drink too much and wake up naked in Cooper's dorm room, and that's more than enough for them. They don't need the drama, and more importantly, they're not Timothy and Jonathon. Timothy and Jonathon were boyfriends, in the traditional romantic sense of the word. High school sweethearts, they'd fallen in love while working on the senior production of A Midsummer Night's Dream and never looked back. Cole and Cooper had also logged a monumental first the weekend of the production, if one cared about those sorts of things (which they didn't). While a large portion of the weekend surrounding the senior play was a blur, the after-party was a blur of a different sort - the kind involving moderate-to-large quantities of Gray Goose and Captain Morgan. The advantage of having parents who were gone most weekends was that Cooper had the opportunity to host the best parties in town. They'd woken up the next morning naked, with hangovers bad enough that whatever awkwardness there might have been was lost in the dash for the bathroom. That had been a few weeks before the end of the school year - the end of high school. They'd written it off as \"one of those things\" and gone back to hanging around like they always had, a tradition dating back to Cooper's sixth birthday. If things occasionally happened, like late nights lubricated with beer and the odd margarita (and always at Cooper's house, because Cole's mother insisted that they sleep with the door open like they were five), it was just two friends having a good time. They dated now and then, but never seriously, because that was more effort than it could possibly be worth (once, Cole had even drummed up the courage to ask Becky out. Cooper had known it would end bloody, what with Jonathon leaving her for Timothy and all, but he'd done his duty and encouraged his best friend. He'd been proven right after two dates and an hour trying to get something pink and sticky out of a silk tie. That had been an interesting night, and an even more interesting morning. He'd learned a lot, and really, who said \"no\" to a blow job, right?). In general, though, that summer was filled with mind-numbing jobs, the summer soccer league, and the biweekly parties that Cooper hosted when his parents were both out of town (and the occasional night of really bad movies washed down with a few bottles of beer - Cooper's parents were cool like that, and let him and his friends drink in the house so long as there was a 2 beer/2 shot max for the night). It being the internet age, when they all went their separate ways for college nothing changed. The rugby team had a Facebook page, and everyone had G!Talk anyway, so 1,000 miles barely made a dent in things. While Jon migrated to the East Coast to slog his way through Boston College, with Timothy unsurprisingly nearby in Amherst, both Cole and Cooper stuck closer to home. For Cooper, Northwestern had everything he wanted and the best scholarship package; for Cole, his mother had made it clear that he wasn't going more than 200 miles, so he'd ended up at Notre Dame because it gave him the most breathing space. With a mother like Cole's, you ended up going one of two ways - you were a Mama's Boy, or you chafed quietly and got out the moment you could hit the pavement. Cole fell under the latter description, or at least he wanted to. However, \"hitting the pavement\" was a relative term, and his father was useless at best when it came to pushing back against his mother's \"family declarations,\" so it was a gradual process. Notre Dame had been the first step, but it was a limiting factor as well - even with the scholarships he'd qualified for, it was still upwards of $30,000 a year, which meant being the good son for four years until he'd earned his degree. He could do that. Head down, grades good, and date just enough to let his parents know they'd get grandchildren eventually. Piece of cake. Shockingly, it actually did work like that. He landed in Dillon Hall, did his part in Rivalry Week that fall(and got a sprained ankle for his troubles), joined the Jewish Club(he considered it a valid self-defense against his mother's inevitable questions about his social life), and spent the rest of his life bouncing between the various libraries on campus. His parents had let him take the Outback with him, which was awesome, but it being South Bend, there really wasn't all that much to do even off-campus, whether or not he had the time to spare (which he didn't). He and Cooper bitched and moaned at each other about their respective courseloads, teased Jon mercilessly about being a lovesick fool, and somehow muddled through their respective first semesters. When Thanksgiving break came around, Cole was only too happy to hit the road for home. Having some sense of self-preservation, and a vague notion of Cooper's (lack of) ability to be packed and ready to go on anything resembling a schedule, Cole didn't even bother to grumble about having to spend Tuesday night in Cooper's dorm room because Cooper had to turn in a paper Wednesday morning. The fact that there'd been far more groping and far less writing that occurred that night was a minor detail at best, and one which could easily be ignored. After all, Cole was sure that there'd been an open beer can somewhere on that floor of the dorm. It was the next morning before it occurred to Cole to ask where Cooper's roommate was, eying the neatly made bed on the far side of the room with no small amount of trepidation. Cooper just shrugged, stretching his arms over his head before settling back down onto his side of the too-small mattress. \"Beats me. I think he left last Friday, but we don't really talk much.\" It was on the way to the bathroom, when Cole's brain was finally capable of processing more than \"I turned in that paper, what if it wasn't good enough?\" and \"How long has it been since I slept?\" and \"Wow, shouldn't have had that coffee\" and \"Cooper's arms got bigger, that's kind of hot\" and \"I need to get laid more often\" that he noticed the stickers on the door. \"Hey, Coop? There something you want to tell me?\" Cooper, who was still lying in bed and showing no signs of moving anytime soon (despite the fact that they were supposed to be on the road in under an hour), didn't even bother to open his eyes. \"Don't think so.\" Cole eyed the stickers again, the Gay and Lesbian University Union one in particular, before stepping back into the room and closing the door behind him. \"You sure about that?\" Cooper did open his eyes at that, squinting in the sunlight. \"Um, yeah? Why, you find a bong or something? Because I told Jimmy to quit leaving that shit around in here.\" Cole resisted the urge to ask what else Jimmy had been leaving around that Cooper hadn't thought to mention, because that wasn't what he was getting at. \"Since when are you gay?\" Cooper propped himself up on his elbows, a confused look on his face. \"Um, I'm not? This\" he gestured between the two of them, \"aside, I kind of tend to stick with the ladies. Less fuss, and less risk of someone breaking my nose again.\" Cole blinked, because sure, Cooper was cool with Jon and Timothy, but they'd been friends with Jonathon somewhere around forever. Being cool with a gay friend was one thing, being this chill about how 'I sleep with girls, mostly, but not always' was something quite a bit different, and certainly not how Cooper had put things when Cole had dropped him off in Evanston in August. \"So what's with the club sign on your door?\" \"Oh, that. It's mostly just a social group, trips down to Chicago, that kind of thing. Being closer to the city means access to all kinds of awesome things. Next spring, I am totally dragging your ass to some of the fetish festivals. Because I want to go, and there's no way I'm going alone.\" Cole opened his mouth to argue, because really, all he needed was for his mom to learn that he'd been to a fetish festival and he'd be back at U of I, Kingston Campus faster than he could say auto-erotic asphyxiation. Cooper didn't give him the chance. \"Don't worry, we'll hit a museum or something, too. Trust me, you'll like it.\" And that was how Cole found himself at the International Mr. Leather show the following May. And marching with the Pride Parade the following summer (because somehow, Cooper had accidentally signed him up as a volunteer after insisting that Cole get the weekend off of work). After that, Cole gave up the fight and just cleared his schedule when Cooper called and said he'd found \"something you'll love. Trust me.\" Because the thing was, Cole did trust Cooper. Sure, they screwed around with each other (literally and figuratively), but they also had an understanding that went back to the fifth grade - when one of them said stop, they stopped. Whether it was teasing about how Cole's Dad had moved to the city and was never coming back (Cooper learned later, through a round of tears which both of them would fiercely deny had ever occurred, that the term divorce had been thrown around the Bochner living room more than once after Cole was supposed to have been in bed. Cole's parents had worked things out, but Cooper never joked about the subject again), or the first time Cooper had tried giving Cole a blow job and nearly choked himself before admitting that it wasn't as easy as it looked. They were friends . While he always had a good time, Cole was also always vaguely on-edge at the events Cooper dragged him to. It was easy for Cooper, because he had a not-quite-rotating-door of girlfriends to casually drop into conversation if certain assumptions were made. Despite his best efforts, Cole didn't have that. Sure, he dated a little, but it never really seemed to go anywhere. After three years of ending up \"better off friends,\" he just wrote the dating scene at Notre Dame off as a no-win situation and dug even deeper into his studies. It wasn't that he found the assumption that he was gay offensive - Jonathon was gay, and he was the most manly guy that Cole knew. But Cole didn't think that he was gay, and if his mom ever got the idea he might be, well, there was a strong possibility that he'd be scrambling to come up with upwards of $30,000/year all by his lonesome in a hurry. His education was too important to screw around with on the off-chance that his preferences ran to more than just the occasional accidental night fucking around with Cooper. He didn't push the issue with girls because he was worried about what he might learn, and even though (as Cooper liked to put it) \"a blow job was a blow job, why be picky?\" it was just as easy to \"accidentally\" date only girls who were interested in waiting until marriage. Cooper never teased Cole about his concerns, and he always steered clear of Cole's love life when they chatted - either online or in person - which Cole appreciated immensely. There were some things that just weren't worth dealing with while one was balancing a completely-and-utterly-insane load of chemical engineering courses. He could have opted for an extra term or two; while tuition was expensive, his parents would have understood the fact that some courses were only offered in one or two section chunks and freshmen just didn't get into certain classes the first time around. But they'd put down more than enough money on his education as it was, and the minor suspicion that he might not like girls as much as he thought he did was getting more and more persistent the closer he got to being financially independent. He was going home less, spending his breaks in Evanston with Cooper or driving to various grad schools to talk to their admissions people about funding options. Apparently, an unweighted 3.75 GPA and some volunteering experience in minority-focused fields, along with the internship he'd landed in Chicago the summer before his senior year, led to some sweet grant offers. The \"unlimited minutes\" package for his cell phone was worth every penny that spring, between the calls to Cooper and Jon and his parents. Some things were just easier to discuss on the phone. Cole never got the chance to ease his parents into the (apparent) change in his romantic preferences, or even to sound them out on the topic. While he knew where his mother stood, being just this side of the line between Reform and Orthodox and carrying plenty of old-school baggage with her just for the hell of it, his father's position was a bit murkier. David Bochner had been effectively out of the house since Cole was twelve, working in Chicago and only coming home on the weekends. Cole hadn't realized what was going on when the first affair occurred, but he was old enough to recognize the signs by the second and third times. His parents would fight, and his Dad would go all quiet, and then he'd stop coming home for a few weeks. Then, one night, he'd just be back as if nothing had happened, and Cole was too grateful to have him back to ask. Cole's mother never said anything about why her husband was gone for a month at a time, made no attempt to explain. The one time Cole made the mistake of asking, he'd ended up spending a month with his Aunt Rachel, who'd married a Rabbi and believed that children should be seen and not heard. Even if you were 14 and had already had your Bar Mitzvah, you were still a child in her house and should close your mouth and roll up your sleeves. He'd never brought up the subject again. So, it was possible that Cole's father might have taken the news that his son would not be taking a bride in the near future with a grain of salt and a strong dose of patience. At least, he might have if Cole had been given the chance to explain things to him. Instead, his parents got their dates mixed up and drove down for commencement a day earlier than he was expecting them. \"Cole, are you up, dear? I- Cooper?\" It was an awkward situation all around, made worse by the fact that neither Cole nor Cooper could effectively duck out of the immediate line of fire due to the lack of certain essential articles of clothing. They were saved from having to even attempt an explanation (and Cole knew that particular responsibility lay solely with him) when Cole's mother (predictably) took the vocal offensive, turning her back on the bed with her son and his best friend and instead lighting into her husband. \"David! Do you see this? Do you? This is what happens when you send a boy to a Catholic university. I told you he shouldn't have been so far from home. But did you listen to me? No.\" She raised her right hand, poking David hard in the chest. \"This is your fault. You're his father. You need to fix this! I will not have my son thrown out of Temple because he didn't have a strong enough male influence. Do you hear me?\" Cole took advantage of his mother's distraction to pull on a pair of boxers and stand. It took him two tries to cut into her tirade. \"Mom. Mom! First, you need to step into the room and close that door. I refuse to have this discussion in front of the rest of the dorm.\" He crossed his arms and stared at her until she did so. \"Second, this is not Dad's fault. It's not your 'fault'.\" She opened her mouth again, and he held up a hand to cut her off. \"And it most definitely is not Cooper's fault. This is the twenty-first century, Mom. Yes, I've had sex with Cooper. Yes, I liked it. No, we're not getting married. No, he's not a girl. And yes, that means I'm probably gay. Now, I was up for a large portion of the night doing things I'm sure you don't want to hear about, and I need at least two cups of coffee and a shower before I'm having anymore of this discussion. I'll meet you downstairs by the main doors in half an hour. If you're not there, I'll understand.\" Cole's mother blinked dumbly at him for a minute before pulling herself together. \"Now, wait just a minute, here. I'm-\" \"Leaving.\" David cut in, startling both Cole and his mother. \"Because I need something a lot stiffer than coffee before I'm going to have this conversation, any of it. And because while I might not understand everything that's going on here, I do know that Cole is an adult capable of making his own decisions.\" He took his wife's arm and pulled her toward the door. \"Even the bad ones.\" David turned, shooting Cooper an indecipherable look before nodding once in Cole's direction. \"We'll be at the hotel tonight, and we'll be at commencement tomorrow. And then we'll talk when you get home.\" Cole swallowed hard and nodded. \"Later, Dad.\" He waited until the door closed before unclenching his fists, wincing as he realized that he'd left deep half-circle marks in his palm. He took a shaky breath, carefully easing himself back down onto the bed where Cooper still sat, sheet bunched around his waist and back braced against the cinderblock wall that seemed to be an inescapable feature of dorm rooms everywhere. Cole took a second breath, easier than the first as Cooper's hand settled gently onto his back and began to move in circular motions. \"You okay?\" Cole choked on a laugh, recognizing the hysteria for what it was and unsure if he should let it out to play or bury it somewhere in the darkest corners of his mind. Spared a moment to wonder if that would even work. \"I'll live, I think.\" He shivered once, the movement claiming his whole body before it subsided. \"Sorry you had to see that. This wasn't how I wanted them to find out.\" He leaned back into Cooper's hand, allowing his eyes to slip closed for a minute before they snapped open as another concern emerged. \"Wait, what about you? I mean, you date girls. You like girls. Mom's probably going to call your mom and tell her that you're some kind of a pervert or I've corrupted you or something.\" Cole was surprised to see Cooper shrug, obviously unconcerned. \"My parents know I'm not quite arrow-straight. They seem to be okay with it, you know? I mean, if I told them we were getting married it might be different, but we're not exactly Jon and Timothy, you know?\" Cooper shook his head, his expression shifting to one of disbelief and fond amusement. \"Still can't believe Jon's actually planning to ask him. I mean, I get it and all - they're moving for his law school program, and he wants to give Timothy concrete proof that he understands the commitment being made, but still.\" Cole nodded, relieved, and allowed himself to lean into Cooper's touch just a bit more. \"I don't want that.\" \"Hm?\" \"Just so you know, I mean. I'm not your boyfriend, I don't expect anything like that. All the same, I'm glad you're here.\" Cole shifted around, scooting until he was lying down with his head resting on Cooper's thighs. \"You're my best friend, man. Nowhere else I'd rather be.\" Cooper lightly slapped Cole's shoulder. \"And besides, you still give the best head I've ever had. I'd be a fool to turn down an offer like that.\" Cole gave a breathy chuckle, rolling over so that he could get a glimpse of Cooper's face. \"Is that a request?\" Cooper squirmed, slouching further down against the wall. \"Well, if you're offering...\" Cole ran his hand up the length of Cooper's leg before gently grasping the sheet and pulling it down. \"Now, how could I turn down such a heartfelt and poetic request like that?\" He shifted again, sitting up to get into a more comfortable position. \"Why, I might think you had designs on my virtue, using fancy words like that.\" Cooper rolled his eyes. \"Oh, for fuck's sake, just get on with it.\" Cole grinned, but his response was cut off by the ringing of a cell phone, the musical sequence specific to just one of his friends. If it had been anyone else, he'd have left it to voicemail. But this was Jon, who'd spent far more time on the phone with him than was healthy helping him to sort out his grad school options and sexual orientation (and there was a term he most definitely was not comfortable using yet, wasn't sure he ever would be). With a groan of frustration that was emphatically echoed by Cooper, Cole leaned over the side of the bed to find the source of the noise. Once it was located, he tapped the answer key and put it to his ear. \"This had better be good.\" \"He said yes!!\" Cole blinked, looking over at Cooper for a hint as to what Jon was talking about before it dawned on him. \"Wait, that was this weekend? What happened to waiting until summer?\" It was May. May definitely did not count as summer in Cole's book. \"I was going to, but then I accidentally left the ring over at his place and it was this whole big mess because he still thinks I see him as being a girl or something, even though he knows that's not true, and I know, sometimes I really suck at being romantic, but it just sort of slipped out and, um, he said yes!\" Jonathon was going a mile a minute, which was unusual for him. But then, Cole supposed it wasn't every day that you successfully proposed marriage, so he could cut the man some slack. \"That's awesome, Jon. Congratulations. Hey, Cooper's in town for grad, why don't you tell him your big news?\" Cole shoved the phone into Cooper's hand, ignoring the sour expression he got in response. \"Jon? Hey, what's up? Really. That's great. Look, I've got to run. Cole will call you back later, okay?\" Cooper snapped the phone shut, turning his attention back to Cole as he resettled on the bed. \"Now, where were we?\" Cole pretended to think it over. \"Hm. Let me see...\" Several hours later, sated and drowsing in the late-morning sun, Cooper felt the need to break the contented silence. \"So, I've been thinking.\" Cole snorted, rolling over onto his side to fully express his skepticism. \"I thought I smelled something burning.\" \"I'm serious.\" Cooper punched him in the shoulder, just hard enough to make Cole lie back down, grumbling under his breath. \"So, you're going to U of M Twin Cities in fall, right?\" \"Yeah...\" Cooper tucked his hands behind his head, then decided he didn't want them there afterwards and crossed them over his chest before finally settling on tucking just his right hand behind his head. \"Well, you see, I got this job offer from a lobbying group in Saint Paul. And I'm thinking of taking it.\" Cole blinked, because of all the places Cooper could have been going, this had not even been in the top ten. \"What happened to starting your masters at Ohio State?\" Cooper shrugged, carefully studying the ceiling. \"It's a really good job offer, and it looks a hell of a lot more interesting than an MA program in political science. Cheaper, too.\" Cole propped himself up on one elbow, studying his not-lover for clues as to why the fuck he was doing this, bringing it up now of all times. \"Really.\" \"So, I was thinking, I mean if you'd be interested, that maybe we might want to get an apartment together. Save money, roommate you already know, that kind of thing.\" \"Are you asking me to move in with you?\" \"What? No. Of course not. I'm just suggesting a mutually beneficial arrangement. You know, good for both of us. I mean, moving to a new city is always easier if you know someone there, right?\" \"I do know someone there, remember? Nate transferred to the U of M two years ago, and he's taking an extra year on his BS.\" The change in Cooper's expression was subtle, but then Cole had known him a long time. \"Right, I'd forgotten about that. Well, good. That's good, I-\" Cole placed gentle fingers over Cooper's mouth to silence him. \"I didn't say no.\" Cooper reached of and grasped Cole's hand, pulling it away. \"You didn't say yes, either.\" \"I don't want you doing this for me, Cooper. If you make this choice, it needs to be for you. You're my best friend, and I can't risk losing that. I won't. So if you can tell me, honestly, that this is for you, I'll say yes.\" Cooper released Cole's fingers, and gently cradled his friend's face with both hands. \"I'm not doing this just for you.\" He pulled Cole down, taking a moment to savor a kiss. \"And I won't lie and say I'm doing it just for me, either.\" He shifted, urging Cole to rest more fully atop him. \"I'm doing this for both of us, because I'm sick and tired of only sleeping with you when one of us has vacation.\" Cole's eyes widened, surprise and cautious optimism apparent in everything from the line of his jaw to the light creases in his brow. \"Really?\" \"Yes, really. Is that enough for you, or do we have to attempt to discuss our feelings?\" Cole shook his head in reflex, leaning down to halt the flow of words with a kiss. \"It's more than enough, and you damn well know it.\" ~ Finis ~ ","Summary":" Author's Note: This was written at the prompting of a friend, who pointed out (very astutely) that "},{"Movie":"Were the World Mine","Title":"Whom I Do Love","Author":"Tiniwiel","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6116096","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Notes: Hi all!

Timothy walked slowly through the woods, breathing deep the moist air and smiling as he soaked in the late summer sunshine. This place had always felt a haven, but even more since the play, and he would now always associate the feeling of safety here with the warmth of Jonathan's arms. As though called by Timothy's thoughts, the boy appeared standing at the edge of the lake, Jonathan's back facing him. Timothy approached him slowly before wrapping his arms around Jonathan's shoulders. They smiled at one another and the rugby player rested his hands on the arms around his shoulders. Their breathing synchronized and for a moment they were one person as they stood staring at the sunlight reflecting like diamonds off the clear water. \"I wanted you so much, that night,\" Jonathan finally said into the silence. He didn't have to elaborate on what night he meant. The wind rustled the trees and Timothy thought he heard voices whispering among the crashing of the leaves. We fairies that do run from the presence of the sun... \"I wanted you too, but it wouldn't have been right. You were under the spell,\" Timothy answered, wondering why they were repeating the conversation they had at Cooper's party the night everyone was set right. \"I had never felt so brave, so free and since then I've been determined never to hide myself or my feelings again.\" Jonathan turned in his boyfriend's arms and let his tanned and muscular arms encircle the other boy's thin waist. \"But I'm afraid.\" Timothy's brown eyes clouded in confusion. \"Of what? Everyone's accepted us now.\" \"You've been comfortable with being gay for a lot longer than me,\" Jonathan started as he looked away. He stopped, unable to voice whatever fears had clearly been brewing within him for a while. Timothy pressed a kiss to his forehead in encouragement and Jonathan breathed deep. \"What if when we go to college you find someone else?\" Timothy jerked out of the embrace. \"You think I'm going to cheat on you? You really think that little of me?\" \"No!\" Jonathan insisted, reaching out to grab the other boy's hand but Timothy crossed his arms across his chest. \"It's just...I'm still trying to figure out how live like this, be comfortable with who I am and you've been so patient with me and I know that can't be easy, especially everything I've put you through. I'm just...I'm afraid you'll find someone who is better for you, someone...\" he trailed off, unsure how to explain the thoughts in his head. Timothy took a step back, staring at his boyfriend incredulously. Jonathan had always been confident in everything he did, even under the spell, so to see him so exposed and afraid made Timothy's heart break. He wrapped the shorter boy in his arms and held him tight. \"I will never leave you,\" he said into Jonathan's sun-kissed hair. \"No matter what.\" He pulled away and looked him in the eyes. \"I love you. I always will.\" The tension faded from Jonathan's shoulders and his lips curled into a small smile. \"I love you too,\" he said before entwining their fingers together and bringing their lips together for a kiss that Timothy eagerly returned. The wind blew around them and in it the whispers continued as the two boys wrapped their arms around each other. All things shall be peace. Please let me know what you think!

Warnings: Child abuse (not graphic) Disclaimer: Unfortunately, Were The World Mine does not belong to me. I wish it did though. Notes: Here there be fluff so sweet it's almost teeth-rotting Timothy was pacing nervously in the living room of the small apartment he and his boyfriend - Lover? Partner? He wasn't that sure anymore. - owned. He was nervous, that much was obvious. They were going to find out today if the papers had gone through and were accepted. He was waiting for the phone to ring and for his boyfriend to come home. The door opened slowly and Timothy turned, seeing Jonathon walk into the apartment. The rugby player dropped his keys in the bowl by the door as he slipped his shoes off, padding over to Timothy and kissing him softly. Timothy kissed back distractedly, eyes still on the phone as he started pacing again. \"I take it they haven't called yet,\" Jonathon said as he set his duffle bag down by the couch. The drama major shook his head and kept pacing, making Jonathon roll his eyes as he sat down on the armchair. As Timothy passed him, Jonathon grabbed him around the waist and tugged him into his lap. \"Stay still,\" he grunted as Timothy squirmed in his arms, but the grip the rugby had on his waist was too strong. \"Pacing is only going to make you feel worse. Just sit here with me and calm down. We'll get the call, don't worry.\" Timothy stopped squirming and fell limp in Jonathon's arms. \"How do you know?\" he asked softly and Jonathon smiled a little, kissing his cheek lovingly. Timothy sighed and nuzzled against his neck softly. \"Because Amy said we were the best candidates for it,\" he said softly, rubbing his back gently to relax him more. \"Even out of the straight couples, she said that she thought we were the best. The papers will go through, just relax.\" As soon as Jonathon finished speaking, the phone rang, the noise piercing in the silence. Timothy bolted up and scrambled out of Jonathon's lap, making the other groan as the bony theater major leaped for the phone. \"Hello? ... Yes, this is he. Hello, Amy. ... Yes. ... Yes, yes. O-of course. We can be there in... fifteen minutes give or take. ... Mmhm, right. ... Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you so much. We'll see you soon. ... Bye,\" Timothy said as he hung up the phone. He placed it back in the cradle and turned to look at Jonathon, who was just sitting patiently in the chair, rubbing his aching stomach. \"Well?\" he asked with a slight smile. \"She's ours!\" Timothy cried, throwing himself at Jonathon. The rugby player caught him and held him tight, a slightly shuddering sigh leaving him. \"I told you that we'd get her. Where are we supposed to be in fifteen minutes?\" he asked and Timothy beamed at him. \"Crowne General Hospital,\" he said, letting go of Jonathon to tug his shoes on. \"Why is she at Crowne General Hospital? Did something happen to her?\" Jonathon asked worriedly and Timothy shrugged a little, shaking his head. \"I don't know but I'm worried too. C'mon, Jonathon! I'm driving!\" \"Oh no you're not. With your driving, we'll end up in an accident or with a ticket. I'm driving, give me the keys, Timothy,\" Jonathon said as he pulled his own shoes on and grabbed his jacket. As he took the keys from Timothy, he gave the other a jacket. \"It's cold out... you should wear that.\" \"I don't see why you play rugby when it's cold out,\" Timothy said as they left the apartment and locked up. \"Because it's good exercise. And, it's not like I play with my shirt off. I don't have a pretty girl to impress,\" Jonathon replied as they walked out to the car. \"No, you have a handsome boy to impress,\" Timothy said and Jonathon shook his head a little. \"You don't even come to my games,\" he pointed out. \"I would if you were running around without a shirt on,\" Timothy said with a wink as he climbed into the passenger seat. Jonathon rolled his eyes and started driving toward the hospital, smiling whenever he caught the sight of the seat in the back through his mirror. They were there in twenty minutes, although Timothy complained that it would've been shorter if he was driving. Jonathon shook his head as they walked into the hospital, smiling when they saw Amy. Amy Jones was a small woman with dark brown hair and kind hazel eyes. She was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt with her hair pulled back in a messy ponytail, which was a big change from the clean pressed gray skirt and shirt combo with her hair in a tight, neat bun at the back of her head. \"Glad you guys could make it. I take it you drove, Jonathon?\" she asked, smiling at Timothy groaned a little in protest. \"I'm a good driver!\" he said before pausing at the raised eyebrow aimed his way by Jonathon. \"Okay... I'm a good driver most of the time.\" Jonathon just shook his head and kissed his cheek gently before looking at Amy with slightly worried eyes. \"Do you know where she is?\" he asked and Amy's smile disappeared. \"Follow me,\" she said softly, leading them into the pediatrics ward. She led them to a small room towards the back and they just stood there, watching the nurse in the room for a while. \"What happened?\" Timothy asked softly as they watched the nurse carefully change the bandages of a little girl that sat on the bed. She had sandy blond hair and soft blue eyes that were wide and unseeing as the nurse tended to her. She couldn't have been more than four at the most, her arms and legs were still slightly pudgy with baby fat. Timothy couldn't believe that someone would want to hurt her. Amy swallowed and looked at them for a moment, regarding them carefully. \"We found out that her mother was abusing her,\" she said, watching as Timothy paled and Jonathon's eyes hardened. \"When we got to the house, she was by the door withe cuts that were bleeding and some that looked infected. She was immediately removed from her mother's custody and brought here. I called you and Jonathon as soon as I knew she would be alright. I thought that you two would be the best parents to take care of a little one who was put in her situation. If you don't want her-\" \"Amy,\" Jonathon said, cutting her off gently. \"We could never not want her. Please, can we see her?\" Amy smiled and nodded, opening the door for them. The little girl looked up as the door opened, her big blue eyes widening a little as she looked at them. She looked at them with wide eyes, not recognizing them. Timothy smiled at her as he walked forward, kneeling in front of the bed she sat on. \"Hey, Jamie... do you remember me?\" he asked softly and she looked at him for a moment before recognition dawned in her eyes. She nodded slowly. Timothy smiled as he knelt down in front of her, taking in the cuts, scrapes and bruises on her tiny body. \"Good... I'm glad. Do you remember what I asked you last time I saw you?\" She nodded again. \"Well, I have another question for you.\" As Timothy spoke softly to Jamie, Jonathon turned to Amy. \"Is her mother being prosecuted?\" he asked softly, not wanting to upset Jamie. Amy nodded. \"Yeah. I saw what was happening with my own eyes. I couldn't leave a three year old in that woman's custody any longer. You two were already cleared for adoption and Timothy is a registered foster parent. As soon as you're heading home, I'll draw up the complete adoption papers so that she's yours and Timothy's legally. Jamie's case agent adores you both and agrees with my decision to allow her to stay with you if that's what Jamie wants and if that's what you and Timothy want,\" she said. Jonathon smiled a little. \"Amy, we wouldn't want it any other way,\" he admitted, looking over at Timothy and Jamie. He nodded to Amy and walked over, kneeling next to Timothy. Jamie looked at him with a tiny smile, waving shyly. \"Hey, Jamie. Did Timothy ask you the question already?\" She nodded and she looked at her lap before looking at the two men in front of her. \"I... I want to stay wif you,\" she said softly, holding her arms out to them. \"Pwease?\" Timothy's eyes softened completely and he lifted her into his arms, holding her close. Her little arms wrapped around his neck and clung to him, her face buried in his neck. \"We'd love it if you stayed with us,\" he said, feeling the first tears against his neck. He held her close and Jonathon wrapped his arms around both of them, one of his hands rubbing her back gently. The drama major took a breath and kissed her hair softly before beginning to sing. \"I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of me. To fright me, if they could,\" he sang softly and Jonathon smiled at him, leaning in to kiss him softly as Jamie pulled her head out of his neck to look at them. \"But I will not stir from this place do what they can. I will work up and down here.\" Jonathon smiled and took the next line, rocking them gently. \"And I will sing that they shall here, that I am not, I am not afraid. I am not afraid,\" he sang and Timothy smiled sweetly at him before beginning to sing again. \"I know not by what power I made bold, but still you flout my insufficiencies. The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace. My ear should catch you voice, my eye your eye. My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melodies. My tongue your tongue were the world mine,\" he sang as he gently set Jamie down on the bed. She looked up at them with wide eyes before she smiled widely and rocked gently as they sang. \"And I will sing, that they shall hear that I am not. I am not afraid. I am not afraid,\" Jonathon sang, allowing Timothy to pick it up once more. He didn't mind not singing that much. This was Timothy's song. \"Faeries away, fetch me that flower.\" \"Up and down and up and down.\" \"I will lead them up and down. Faeries away, swift as a shadow.\" \"Up and down and up and down.\" \"I will lead them up and down!\" Timothy sang with a wide smile before scooping Jamie into his arms and spinning her around in the air. Her shrieks of delight caused the nurse and Amy to come running into the room, but when they saw that she was smiling and laughing and clapping, they sighed in relief and stood back, watching them carefully. \"Oh why rebuke you him that loves you so! Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe... on your bitter foe!\" Jonathon smiled as they got to his lines, moving forward and taking Jamie from Timothy gently. He began to sing, dancing around with her in the room. \"What angel wakes me from my flowery bed? I pray thee gentle mortal, sing again. I pray thee gentle mortal sing again. Mine ear is much enamored of thy note. So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape. I'll follow thee, I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell. I'll follow thee, I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell. And make a heaven of hell!\" he and Timothy sang together as Jamie smiled widely and laughed in delight. They set her down and she started dancing to the music they were making together as a family. \"Faeries away, fetch me that flower! Up and down and up and down. I will lead them up and down! Faeries away, swift as a shadow! Up and down and up and down. I will lead them up and down!\" the men sang together, holding hands as Jamie leaped up and grabbed their free hands. They swung her gently, smiling widely as they watched her break out of her shell and just have fun. \"Faeries away, fetch me that flower! Up and down and up and down. I will lead them up and... Faeries away, swift as a shadow! Up and down and up and down. I will lead them up and down!\" Timothy and Jonathon sang, surprised when Jamie joined her voice with theirs. They beamed and knelt down to her level, smiling at her as they sang the last lines. \"My ear should catch your voice. My eye should catch your eye. My tongue your tongue, were the world mine,\" they sang together, smiling at each other as Jonathon leaned in to kiss Timothy impulsively. Jamie giggled and threw herself at them, wrapping a little arm around each of their necks. hugging herself close to them. Jonathon supported her body as they stood up, holding her in between them as she fell asleep against them. Amy walked forward slowly and Timothy turned to look at her, content to just hold the sleeping angel in his arms. \"What song was that?\" she asked, tipping her head to the side slightly. \"I didn't recognize it.\" Timothy smiled a little as he gently took Jamie's arm from around his neck, settling it next to her other arm around Jonathon's neck. \"It's called 'Were the World Mine',\" he admitted softly, a soft smile on his face. \"It's the song that brought Jonathon and I together.\" He looked at Jonathon, who was humming softly and rocking Jamie in his arms. \"And now it's brought our family together.\" END ","Summary":" Title: Family Author: Sleep Sound Rating: K+ Summary: Timothy and Jonthon take their relationship t"},{"Movie":"I, Robot","Title":"I, Human","Author":"The Amazing Spider-Lou","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2021185","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A silhouetted female appeared before Detective Del Spooner laid down on a sofa. Del felt the smile widen on his face while she sauntered toward him. \"Damn, you frisky tonight!\" \"You and I are forever, Del,\" the voice said. \"Whatever you say.\" He was confused. While she sounded familiar, her resonance chilled down his spine. \"You and I are forever, Del.\" The silhouette encroached him. Minimal light peeked through the windows and shone onto it. \"Susan?\" Suddenly, the figure lunged inward to attack; too quickly for him to discern a face. Del sprung upward from a bed, mildly sweating, and sat upright in an attempt to catch his breath. It was only a nightmare. As usual, Dr. Susan Althea Calvin laid beside him. After their relationship was taken to the next level, he was given access to her apartment, with frequent overnight stays. Susan was a sound sleeper, yet was still unaccustomed to sharing a bed with anyone. Therefore, her interrupted slumber was gradual. \"What's wrong, honey?\" Susan quietly asked, lifted her head from her pillow and slid her palm across the small of his bare back. He slowly lowered himself back onto the pillow, Susan nuzzled into his chest and he placed his arm around her. \"Just a bad dream, that's all. I can safely say it had nothing to do with the accident. Those ones I always remembered. Sonny's still watching television?\" Del inquired about their \"child\", an NS-5 Robot. \"I hate how you're subjecting him to watch that dreadful television programming.\" \"Classic TV trivia is educational!\" Del answered with a kiss to her head. \" Giggling Island is educational?\" Susan asked \"That's Gilligan's Island , and yes, yes it is.\" Susan closed her eyes but the eyes of her lover remained wide open. But quickly they shut, albeit not for sleep. It was a hard squint due to a migraine. \"What the hell? I don't get headaches!\" The officer thought. To be continued.[Chapter 2] January, 4, 2036: Chicago, IL Del Spooner kept his migraine ailment from Susan, for she would have prescribed him medication he had not desired. Even worse, her psychological analyses would never have ceased. Del was content with Tylenol, but that never alleviated abrupt migraines. This morning he arrived to work early, strolled through the immaculate precinct towards his desk, and slumped down into his chair. Spooner clenched his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose and Lieutenant John Bergin fully noticed this demeanor. The burly superior officer trudged toward Del, who seemed out of it. Bergin finally reached the desk. \"Hungover?\" He casually joked. \"Just your average, everyday headache.\" Del alertly answered and faced his computer screen. \"Everything okay with Susan?\" John knew that Del never stressed about his job. \"Opposites still attract; everything's great. \" Del finally smiled. \"How about Sonny?\" The curious Bergin mentioned the sentient NS-5 robot. \"We're pretty much raising a child. Even after all these months, I still hardly believe I'm somebody's parent.\" Del mused. \"If it's any consolation, I doubt you're the baby-daddy.\" \"Amusing.\" \"You're always good around my kids. Sonny may be a little naïve but he's not too much different.\" The Lieutenant noted. \"He's not human. If we don't nurture him properly, he could present a danger to humanity.\" Del interrupted. \"Hey, thought your attitude changed towards his kind,\" John asked. \"It did, and now I've got two worlds to protect.\" Del was about to peruse his inbox until a fellow detective got a call. A Latino male was murdered in his apartment last night. \"Hey, Rog, can I take that one?\" \"I'll forward the info to your car,\" Rog said. \"Thanks.\" Del rose from his chair, about to leave the precinct, but turned to face Bergin. \"And thank you, John\" Bergin grinned and nodded. After a travel to the murder scene, Detective Spooner arrived in the clean, furnished apartment. However, a foul stench of death lingered. Spooner motioned to the CSI on scene. \"Hey Nick, what've you been up to.\" \"You're late, Spooner. Usually you'd be on top of things like this.\" Nick, middle aged, graying beard, was the team leader of the CSI, on the scene once the police were called. \"Yeah, well, I'm preoccupied. I've got a new family to contend with,\" he barked back. \"Welcome to the club.\" Nick began his overview while the corpse of a man in his late-thirties laid crumpled on the middle of the wooden floor. His face was swelled with bruises and covered in a sheet of blood. \"This guy looks familiar. You got an I.D?\" Del mused. Nick stood up and tapped through his tablet. \"Santo Perez, thirty eight, well-paid janitor at a bread factory. You knew this guy?\" \"He's a lot older and deader, but yeah, I kind of did. He's one of my earliest collars after I graduated from the academ y. \"No arrests or felonies since he was first arrested for selling crack,\" Nick listed. \"He's seems to have been clean ever since, but maybe old habits die hard. Maybe a deal didn't go down right.\" \"Leave the detective shit to me.\" Del shot him a sneer. \"What about the body?\" \"Severe neck trauma, as anyone with functional eyes can see. Whoever did this must have been hopped up on speed or some other substance.\" \"Could've been a robot,\" Del quietly said. \"All of the robots have been decommissioned, Spooner,\" Nick said. \"I'm fully aware of that fact, Nick. That's why this bothers me.\" He answered. To be continued.[Chapter 3] January 4, 2036 At U.S.R., Chief Executive Officer Dr. Susan Calvin continued working on the NS-6 prototype. Dr. Milton Ashe, Vice President of Android Mechanics, expedited its development a scant few months after the VIKI revolution. Susan was not alone in her efforts. Sonny had volunteered his services. Today, she mulled over various computer screens. \"How may I be of service, Dr. Calvin?\" Sonny entered her large office. \"You aren't a servant, Sonny, and call me Susan.\" She calmly corrected him. \"I was not regressing to the intended programming of my counterparts. You appeared distressed as you perused your itinerary. I was concerned.\" The soft spoken Sonny assured her as he marched closer to her desk. \"Epinephrine and other adrenal steroids such as hydrocortisone escalate in your body whenever you are in this office. It would seem U.S.R.'s demands erode your psyche. Also, there is tension in your romantic relationship with Detective Spooner, with Del.\" Susan sighed, reclined in her chair, interlaced her fingers through her brunette locks of hair, and smiled. \"You're correct on both counts. Just don't bring up the 'romantic relationship' anywhere else at work.\" Confusion crossed his face for a moment, but he then nodded. \"Granted, I am not educated as you are concerning these matters.\" \"You guessed quite well, son.\" She rolled her chair away from her desk, stood, strolled toward the wide, broad windows, and touched the glass. \"I took this job because Dr. Lanning and I created V.I.K.I.. She betrayed us.\" \"It was no fault of yours,\" the NS-5 responded. \"You regret developing the NS-6 plan?\" \"It has been stressing me out, but no, I don't regret it,\" Susan admitted. \"And the other matter? Del has barely visited your residence lately.\" Sonny inquired. \"Practically never; he's been behaving oddly,\" she admitted. \"I have also noticed how he has been distant,\" was his observation. \"I'm unaccustomed to a family life. So I'm not sure if he and I are experiencing an anomaly.\" Susan sighed and stood behind her desk. \"That determination is entirely up to you,\" the robot answered. Dr. Ashe stormed into her office. He stood six feet tall, with slightly wrinkled skin, mid fifties. Holding a tablet in hand, he walked to her desk. Susan and Sonny stared at his approach. \"Forgot how to knock, Milton? I didn't expect to see you. Usually you send an email,\" was her genuine surprise. \"This is too crucial to not share in person,\" he said while tossing the pad to her. Susan read a cease and desist order from the Federal Government in regard to the design and manufacturing of the NS-6. \"Oh, no.\" \"What is it, Susan?\" Sonny curiously asked. \"Sonny, please wait outside,\" Dr. Ashe requested. \"Yes sir.\" Sonny appeared dejected, and exited through the double doors. Dr. Ashe and Dr. Calvin silently stared at each other for a moment. \"After seven months, we barely broke a sweat! How is this even possible?\" She asked. \"Look, I understand how you must feel.\" \"We implemented a rebuild to make U.S.R. reputable, Milton. The NS-6 was intended to help achieve that goal.\" Susan recounted. \"As you see, our government, among others, deems it too soon after the worldwide revolution to jump into another high-risk situation! Their investigation is still open.\" \"Are they even aware that the new unit offers complete autonomy?\" \"Of course. It doesn't matter,\" Ashe answered. \"Please, this is a just endeavor. Plead our case. They'll listen to you.'\" Susan asked while veering around her desk to stand next to him. \"We have to wait this one out,\" Dr. Ashe noted. \"Yeah, until we file for bankruptcy; this company cannot die a death like the tobacco companies!\" \"Do you honestly believe I want to go manage a McDonald's?\" Ashe said. \"You're not fired or anything. I'm simply telling you to take a break.\" \"Take one yourself, Milton,\" she snapped. \"I'll ignore that,\" he flatly responded with a smirk and walked away. \"God damn it!\" Once he was gone from her sight, she flipped the computer pad hard against the wall. She sat and rested her face in her hands. \"I'm not in good shape, if that's what you're going to ask.\" \"Then I also would suggest taking a break.\" He was already walking back in the office, noticing his distressed mother. \"Wow, are your auditory sensors sensitive.\" She dabbed tears from her eyes but also laughed a bit. \"Maybe I do need a few days off. Not like we're going to get anything done, right?\" To Be Continued.[Chapter 4] Del Spooner stayed true to his reputation as one of Chicago's best detectives and followed up on the death of Santo Perez, who was survived by his mother, Rosalina Perez, retired and residing at a Chicago suburb house. He pulled up to it and walked to the front door. The doorbell resonated like an old-fashioned bell; no buzz, no electronic whir. Del took some comfort in hearing it. A Latina woman answered. She looked like a mother, with smooth, dark skin and light red hair. She saw the detective on the porch. He raised his badge for her view. \"Can I help you?\" The woman hesitantly asked. Spooner sighed and answered, \"Ms. Rosalina Perez?\" \"That's me.\" \"Detective Spooner, C.P.D. Homicide, may I please come in?\" She allowed his entrance. The interior was clean and pleasant, and Del immediately reminisced a childhood with his own mother. \"I couldn't leave this place after my husband died,\" Mrs. Perez reflected. \"We were married thirty five years. Not many gave us a chance to last three. Would you like a coffee?\" \"No, thank you, ma'am. I'm here on official business, and I'm sorry, but there is no easy way to tell you this. We found Santo murdered at his home.\" He said, and it was the one part of his occupation that he despised. He paused for a moment, She found herself unable to stand and meandered towards her couch to sit. \"How?\" \"We need your consent to perform an autopsy to determine the cause of death,\" he answered. \" !Ay, dios mio ,\" she said with sobs, and wiped her eyes. \"Ms. Perez, this may seem insensitive, but I must ask you a few questions,\" Del said, after handing her tissues. \"When was the last time you heard from Santo?\" \"It's been a few days. He sometimes checked in on me, always worried after his father died.\" \"Do you remember what your conversation was?\" He scribbled in his notepad as he asked. \"He was having a good week and he heard from an old friend.\" \"An old friend?\" Del's eyes opened wide. \"Did he happen to mention who?\" \"Not specifically, just somebody he hadn't seen in a long while.\" Del underlined and circled this part of his notes, clearly a lead. \"Ms. Perez, I already called in a squad car. They'll be here in a minute to take you to handle matters with your son,\" he professionally said. \"I'm very, very sorry for your loss.\" Rosalina stood from her couch, her eyes swollen from crying, and stood closely to Detective Spooner. \"Do you have any children?\" Del hesitated, not expecting the question. \"A stepson.\" \"Cherish every moment with him and his mother,\" She advised through her grief. \"Because you'll never know if you're going to lose them\" She completely broke down crying, and Detective Spooner comforted her with an embrace. This was his first true murder case since the revolution dispersed and since his new family. It hit home for the first time in his life. This one would not be an easy ride. A stinging pain crossed the skull of the Detective. Ms. Perez noticed his reaction. \"Are you all right?\" was her concern. \"Yes, ma'am,\" was his lie. Spooner had neared the front door and the mourning mother slowly followed. \"Are you sure you don't need an aspirin?\" she offered. \"No, thank you. The marked car will be here shortly. Call me if you need anything.\" The Detective smiled at her giving nature in her time of loss. He climbed down the short flight of stairs and neared his car. Spooner saw a reflection in his window that was not his own. He shut his eyes tightly, stared again and then saw only his face. \"What the hell was that?\" Meanwhile, Sonny and Dr. Susan Calvin strolled in the frigid air on the Downtown Chicago streets. She created a holographic skin that disguised him as a teenage male resembling both Detective Spooner and her. \"Are you feeling any better?\" The naïve NS-5 queried. \"Stress isn't an ailment that can be cured instantaneously. We require some calmness and peace, hence the reason for this stroll.\" Susan glanced at him with much respect. \"I am trying to be that calming element.\" Sonny admitted. \"Your placid demeanor is contributory.\" She finally felt freed of the pressure that had been heaved upon her in the last seven months. \"God, I was so intent on creating another you, I almost forgot how unique you were. I just didn't want you to be alone.\" \"But I am not in solitary. I have you and Del.\" the robot-boy assured her. Dr. Calvin beamed at his words, but the scientist in her would not be silenced. \"We're finite beings. At some point, you'll need to be with your own kind.\" \"I would miss you,\" he meekly responded. Susan ceased walking and directly faced the incognito robot. \"Spending more time with you outside of the job will most definitely open my eyes.\" To be continued[Chapter 5] Rosalina Perez consented to the autopsy of her son. While the results would be available to Spooner the next day, the young detective did not truly need them. After the revolution ended, he saw many dead bodies similarly damaged by ruthless robots. It was something that Del never saw before and hoped to never see again. The bruising and brutality of Santo's neck break was the same. Spooner analyzed the crime scene pictures while in his auto-driven police vehicle. With every NS-5 decommissioned, he wondered if the timid, infantile Sonny was a murder suspect yet again. \"Dial Dr. Susan Calvin,\" he ordered his phone. Susan walked with her artificial son for twenty minutes, learning more about Sonny. When her phone beeped, the caller identification displayed Del's number. \"Hi.\" \"Where are you?\" Del answered, not smiling. \"I'm out walking with Sonny. You won't believe what happened to me today.\" \"Tell me over dinner tonight.\" She was taken aback by his dismissive tone. \"Time and place?\" \"8:30, Gee Gee's.\" he announced. \"Why at your grandmother's?\" \"She's out of town on some Church excursion. Her kitchen's stocked with leftovers. I'm not in the restaurant mood.\" \"I'll see you there.\" She answered with a finite tone. Del hung up without saying good-bye, but a latent voice immediately sounded, and then tapered off. \"Del.\" His right eyebrow arched as he checked its screen. It was disconnected. His headache suddenly returned like a ball peen hammer struck him from behind. His reaction was vocal. His eyes teared-up from the pain. But it disappeared as fast as it came. Susan was left hanging. Sonny saw her facial expression regress to the earlier, more stressful form. \"At least he contacted you,\" the robot noted. \"Listen to my sweet boy always looking on the bright side!\" She said with a laugh. Hours later, the estranged couple finally met at the quaint apartment of Spooner's grandmother. They ate chicken, collard greens, and sweet potato pie. But Del's appetite was not much. They spoke very little in the short time they sat at the round table. \"I was taken off the NS-6 project. The positive is I'm getting paid to do nothing.\" Susan broke the silence. \"Sorry to hear that,\" he said while poking his fork into a piece of pie, but not consuming any of it. Susan stared at his failure to ingest his favorite delicacy. He was not in character, but then again, she did not know how he dealt with relationships. He was, after all, a divorcee. \"What the hell is going on?\" She asked. \"I beg your pardon?\" Del looked up from his mangled pie She did not like the dramatic approach she took here, but Susan had little choice. \"You've been avoiding me like the plague. If you're seeing someone else, at least let me know.\" \"Jesus, Mary and...I'm not seeing anyone else!\" He finally woke up. \"Then I'm really at a loss here, Spooner.\" When she used his last name, that was a bad sign, and Del felt obligated to answer. \"I'm just...I need some room.\" \"I don't mean to sound paranoid. I'm fully aware how we're two different worlds, but it seemed we made this relationship work.\" \"Paranoid?\" Del sat up straight in his kitchen chair. \"I'm unaccustomed to being emotionally attached to anyone. I'd been too preoccupied with work to notice, until our son had to make me aware you're never around.\" \"Sonny,\" he said, under his breath, with regret. \"Here I am, thinking that you wanted to make things right. But you stoically sat here not giving a shit!\" Susan continued. \"Don't you dare say I don't give a shit!\" He stood up, towering over Susan. Once again, his tone shook Susan. \"Why did you just overreact like that?\" \"Oh God, you can go on and on and on, can't you? I called you here to question you about Sonny.\" Del answered. \"What about him?\" \"I'm investigating a murder where the bruising was consistent with several victims of the revolution.\" He sat down again. Susan Calvin slowly moved her chair back and rose from it. She was intelligent enough to see where he was going. \"How could you suspect Sonny, who's been in our close care since then?\" \"Calm down. I'm not suggesting he did it.\" Del Spooner held his hands up to stop her. \"This is a classic case of regression,\" she casually diagnosed. \"What?\" Del was dumbfounded. \"Such change in your life has occurred to you, that you'll reject any further infusion!\" \"Do not analyze me, Susan,\" he growled. \"Whatever. Sonny is a child; hell, an infant, who doesn't murder people, period.\" Susan concluded, sat and stared straight ahead. \"If the wounds weren't the same, if every single robot wasn't decommissioned and accounted for, I'd never investigate our son. But I have a job to do and so do you. Run a full diagnostic on Sonny and get me his activities logs for the past six months.\" \"Fine.\" \"I don't think he did it, Susan.\" They both sat at the table, quiet again.

Del felt the smile "},{"Movie":"Were the World Mine","Title":"An Extended Saturday","Author":"Angel of Music lover","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5767311","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I want to start out by admitting that I'm a bit nervous about this oneshot. I haven't seen the film all the way through yet, but I've seen the majority of it and love it, so much that I actually went looking for a FanFic section for it. :) So please be kind and if you are reading this, please review and let me know how faithful you found it. Thanks! Dating someone in a different school didn't seem to leave much time for spending together. Between high-pressure classes, sport practices, drama rehearsals, and everything in between, there almost isn't time for casual downtime. At least, this is what Timothy and Jonathon quickly found out once they became official. Sure, there was the occasional party or two they could meet up for, but Timothy didn't like drinking and Jonathon was trying to cut down for Timothy's sake. They both noticed at the same time. They weren't seeing each other now that they went to different schools. And it was affecting their relationship. It was Timothy who suggested the Saturday date day. He was pretty confident he could finish any homework before then (and if he didn't he would pretend that he did) and Jonathon tentatively believed that the coach would let him out of most of the rare Saturday rugby practices (he wasn't on the main team in his first year of college, after all). Usually, they would try to meet somewhere in between (there was only an hour or so distance between them, less with Jonathon's driving techniques) until that stopped working out. A week without seeing each other, sometimes longer if things hadn't worked out the week before, and the last thing the two wanted to do was stay in the public eye. So, they began driving the full distance to the other's dorm, arriving early and leaving late. This Saturday was no different. Jonathon left at 8 in the morning, ignoring the jests of his roommate that he was off to go see that boy again and also ignoring the questions of when Timothy might be coming around again. Timothy's dorm had become the much more frequent choice for their dates because his dorm room was empty ( his roommate was often off visiting with his druggie friends and would be absent for the rest of the weekend). Jonathon drove for an hour (speeding the whole way), slipped into a relatively small dorm behind some residents and then burst into the room furthest down the second floor without bothering to knock. Timothy leapt to his feet, giving Jonathon an enthusiastic hug and affectionate kiss, murmuring about how much he missed him. The next step was eminent. Fifteen minutes after Jonathon's arrival, they were sitting on Timothy's couch in front of the television and having, what their friends called, a Timothy and Jonathon Quibble . \"It's my turn,\" Jonathon was saying. \"It was yours last week and now it's my turn.\" \"I wasn't aware that there were turns involved,\" Timothy argued, a little grumbly, but knew that it had been an unspoken Saturday Rule. He took a deep, resigned sigh and sent a regretful look towards the television. \"Couldn't you at least pick something besides sports? You know I don't get it.\" \"You know,\" Jonathon began sarcastically, reaching for the remote and ignoring Timothy's dark glare, \"For someone who hates sports so much you managed to show up to every school game last year.\" Timothy smiled, catching Jonathon's eye. \"I like watching you play sports,\" he corrected with about as much innocence as such a comment warranted. Jonathon smirked, playing along and cocking one of his eyebrows. \"Well, I can't blame you. I would watch me play sports, too.\" Timothy snorted loudly, shooting Jonathon a disbelieving look. \"Oh, that's my vain little Jonny.\" Timothy thought he caught a bit of a blush on Jonathon's neck at the joke, which put butterflies in the pit of his own stomach. How could he complain about sports now ? \"Let's just get this over with,\" he sighed, scooting closer to Jonathon so he could put his head on his shoulder. He had to stretch his significantly longer legs out, slide a little further down the so he was practically on his side, and then finally tuck his legs underneath him to accomplish this. It was a downside of being significantly taller than his boyfriend, but not one that bothered either of them. Suddenly, Timothy frowned. \"Your shoulder is so bony.\" \"I think you mean muscular,\" Jonathon reminded him, flipping the television on. Timothy didn't contradict and Jonathon definitely noticed. Jonathon finally settled on a tennis match and then set the remote far from where Timothy could reach. He'd learned from experience that Timothy was much sneakier than he seemed at first glance. It didn't help that Jonathon seemed to go into a trance once the sports were on, either. He would be wrapped up in the last five minutes of a game and then Timothy would be holding the remote and searching for cartoons in no time. Two minutes into the match, Timothy felt himself getting restless. True to form. He watched the female players smack the ball back and forth with heavy lidded eyes, wondering what the scoring system even meant (it seemed there were so many ways to lose points and no clear format). It all happened too fast, if you asked him. It didn't take long, though, for Timothy to find a certain rhythm in the beating of the tennis ball. It made such a resonating, steady sound that it was impossible to ignore. Soon, the eager back and forth movements the players made while waiting for the ball to come to their court seemed like a dance movement, carefully choreographed and full of surprises to catch the audience's eye. Before he knew it, Timothy was seeing high kicks, graceful leaps into the air, fluid spins, and powerful swings. He wasn't paying attention to the score but instead finding the rhythm of music and dance right in front of him on the court. He was reminded, once again, of the power that athletes possessed and was once more in awe of it, wishing that he could find that kind of rhythm. His eyes had become focused and he wasn't participating in his usual bored habits (like finger tapping, flicking Jonathon's shoulder, getting up to get water every five minutes, etc.) \"Are you actually paying attention?\" Jonathon asked in surprise, peering down at Timothy's face that still rested on his shoulder. It had been fifteen minutes and he expected Timothy to be complaining again. The bemused, comical, and (in Timothy's humble opinion) adorable expression on Jonathon's face immediately yanked Timothy out of the dream. \"Sort of,\" Timothy replied dismissively, sending a rather toothy grin Jonathon's way. Jonathon narrowed his eyes knowingly and then smiled back. He knew this expression on Timothy's face well. \"Well, as long as you're enjoying it I don't feel so bad.\" \"Who's winning?\" Timothy asked, suddenly determined to become more involved in this viewing process. \"The blonde,\" Jonathon didn't bother with saying her name, it would probably only confuse Timothy more. \"But only by a little bit. She seems to be getting tired, too.\" Timothy paused, watching the screen without such a dreamy expression. \"I like her best,\" he decided. \"I want her to win.\" Jonathon chuckled, wrapping an arm around Timothy's waist casually. He noticed Timothy's smile at the gesture and promised himself to do things like this more often. He'd never been the type of guy that liked a lot of physical contact in a relationship, but for Timothy he didn't mind. Not at all. \"You know that I don't mind watching sports as much as I pretend to, right?\" Timothy questioned. \"I mean, you like it and everything so I don't want you to think that I hate what you like because that's ridiculous—\" \"Timothy,\" Jonathon interjected, still trying to keep track of the game. \"You can like whatever you want.\" He was getting used to Timothy's insecurities, his fears that he might be too clingy or too demanding. He found it useful to just be blatant about how he felt and save Timothy some misery. \"Okay. I'm just making sure you know. Sorry.\" He looked a little embarrassed, so Jonathon tried not to tease him about it. It never went that well to tease, Timothy was kind of sensitive. Timothy was quiet after that, his bout of nervous energy spent and it seemed he was focusing on the players again. The game cut to a commercial, and something in a jingle for a product seemed to catch Timothy's attention. Then, he was smirking, and Jonathon knew that it probably didn't mean anything good. \"Do you know what's gonna be on HBO next weekend?\" Timothy asked, looking just a little too excited. Jonathon internally groaned, knowing where this was going now. \"What?\" Jonathon asked, trying to keep the tone of his voice even and uninterested. \" Repo! The Genetic Opera .\" Timothy gave Jonathon a moment to let that sink in before going on. \"And as long as we're using this turns system…\" Jonathon tried not to groan dramatically, that was Timothy's thing and not his. \"Is there singing?\" he asked, and there was no way to hide that hint of reluctance in his voice. \"Well of course,\" Timothy rolled his eyes, obviously referring to the fact that the word 'opera' was in the title. \"But it's nice and bloody, which I thought might keep your attention.\" Jonathon paused. \"… It's bloody?\" Timothy chuckled, moving his head so that his chin was now on Jonathon's shoulder. \"The first time I watched it I had nightmares,\" he promised. \"And that was only last year.\" Jonathon was quiet, watching a commercial. \"See, there you go making me feel guilty about this tennis game, you cheater,\" he said, sounding quite upset and causing Timothy to break into incredible, shaking laughter. \"It's my nature,\" Timothy teased, \"And you love me anyway.\" \"You got that right.\" Again, that hint of blush was on Jonathon's neck and Timothy could feel his own redness traveling further up his face. He wouldn't say it was from embarrassment, but merely from happiness. \"So, singing, huh?\" Jonathon said once the game came back on, smiling a little. \"I guess it's only fair.\" \"You know,\" Timothy started, an easy grin slipping on his face, \"For a guy who hates singing so much you sure stuck through that musical last year.\" \"Well,\" and Timothy could tell that he was going to say something cheesy from the way Jonathon broke into a rare, goofy smile, \"I like listening to you sing.\" Timothy couldn't bring himself to play along as Jonathon had before about the sports, finding that he was just a little too shy for that. Instead, he just picked up his hand and gently brushed it over Jonathon's, which was still occupying Timothy's waist, in a gesture of appreciation. Jonathon, however, caught Timothy's fingers and intertwined them, rubbing their palms together affectionately. \"I love you,\" Jonathon said sincerely. \"I don't think I tell you that often enough, but I really do.\" Timothy looked down at their hands, still stuck together, and nodded. \"I know. And I love you, too.\" Jonathon smirked. \"For the record, being in love with me and being in love with my ridiculously hot body are two different things.\" \"Oh, shut up,\" Timothy snapped, liking the banter. He turned to make some kind of retort before suddenly stopping short. Looking at Jonathon, he experienced a feeling that had not been so intense since the two of them had been in high school. It wasn't that he had forgotten, but was merely being reminded of just how gorgeous Jonathon really was. And he remembered the new things he had learned to love, like the way Jonathon tilted his head a little to the side when watching something very interesting or how his jaw periodically clenched and unclenched. He didn't think that he'd been so blissfully happy but then realized that Jonathon almost always had this effect on him. Overcome with affection, Timothy leaned his head only slightly forward, intending to kiss his boyfriend senseless and pry his eyes away from that damn television. However, he was met halfway as apparently Jonathon had the same thing in mind. The initial surprise didn't last long for Timothy. Not wanting to be outdone, he took charge by reaching out to cup Jonathon's jaw, sufficiently pulling him closer. He had grown to enjoy being brave in the relationship. \"If we keep this up,\" Jonathon warned as Timothy pulled away for a moment, \"Then I get extra sports next weekend to make up for it.\" \"That's okay,\" Timothy replied, starting to kiss the side of Jonathon's mouth. Then, smiling into Jonathon's lips, he added, \"Aren't there better sports on Sundays, anyway?\" \"Are you asking me to stay over, Mr. Schoolwork?\" Jonathon teased, now turning entirely away from the television to pay better attention to Timothy. Timothy laughed, quieter than before. \"Would you refuse?\" Then, \"It could be like an extended Saturday.\" \"Sounds perfect. I love Saturdays.\"[Chapter 2] A/N: Wow, I got a lot of great feedback from reviewers. :) Thanks so much! There were lots of requests for a sequel, which I'm kind of going to do. I decided that I might just have various oneshots, most of which will take place on a Saturday date to keep with the theme. Does this seem like a good idea? Also, do you think I should do another fluffy oneshot or more of a serious oneshot for the next chapter? I have ideas for both. ;) Please review! :) Disclaimer: I don't own Were The World Mine Jonathon winced when he got up from his couch to greet Timothy. This alone was enough to make Timothy very suspicious. Then, Jonathon hesitated before returning Timothy's affectionate hug, which was also very unusual. And with Timothy's powers of observation he noticed that Jonathon hesitated before sinking back into the couch. He knew it. That boy cut himself up at practice again. Timothy flopped into the available space next to Jonathon. \"So, how has rugby been going?\" he asked innocently, knowing in his gut that there was a reason he never liked rugby. Jonathon shrugged, a subtle movement much more restrained than his usual exaggerated movements. \"Pretty good.\" Jonathon paused, apparently trying to think of a good story. Timothy waited patiently and tried not to act like he was hanging on every word. \"I made a good block yesterday,\" Jonathon finally said. \"This great big huge guy was rushing my buddy, but I stopped him.\" \"Oh, that's good. My tough guy,\" Timothy grinned, elbowing Jonathon gently in the side. He saw Jonathon tense and frowned again. \"It didn't hurt, did it?\" Jonathon shook his head but didn't quite meet Timothy's gaze. A dead give-away. \"Nah, not really. I've got a bit of a bruise, but what else is new?\" \"You always have bruises.\" Timothy knew that his tone was borderline nag and forced himself to stop short. He could tell that Jonathon wasn't in the mood and he wouldn't get anywhere if he pissed Jonathon off. Still, he wanted some answers. He just knew that Jonathon was hiding something, and usually when Jonathon had something to hide it had to do with an injury he didn't want Timothy to worry about. Timothy had learned better than to ask out-right and had taken to craftier methods of getting Jonathon to be honest. \"What do you say we do something else?\" Timothy asked as Jonathon reached for the television remote. His hand hovered over the remote as he digested this suggestion. \"I was thinking we could play a board game or… doesn't your dorm have a foosball thing set up downstairs?\" Jonathon looked shocked and, honestly, reluctant. \"You don't have to do that, Tim. I know you hate foosball. And board games make you twitchy.\" Timothy found himself frowning when Jonathon sent a casual wink his direction. \"We can just sit and watch T.V.\" Timothy stared at Jonathon for a moment, who pretended not to notice, as he tried to think of some other test to confirm his suspicions. Now he was almost positive that Jonathon was hurting badly. He was never this gallant when it came to protecting Timothy's interests. In fact, Jonathon would usually jump at the chance to get Timothy to do something active for a change instead of continuing to sit on the couch like a lazy bum. It was usually a source of argument between the two of them. \"I'm just tired, Timothy,\" Jonathon wearily tried to explain, unable to bear the staring anymore. \"Now, don't stare at me. It's kind of creepy.\" \"Sorry,\" Timothy mumbled, a little offended. He knew he shouldn't be offended, but such a remark usually stung. Jonathon noticed and winced guiltily. \"I'm just not in a very good mood,\" he sighed. \"I fucked up my English exam and now I'm going to have to do weeks of extra credit to keep my grade passing.\" He shrugged with a wide motion and then noticeably flinched, jerking his shoulder back down to an even level. \"Sorry, Tim. It's not your fault.\" \"Oh my god!\" Timothy exclaimed, briefly forgetting about Jonathon's physical woes when presented with this new information \"That's awful, Jonathon. Why didn't you say anything?\" Jonathon just shrugged again, back to the subtle movement instead of the exaggerated one. \"I'm so sorry.\" Instinctually, Timothy started to scoot closer to take Jonathon's hand or rest his head on Jonathon's shoulder. It was in this motion that Timothy got an awful, terrible idea. He glanced down at Jonathon's side, which Jonathon was unconsciously protecting by keeping his arm pressed firmly against his ribcage, and knew the perfect way to expose the injury. Timothy got a little closer, now in a good position to press his nose against the side of Jonathon's head if he wanted. He leaned forward and kissed Jonathon's neck, lightly, and brought a hand up the length of Jonathon's arm. He was sure to be careful, not wanting to make Jonathon hurt too much, but couldn't help but smile when he felt Jonathon jump in surprise. \"What are you doing?\" Jonathon demanded, trying to keep very still. Timothy chuckled. \"I just feel bad that you had such an awful week. Maybe I'm trying to make you feel better.\" Jonathon swallowed and turned his head a little to face Timothy again. He kissed Timothy carefully, almost completely distracting Timothy from his goal. \"That's really sweet of you,\" Jonathon said, smiling honestly for the first time that afternoon. \"I'm so lucky to have a guy like you around. But I'm really—\" Timothy quickly shut Jonathon up by returning his lips back to Jonathon's neck. He knew that the next words out of Jonathon's mouth would try and deter Timothy from his goal and this was probably his last chance. He pressed even closer against Jonathon, relentless, and experienced wonderful victory when he felt Jonathon give up trying to control himself and twist to meet Timothy head-on. The result took the both of them by surprise. Jonathon sucked his breath in so loudly it was almost like a shout and tried to push Timothy off of him (but ended up pushing him of the couch). In a second, Jonathon had jerked back into an upright position, nearly gasping for air. As Timothy regained his balance, Jonathon quickly clutched his ribs with shaky hands. \"I knew it!\" Timothy shouted, almost feeling giddy with having his suspicions confirmed. However, when he tried to climb back onto the couch Timothy was a little horrified, though mostly ashamed, to see that Jonathon's face had turned an awful shade of gray and that his teeth were gritted tightly against pain. This wasn't one of the usual injuries, Timothy could tell right away. \"What's wrong?\" Timothy demanded, hesitantly coming close again. He was no longer smiling. \"Jonathon, what the fuck is going on?\" Jonathon opened one eye warily before clamping it shut again. \"It's nothing. I just got a little banged up in practice, like I said. Don't worry about it.\" Timothy snorted in disbelief, gently moved Jonathon's hands, and then pulled Jonathon's shirt up almost over his head. There, he saw the proof for himself. A pitch-black bruise ran from Jonathon's waist up to his rib area. Two of the ribs seemed to be pushing out a little further than the others. \"Jonathon!\" Timothy didn't even care that he sounded like a nag. \"Jonathon, you have to go to an emergency room. You might have broken something!\" Timothy shook his head in disbelief. He had been hoping for a cut or a gash, nothing too serious. Now he was starting to have a full panic attack. \"This is so irresponsible! How long have you been like this?\" Jonathon ignored the question. \"If I get laid up I could lose my sport scholarship,\" he snapped, yanking his shirt back down and was nearly immobile once more from the pain of the action. To this, he could only let out a disgruntled groan while he tried to recover. Timothy tried his best to ignore the pained sound. He took a deep breath and attempted to push his hysteria to the side. For once, it worked. \"Maybe you only cracked them,\" he tried to reason, his voice strained but calm. \"That takes no time at all to heal, I swear. You just… you have to get this looked at.\" Jonathon looked like he might come up with some other excuse for Timothy to be wrong. However, he just sagged in defeat, looking more helpless than Timothy had ever seen him. \"I know,\" he managed to reply, the color coming in small increments back to his face. Timothy saw this acceptance and was more than a little surprised. Jonathan was usually so against visiting doctors or hospitals that he would walk around with a sprained ankle all day without a complaint. It was something that Timothy himself had never quite understood. He decided not to gloat about his victory, though. Instead, Timothy just managed to put on an encouraging smile and stood up from the couch. \"Come on, let's get your ass up,\" Timothy instructed, taking a hold of Jonathon's good arm. Wincing, Jonathon allowed himself to be pulled up and nearly fell forward onto Timothy once he was. Instead of righting himself, however, Jonathon leaned against Timothy for a minute, completely relaxed. Timothy froze, a little unsure of what to do or what exactly was going on. For a moment he feared that Jonathon had completely passed out. \"I don't know what I would do without you bitching at me all the time,\" Jonathon sighed. He never knew that he could be so grateful for something so annoying. \"Thanks.\" Timothy managed an amused smile at Jonathon's expense. \"You'd probably be laying on the floor when your roommate came back, complaining how you haven't been able to get up for food or water for two days,\" Timothy answered, rubbing Jonathon's good shoulder comfortingly. \"You're so stubborn.\" Jonathon gave a muffled agreement and nearly laughed. The sharp sting of pain held back the laughter, however, and he remembered that he had to keep his upper body still. He managed to pull himself back away from Timothy by himself but let Timothy support him as they headed for the door. \"So, any chance that this'll convince you to give up rugby?\" Timothy asked hopefully as he fished around his jean pocket for his car keys. He wanted to be prepared before heading down the stairs. Also, this familiar action helped calm him so he wouldn't start screaming at Jonathon again. \"Not a chance,\" Jonathon grinned, enjoying the joke. Timothy was always good at making him laugh, even when he was in the worst of moods. \"Nice try, though.\" \"Yeah, well, I can always hope,\" Timothy sighed, maneuvering the two of them out the door. Jonathon pulled the door shut and then realized he would have to hobble down the endless hallway, which led to an endless staircase, and suppressed a groan. This was going to be painful. He decided to try and keep in a good mood he would try and make Timothy blush, a move that was a little petty but mostly born out of amusement. \"Hey, by the way,\" Jonathon began as he limped down the hallway with Timothy. \"Nice going with the whole seduction thing.\" Timothy choked a little, nearly losing his grip on Jonathon's waist. \"You're sneaky.\" \"A guy's got to do what he has to do,\" Timothy defended himself, feeling a little sheepish. He knew he was blushing but decided there was nothing to be done about it. He also decided not to be apologetic. \"It was the only way to get you distracted enough to expose yourself.\" Jonathon chuckled a little, obviously agreeing. Once they approached the staircase, however, Jonathon stopped laughing. He stared down the stairs and then looked imploringly up at his boyfriend. \"What if I promised to stay in bed for two weeks instead of going to the doctor?\" Timothy shook his head firmly. \"I refuse.\" Jonathon sighed, rolled his eyes a little, and then bravely made it down his first step. It was painful but he managed to keep from yelping again. \"Three weeks?\" Timothy smirked and shook his head. \"You're killing me.\" \"Come on you big baby,\" Timothy encouraged, taking the step with Jonathon. \"It won't be so bad.\" They made it down several more steps in a concentrated silence. Jonathon was staring down at the upcoming steps worriedly, taking each one with a calculated and careful step. Timothy was full concentrated on Jonathon, trying to determine how much support would be needed for each stair. \"You'll stick around, right?\" Jonathon suddenly asked, wincing as he took another step while Timothy tried his best to brace against him. \"When we get to the hospital, I mean. Do you have to leave?\" Timothy shook his head and smiled, happy to know that Jonathon wanted him there. \"I was planning on being here all day anyway.\" He squeezed Jonathon's hand when he nearly stumbled going down the third step and let out a great hiss of pain. \"Good.\" Jonathon waited to continue until after he had successfully gone down the next step. \"Doctors freak me out.\" Timothy had to strangle a single, hysterical laugh. He sensed it wasn't a laughing matter. \"Well, that explains a lot.\" Jonathon just got closer to Timothy for support and grunted an affirmative.

Disclaimer : I do absolutely not own the film Were the World mine, all credit to the rightful owner. And I also do not own the quotes from A Midsummer Night's Dream, honor to the Genius master of the play : William Shakespeare. The Raven and the Dove School was great. That is if your name is Gorgeous Jonathan Cordon and that you are the star of the rugby team. If you have the added bonus of being as manly as they come and of having the girliest girlfriend named Becky; then you're definitely in. Sadly if your are called Timothy and that you do not have a girly girlfriend named Becky, and that you enjoy too much looking at your fellow students in an all boys school; then you are thoroughly fucked - pardon my french. Jonathan and Timothy were two very different sides of two very different coins. The gap between them was as huge as the one between London and Tokyo. But they do say opposite's attract. Not that Jonathan was attracted by the lonely boy, no of course not. It's just that he did feel a pang of pity every time one of the boys picked on him. It was in dodge ball this time that Tim received his punch of the day - by the ball you understand. By the time they all went to the changing room, a nasty purple and yellow bruise had formed right under left eye. The boys continued to taunt the poor lad, things Jon didn't even listen to. Timothy stayed calm though, he didn't even seem to register the insults; it was only when Cooper called him Timmy that he answered : \"My name's Timothy\" Jonathan admired his temper and deliberately changed slowly. He stayed behind with Timothy, for an instant, if only to show he was against what those full of prejudice bastards did. \"Do you need some ice ?\" He asked casually, knowing full well that he was the only who'd bother asking. \"I can handle it\" Timothy replied and in those words Jonathan heard his cue to leave. He wouldn't stay when he was obviously unwanted. It seemed Timothy wasn't even surprised anymore, and that seemed somehow odd to Jonathan. He couldn't quite put his finger on why it did. Next was 's lesson. was an odd woman. She seemed to know every single line from every single one of Shakespeare's works, and amused herself by making her students repeat it all as they had to write in verse. Her work was her passion and each phrase she used seemed to have required years of careful thought and attention. Jonathan quite liked her though, he thought she was amusing if nothing else. During the lesson he dared a glance at Timothy, who stared out to the wall as if he saw a naked boy dancing atop the teacher's desk; full of wonder and honest surprise. \" What Angel wakes me from my flowery bed ? \" Jonathan repeated with an absent mind; he was still looking vaguely at Timothy. At the end of the lesson distributed leaflets to them all. The senior play this year was to be A Midsummer night's Dream by none other than William Shakespeare. All seniors were required -forced- to audition on Friday. Jonathan didn't mind; he just hoped all this wouldn't interfere too much with his training. As it happens, the audition was so far in the back of his mind that training went absolutely fine. He enjoyed it, training with the lads, out in the open; with a painfully faithful Becky watching, sitting alone with a friend for the entire world to see. He scored and then as captain called a Time Out . He went to Becky, kissed her gently on the lips and then faintly saw a figure between the bars. It was Timothy. Their eyes locked for a moment, Jon felt slightly odd. But then he turned to Becky and finally said in a teasing tone : \"So you think we're ready for the competition then ?\" Becky smiled and tucked some stray hair away. \"They'll win as long they have you\" She said and Jon really wished she hadn't. She always went out of her way to tell him that kind of things, to compliment him or anything. And he'd rather not. They'd been together for some time, she needn't flirt any more. As the Audition neared, Jonathan felt rather calm. He passed after Cooper, who when he came out, proclaimed that the play was very gay. made him recite poems and love proclamations. Jonathan didn't find the play gay at all; sweet certainly but never gay. He wasn't an actor, but all in all he thought he did well. Then he went to change for training. His compatriots spent their time mocking the play and Timothy especially. He's going to play the fairy, Cole said with certainty and a hint of disgust. They waited in front of the doors, as a late arrival was passing his audition. Jonathan only vaguely listened. He had passed his own audition, and that's that. But then whoever started the lou lou lous. Lou lou lous he himself had sung a few moments prier; but his were nowhere near as contagious as these. Then the boy started singing and Jonathan closed his eyes to enjoy. We fairies that do run, From the presence of the sun, We follow Darkness Like a dream. \"Who is it ?\" Cole asked beside him. Now, Jonathan felt curious too. He dared a glance through the door and couldn't look away. It was Timothy. Shy queer Timothy. Their eyes met and it sparked something. Jon felt some thing in his stomach. It wasn't a I'm hungry , or a I'm ill . He couldn't define it, so he continued watching. We fairies that do run, From the presence of the sun, We follow Darkness Like a dream. And that's what it felt like : a dream. Timothy : Puck Jonathan : Lysander Thus read the beginning of the cast list. Jonathan was Lysander; the man that knew love but was forced to love another. We have mistaken quite, and stolen lover's hearts away in spite . He was in love - in the play. Timothy was next to him, equally looking at the list. Jon put an arm on his shoulder. \"Looks like I'm one of the lovers\" He said by means of conversation. He wanted to talk to Timothy; why he wasn't sure, but he wanted him to have at least some one. Marc pushed him out of the way to see, and started complaining about his role. He left with a last : \"What's Thisbe ? It that a chick ?\" Thisbe was Pyramus' lover of course, in the play Nick Bottom and company perform for the wedding. Timothy started to leave but Jonathan felt he had not quite said what he ought to. \"Nice Pipes\" He called after him. When Timothy turned round he added \"I heard your audition\" Jon then walked away. He didn't necessarily know where the compliment came from, but he had said it, and he was honestly glad that he did. \"My gentle Puck, come hither\" Oberon said and Jon nearly snorted at that. No one thought Timothy was gentle, they all saw him as disgusting. But he moved swiftly through the lines and over the stage. Jonathan saw nothing in him that wasn't gentle. He did later on though. He was just training the boys for the upcoming match, forcing them perhaps more than was strictly necessary. Marc had just fallen face first in the mud - and serve him right - when Timothy came storming towards them all. He had never seemed more angry, or more alive. \"Who did it ?\" He demanded angrily \"Was it you ?!\" Jab after jab the lads threw at him. What crawled up your gay ass ? They said and laughed all together too much. Jonathan saw the anger rising in Timothy, but he couldn't risk a fight amongst his team. Feeling awfully brave, he put a hand Tim's shoulder. \"Let's walk\" He said confidently. Timothy probably would have come, had Cole not shot him another insult. Timothy threw himself on Cole and the first hit flew. Jonathan allowed them one punch each, because they both deserved it, and then he pulled Cole away. Timothy fumed alone, grabbed his bag and walked away. His white shirt had a thick green mark - Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain - Jon saw as he sent a last fleeting glance his way. Jonathan could appreciate, if not understand Timothy's course of action. When he went to see Becky, who had seen the entire ordeal, the first thing she said was : \"What a stupid fag\" And Jon almost wished Timothy would come back to hit her as well. He wisely kept his own shut though. He had nothing against the boy and didn't understand everyone's hatred towards him. Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind. And therefor is winged Cupid painted blind . That night as he fell asleep on his copy of a Midsummer night's dream - the scene where the pansy's juice is sprinkled on his eyes - he dreamt in song. It was a tune he had perhaps heard before. He was somewhere on stage, though he didn't know, for his eyes remained shut. He heard a sweet somewhat familiar voice, near his ear; and a hand caressed him gently. My ear should catch your voice, My eye your eye, My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody, My tongue, your tongue; Were the world mine. It seemed it wasn't his choice when his eyes would open, but they did. Jon found his voice carrying on stage as if pulled out of him. What angel wakes me from my flowery bed ? I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again. Mine ear is much enamored of thy note, And so is my eye enthralled to thy shape. I'll follow thee. I'll follow thee. As Jonathan looked at Timothy, marred by the most beautiful wings, looking in every way like an angel, Jonathan knew that he would follow him. They´ll make a heaven out of this hell. By God, they will. Whether consciously or not, it doesn´t matter; but Jonathan reached out as Timothy reached down. The feeling of their clasped hands was fleeting, like it wasn´t really there. But they sung together, words Jonathan didn´t even understand. Fairies away, fetch me that flower. Up and down, up and down. I will lead them up and down. What fairies and what flower ? He didn´t know and he didn´t care. For the moment he understood it all. And as he looked Timothy in the eye, it made sense to pluck the single flower that was painted purple, and hand it to him. It didn´t make all that much sense when he was awake though. After the dream, it seemed Timothy plagued his mind somehow. He didn´t look different, just not the same. Every time Jonathan looked over to Timothy, he was somehow reminded of how his hand had felt, how real it had felt. The strange feeling in his stomach tenfolded. Sometimes after lessons, Jonathan would stay behind, just to ask Timothy if he was alright, or sometimes just to say hello. The feeling went away whenever he was close to Timothy. Jonathan found himself being unusually angry or simply unpleasant with his team mates. He was in a good mood for basketball though. Timothy too it seemed. He joined in well, managed to get the ball a few times too. Once he even scored. Jonathan was glad for him; so glad for himself too that he approached and smacked right on the bottom. \"Good Form\" He said with a smile. He didn´t care it was flirting. He had enjoyed doing it, probably even more than Timothy enjoyed receiving it. He jogged on with a victorious smile. That evening, there was a mass of arguments around the dinner table. Cooper and his parents came to dinner at Jonathan´s, and the parents are as bad as him. It didn´t take more than fifteen minutes before they all started. Cooper had come to mention that he had to play a girl in a Midsummer night´s dream, and his parents went at it. It´s outrageous this and it´s preposterous that. Jonathan´s parents did too. He himself stayed silent; he was the only in the room who was entire behind the play. His mind was somewhere else though; far away on the stage. Too far away to be true really. Rehearsal was fun. As far as Jonathan was concerned, rehearsal was very fun indeed. Being Lysander, he of course had every tool to flirt with the boys, and make them uncomfortable. He was almost throwing himself onto the guy, who was pretending to be a girl, telling him quite elegantly to sleep in his bed. It was his revenge; to act gay in front of a homophobe, without said homophobe twigging that he might just be gay. Jonathan had done a bit of thinking on that department. After that dream, and after observing Timothy for a while, he concluded that he might be gay. He´s not saying that he is of course, but he might be. He was pushed against the tree and pretended to fall asleep. He opened his eyes to see Timothy come on stage though. He had splendid white wings on his back and moved with elegance over the stage. He acted like a professional, reciting his lines as if he had done it for years. Timothy stood next to sleeping Cole and said what he had to. Cole being Cole, coughed a : \"Fag\" Timothy didn´t seem to care though, he just continued his role and kneeled down in front of Jonathan. The latter kept his eyes closed as he had to, but he desperately wanted to see what was going on. \"Upon thine eyes I throw\" He recited sweetly \"All the power this charm doth owe\" A liquid substance was thrown onto Jonathan´s face. He rubbed at his eyes, it was cold. When he opened his eyes, his vision was vague, he could hardly see around him. But his sight cleared after a second. He still saw nothing, nothing except the face of what had to be an angel. How had he never seen ? Never seen just how beautiful this man was ? His breath was taken away from the mere sight in front of him. Everything inside of him pushed him forward, like invisible hands. His heart lept in ways it had never done before. He searched the eyes of that Divine creature, he couldn't think of anything else. The world was gone. There was just him and this angel; Timothy. He touched the cheek, compelled to wonder if such beauty could even exist. \"Timothy ?\" He murmured, making sure of this miracle. And as Timothy smiled back at him, hesitantly almost, he felt like the world was perfect. They were perfect. He had never felt this strongly about anyone before. He knew what this was, it had to be. It had to be... \"Nasty!\" Cole exclaimed, breaking the spell. Timothy got up, left Jonathan on the floor. Jon felt like he couldn't breathe. The world around him crumbled to pieces, it was meaningless without Tim near. He looked up, immediately searching for his meaning; but all he saw was laughing discreetly, and all his class mates were suddenly kissing each other. He didn't care though; what could it possibly matter ? He then saw splendid wings flying away from him. For a fleeting second Timothy looked back and sent him a sort of smile. Jonathan could have died there and then. He was so absorbed by the moment that he hardly saw Tim leave. He had it coming. From day one, everything had been building up to this. Everything made sense now. He was in love. He was bloody well in love! Gay or not, who cares. World or without, what does it matter. Jonathan was in love! His legs pushed him forward, for he could not let his love run away any longer. His instinct, his brain and his heart had all become one; they were all pushing him in the same direction, there where he belonged. He ran and ran, like his feet carried him without knowing where to go. He saw Timothy further away, another boy was throwing himself on him. Jonathan would have none of it. His world was a maze, he had to go left and right, not seeing where to go, but every road led to the middle, there where Timothy would be. He put a hand on his love's chest, finally he felt whole. \"Far I've chased you. Sweet, why run so fast ?\" He said, and looked Timothy deep in the eye. The latter looked back and answered : \"You've got practice\" But Jonathan didn't hear that anymore. Underneath his hand he felt the thumping of Timothy's heart and it overwhelmed him with a sense of power. A glowing light around Tim thumped in rhythm. \"I can see your heart beat\" He said in wonder. But he hadn't time to see, to feel; for a hand reached over his shirt and pulled him backwards. \"I'm not done here yet, sport\" The girl said and carried on yelling at Timothy. \"Was this the accident ? You seducing my boyfriend?\" She demanded. Jonathan approached again but a single glance from Timothy kept him silent by his side. \"Yes, Max was the accident, but I'll fix it, I promised\" Tim swore to the girl. When he turned to Jon, the latter almost stopped breathing. \"Let's walk\" He said and Jon was only too happy to oblige. He put his hand on Tim's back, it appeased the yearning. They both completely ignored the calls behind them, or the yelling, or the dancing. They just walked away; like a master and his faithful dog. Jonathan was enraptured by the sight of Timothy, by his every movement and every sound. They needn't speak, not right now. For the moment Jonathan was satisfied in watching, just watching, victorious as he was invited by Tim. The town dissolved; and the glow grew as it faded. But then they could faintly hear becoming louder the calls of : \"Timothy! Timmy!\" The tone sounded reassuring, so Jonathan stopped Tim and looked behind him at the woman running towards them. \"Do you know her ?\" Jonathan asked pleasantly as he was still in magic. \"She's my mother\" Timothy answered and Jon saw his moment right there. This first impression was important, to both of them. As soon as she arrived, Jonathan took her hand and said : \"I'm Jonathan. You have a brilliant son\" The smile she sent him worked wonders for his pride but then she exclaimed : \"Oh shit\" And he thought he'd lost, but she added \"Sorry, we've just had our nails done\" Jonathan moved back Timothy, which was the place where he felt most comfortable. Another woman came and introduced herself. Jonathan had vaguely heard of her; she was Nora Fay. She shook hands with Timothy and then turned towards him with an amazed smile. \"Jonathan Cordon, well, you look quite luminous\" She said and Jon felt proud at her rendering. He was luminous, and so was his love. \"I'm in love\" He said, admitting finally out loud. He was proud of his feelings and cherished them dearly. Nora seemed delighted. \"Yes! This is exactly what I mean by rising above Donna. Your son compatriots with Morgan Hill's star rugby player\" Jonathan almost rolled his eyes. For a second his hand touched Timothy's and he felt compelled to scream to the world what they were. He was suddenly so very proud, so very alive. He had never been so incredibly happy. But he didn't want to scare Timothy away so he announced quite calmly : \"We're not compatriots, we're boyfriends\" Nora Fay's smile slowly faded. She looked at them like she was expecting them to soon announce it was all a great joke. \"I'm sorry ?\" She asked in mild shock. Timothy turned to Jon, looked at him for a second and said : \"We have got to go\" And he dragged Jon with him without even touching him. Jon felt like there was a string attaching the two of them together, like a barrier kept them from being far off. Just as Jon felt they could finally be alone, a car stopped close to them. \"Jonny!\" Becky yelled quite happily. Only then did Jon remember that he had a girlfriend. With Tim around, he forgot. He gripped his boyfriends sleeve, keeping them both away from the female. She said something but he didn't listen. He only had eyes for Tim, and he didn't want him embarrassed. \"I've outgrown you\" He said firmly to Becky. It was true. He couldn't care about her and her ways, not anymore. He held tighter onto Timothy's sleeve. \"Is this a joke ?\" She demanded. Jonathan felt angry at those words. How dare she consider this a joke! \"Don't mock my love. Who couldn't change a raven..\" He looked at her, showing clearly his displeasure; and then his eyes softened as he laid eyes on his boyfriend \"..for a dove ?\" Timothy was more than beautiful. He was amazing, every single part of him was. \"What ?\" Becky exclaimed and Jon glared at her, still holding on. \"Fly away\" He said. Becky stormed away in anger, ordering him to come pick her up at seven. But he wouldn't. At seven, he would be with his love, and every seven come that moment did he want to be with him. They looked at each other for a moment. But then Timothy asked him to wait there, and his vision regained something. It was like something important was missing and suddenly nothing made sense anymore. He looked at the bike, missing already the presence that should be on it; but he didn't understand why. Nothing made sense, the world had gone mad. Until Timothy returned with the light; the world blurred again but the greater lines were defined. Jonathan took the bike and they walked away. \"Where are we going ?\" Jon asked. Timothy shook his head. \"Anywhere, as long as it's away\" They walked aimlessly for a moment, abandoning finally the bike in some shed. They walked further away from town, talking randomly about the madness that crept into the students. They mentioned the play; how beautiful Timothy would be as Puck. Jonathan kept glancing at his boyfriend's hand, hanging loosely like it was waiting. He took his courage in two hands and grasped it. Never before had the world seemed more perfect than when Timothy gripped his hand back. They walked around town till later. Jonathan talked about his judgemental parents, about his older sister whom he never talked to, about the importance of rugby in his life and all that. He learned a little about Timothy´s home life, about Franky and Max, about his mother and even about his coming out. Tim never mentioned a father though, Jon wondered why. They sat down on a bench near Timothy's house. The day was growing darker and the moonlight made Tim look all the more angelic. Jonathan could just sit and stare for hours. \"Would you like to go to the festival with me ?\" He finally asked. Timothy looked at him with a searching look. \"Are you sure you want to go ?\" He replied. Jonathan wanted to scream that yes, he did want to go. He wanted the world to see them, he wanted them to understand. \"Yes\" Timothy shot him an almost invisible smile. \"Alright\" They were only thirty feet away from the festival when the hesitation crept up. Timothy pulled his hand back and leaned against a tree. Jonathan felt his hesitation or plain fear through the glow around them. \"Let's not go\" He said. Jonathan looked at the festival and then back at Tim. He wanted them to be official to the world. \"Why ?\" He asked. He got closer to Tim, trying to reassure him. \"You're different now\" He answered simply. What was different ? Jon had always loved Tim; he just didn't realize before. \"Come on, what about cotton candy mountain ?\" He repliedm playing with his boyfriend´s vest, trying his best to keep him at peace. Timothy shook his head. \"I don't think your ready for this\" Jonathan smiled at that. He thought it was awfully sweet of Tim to be concerned for him. But he was ready for it all. \"I cross my heart\" He answered with a smile. Timothy wouldn't take it, he leaned against the tree. \"Seriously. I was being beaten up for being queer before I even knew what that was\" Jon could have hit a tree, he knew the students were bad, but he didn't like hearing it out loud. He never wanted that to happen ever again. \"Well don't worry, I'll protect you\" \"I don't need someone to protect me\" Timothy answered and Jonathan looked down. He knew his boyfriend did not need protection, but that's all he had to offer him. \"You didn't even like me yesterday remember ?\" Timothy added sadly. Jonathan indeed tried to remember yesterday, but nothing pointed out to him not liking Tim. For all he knew there had been something all along. \"Sure I did\" He replied and put his hand on Timothy's shoulder, reassuring him, looking him deep in the eye he said : \"But I fell in love with you today\" He then pulled at his sleeve \"Come on\" \"Stop\" Timothy said exasperated. It seemed to Jonathan that he didn't see, exactly what he was. He hesitantly touched him again. \"You're perfection\" He breathed and meant every letter of it. Timothy was perfect. His eyes, his wings, his words. Everything was perfect. \"That's the Pansy talking\" The what ? The flower. Jonathan didn't care about the flower. He loved Timothy, and no juice could have made him fall in love. He knew this was true. \"Come on, it'll be fine\" He said and Tim finally gave in. They held each other's hand. \"There's a kissing booth\" Jon mentioned suggestively. Timothy chuckled and shot him a sweet look. \"Is there really ?\" He said and it completely turned Jonathan on. When they arrived at the festival, people were still at the opening ceremony, nothing had really started yet. Timothy pulled his hand and said : \"Come on, we´ll come back later\" Jonathan was disappointed but he could see why the festival wouldn´t be too fun at the moment. They walked further away. There was a little hill with a view over the festival, they went there. \"It´s nice here\" Jonathan said. He was facing Timothy. The view was pretty amazing but Jonathan only had eyes for Tim. The night air washed over them, colliding with their invisible bubble without ever touching them. Jonathan felt warm, he felt great. He felt so very light in the serene atmosphere. Timothy looked at the festival and then at the ground. \"I hate this town though\" He said \"I can´t wait to graduate and get the hell out of this place for ever\" And there it was, laid open on the table, Jonathan´s fear. He knew Tim hated the town, he knew he wanted to leave; but he tried to forget it. This town was his home. If Timothy left, he´d leave him behind. He´d be alone, in this place where the world made no sense. He smiled with fear. \"It´s not that bad\" He reasoned. Timothy seemed almost amused. \"Try looking at it through my eyes\" \"What about your family ?\" Jon was picking at straws then, he just wanted his boyfriend to stay. \"You mean my mum ?\" \" Everyone \" He emphasised, hoping there was something, anything , to keep him here. \"There´s just my Mum. On a good day\" Timothy answered. Jonathan didn´t know what to say, didn´t want to talk about him leaving. He looked down, wanting desperately to reach out, keep him here with him. \"I don't want to go back\" Timothy added. \"To what ?\" Jonathan asked. \"Real life\" Jon smiled at that. Tim thought it wasn't real, or a dream perhaps. But it was real, it felt real. \"This is real\" He said. Timothy looked thoughtful for a moment and whispered : \"Yeah, but so, so far away from where I woke up this morning\" This morning was far away. And even if it was near, this morning was meaningless, and empty. This morning, Jon woke up alone, they both did. \"People were staring at us\" Timothy added with a chuckle after a while. \"Well stare back\" Jon told him. He looked at his boyfriend; and he had to say it. The timing was right, just as Timothy started worrying. He searched his eyes, looking for anything that might stop him. But there was nothing; in fact everything seemed to encourage him. \"People are just jealous\" He finally said \"Because I'm with the best fellow in town\" They looked at each other. Jonathan's breath was taken away by the sheer beauty, but also by the strength of their bond. Those invisible hands were pushing him again and his entire being cooperated. He leaned closer slowly, allowing Timothy the time. But they got closer and closer, up to the point where Jon could feel Tim's breath, could see his pupils dilate. He kept the eye contact firm, but closed them with Timothy's, just as their lips touched sweetly. Timothy put a hand on his cheek and pulled him closer still. And then it really was heaven. Balls of lightning shot through him, he was electrified, petrified. Amazed. His mind was completely spinning. He was still in a daze for a second when they parted. He smiled at his boyfriend; now they could handle the world. \"People can change\" He then added, because it had to be said. Timothy leaned back, bit on his lower lip like he reveled in the feeling. He smiled to himself and answered : \"If they experienced that , they might\" Jon felt proud of himself, for making Tim say that. Their gaze simultaneously turned to the view, back to the festival; and right there, in the open, for the entire city to see, were Cole and Cooper, kissing the living daylights out of each other. It amused Jon, really, how those two homophobes were together. \"How many people are in this town ?\" Timothy then asked. Jonathan wasn't sure about that. They were jumping through subjects faster than mastermind. \"Ten thousand maybe\" He replied. Timothy started getting up. \"Let's go\" He said. Jonathan took his hand. \"Why ?\" \"I have got people to change\" The festival had started by then. People were drinking, dancing and playing games. Timothy and Jonathan came hand in hand; everyone stared at them but Jon was too proud to care. The evening was turning out to be pretty amazing. Until Franky, followed by Max, arrived. \"Game's over, sport\" She sighed. Max immediately threw himself onto Tim yelling dramatically : \"Missed you!\" Jon saw red for an instant but Franky pulled the boy away before he could. It was a match of pulling and pushing. Franky was pulling Max, Max was pulling Jon, and Jon was pushing Max. The darker grabbed him and yanked him away. \"Leave him alone. He's mine!\" Jonathan retorted. He'd never felt this strongly, this passionately. Max faced him. \"Stop teasing him and go after your cheerleader\" He said. Jon suddenly felt compelled to tell him, to make him understand; not just him but Timothy especially. \"Any love I had for her is gone, I swear\" He pleaded. Timothy was there by his side it seemed, he pushed the boy away, reasoning : \"Max Max. You love Franky, you know I know\" The girl dragged her boyfriend away with an exasperated : \"Yes, thank you\" But Max fought his way out of her grip, relentlessly. \"I love you\" He said looking Tim in the eyes \"My tears do tell the truth\" Jon almost smashed his head there and then. How dare he say it so easily! Every one knew he loved his girlfriend so how dare he saw that! Thankfully, Franky was as relentless. She dragged him away again, yelling something about being officially insane. Then one of them tripped and they fell to the floor. But Jon could not concentrate on that matter much longer, for someone started prodding him hard. He turned round to a raging Becky. \"You asshole!\" She screamed, pushing him still. Jon was not in the mood. \"Stop it!\" He countered and then he was pulled from the other side by Timothy, who yelled : \"He's mine\" Jon let the words wash over him. They had both said exactly the same thing. That meant, they belonged to each other, didn't it ? He saw Timothy use his flower on his ex and her friend. They were blinded for a while and then laid eyes upon Franky. Jon saw in their reaction, what had happened to him earlier. But it was real for him. He had concluded that times over and he would conclude again. This was real. But he removed his gaze from the girls as he saw in the corner of his eye, Max leaning onto Timothy again. \"Timothy, I love you. I swear on my life I do\" He said. Jon pushed him off, desperate to find his love. \"I love you more than he ever could\" He said and it was true. No one could love anyone more than he loved Tim. \"Prove it\" Max challenged, Jon was not afraid. His love only made him stronger. \"You wanna fight ?\" He proposed challenging. \"You're on, Jack boy!\" Franky jumped on Max's back, but Jon hadn't the time for all this. He was going to prove to the stupid man, to the world, and especially to Timothy, exactly how deep his feelings ran. \"You coming ?\" He asked impatiently. Max freed himself, sent a last remark of unlove to Franky and turned round. \"Follow if you dare\" Jonathan said and then walked away. He knew Max would follow. The fight was hardly something to write home about. Sure, both fought with all their might, with all their love; but Jonathan had had certain previous training. Max was a poser, a jester. Jon had had hours of tough work behind him. The love factor played a part too though. Max was pushed entirely by the flower to go against his true mind; he had two opposing poles. Whilst Jonathan, he truly did love Timothy, he had the advantage of actually being real, for a part. Though that does remain a secret amongst them. For the world, both Max and Jon equally love Timothy. In any case, Jonathan had but to throw a few well aimed punches, avoid a couple of minor ones and he'd win. Max's shirt was stained in his own blood as he crawled away beaten and overcome. Jon leaned at a tree, recuperating his breath. Only then did he start to think. Without his need to prove himself, without Timothy's presence; his mind seemed clear. And yet so detached. It's like he wasn't really there. He felt especially heavy, like he had to do something. Visions of yesterday, of today, and even of tomorrow he saw. There was something wrong with all of them, but for the life of him, he couldn't figure what it was. As the images dissolved, his mind cleared a single bulb that shined onto Timothy. Timothy came with his bike, he was slow. Jon got scared for a moment, that the fight might have been the wrong thing to do. But Timothy came and appeased him with a single sweet kiss. \"Thank you\" He whispered; and Jonathan knew that if he had done something, he was forgiven. They walked away together. The town had only one lake and boy was it amazing.. It was more like a large pond. They sat near it, splashing aimlessly their feet in it. Jonathan looked at his boyfriend's face in the moonlight. \"You are Divine\" He breathed. Timothy blushed a little bit. \"You won't think so tomorrow\" He replied. Jonathan put his hand on his cheek, mesmerizing. \"You'll always look beautiful\" He promised. Timothy ignored the remark, but a faint smile was drawn on his face. Jon then slipped into the water, holding his hands out. \"Swim with me\" Timothy chuckled, took the offered hands, got closer and replied with a smile : \"No\" Jonathan could have fallen all over again. He laughed and splashed some water on his boyfriend, who in turn threw some grass at him. That carried on, till Timothy -slightly wet- said : \"Come on, I'm tired\" So they both went further away. Jonathan found a tree and laid against it. He opened his arms for Tim. It took a moment but then Timothy did put his back against Jon's chest. All shall be peace. They formed one being; and it was amazing. Jon let his hands fall on Tim and caressed him gently. \"I love you\" He murmured now that he felt at ease. And he meant it with every fiber in his being. Timothy just twined their fingers together, but stayed silent. Jonathan felt worried at the silence. \"Sweet, does thou love me ?\" He asked concerned. Tim looked away at the ground. \"I'd rather not say it\" \"Why ?\" Timothy toyed with his hands and sighed. \"Because tomorrow only my words will be true\" He answered. Jon would have wondered at the true meaning of that phrase, had he not been too busy catching what he wanted. All he heard in those words was Timothy's discreet confession. Tim sighed nervously and turned slightly in Jon's arms. \"Let's not talk. Let's just sleep\" He said and put his ear over his lover's heart, and his arm around his waist. Jon held him close, snuggling into him. They fell asleep in that fashion. And the dreams they had then, felt vague from the one they were living. In his sleep, Jonathan was being pulled by fairies and he faintly heard them sing something like The will of man is by your reason swayed . Timothy woke Jonathan up when he himself was awoken by his mum. \"Hi sugar. I gotta get you to the school\" She said simply. Timothy turned to Jon and whispered a quick : \"The play\" And then he stood up and left. Something seemed wrong. Tim was acting distant, fearful even. He was expecting something, or at least worrying about something. It could have been for the play of course, but it felt deeper, more profound somehow. Jon walked next to Tim but the latter wouldn't even look at him. And by the way was smiling next to them, she knew what was to come too. \"Is anything amiss, love ?\" Jon whispered into his boyfriend's ear as they neared the school. Said boyfriend still refused to meet his eye and it hurt. \"Nothing\" He replied quickly but it didn't appease the unease in Jonathan's heart. The crowd was complete with stars and bolts in their eyes, they waited patiently, or impatiently. Jonathan was in costume, but he was alone, for Timothy had roles all over the place, and their time together at that moment was restrained. Jonathan watched as Theseus and Hippolyta talked of their upcoming wedding; he played Hermia's forbidden love; he saw Oberon and Titania fight; Puck gone to serve his master; he got juice splattered in his eye; he fell in love with sweet Helena. Well anyway, the play run it's true course and all did well. Now came the scene where Puck pretends to be Demetrius first and then Lysander. Jonathan was in make up and recited his lines bravely on stage. \" Where art thou, proud Demetrius ? \" He asked and Timothy as Puck hid behind him, drawing him to different grounds. He did the same to Demetrius and then met Lysander again. \" The villain is much lighter heeled than I: I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly. That fallen am I in dark uneven way,And here will rest me. Come, thou gentle day !\" Jonathan recited, putting a few nice movements in two. Then he lied down, fell asleep in wait of his enemy. With his eyes closed he still listened and greatly enjoyed listening to Timothy. \" Ho, ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com'st thou not ?\" Tim recited mockingly and it almost made Jon smile. \" Where art thou ? \" Marc, who played Demetrius said. \" Come hither, I am here \" \" Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear, if ever I thy face by daylight see: Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed. By day's approach look to be visited \" And then Demetrius too fell asleep, Jonathan knew and spied discreetly. Helena played by Cole, entered and proclaimed : \" O weary night, ô long and tedious night, abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east, that I may back to Athens by daylight, from these that my poor company detest: And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye, steal me awhile from mine own company \" As the other two, she slumbered. Jonathan peaked through his lashes, saw beautiful Puck enter with his wings. Timothy acted surprised. \" Yet but three? Come one more; Two of both kinds makes up four. Here she comes, curst and sad: Cupid is a knavish lad, thus to make poor females mad \" He recited while pulling Cooper as Hermia onto the stage. Cooper, now under influence gay, acted professional and even with conviction the saddened Hermia. \" Never so weary, never so in woe, bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers; I can no further crawl, no further go; My legs can keep no pace with my desires \" And he fell down, not too far from Jonathan. Jonathan then had to close his eyes; but he felt Timothy near and the temptation to see him was huge. He had to bite the insides of his cheek to stay in his play. Timothy kneeled by him, he could feel it. A loud and almost sinister music sounded then. Timothy sung and it sounded like something truly beautiful and deep to him. On the ground, Sleep sound. I'll apply To your eye Gentle lover, Remedy. The thunder sounded loud outside and the music picked up. Jonathan feared something, it felt wrong to him. When thou wak'st, Thou tak'st True delight In the sight Of thy former lady's eye. Jack shall have Jill, Naught shall go ill. The man shall have his mare again, And all shall be well. Something wet landed on Jonathan´s eyes. He saw just in time, the flower dissapear from his face. And as the flower dissapeared, so did it . Something deep inside of him, from the core of his very soul, faded. It was pulled out of him, slowly, almost like it wasn´t happening at all. But suddenly he became more aware of the surrounding world and sounds. A fog lifted from his head. Everything existed again. Timothy kneeled in front of him, looked him deep in the eyes. No hands were pushing forward, nothing in him was forcing him. But even with that gone, he looked at Timothy, and he still felt it. Tim looked at him with sadness. \"Goodbye\" He whispered and was off like a shot. Jonathan was too stunned at that time to do anything but stare vaguely. What was a goodbye ? He did not know. Droplets of water pearled onto his face. He looked up but saw not where they came from. \"Is this part of the show ?\" He asked out loud. Marc next to him exclaimed \"Dude, this is cool\" And then they were all called off of the stage. Jonathan did this only vaguely, following his equally dazed class mates. In fact, most of the audience looked like them. Jonathan looked for something that had left him when Timothy sang. But he couldn't see it. Frankie and her hand started the new improved song, telling the drama that Nick Bottom and the others would perform at the end wedding. Pyramus and Thisbe were young beautiful lovers. One day Thisbe got attacked by a lion but she got away. Her mantle had dropped to the floor, and the lion stained it in blood. Pyramus, finding the bloody garment, and thus thinking his love dead, commits suicide. Thisbe, alive and well, then hears of Pyramus' death and also commits suicide. Thus Thisbe ends, adieu adieu adieu. At least that is what I understood. Jonathan of course did not listen. He was too busy staring aimlessly at the floor and not getting his head round what he should. He paid attention when Timothy returned on stage to end the play though. The boy seemed different, somehow. He looked like a man - well a man dressed up as a fairy - and not like a divine creature. He looked human and not angelic. But not anything less attractive. Tim did his ending with conviction and perfect tone. Speaking like he meant every word. If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended, That you've but slumbered here While these visions did appear. And this weak and idle theme No more yielding but a dream. Gentles do not reprehend If you're pardoned we will mend. And as I am an honest Puck, If we have unearnèd luck To 'scape the serpents tongue We will make amends ere long. Else the Puck a liar call. So Goodnight unto you all. Give me your hands if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends. It was in those words that Jonathan understood the play, and indeed what had happened. The second time being wet was the counter cursed, to make the past seem like a distant memory, or a clandestine dream. That everything the flower had done would he reversed. The town would no longer be 90% homosexual; the broken lovers would no longer be apart. Things were back to what they were before; all this was a dream. And what was Jonathan before ? He thought about it as the boys came up on stage hand in hand to receive their well earned applause. Naturally Timothy came last as he was the talk of the theme. He deserved it all. Jonathan couldn't help but smile at how happy Tim seemed to be. Yes. And what were they before ? The play was over and so was the frenzy in town. People suddenly seemed kinder; like their eyes had opened. The world probably seemed worth it then. The anger and prejudice seemed to fade, at least for the time being. had never looked more proud actually. She seemed real pleased with herself as she cleared up the stage with dreamy eyes. Jonathan's eyes had opened too, to something that had been there all along. What was he before ? Indeed a Jack Boy as Max said, a star rugby player, a good actor. And back then he was also very much in love; discreetly and unawares granted, but he was. What were they before ? Nothing really. Both had harbored secret feelings, but together, back then, they were nothing. Perhaps yesterday had been a dream but Jonathan remembered it all too vividly. He remembered thinking that he had loved Timothy all along. This is real , he had said and thought. Then, what was different now ? No hands were pushing him. He hadn't overly dreamy or cheesy notions in mind. He was in control from then on. He was released from a spell, that was designed to release him from other chains. Nothing had to be different, not really anyway. They could be together, and be real together; which they weren't before. His mind was made up. Definitely. Jonathan had asked where Tim would be; she got a sparkle in her eye and pointed at the correct direction. Jonathan pepped himself up, like he did before an important match, and walked up the stairs to the changing rooms. Timothy was there, removing the make up gently from his face with a sort of nostalgia in his eyes. Jonathan paused and simply looked. His stomach did no longer have butterflies, it just did somersaults. But he would Jonathan Cordon, if he couldn't do this. Without the pansy, he had never really been good with words. So he tapped Timothy's shoulder and laid a gentle kiss on his lips. He was pushed away almost immediately, but that was okay. Because it was all still very new, for them both. \"You were unbelievable tonight\" He complimented fondly. Timothy regarded with sincere surprise and disbelief. \"Don-don´t you feel..\" He started stuttering, but Jon reassured him quickly by putting his hand on his leg and answering : \"I feel like myself\" And he really did, because this is what he was. \"It is not enough to speak true, but to speak true\" said from behind them and then Cooper, Max and Franky came in, all complimenting Timothy's acting. Cooper stood between them, looked at one and then at the other before exclaiming : \"You two lovebirds better be at my party tonight, 'cause it's gonna be beyond , alright ?\" He sounded truly gay actually, but he wasn't mocking them. Seemed the flower had changed more than just one. They all left again. Timothy stared at Jon for an instant, like he couldn't believe it. And as if he were touching a dream, he leaned closer, put his hand on Jon's cheek and kissed him slowly. They chuckled to each other like school girls obtaining their first crush. They could work. They faintly heard the retreating footsteps. Jonathan smiled brightly at his once again boyfriend and asked kindly : \"Can you say it now then ?\" Timothy smiled too. \"Only if you say it as well\" For old times sake, Jonathan drew a cross over his chest. \"I cross my heart\" He replied. Timothy gave him a slow kiss and finally said : \"I do love you, handsome Lysander\" Jonathan had to stop the proud grin from maring his face as he replied : \"And I you, Sweet Puck\"[Chapter 2] Author note Hey guys! Just so you know, I hate author notes as much as the next person. But I do have certain things to say, so I will. Firstly I love Were the World mine, I really do; but I haven't studied the film, I just like watching it. And I thought it would be nice to hear Jonathan's side of it all. It was actually very hard to write for me, as I've never written anything remotely like this sort of enforced love, or archaic love. I'd have to admit that the idea was loosely, but really loosely based on Ssatsuki's Were the World Jon's, who also decided to write the entire film from Jon's point of view. I just wanted to choose an another option. Ssatsuki's story is great, really, and I recommend reading it. Though I'd have to admit, that in my opinion, Were the World Jon's is too lovey dovey - no offense. Jon appears to me in the story to be a little too in love, far too sweetly. Again no offense, I do love the story. I just wanted to show a more \"natural\" side to Jon, a bit less profound and a little more like how he looked in the film, in my opinion. I'll just finish on one last note; and that is that I haven't profoundly studied the film, and so I can not see into every movement like Ssatsuki has done, or even know every single line by heart. You've probably fallen asleep by now, and I'm sorry; but it all had to be said. I hope you enjoyed my take on Were the World mine : The Raven and the Dove.

The singing called to him, like some muted, wonderful mermaid. With a carefulness he peeked through the doors, to see a familiar tuft of disheveled, brown hair. His heart broke or soared: Timothy. For some time now Jonathon felt thick stirrings within for the boy. He realized it one English class afternoon; this clarity of feeling dawned on him upon seeing Timothy, brow furrowed, in earnest concentration over whatever he was writing. He blushed, smiled, and he knew. Timothy…had this aching beauty about him. Jonathon had known that he was attracted to boys physically…but Timothy was the first boy he'd ever actually had a crush on. He had started going out with Becky before these feelings for Timothy… And somehow, he just felt a strain to keep up with appearances. Becky was a nice, pretty girl. She didn't deserve heartbreak… But oh, if he could have Timothy…(that singing, that melodic voice drifted over his thoughts) Jonathon shook his head. Pain soared within him, but so be it. He didn't have the courage Timothy had. To be…himself. \"Hey…\" He caught Timothy after the auditions. \"Great pipes,\" he managed to get out casually. Ah, the wonderful quality of having the Nice Guy label: you could talk with anybody, without giving any…additional feelings away. Timothy smiled (a lovely, lovely grin!) \"Err—thanks.\" They made eye contact, smiling at each other. For a moment, neither breathed. Flushed faces staring back at each other, waiting… The hall had cleared out. Jonathon suddenly cleared his throat, a twitch in his fingers A breath in, and[Chapter 2] Jonathan brushed against the inside of Timothy's wrist, lightly, quickly. \"I need to talk with you,\" he said kindly. He heard Timothy suck in a breath of air, a clearly confused expression across his face. They slipped into an alcove in the remote hallway, unseen. Timothy looked up at Jon, eyes clear, set, waiting for words or anything… \"Timothy…\" he whispered out, suddenly quite certain in what he was saying, \"I've only told my family, but…I want to tell you now. \"I'm gay. \"I want to tell you this because…you're just so…I've had feelings for you for awhile. I just…\" Jonathan glanced at those lips…\"I just wanted to tell you.\" He winced because of his own bluntness and awkwardness, simultaneously giving an easy grin. Because he was finally here, with Timothy, a moment he had ached for throughout his high school years. Timothy could hardly believe it. This was his dream, this was all some sort of sugary fog. And yet, here he was, here Jonathan was! His heart hammered to feel that boy's fingertips against his wrist, to hear his voice so close and soft and steady, so near him. Something felt very strange about this. As though Ashton Kutcher would just pop out from some nearby locker in a bit, laughing out, \"You just got PUNK'D!\" \"Are you—being honest with me?\" He forced out, incredulously. There was a pause, and Jonathan stared right into his eyes, earnestly trying to convey…that he was speaking true? \"I know this all sounds so sudden…but I tell you,\" Jonathan whispered out, \"I am.\" He smiled, he let the smile wash over him. This was all so wonderfully strange. Jonathan took a step, so that his eyes rested mere inches from Timothy's. \"Timothy,\" he breathed out, \"can I kiss you?\" His whole body pounded, sweated. He felt confident…and yet, vulnerable. Magical…and yet, so very human, so very body and heart and blood. Timothy nodded quickly, and Jon could hear the brunette's chest seize briefly. His lips dove in, brushing against Timothy's ever so lightly. Jon pulled away for one long second, looking deeply, longingly into those deep brown eyes. And then…bliss. Sighs. He tenderly cradled Timothy's hips, some euphoria leaping within him, around him Then Timothy felt a warm, wet tongue sliding along his upper lip, beginning to dart in, circling against his own tongue. He tasted Jonathan (he never thought this moment could happen) he pressed against Jon harder, lips and body, warm and eager and hungry. Their stomachs hips legs thighs swayed jerked grinded against each other. \"Ohh,\" Timothy whimpered out, as Jonathan left his aching, pounding mouth to kiss along the jawline, lower and lower, tasting Timothy's neck as the boy's Adam's apple squirmed up and down in low groans of joy. His shirt was crinkling up, as Jon's hands slid up Timothy's sides, sending a cold shiver down the boy's arching back. His skin was warm and soft. His skin was warm and soft and Jonathan couldn't think didn't think and only let himself touch and feel and taste all of the loveliness of Timothy. The ridge of the ear, the tender neck behind the ear, the shoulders, the stomach, the chest, the back, the eyelids, the hips, the Jonathan snapped out of his day-dreaming. Oh, it happened. This wasn't a dream, or some idle imagined scene with dancing glittering jocks skipping in the background. Just yesterday, they had been kissing. If Jonathan had ever doubted his sexuality, he knew it now, thoroughly and wholly. He let out a sugary sigh, as he thought of Timothy's short brown hair, so thick and…wonderful. Grin, easy and light He broke up with Becky. This morning. He wasn't ready to come out, and she didn't know about him, but he knew that he had to certainly break up with the girl. She wasn't crushed. She was always a crier but her eyes remained dry, dry…He simply needed to do it, anyway: this was the frail glimmer of clarity he found amidst all of these thoughts of…. Of him, of him sitting in the back of the class in those skinny jeans, of him smiling, of him speaking in that eloquent, low way of his in class, of him blushing as he bashfully played with the back of his hair…. Of him. Jonathan hadn't seen him yet today, and this concern clouded his head. Of him. Jonathan walked down the hallways, towards the cafeteria. He'd been talking to the teacher, so The hallways were dim, clear. Gave room for more thought (overwhelming yet so tempting) and he was more or less meandering, given the fact he didn't feel all that hungry…well, not that kind of hungry… A happy voice called to him from behind. \"Jonathan!\" It was Timothy, elated and out-of-breath. \"Where does this put us?\" Timothy asked, after the two just paused in silence, smiling at each other. \"I broke up with Becky,\" he offered. Timothy broke out into a wide grin. \"That's really all I need to know.\" With that, Timothy stepped forward and cupped a side of Jonathan's warm face, carefully. Suddenly some realization came over his dark eyes. \"Wait—what if someone sees us?\" As he said this he pulled his hand away, wondering. \"You know—it's okay. I don't mind.\" Jonathan whispered out, and he went in for a lovely, lovely kiss. My tongue, your tongue…the world mine.

Chapter 1: A World of Robots Azure hurried down the crowded streets of Chicago, eager to meet up with her friend. She often worried about Del Spooner, not because he couldn't look after himself, more because of his mental health. She knew that even though it had been some years since his accident there was still a little bit of lasting trauma. Mainly Del's loathing of anything robotic and the increasingly changing technology. Most of all though there wasn't many people Del considered friends and trusted; therefore Azure felt honoured to be one of them. It would be good to see him again as he had only recently returned from his vacation. As she neared his apartment the crowded streets still seemed to amaze her. There was so much activity going on, hundreds of people bustled around on business or leisure time. The robots were everywhere, running errands, walking dogs, cleaning the streets, buying supplies or just following their human keepers around. There was so much movement and life that at moments it completely overwhelmed Azure, who was more rurally orientated. Just as she approached his door one of the, now considered an older model, robots paused right in front of the door holding a FedEx package, just as it was opening. She saw Del flinch back in surprise as the robot said happily in his face: \"Good morning sir! Yet another on time delivery from-\" it was cut off when Del pushed it out of the way by its face; grumbling something that Azure couldn't hear. \"Del!\" Azure exclaimed brightly, walking up to him, \"how are you today?\" \"I'm just fine Z,\" he replied, relaxing into a smile. \"You wanna go see Gigi? She's been complaining that you haven't visited her.\" He went to ruffle her hair but she quickly slapped his hand away before continuing down the street. \"You should know by now not to mess with the hair,\" said Azure while Del chuckled, \"and I haven't visited Gigi because of all these assignments! Who knew studying psychology would be such hard work?\" \"Hey, better you than me,\" Del answered. Azure briefly looked up to admire the new NS-5 robotic model upon a huge billboard screen. USR (U.S Robotics) began advertising about a month ago, the new model was sleeker with any main body parts composed of some white synthetic gel type exterior. They had designed the face to be more human with brown eyes and capable of facial expressions; along with a handy USR uplink for daily upgrades. Azure felt a little sad for the old models who would be discarded for this newer, better model. Just then they heard a shout from across the street and the next thing, Farber was running up to them. Azure didn't know much about him other than he was around sixteen and was a bit of a trouble maker. Farber tossed a ball in Del's direction which he pretended to catch only to walk straight past it. Farber, undeterred, ran to Del's side and began conversing with him. Azure wasn't really paying any attention until he asked to borrow Del's car in order to get with some girl who was, quote: \"ass-hot spankable\". Del scolded him a little and told him to go home. Unfortunately that's when Farber noticed Azure and slid over trying to be slick with an opening line of, \"hey, beautiful. You're so hot you're melting the sun\". \"Give it a rest Farber,\" Azure scoffed. \"Come on girl, I'm just getting warmed up… by you.\" \"Ok, that's enough,\" Del interjected, grabbing his arm, \"stop hitting on Z and go… home.\" \"Oh all right, that's strike one Spoon, that's strike one,\" he called as he ran off. Azure rolled her eyes as she and Del continued down the street. They quietly entered Gigi's home and Del put a finger to his lips before creeping down the hall. He got down on his hands and knees to be even quieter as he neared the kitchen and dining area. Gigi suddenly came around the corner asking if Del had spoken to his ex-wife lately. Del relented and greeted her then pretended to snore as Gigi started her lecture about divorce. \"Gigi, how do you do that?\" asked Azure in interest. \"Azure!\" called Gigi joyfully as she hurried to hug the girl, \"you haven't come to see me in so long. I thought you'd left town.\" \"I could never do that to you,\" chuckled Azure, sitting down with Del to consume Gigi's awesome sweet potato pie. It was always homely at Gigi's house and the three sat as companions. Azure loved visiting Gigi. At some point Del's new sneakers came up in conversation, which Azure was slightly envious of as they came from the 21st century which was a great time, the beginning of robotics. The NS-5 model came up after that and Azure examined Del's reaction, his obvious disapproval for the new robots. Azure had to admit though that Del's vacation had done some good since he didn't seem nearly as agitated about the subject compared to previously. Just before Azure left she decided to ask Del a favour. \"Del, would it be ok if I came with you on one of your cases?\" \"Why?\" he asked bluntly. Azure sighed, \"I decided to take a course on criminals involving profiling, crime procedure and such. What better way to learn than at an actual crime scene! I promise I won't get in the way.\" \"I don't know about this…\" \"Please, please Del. It would really mean a lot to me and we'd make a good team. I mean how many police detectives have their very own psychologist?\" \"You're not a psychologist yet.\" \"That's not the point. Besides, you don't even have to worry because I took shooting lessons,\" he raised an eyebrow at Azure. \"Ok, so I don't exactly have a gun but I can still defend myself if I need to, plus…\" Azure paused dramatically, \"… I won't stop nagging if you refuse.\" Del started laughing before holding up his hands, \"alright already. I can see you're determined and I'm sure John Bergin won't mind, you met him one time remember?\" Azure nodded, he was in charge of Del's police department district, but was also a good friend of Del's. He'd been easy enough to talk to and generally a nice guy. \"Thank you so much Del! You won't regret it!\" Azure gave him a sisterly hug before departing, long brown hair swishing and emerald eyes gleaming.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Dr. Albert Lanning Azure took a car all the way to USR headquarters. She was extremely surprised that Del had called her so soon to ask is she still wanted to tag along to a crime scene. He warned her that there would be an actual body there and that there was no way he was going to clean up after she spewed or freaked out. Azure had only laughed and asked for directions. When she was in high school one of annual career visits had been to a morgue because she'd been curious. It'd been no different to seeing a body during a classical movie night, in which she had watched Zombieland, X-men and Sweeney Todd. Azure looked at all the other cars speeding by, barely glimpsing the different colours and occasional truck. Her car was just a normal one but somehow reminded her of an ancient Barina for some reason. The automated computer informed Azure that it was going to take the next exit to the right. It turned into a virtually unused space where no doubt the employees within USR used it to gain access. Parking, Azure got out of the car but was not sure what to do next. A security guard stood by the entrance and there was an ID scanner for admittance. Just as she was, no doubt, starting to look suspicious a second car pulled up as her car slid into the back wall to hang with the many expensive vehicles in the personnel garage. Thankfully Del hopped out of his company car and scanned his badge. As Azure went to follow the guard stopped her with a request for ID. \"Don't worry, she's with me,\" Del interjected and the guard allowed her through. They entered into a small entry area where many people were going about their business. Azure had a feeling that this whole complex would probably be all in shades of white and metal, but mostly white. They took an elevator up to what Azure supposed was the main atrium. The USR building was enormous, basically just a giant sky scrapper that towered above all the other buildings. The place was surrounded with glass and composed of square type pillars. Stairs led up to a statue at least thirty or more times the size of a standard robot and supposed to represent the first robot created by USR. At least that's what the plaque at its feet said, along with the history and rise of USR. In the very centre of the atrium, before the stairs, lay the body of Dr. Albert Lanning, the co-founder of USR and the main roboticist. Azure knew from the start that this would be exciting but she hadn't expected this. Yellow virtual tape surrounded the scene. His body lay sprawled face down on the cement, glass was scattered all around, his limbs stuck out at odd angles and a pool of blood had formed beneath Lanning's head. Not far away was a small round device that Azure wasn't familiar with. Del told her in the lift that it was programed to send for him upon Lanning's death, that's why they were here. It would initiate a hologram of Lanning with preprogramed answers to certain questions or responses. Azure was fascinated. A team of forensic and police were analysing the scene and let them through when Del showed his badge. As they drew close the hologram appeared, so life like that it was startling. \"Good to see you again,\" it spoke. \"How do you know Lanning?\" Azure asked Del. \"He oversaw the restoration of my arm,\" Del replied, then to the hologram, \"hello doctor.\" \"Everything that follows, is a result of what you see here,\" stated hologram Lanning. \"Is there something you want to tell me?\" \"I'm sorry, my responses are limited. You must ask the right questions.\" \"Why did you call Del Spooner?\" asked Azure curiously, she didn't expect it to answer seeing as it was supposed to be for Del. \"I trust his judgement.\" Azure and Del shared a surprised look, perhaps Lanning had expected someone to be with Del. They continued. \"Normally these circumstances wouldn't require a homicide detective.\" \"But then our interactions have never been entirely normal, wouldn't you agree?\" \"Is there something that you need to say Lanning?\" wondered Azure and the hologram replied with its 'you must ask the right questions' response. \"Why would you kill yourself?\" Del asked, voice tight near the end. \"That detective, is the right question,\" a shiver went up Azure's spine, \"program terminated.\" The hologram receded back into the device. Del approached Lanning's body, looking down he asked, \"why old man?\" Del then went over to talk to the forensic guys. Azure stayed by the body to examine it. She then looked up to the offices some two hundred or so stories, where a shattered window showed where Lanning had plunged to his death. For some reason Azure was getting a strange feeling about this situation, like there was more to Lanning's death than just suicide. Something else caught her attention too. The glass around Dr. Lanning was different somehow but she just couldn't put her finger on it. \"Come on,\" Del called to her, \"let's go have a snoop around upstairs.\" They took the elevator up to the main office because Del needed to get permission from the owner none other than Lawrence Robertson, the other co-founder and CEO of USR. Azure decided to wait by the elevator, knowing that she'd just be in the way and didn't want to explain why she was there. Sometime later Del came back out with an expression on his face that Azure knew too well. \"So he was an asshole?\" \"Yep,\" he replied without hesitation, \"someone's coming to 'escort' us to the lab.\" Just then the elevator opened and a pretty, well groomed woman stood waiting within. They stepped in to take the lift speedily down. \"Lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible,\" she said. \"Really?\" Del replied brightly, Azure smirked secretly as she caught the innuendo. \"I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psycho-profile. Alfred had become a recluse; he rejected human contact for machines.\" \"So you're a shrink, huh?\" Del asked. Azure looked over with interest, \"are you a robopsychologist?\" \"Yes,\" the woman replied, \"I'm Susan Calvin, who are you?\" \"Oh,\" Del interrupted, \"you know I'm detective Del Spooner, this is my assistant Azure Miller.\" \"I'm studying to be a psychologist at university, robopsychology is an interest of mine,\" said Azure. The lift stopped then and Del was back to being professional as they walked down the hall. \"So would you say that Dr. Lanning was suicidal?\" \"It would seem the answer to that question is apparent.\" \"That's not what he asked,\" said Azure, immediately recognising her hedging of the subject. \"No,\" Susan finally said, \"I wouldn't have thought so but obviously I was wrong.\" Del paused on the balcony to look down and stated, \"That's a long way down.\" \"Thank you Captain obvious,\" teased Azure. \"They sure clean up quickly around here, but then, who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby?\" \"He was not just some old guy,\" said Susan angrily. \"Alfred Lanning was everything here. We are on the eve of the largest robotic distribution in history. By Saturday there'll be one robot to every five humans. This was Dr. Lanning's dream.\" \"I doubt very much though, that in his dream he was deceased,\" put in Azure delicately before Del could say anything more insulting. They continued on to Lanning's office as Del asked about the twenty four hour surveillance and where it was. Susan brought attention to the sensor strips on the wall, electric blue small tubes. They all linked up to the core which was a giant ball of neural energy and wire hanging from the ceiling high above. \"It's one giant virtual brain,\" Azure said in awe. \"She was actually Lanning's first creation,\" informed Susan. \"She? That's a she?\" asked Del. \"Virtual, Interactive, Kinetic, Intelligence.\" \"VIKI?\" A square hologram of a woman's face suddenly materialised and spoke, \"Good day.\" Azure observed Susan, Del and VIKI as they conversed about traffic fatalities then Del requested video surveillance of inside the laboratory one minute before the window broke. Strangely the video was non-existent with VIKI informing them there was 'data corruption'. Azure didn't know why but there was something about VIKI that she didn't like. They watched outside the lab instead, from the window breaking until the present. Azure watched closely but didn't see anyone leave the lab that hadn't entered first. Del made some stupid remark, comparing his and Susan's postures. Azure wasn't sure why but for some reason her image seemed just a bit clearer than the others'. It was most likely just a trick of the light though. \"Can we just go inside now?\" Azure asked. \"Oh, yeah, of course.\" Susan scanned and opened the door to Dr. Lanning's laboratory. Authors Note: Hey! I'm having a great time making these! At the moment it isn't very challenging due to the fact that most of it is just following the storyline of the movie. Improvising and building a human/robot relationship will be the difficult part, but I'm looking forward to it :) I just hope I can give the characters justice in respect to their personalities, I also need to try not to over-think things too much as well. It's a fine line. Please please please! Let me know of any mistakes you find in this story. Will be very much grateful and give you your very own Mini Sonny robot. How cute would that be?! -Trix-[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Rogue Robot Azure looked around the lab in fascination. Every available shelf was covered with metal parts, most of which Azure had no idea where they'd go on or in a robot. In a corner lay a small cot, the sheets pulled back and slept in. From the ceiling dangled robots in various states of completion. Machines lined the walls, one with some kind of gel used for shaping robot faces. As they looked around Susan informed them that she did advance robotics and psychiatry for USR but that she also did interfaces. Del asked her again in order to get a simpler answer which was basically that she makes robots seem more human. Azure knew what it was like with vocabulary, often she spent so long in studying various terminologies of psychology that she forgot regular people didn't know what she was talking about. It was sort of similar to speaking in a different language. Del then went up to examine the hole in the window. Azure was also drawn to the window but for a different reason. Touching it, she realised something important. \"Del, this is safety glass.\" \"What?\" he asked, looking up from the children's book that he'd found on a table, its title was Handsel and Gretel. \"I thought I recognised it down in the lobby but I wasn't sure. Here,\" she handed Del a stool. Understanding, he drew it back and smashed it into the other side of the window. It cracked but didn't shatter. Susan let out a yelp at the sudden noise. \"What in god's name are you doing?\" \"Did you know that that was safety glass?\" asked Azure. \"Be pretty difficult for an old man to throw himself through that, don't you think?\" asked Del. \"Well he figured out a way,\" retorted Susan. \"I doubt that very much,\" said Azure as Del really started to look around. \"Miss Miller, detective, the room was security locked no one came or went. You both saw that yourselves. Doesn't that mean this has to be suicide?\" 'Yep,\" commented Del as he pulled out one of his guns. \"Unless… the killer's still here,\" said Azure, looking around warily. Then she understood what Del meant as she looked at the robots around the room. A robot would have the physical strength to throw Dr. Lanning out of a window made of safety glass. \"You're joking right?\" asked Susan, \"this is ridiculous!\" \"Yeah, I know, the three laws. The perfect circle of protection,\" said Del sceptically as he started searching the room. \"A robot can not harm a human being, the first law of robotics.\" \"But doesn't your second law state that a robot has to obey any order given by a human being. What if it was given an order to kill?\" \"Not if it conflicts with the first law,\" added in Azure as she followed them. Del turned to face her, \"whose assistant are you?\" \"Well I'm not going to university for the fun of it, am I?\" said Azure, \"Oh and don't forget the last law, a robot can defend itself if that doesn't conflict with the first two laws.\" \"You know what they say, laws are meant to be broken,\" Del continued in his search. \"No, not these laws,\" Susan stated confidently, \"they're hardwired into every robot. A robot can no more commit murder that a human can walk on water.\" Azure watched as Del started rummaging through a bin full of robot parts with his gun pointed at the ready. \"You know there was this one guy real long ago-\" began Del as he moved an arm aside and turned back to speak to Susan. It happened so quickly, there was a large eruption as robot parts were flung in all directions as something launched itself from the bin. It knocked Del's gun from his hand, flipped right over him and landed right next to Azure. The gun slid across the ground to rest by its feet. \"Stay back!\" Del called to Susan then, \"Z, move away, slowly.\" \"Calm down detective\" advised Susan, \"the only thing dangerous in this room is you.\" She walked slowly towards it, \"deactivate.\" After she said that the robot immediately moved into a relaxed state and appeared to be offline. \"Look, it's fine. What you're looking at is the result of clever programing, an imitation of free will, it's nothing more.\" Del resolutely removed a second gun from his ankle holster and distrustfully pointed the gun at it. Azure recognised it as one of the new NS-5 models. There was something different about it though. It was about a head taller than her but she stepped closure as Del and Susan argued. At first it looked exactly the same as all the other models she'd seen, but something tugged within her. She stood on tip-toe to get a better look at it when she noticed what was different. Not only had it been more expressive than the others, its eyes were altered. While the other NS-5s had brown eyes, this one's were the colour of her name, a beautiful sapphire blue. Behind Azure Susan picked up the gun from the ground and turned towards Del. As Susan did so Azure was suddenly frozen by the stare of the robot now looking at her. It leaned forward and snatched the gun from Susan's hand. It pointed the gun directly at Del who did the same. Susan was trying to deactivate it but it wasn't working. Both Del and the robot were facing off as Del's back was to the window. \"I gave you an order,\" said Susan clearly. \"He's not listening right now lady,\" said Del with his eyes glued to the robot and added, \"step away Z.\" The robot was backing away to the door, Azure turned to watch it. \"VIKI, seal the lab,\" called Susan. \"No, VIKI, leave the-,\" countered Del. Azure examined the robot in what limited time she had. He was shaking slightly, there was real fear in his face, his-its, eyes. It turned just as the door closed and Azure knew there was only one other way out. The robot turned and ran, Azure stumbled to try to get out of the way. In fact she would have tripped and impaled herself on a piece of machinery if it hadn't tapped her on the back on the way past and righting her sense of gravity, allowing her to keep her balance. As Del shot at it, impressively the robot did a front handspring to avoid the shots. He ran and jumped out of the already broken window, Del got one more shot off before it disappeared over the edge. Del then immediately went after it with Azure and Susan close behind. Del got down there before them and they found him among the crowd of people, looking around for the now rogue robot. He found the gun on the pavement, so at least the machine was no longer armed. Azure examined the curious little puddles of liquid the robot had left behind. \"You hurt him, I think… badly,\" Azure deduced. She had mixed feelings about this new situation. It appears the robot had a will all of its own, not restricted by the three laws. However, he did save Azure from injury at the risk of possibly being shot, which showed that it cared for the health of humans. It could have easily killed Del and escaped… but it didn't. Those eyes too… they clearly showed emotions that were very real, even if they were programed. \"Where's it going?\" asked Del, then aggressively, \"where?\" \"It needs to repair itself,\" Susan said. They were in Del's car, Azure in the back as there was no time to get hers as well, plus she didn't know where they were going. Del was on his ear-piece phone to the police department, asking for backup from Lt. Bergin. To which Susan promptly disagreed only to be ignored. Del then switched to manual override of the car. Azure was used to Del's preference for driving himself; it made him feel more in control of a situation. Unfortunately this caused them to miss the exit, wasting valuable time. It also didn't help that they were both arguing like an old married couple. They arrived at a USR plant, which was a logical location for the robot to go and happened to be the closest. \"Where is everyone?\" Azure asked as they walked past the assembly line to a door. \"This facility was designed, built and id operated mechanically. No significant human presents from inception to production.\" They stepped through the door which closed behind them and Susan went to a control panel. \"So robots building robots?\" observed Azure. \"Well that's just stupid,\" commented Del as Susan input a code. \"I'm putting up the inventory. Out daily finishing capacity is one thousand NS-5s,\" Susan informed them, \"I'm showing one thousand and one.\" The whole room began to light up, revealing the one thousand robots and somewhere within them was the robot that had been in Dr. Lanning's lab. Azure wondered how they would ever find it. \"Attention NS-5s,\" called out Susan, to which they all went online with opened eyes and ready stances, \"there is a robot in this formation that does not belong.\" Her, Del and Azure walked down the ramp to stand in front of them. \"Identify it.\" \"One of us,\" replied all of the NS-5s. \"Which one?\" Azure asked in a clear voice. The robots, however, answered with exactly the same answer. Azure looked at Susan in confusion as Del asked how much they cost. \"Look, these NS-5s haven't been completely configured yet, they're still just hardware. Basic three laws operating system, that's it. They don't know any better,\" said Susan. \"What would you suggest?\" queried Del. \"Interview each one, cross reference their responses to detect any anomalies.\" \"That would take at least three weeks. We don't have that kind of time,\" objected Azure. \"Well I guess we should get started,\" commented Del, Azure knew this was a bad sign. Del strolled up to the NS-5s while casually fingering his gun. \"Robots, you will not move, confirm command.\" \"Command confirmed,\" chanted the models. Del then swiftly removed his gun, Susan anxiously asked what he was doing. \"You said they've all been programed with the three laws,\" said Del as he walked along the front line of the robots and stared at each column. \"That would mean, there's a thousand robots who won't try to protect themselves because it'll violated the law of following a humans direct order… except for one,\" finished Azure as she caught on to Del's train of thought. \"Detective, put your gun down!\" ordered Susan as he pointed it at the face of an NS-5. Azure personally didn't like this cause of action either, but she has also known Del for a long time; he wouldn't care about a few destroyed robots if it meant he could find the rogue one. Azure frantically looked at all the robots, if she could only find the one with the pretty blue eyes… but there were too many… and did she just think of a robot's eyes as pretty? \"These things are just lights and clockwork,\" Del ended the little speech he had been talking to Susan as Azure was looking around. Azure jumped as he pulled the trigger multiple times. The NS-5 made horrible little mechanical noises before it crumpled to the ground. \"Are you crazy?\" cried Susan as she went to the robots side. Azure stared down at the NS-5 before trailing Del as he voiced some kind of saying involving sanity. He then stopped in front of another robot, began to pull the trigger when there was a small movement along the line of robots. If Azure and Del weren't looking down the whole column they wouldn't have seen it. One of the NS-5s leaned out of line to glance down towards them. \"Gotcha,\" muttered Del, \"get the hell out of here!\" He raced off down the column in pursuit of the rogue robot. Completely ignoring him, Susan and Azure followed. Azure lost sight of him completely among the machines but continued in the same direction, separating from Susan. Azure eventually stopped, unable to find her companions, she sneaked around warily. Suddenly she heard a shout and Del was thrown across the room to a wall. She saw the rogue robot stand in front of him and saying something that Azure couldn't hear. Then as a large group of NS-5s surrounded Del, offering assistance, the rogue bot made two big leaps, ending in a somersault. \"Wait!\" Azure called as she ran over to it. Surprisingly it paused and turned to her. \"Do you even have the three laws? Who built you? Why did you run away? Do you have emotions? Why are your eyes blue?\" Azure fired off her questions quickly, afraid that this unique NS-5 would disappear. There was something different about it, she felt herself drawn towards him and wanted to know everything about it, but she didn't know why. It was confusing, unlike anything she had experienced before. Azure looked into its face and saw he seemed conflicted also. She took a step forward and her hand rose on its own, reaching out to touch. The robot hesitated before starting to mirror her gesture. \"Azure!\" Susan called out. Azure paused and turned for a moment but when she looked back the robot was gone, a big hole was left in the metal cargo door nearby. Del came running up moments later, then Susan. The sound of police outside could clearly be heard and also rapid gun fire. It didn't last very long so the three of them stepped through the hole, Del first, to investigate. They walked over to the group of police surrounding the wriggling robot caught in a squeeze-net. It was a special design that tightened the more an assailant struggled. Azure looked down at the NS-5 and felt a twisting sensation in her stomach. Hey all! I'm having slight difficulties in getting the characterisation right, I suppose I'm just not sure of how Sonny would react to different situations but I'm hoping my interpretation is ok. In the movie he seems highly curious but completely logical a mix of his robotic nature and programed emotions. The question is are the emotions programmed, or were they taught? Maybe a mix of both. Well, I could discuss for ages about true AIs and things concerning emotion and what makes something/someone human-like until I'm blue in the face. But then... who would write the rest of this story? So onwards! Oh and one more thing. Robots are AWESOME. I 3 ROBOTS! ((additionally, I've gotten a couple strange comments, one along the lines of just \"ewwww\". I made it clear in the begging what this story is, WHY ARE YOU READING IT, STRANGE PERSON?!) *sigh* I'm all good now and out of exclamation points, bye :)[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Sonny It had been a long night, but Azure refused to go home and instead accompanied Del to the station where the NS-5 was being held. It was incredible, the first ever robot, in the world, who wasn't shackled by the three laws. Azure had sometimes wondered what would happen if robots didn't have the three laws. How would they react? Would they actually evolve independently? Would they develop individual personalities? But then there was the whole programming side of things. Could a robot have its own personality or would that be considered just a part of their programming? Azure's head was filled with possibilities as she followed Del towards John Bergin. To which the two men immediately began to talk and argue while Azure listened intently. \"You have no idea what we had to go through to clip this thing John.\" \"Yeah, I get it man. You actually think you brought me something good.\" \"That thing did it!\" \"Did what? We have a suicide, detective, end of story.\" \"I am telling you that robot killed Lanning.\" \"And I'm telling you that's impossible. And even if it is it sure as hell better be in somebody else's precinct.\" \"John, John. Give me five minutes with it.\" \"What are you, nuts? I just got off the phone with the DA. Nobody goes into that room until Robertson and his attorneys get here.\" \"This is my suspect!\" \"It's a tin opener for christ sake.\" They rounded a corner and stood in front of Observation Room 12A. Through the glass door Azure could see the NS-5 sitting in the room, cameras observed it from every angle. \"John, don't do this to me, I am asking you for five minutes,\" pleaded Del on the edge of begging. \"What if he's right?\" interrupted Azure, gaining their attention. \"That NS-5 has free will, the ability to choose his actions, I witnessed that. The whole group that brought it down witnessed that.\" John gave an exasperated look and pinched the bridge of his nose. He looked extremely tired and forlorn. He recovered himself and said, \"I can't argue with the girls logic… I guess we're gonna miss the good 'ol days.\" \"What good old days?\" asked Del. \"When people were killed by other people,\" John then sighed, opened the door and gave Del the case file, \"five minutes. That goes for both of you.\" \"Thanks John,\" smiled Azure. Del then winked at John before entering, Azure close behind. There were a total of six guards in the room with their guns aimed at the robot, not including the ones outside. The NS-5 sat placidly quiet and watched the two familiar people enter. The door closed behind them and Del retrieved the case pictures from the folder, setting them in front of the NS-5. It looked down at them, fingers gently hovering over them. \"Murder's a new trick for a robot, congratulations,\" spoke Del. The NS-5 roughly pushed the pictures away. \"Respond.\" \"What does this action signify?\" the NS-5 randomly asked as it looked between Del and Azure, then winked. \"As you entered, when you looked at the other human. What does it mean?\" The NS-5 winked again. \"It's a sign of trust,\" said Azure, gaining the attention of its brilliant blue eyes, Azure also observed its voice and mannerisms. It was male, if robots did have a gender, the voice clear with tone and accompanied by appropriate expression. Not to mention the fact that it was curious. \"It's a human thing. You wouldn't understand,\" added Del unnecessarily. \"My father tried to teach me human emotions,\" said the NS-5, \"they are… difficult.\" \"You mean your designer?\" \"Yes, and I believe that also answers one of your previous questions,\" the robot said to Azure. Del shot Azure a questioning glance, but she waved her hand in a 'later' gesture. She felt a little flustered, thinking herself stupid for her sudden burst of questions earlier on. \"So why did you murder him?\" asked Del, casually sitting. \"I did not murder Dr. Lanning,\" said the robot. \"Why were you hiding at the crime scene?\" Azure tried to lead the subject away from what she sensed was, dangerous grounds. \"I was frightened… the answer to your third question.\" \"Robots don't feel fear,\" said Del, \"they don't feel anything. They don't get hungry, they don't sleep-\" \"I do,\" interrupted the NS-5, \"I have even had dreams.\" \"Dreams? Lanning is your creator? He gave you dreams?\" asked Azure. \"Yes. I also do have the three laws and I do not know why my eyes are a different to the others nor why Dr. Lanning chose them. Perhaps they are more artificially aesthetic to appearance… I would not know.\" It was an innocent enough response though Azure could not help her face heating up; she doubted that the robot recognised the subtle implication that by her fixating on his eyes she was subconsciously acknowledging them as being attractive. Luckily Del hadn't noticed her flustered face and took Azure's silence as encouragement to continue. \"It doesn't matter, you are just a machine. Imitation of life, you can't write a symphony or turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece,\" he paused a moment. \"I think you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions and things got out of control.\" \"I did not murder him,\" the NS-5 said seriously. \"But emotions don't seem like a very useful simulation for a robot-\" \"I did not murder him.\" \"Del,\" Azure murmured a warning, hearing the danger in the NS-5s voice. Del didn't listen, \"ah hell, I don't want my toaster or my vacuum cleaner appearing emotional-\" \"I DID NOT MURDER HIM!\" yelled the NS-5 suddenly, slamming his fists against the steel table in a fit of anger which agitated the guards. Azure couldn't help flinching slightly at the outburst and the robot glanced over at her before relaxing slowly. Azure thought she noticed a little guilt or self-shame in its eyes at his loss of control. He looked down at the table, uncoiling his fists and seeing the great dents it had created. \"That one's called anger,\" informed Del. \"Ever simulate anger before?\" The NS-5 looked away. \"Answer me canner!\" Del raised his voice in impatience. The NS-5 looked up with decisiveness and addressed them, \"my name is Sonny.\" \"So we're naming you now?\" \"I'm Azure.\" Both Del and the robot, now Sonny, looked at her. \"It's nice to meet you,\" Azure said awkwardly. \"Z,\" signed Del in exasperation. \"Del,\" cut in Azure, \"you don't see what I see.\" \"A piece of metal?\" Azure sighed now in exasperation. \"No,\" she said and glanced shyly at Sonny, \"a friend.\" A corner of Sonny's mouth seemed to twitch a little, as if he was instinctively going to smile but didn't know how to. Azure ignored Del's snort of derision and turned to the robot. \"Why is Lanning dead, Sonny?\" \"Dr. Lanning killed himself,\" Sonny observed the case pictures again. \"I don't know why he wanted to die. I thought he was happy.\" Sonny's voice seemed sad, then his emotions changed. \"Maybe it was something I did. Did I do something?\" Sonny looked up at Azure and Del, \"he asked for a favour, made me promise.\" \"What favour?\" asked Del. \"Maybe I was wrong, maybe he was scared.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Scared of what?\" asked Azure. \"You have to do what someone asks you, don't you Azure Miller and Detective Spooner?\" \"How the hell did you know my name?\" replied Del intently. Azure was startled also, she had only told Sonny her first name not her last. \"Don't you… if you love them?\" Sonny was sad, scared and uncertain as he looked between Azure and Del, while they were confused. The exchange was broken then when the door was opened, Bergin and Robertson of USR stood outside. They made their way to Bergin's office but Azure was stopped from entering by one of the USR personnel. Something about it being USR business and that a civilian wasn't allowed. Azure rolled her eyes and waited outside. Luckily sound travels and she could make out some parts of the conversation within. Apparently murder could only be committed by two humans, meaning Sonny couldn't and wouldn't be charged. Sonny was property of USR; faulty machinery would be returned to USR for diagnostic and then decommissioned. Azure's stomach dropped at that, how could they just simply destroy someone with a obvious personality and consciousness? And in a robot, no less. Azure walked a little way down the corridor and stopped to look through the glass walls. In the main hallway guards and police were escorting Sonny out of the building. He looked up at Del as he walked past, then Sonny caught sight of Azure. His blue eyes stared at her and Azure resolved to see it… him, again. Hey all! Firstly I just love the logical, sort-of robotic talking for some reason, maybe it's because I watched too much Spock when I was a kid? Second, anyone pick up on what I've been doing with Azure? She's getting a little twisted up with her feelings, not sure whether to treat Sonny as a robot or a person, to call the robot a 'him' or an 'it'. Poor Azure :) I'm enjoying writing this more than I thought I would. Thank you to any and all that reviewed/is reading this! Even though this is for my own amusement it's nice to know others are enjoying it too. I luv you all, mini Sonny robots for everyone![Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Plans Azure accompanied Del outside and down the street. They didn't say anything, both had fallen in a depressive state of mind. Azure followed Del into Ovaltine Café and they sat watching the telly at the bar, which, despite being a café, sold beer. Azure watched the TV disinterestedly as it broadcasted the news about the death of Lanning and his apparent suicide. The robot barista came back with more drinks, Del's second beer or whatever he was having and Azure's hot chocolate. As she sipped it the warmth and release of endorphins helped to cheer her up a little. \"It's like Frankenstein,\" Azure said randomly, still thinking about what happened. \"What?\" asked Del. \"I mean this whole case with Sonny. Guy created 'supposed' monster, monster kills creator, then everybody misunderstands and kills the monster. It's just… wrong.\" \"Hey you're not turning into a tin-lover are you?\" \"Those 'Tin-men' are interesting.\" \"Don't you mean Tin-man?\" Azure said nothing and buried her head into her drink. \"You're really taken with this one aren't you?\" Azure spluttered into her chocolate, \"What… huh… wait… what?\" Del actually laughed and decided to tease some more, \"I've seen that look many times Z. Personally I wouldn't touch that with a 50 foot pole but to each their own.\" Azure by now was bright red and laughingly pushed him in mortification. \"Well what about you and… Ms. Calvin?\" Del nudged her back for that. They eventually settled down again and Del said thoughtfully, \"only, USR was real quick on wanting to destroy the robot, weren't they?\" \"I suppose so.\" \"And what was the motive?\" \"They would just tell you that you don't need a motive. That it's just a malfunction.\" \"It looked like it needed a motive. It could have just killed me Z. Why didn't it just kill me?\" \"You're right. It could've just killed you... and me for that matter.\" They were in comfortable silence once again, each in their own thoughts. Azure was mulling over everything that had happened when a thought occurred to her. \"Don't you think it's a bit strange, that you were the right guy for the right job?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Del, think about it. You've been almost obsessed with finding a bad robot. What would be the odds that you would be the one to find one?\" Del thought for a moment, \"I wasn't just the right guy for the job, I was the perfect guy for the job.\" \"Yes… what if you were supposed to find that robot?\" \"Yeah, the robot said that Lanning was scared, what did he have to be scared of?\" Azure thought for a moment, \"I don't know Del, but something isn't right. Do you ever get the feeling you're being watched, all the time?\" \"No.\" \"Well I do, ever since this case started. Something just isn't right Del and I'm not just talking about Sonny.\" \"Look, we'll figure this out Z, but I think I'm gonna check out Lanning's house. See if he left some kind of clue.\" \"Ok, I might try and contact Susan, see if she can get me into USR for when she does a diagnostic of Sonny.\" \"Great idea, the more we know the better. You know I might just make a detective of you yet.\" \"Really?\" \"No.\" Azure made a hurt expression and placed her hand over her heart, \"Oh that hurts Del, really hurts.\" \"Suck it up kid and just... be careful around that thing. No matter how you feel about it.\" \"Got it, I'll keep my non-existent emotions in check.\" \"Denial doesn't suit you Z, you're way too honest.\" \"I thought I was supposed to be the psychologist expert here?\" \"Exactly my point. Stay safe girl.\" \"You too.\" Del got up, scanning his card to pay for their drinks before he left. Azure stayed a little while afterwards but then headed home. She'd call USR in the morning. Hey everyone! Really short chapter this time. A brief warning that there will be no set time for when the chapters come out, so it could be quite some time (or a very short time) between each. Depending on many factors: fellow writers out there will know what I'm talking about. Be reassured however that I will eventually finish the story. Shout out to some people who have reviewed (hoping you don't mind your names here but hey, free publicity everyone!) I'd just like to thank you all for reviewing or anyone that's reading this really. I never know the protocol for getting reviews so if you want me to reply just put \"please rply\" at the end or something. Or maybe like a bazillion smiley faces, or a strange word that I probably don't understand; should get my attention :). Ok a shout out to: - Purp1eLady - Doop (Guest) - Deception is Decepticon - AnimeDemonNinja - Vanessa Rowes - FloodFeSTeR - SweetSickNightmare An extra-golden-robot-cog goes out to: RansomNote who wrote me an awesome paragraph of encouragement/helpfulness. I love people writing me reviews about... well anything really. So thanks![Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Bread Crumbs Azure somehow managed to talk Susan into letting her be there for the diagnostics on Sonny. There were a couple of regulations, paperwork and safety protocols to go over but since Susan was in charge for the moment, it was allowed. That is after Azure had signed a disclosure agreement. Azure wondered, as she walked the streets towards Gigi's house, where the old robots went after they were made obsolete by newer versions. Were they recycled into junk metal? Upgraded to become a part of the newer robots? Or, which was more unlikely, put into storage and slowly loose power and die? Azure wasn't quite comfortable with that thought. On the other hand they were only robots. But they had the potential to become so much more. After all, USR were able to replace lost limbs with robot machinery, how was creating a human-like robot any different? Azure was cut from her musing by clapping and a few cheers. She stopped to watch a family trade in for an NS-5. The robot bent down to hug the small child of its new family. A slight burst of envy and overwhelming sadness shot through her, before she tried to push it away. her parents had died in some kind of industrial accident. Azure didn't really remember them, probably because she had been too young at the time. She had no memories of what they had looked like, or what they were like. Azure also felt down when she watched another trade-in for the new NS-5s. The old robots just looked really sad. Azure startled when she realised she was standing out the front of Gigi's. Entering she was greeted with a suffocating hug and what sounded like a 'hello' from Del's mouth, full of pie. While Gigi got her a slice Del filled her in on what happened to him at Lanning's house. It was shocking to discover that Del had almost been killed by a demolition bot. Azure took Del's side in it not being an accident. There was just no way anyone would enter a building when it was near the time of being made into rubble. Besides, when active those bots usually required supervision from USR as a precaution. Azure noticed there was something about the sweet potato pie, like it had something a little extra in it. That it was a bit more delicious than the way Gigi usually made them. \"Gigi this is great! Is it a new recipe?\" \"Yeah,\" joked Del, \"you keep making these pies this good we're gonna have to put you to work.\" \"So you both like the pie, huh?\" asked Gigi innocently, Azure didn't miss the mischievous sparkle in her eyes. \"Mmmm hmmm,\" confirmed Del eagerly. \"You can come in now!\" called Gigi and out of a side room suddenly came an NS-5, sleek and new. \"Hello Detective Spooner, Miss Miller,\" it stated. \"I won Del, I won the lottery! We've been cooking like crazy.\" \"That's wonderful,\" said Azure softly. The NS-5 made its way to the kitchen. Del pushed away his plate of pie. Azure didn't even need to see the look on his face to know what expression he was wearing. It was one thing to have robots wandering the streets, he could cope with that, he did well most days. But to have a robot not only close by but living with a person he deeply cared about... Azure knew this would not go well. She waited nervously for something, some kind of outburst but to her surprise nothing happened. Del was tense for the rest of the visit and refused to eat anymore food but other than the disgusted looks he sent the NS-5, that was it. Azure was impressed, maybe his vacation had really done him good, relaxed him more. On their way out Del hesitated before turning and Azure just knew he was going to say something about the robot. Sure enough, \"You gotta get rid of that thing Gigi. It's not safe.\" \"Baby, you get too worked up about them, too full of fear. I saw in the news that nice doctor died. Dr. Lanning was a good man. He gave me my Del back. Is that why you both have been so upset?\" Azure startled a little before asking, \"what do you mean?\" \"Oh my girl. Gigi always knows these things.\" Del looked at Azure a little surprise, they had both been a bit preoccupied lately with everything that had happened to notice much about each other. \"It's nothing Gigi,\" replied Azure. \"Just old feelings, non-existent memories about my parents.\" \"Oh, you two. You've got to let the past be past.\" After that Gigi seemed to get distracted by Del's shirt. \"Azure, how did I ever raise such a mess?\" Azure couldn't help giggling over Gigi's fussing and teased, \"you could probably follow his trail of crumbs all across town.\" At that moment an interesting expression crossed Del's face, realisation. Azure could see the light bulb go on in his head. \"Bread crumbs,\" Del murmured. \"Z, you're a genius.\" Azure flailed, \"what?\" Del kissed Gigi quickly on the cheek before hurrying off. \"Del? Uh, bye Gigi!\" Azure struggled to catch up. \"Del wait, what's going on?\" \"Z I think Lanning left clues, bread crumbs, behind. Clues to maybe tell us who killed him. I'm going over everything about the case again.\" \"I...\" \"Just go with Susan and see about all the details on that thin-\" \"Sonny. His name Sonny.\" Del stopped a moment in frustrated exasperation commanded harshly, \"Just go alright.\" Azure gave a fake, sharp salute before going to walk off. \"Wait, Z,\" Azure turned. \"Be careful?\" Del asked softly, apologetically. Azure couldn't help gently smiling and nodded. Apology accepted. Oh wow, it's been too long since I updated! I just get so caught up in life, I'm also in the making of an honest-to-robots (heh) book! I'm making myself excited. Anyway SO SORRY for the long wait, I'll try not to make it so long next time. I was going to wait until I finished up the chapter after this one (because this one's so short) but oh well. It's just a little bit more characterisation. THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU to everyone that reviewed and has been encouraging me to continue! I love you all! May you all find your very own Sonny... or Wonka... or Sherlock... or Damon... or basically just that amazing someone. xoxo ","Summary":" Robots Have Feelings Too By Trixmade Disclaimer : I DO NOT own anything relating to the movie I, Ro"},{"Movie":"American History X","Title":"American History X: Finding Derek","Author":"Yoyo09542","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13153227","Passage":"[Chapter 1] *AN: Of course I don't own Derek Vinyard, but since I first watched this film nearly 20 years ago, his is a character I just couldn't get out of my head. Eventually all the futures I imagined for him have coalesced into this story and I'm finally sharing it with you. It's the first story I've ever shared, so please be helpful (and kind!). * Chapter 1: Identity It was a week until her birthday, and Niamh was determined that this time she was going to make sure Derry came out to party with her. Every time she asked him, he found an excuse, some reason he could not join her and her college friends on their rowdy nights out round the town. Even heavily laden hints about movies she wanted to see, or local sights she wished she had someone to show her fell on studiously deaf ears. She knew she should let it go, he clearly was not comfortable taking their relationship outside of the bar, beyond being her boss, but she still could not accept that the intense, irresistible pull she felt towards him was not reciprocated. So she had planned this all out. She knew Lamont was due to be working that night, she'd checked the rotas, and picked a particularly quiet night. No ball games, no student events, just a midweek school night, so letting her and her friends take over the bar for the night would barely make a dent in takings. If Derry wouldn't come to her, then she would come to him and find a way to finally make him drop his guard and have some fun. And if she could be part of the fun he would have, well… that would just be the best birthday present ever. It had been nearly six months now since she had first walked into his bar and within days she found herself falling slowly, inexorably under his spell, until every waking moment was spent thinking about him. She promised herself, if he made an excuse this time, that would be it; she would have to accept that he was not interested and stop trying. Even though the logical part of her brain knew that was the right thing to do, even thinking that thought gave her a stab of pain and renewed her determination to make this work. Niamh showered and took care dressing for work. She stood scrutinising herself critically in the mirror; her wavy dark hair was freshly washed and the summer halter-neck dress she was wearing was just the right side of being too girlish, showing a glimpse of her breasts from the side when she lifted her arms. She remembered the last time she wore it and flushed at the memory. She had caught Derry looking at her from the corner of her eye, as reached up to get a glass from the shelf. He turned so quickly she couldn't be certain, but surely there had been a glint of desire in his usually so well-guarded and unreadable eyes. Unbidden, the thought of what it would be like to have him slide his hand inside her dress and caress her breast made her catch her breath. Her desire for him was constantly catching her out like that. It was an intense, heady longing, but with no way of finding release from it, it built to a peak of pain she found at times hard to bear. She rested her head against the cool of the mirror and tried to control her thoughts and slowly bring her breathing under control. She remembered the day she had first seen him and almost wished, not for the first time, that she had walked away then. She had just arrived from England to take up her place as a doctoral student at the university, and was looking for work to try and supplement the meagre bursary she had fought hard to win. She saw the advert in the window of the Irish bar on campus and figured that having a mother who came from the Old Country and a name like Niamh might count as better qualifications than the suitcase full of prizes and certificates that had not yet helped her find a job in this new country. She knew she didn't look like an American's idea of an Irish girl, though; her looks more clearly shaped by her father's Jamaican ancestry than that of her mother's Donegal roots. She toyed with putting on an Irish accent – having been brought up by her mother and her grandmother in South London she was familiar enough with the brogue to be able to make a good enough fist of it to fool most people, but decided against it. She'd wasted years pretending to be people she wasn't, trying to find an identity that would be accepted and she was determined not to start again now. She breathed in, squared her shoulders and pushed open the door. A strong-looking man with short hair and a neat goatee beard stood behind the bar. He wore a long-sleeved black t-shirt pulled tight over a muscular frame, tucked into the neat waist-band of a pair of formal trousers. It was a slightly incongruous look for a student town, out of kilter with either the common slacker look of the crowds, or even the preppy casual expensiveness of the wealthier students. He looked to be in his late twenties, but seemed somehow as if he had stepped out of a different generation to Niamh. He looked up as she walked in. 'Sorry,' he said, 'we don't open for another half hour'. 'I know.' Niamh replied. 'I'm here about the job?' She tried to keep the tremor out of her voice and emulate the easy confidence she found so intimidating among the American students she'd met. A week full of rejections had eaten away at her self-belief and she faltered immediately when he turned fully to face her. The intense, almost fierce gaze from the sharp blue eyes under his knotted eyebrows made her begin to blush and she fought the urge to turn round and walk back out into the street. 'Oh,' he said. 'Okay, well I'm looking for someone who can start right away. What experience do you have?' 'Oh, I've done a lot of bar work,' lied Niamh, thinking to herself that a few nights pulling pints in the Union bar on campus back home nearly counted. 'And of course, I am Irish, like, properly Irish from Ireland, not from South Boston!' she added. It had meant to come out jokingly, but she realised immediately it sounded snide and wished she could take it back. He looked at her quizzically and she braced herself for the usual 'you don't look very Irish' line. Most Americans' idea of Ireland seemed to have stopped sometime around 1950; anyone claiming to be Irish without milk white skin, red hair, freckles and looking like an extra from the 3rd class cabin in The Titanic must be an imposter. She was surprised, then, when he said instead: 'You sound more English than Irish to me.' 'Oh,' she stammered. 'Well yes, I was brought up in England, but my mum is from Donegal. We go there every year, though, and I even have an Irish passport.' God, what a stupid thing to say, she thought, getting more flustered. She looked up and he seemed to be suppressing a smile, which made his eyes soften and transformed his severe look into something undeniably attractive. She pushed the thought out of her mind that he was trying not to laugh at her, and attempted to force a smile herself. 'What's your name?' he asked. 'Niamh,' she replied, immediately adding: 'So, it's pronounced Neve, but it's the Gaelic spelling: N I A…' 'M H' he finished for her. 'I bet that gets mispronounced a lot here!' he said, smiling again. Her surprise at his quick acumen made her forget for a moment about her nerves. 'Not just here,' she admitted, 'it happened all the time growing up in London too. I spent my entire life at school trying to explain why I wasn't called Niyamhah. Even to the teachers!' He laughed and she finally managed a real smile in return. 'So you seem to know a lot about Gaelic names. You must be Irish too?' she said, thinking how stupid that must have made her previous presumption seem. 'Nope.' he replied. 'Not as far as I know, anyways. But my name's Derry and that seems good enough to pass around here.' He was still looking at her with those intense blue eyes that she found hard to meet, but she forced herself to hold his gaze and say: 'So, when can I start?'[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Past is a Foreign Country Derry woke early, as he did every morning. Sleep felt like an enemy most nights, one he tried to subdue but who fled from him and then, when finally captured, wreaked vengeance on him with violent, troubled dreams. Awake, his thoughts weren't much calmer but at least he could force them into submission so long as he kept busy. He got straight out of bed and went into the living room of his apartment, a room almost bare except for a weight bench, dumbbells and jump ropes which were neatly lined up against the wall. He picked up a rope and started to jump, numbing the pain in his mind with the monotony of the exercise. Sometimes finding release took a long time, and he had to push himself almost to the point of collapse before the noises in his head would subside, and he would sink down, retching with effort, onto the floor. Today was a good day, though, and in just thirty minutes he was dripping with sweat and calm enough to face the world. After eating breakfast and showering, he shaved, using the one small sliver of mirror in the apartment, which was propped up high above the bathroom sink at chin level to him. If he was careful, he could avoid seeing his reflection for days on end, and sometimes even began to believe that he was 'Derry'. When he did catch sight of his reflection, so familiar from mugshots and press stories, it was an unwelcome reminder of who he really was and that however far he ran, he could not escape his past. Today, though, was still a good day, and he shaved around his closely cropped goatee without catching his own eyes in the mirror. There was a slight warmth in the air, even at this time in the morning, and the Californian in him couldn't help but feel his spirits lifted after the long New Hampshire winter. Still, he pulled on a long-sleeved shirt, as he did every day, over his ever-present undershirt. His apartment was over the bar, and he let himself out of the door in the small kitchen and down the stairs to that led to the office area behind the bar. He put coffee on to brew and started on an inventory of stock. It was nearly the end of the college year, but there would be plenty of parties after final exams and then new students coming in for the summer programmes. He sighed; there was always plenty of demand for alcohol among the crowds of young people thronging around the campus. He would watch them all with a mixture of jealousy and censure, living carefree lives, devoted to studying and partying, seemingly oblivious to the suffering in the world beyond their college walls. He heard the sound of keys rattling in the lock of the outer door; she was here early today. He schooled his expression into careful neutrality and took a deep breath before going through to the bar area. Niamh was standing in the doorway, just as she had that day, bringing a whiff of something alien and alluring in with her, which he should have known would only bring confusion and pain into his carefully ordered existence. She was wearing a light-coloured dress over a pair of jeans and he was glad to see she had a cardigan over the dress. Sometimes it was too much effort to keep his hard-won cool when she wore that kind of thing, straining to keep his eyes averted from the swelling curves and flashes of bare flesh that she almost seemed to deliberately flaunt in front of him. He shook his head to clear the thought; he knew it was good for business to have someone who looked and sounded like Niamh at the bar and her tips at the end of a night proved it. The few times they had run into each other outside of the bar, she was mostly swaddled in baggy sweats and hooded tops, hair scraped back and glasses on. It's a professional camouflage, he reminded himself, she's not doing it for you. She smiled at him brightly, but there was something off, something too bright and somehow nervous in her smile. 'Hey,' she said. 'How was the weekend?' 'Good,' he replied. 'You know, busy.' Busy, he was always busy. 'Well, things should be calming down now though, right?' she suggested, her smile still too fixed. He shrugged, not sure what this was leading but slightly unsettled by her manner. 'Coffee?' he asked, heading back behind the bar. 'Sure,' she said, following him through the bar and into the staff room. He poured her a cup and winced when he turned round and noticed her cardigan was already off. Dammit, it was that dress again – the one that tied up around her supple neck, showing off her smooth back and a slipping dangerously to the side when she moved around. Today is a good day, he reminded himself. I've got this. 'You're here early,' he commented, focussing back on desk and the inventory papers. Her shift wasn't due to start until 11 on a Monday. 'Well, you know, I have to submit my first chapter next week so anything to get me out of the dorm,' she said with a smile. Derry frowned. He was always taking her to task for indulging in pointless displacement activity when work on her PhD got too much for her. It frustrated him, she was so gifted, with such an agile mind that flew lightly and ably around complex topics and always managed to spot new arguments to take him by surprise. But she was always so disorganised and last minute about everything. She claimed she worked best when she was under time pressure so there was no point trying to do anything until the panic was on, but he found himself wishing he could make her be more disciplined. He realised she was looking at him intently, and that he was still frowning, so he smoothed his features into his usual impassive mask and returned to his papers. 'So, Der,' she said. 'Can I ask you something?' It still jolted him when she shortened his name like that; Der was what Danny had always called him. He wished he'd asked her not to; it was disconcerting and pulled him back into the identity he was so desperate to escape. Sometimes his ears played tricks on him and he could swear she called him Derek, making his heart leap into his throat and a hot sweat prickle its way down his neck. It wasn't just the normal fear that his past could catch up with him, he'd lived for years now with the knowledge that his name was on the hit list of every Neo-Nazi hate group from here to Berlin. No, it was the idea that she of all people would uncover him, know who he really was, and see the monster beneath his carefully constructed façade of normality that made him feel sick to his stomach. He glanced up and saw her looking questioningly at him. 'So?' she said. 'What do you think? Isn't it a great idea?' He cursed himself inwardly for not paying attention. 'Umm, I guess it could be.' He tried to sound non-committal. 'So it's a yes?' Her face lit up and she bounced towards him, and for a split second he thought she might be about to hug him. 'That's amazing, thank you, it's going to be so much fun!' Shit, what had he just agreed to? 'I can't wait to bring everyone over so you can meet them,' she went on. 'I'm sure half of them are starting to think I'm making you up! It makes so much more sense to do it here than to go out somewhere where you don't know who'll be there and what the place might be like.' 'Um, yeah sure,' he said trying desperately to figure out what she meant and how to get out of this. Why would she bring people to his bar? And why would they want to meet him? 'So, um, explain to me again how this is going to work?' was the best he could come up with. 'Well, I was thinking because it's a Monday we won't be busy, so I can take the night off and go meet everyone and get ready. And then we can come here and just have the place to ourselves?' she asked. 'Hugo said he could bring his decks and do a DJ set, we can use the lights we use on open mic night, and Stefania said she would do a cake. I mean of course they would all have to buy their own drinks, but it should be about 30 of us so it wouldn't be much down on a normal Monday night, right?' She was looking at him pleadingly, her eyes begging him not to disagree. He looked away desperately trying to think of a way of putting her off without looking like a total arsehole. 'Um, okay, but if you're not working… I'm gonna have to check the rotas that day, I think Lamont may be off.' He could speak to Lamont later and get him to back this up. 'Oh, it's okay, I already checked with him. He's definitely around that night as Sandra is working at the Y.' Double shit. How was he going to get out of this? 'Oh Der, thank you so much, this means so much to me. It's my first birthday since I got here and I'm feeling kind of weird about not having any family around,' she smiled. Oh Christ, of course yes, it was her birthday. How could he have forgotten? There was no backing out of this now. He tried to smile, while his stomach sank at the thought of a night with her and her friends from the grad school. At least if they were here at the bar he could put himself into professional mode and keep out of their way. A few of her friends sometimes dropped by when she was working and he was intensely uncomfortable in their company. Niamh had clearly found it hard to settle into a social group when she arrived, not fitting neatly into any of the existing cliques. She had slowly surrounded herself with an eclectic group of people, most of whom were from overseas and whose only unifying characteristics seemed to be extreme intelligence mixed with a strong streak of pretentiousness. They smoked hand-rolled cigarettes and dropped names of European philosophers into the most mundane of conversations, swapping stories of travels to remote tribal regions in South East Asia as easily as reminiscing about how plebeian the crowds had been at the Venice Biennale the year before. He wondered how Niamh, who wore her own intelligence so lightly and with so little arrogance, could enjoy their brittle, overwrought conversations and feigned ennui for life. If he was completely honest with himself, he probably could have borne them with more patience if he hadn't felt so judged by them. The few he had tried to speak to clearly dismissed him as a knuckle-headed barkeeper, and never spoke to him as an intellectual equal in the way Niamh always did. He had sensed from that first day she walked into the bar that her confidence was just an act. She held herself well, speaking her mind with a slightly clumsy self-possession that he found intriguing and endearing. But behind her bravado there was a wariness in her eyes that spoke of pain in her past, something he knew too much of to miss in someone else. She was so quick to try and own the contradictions in her identity that he instinctively knew that somewhere in her past they had been used against her and that she was determined not to allow it to happen again. He felt a desire to protect her, even though he knew she would find the idea abhorrent and patronising. And then with a hot rush of shame he would remind himself that it was probably people exactly like him who had caused this pain to a mixed-race Irish Catholic girl from Ulster, a community divided on sectarian lines and scarred by violence. Nope, there was no way of getting out of hosting this party. She looked so happy and excited as she gabbled on about the arrangements that he felt almost reconciled to the idea. How bad could it actually be? And anyway, who was he to deny her something that would clearly give her so much pleasure?[Chapter 3] The rest of her shift passed in a happy blur to Niamh, and she kept throwing Derry excited, grateful smiles that were returned somewhat less enthusiastically. Even though it was a slow night, she fizzed so much with excitement that every guy in the bar seemed to think she was smiling just for him, and her tips were even better than usual. Just before closing, Lamont and Sandra came in on their way home. Niamh smiled a genuine smile, pleased to see them, even though there was still a certain coolness between her and Sandra. When Lamont first brought her around, Sandra had been wary of the strange, light-skinned girl with the foreign accent who spent so much time hanging around the bar and her new man. It didn't take long to figure out where Niamh's interest lay, though, and Sandra now seemed more to pity her, even if she didn't particularly warm to her. 'Hey, girl! Don't you got somewhere better to be?' Lamont asked, as he sat down on a stool at the bar. Niamh and Sandra exchanged polite air kisses as Sandra slid into a stool next to Lamont. 'Can I get you something?' Niamh asked. 'Nah, we good, just checking in on y'all before we go home,' he replied sliding his hand up Sandra's leg and giving her thigh a squeeze. Niamh turned away, surprised at how that small gesture of intimacy hurt her. Of course she wasn't jealous of Sandra, but she suddenly realised how much she longed to have Derry do the same to her. Her good mood started to evaporate. How stupid she was, getting excited just because she had cajoled Derry into letting her have a party in the bar. It didn't mean anything, and he still never once looked at her the way Lamont looked at Sandra now, leaning across to whisper something in her ear that made her giggle and push him lightly on his chest. Tears pricked at her eyes as she felt the ridiculousness of her situation. Why couldn't she just forget about him? There were guys who hit on her every day in the bar, not to mention Marc, the intense French junior professor in her faculty who wouldn't take no for an answer since that one time when a few drinks and a surfeit of loneliness led to her going home with him. She'd regretted it ever since, but he clearly didn't, constantly bombarding her with gifts and asking her out, seemingly unperturbed by her endless flow of excuses and polite brush offs. 'Hey, bro,' Derry called to Lamont, snapping her out of her reverie. 'Can you give me a hand moving some barrels downstairs?' 'Yes Massa, sho' thang Massa!' said Lamont in an exaggerated southern accent, rolling his eyes and pretending to pull subserviently at an imaginary forelock. Niamh smiled, and the two men walked out of the room with Sandra and Niamh's eyes following them. 'So,' said Niamh, breaking the slightly uncomfortable silence, 'you guys have a nice evening?' 'Uhuh,' replied Sandra, coolly. 'Lamont told me it's your birthday next week. Something about having a party here if Derry agrees?' 'Uh, yeah, he said we could,' sighed Niamh, trying to recover some of her previous excitement about the idea. 'Hopefully it will be a good night.' Then she remembered that Sandra wouldn't be able to come as she'd deliberately picked a night she was working. 'Oh, I'm sorry it's on a day you're not around… it's um, just, you know, I couldn't take a night off at the same time as Lamont.' She wondered if Sandra would take it personally, thinking Niamh was trying to exclude her. 'Maybe you could come by after you finish work?' she suggested, lamely. 'Yeah, maybe.' Sandra didn't sound exactly enthused, but she looked up at Niamh, whose eyes had wandered back over to the door Derry had gone out of minutes before, and narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. 'So, was Derry okay with the idea?' she asked, curiously. 'Um, yeah, he was cool with it.' Niamh's hesitation was evident and she folded her arms across her chest, hands rubbing against her upper arms distractedly. Derry and Lamont seemed to be taking a long time changing the barrels. She knew Lamont was the only person Derry really talked to, and it worried her that he seemed to want to talk to him now. Was he really okay with the party? Niamh still didn't understand Derry and Lamont's relationship and although she had gotten over her initial jealousy of their closeness, it still made her slightly uneasy. Even around Lamont, Derry wasn't talkative, although Lamont did enough talking for the both of them, but when she was with them she was always aware of the weight of something heavy and unspoken between them. It seemed such an unlikely friendship, they were so different in every conceivable way, but there was no doubting the deep bond between them. It wasn't in what was said, but in the occasional deep silences and the unreadable looks they gave one another when she asked about their past and how they met. All she knew was that they both came originally from California, and that Lamont had followed Derry out to New Hampshire a few years after Derry made the move. He helped Derry run the bar, and was the only friend Niamh had ever heard Derry mention. When the bar was shut, they played ball together and worked out in the Y, which is where Lamont had met Sandra a few months back. It had been a relief to Niamh when Sandra turned up, as she had begun to wonder whether it was something more than friendship that bound Derry and Lamont together. Sure, Lamont always had an appraising glance and a quick compliment for any woman who came within his radius, and he had even hit on her pretty hard when she first started working at the bar. He couldn't get over the idea of a black Irish girl and her accent had him in pieces. 'Sheeeeee-it, if I knew they had girls in Ireland who looked like Denise Huxtable and spoke like Lady Di, I'da gone Catholic and moved there myself!' he would say, grinning at her and looking her up and down. But Lamont's initial interest quickly dissipated and however hard she tried, Derry remained completely impervious to her, at least physically, even as they grew increasingly close in other ways. They discovered shared interests in history and literature, which took her by surprise, and she felt slightly ashamed when she realised how much she had judged him on his outward appearances. She noted ruefully that as much as she was quick to complain about the preconceptions that surrounded her own appearance, she had been as ready to write Derry off as meat head who couldn't possibly understand about the things she was interested in. How wrong that was became evident by the end of her first shift in the bar. She'd managed to struggle through not too badly given her lies about previous experience. Derry clearly wasn't fooled by her excuses that things were different in pubs in England, but seemed almost amused by her attempts to keep up the pretence. He patiently took her through the basics, and luckily she picked things up quickly enough that by the end of the evening she was feeling that maybe he wouldn't completely regret taking her on. They were tidying up after closing time, when he asked her what she was studying. 'Oh, well, I'm studying for a PhD,' she said, and could tell from his raised eyebrows and quick nod that he was interested. 'What in?' he asked. 'Oh, it's kind of hard to explain,' she replied. Her studies were pretty niche and were what had brought her to New Hampshire. The Jewish studies department at the university had recently inherited the archive of a long-dead Austrian writer who was the subject of her thesis. 'Try me,' he challenged, straightening up from sweeping the floor and leaning one hand on the bar. Niamh was surprised and pleased to have gotten his attention, and felt herself warming slightly under his intense gaze. 'Okay, well I'm studying 19th Century German-Jewish literature and philosophy, but my thesis is on the way sexual and racial politics were conflated in that time, and how they fed into the politics that would eventually lead to the holocaust.' Derry's eyes narrowed and his stare intensified. 'Hmm,' he said. 'That's an intense subject, for sure. What made you pick that era and that field?' She was surprised at the question; most people just glazed over at that point and changed the conversation. 'I was fascinated by the whole dynamic that was going on in central Europe at that time,' she said. 'All those nationalities, languages, races mixing up in a way that had never happened before, that sense of the end of an Empire and the way the decay gave rise to so much creativity and passion. But also how poignant it is when you can already see the seeds of the hatred and violence that was about tear the entire continent apart for the next 50 years.' 'The Rassenbabylon,' he said. 'Yes, exactly,' she said, unable to hide her surprise at him knowing the term Hitler had used to describe what he saw as a disgusting intermingling of the races. 'They say his year in Vienna shaped his hatred of multiculturalism when he saw 'good' Germanic girls being 'corrupted' by venal Jews,' she continued. 'I spent a year in Vienna as part of my first degree, and wandered round all those coffee shops where Freud and Herzl sat. We would take overnight trains to Prague and read Kafka and visit the Jewish Museum there. It scared me. It's like we put it all in a museum and forgot about it – we just say 'Never Again' and that's enough. But it's never gone away - at the University in Vienna they still have these groups of far-right students called Burschenschaften wandering around in full uniform. They were the ones who welcomed Hitler in and kicked out all the Jewish students. They were basically the prototype for the Hitler Youth and yet they're still feted in that country, still part of the elite. They go to all the balls, and get the best seats at the Opera, and everyone acts like it's all okay because no one is putting Jews in concentration camps anymore. The targets may change from one generation to the next, but the fear and hatred are always there, and we need to keep studying them so we can recognise them when they start reappearing.' She realised she was starting to rant a little, but her passion for her area of studies was not just academic. Her own life had been blighted by religious intolerance and ignorant racism, and her fear of where they could lead was more than theoretical. She noticed Derry had gone quiet with a sombre look in his eyes. 'Sorry, I'm on my soapbox again. You shouldn't ask me these questions if you want to get home on time!' she said, trying to lighten the mood. He didn't smile, but nodded seriously and picked up the broom again and began sweeping. Taking her cue from him she quickly finished up cleaning down the bar and set off for home. She went over the conversation in her head again on the way home, trying to see if she'd said something that would have antagonised Derry. She recalled how she had assumed he wouldn't know, or care, about her research and how he'd proven her wrong. She felt her condescension must have been obvious to him, and mentally kicked herself for it. He intrigued her and she couldn't deny finding him attractive, even if he definitely wasn't her usual type, and she realised she wanted to know more about him and find out what went on in his mind. From then on, their conversations as they worked alongside each other after hours became something she found herself looking forward to more and more. His knowledge of history and philosophy was impressive, and he argued with her robustly, particularly when it came to her view of American history. She felt sure he must have studied seriously, but when she asked him, he claimed never to have gone to college. She found that hard to believe. The way his mind worked, there was no way he could have failed at school and she began to wonder if he had been on an academic route and something had knocked him off the path. It wasn't exactly uncommon for people to break under the pressure of a PhD and drop out and it would explain the air of quiet sadness that never quite left him, and his quiet but undeniable antipathy to the students who thronged into his bar. As the months went by, Niamh found that Derry was in her thoughts most of her waking moments. Whatever she read or watched, she immediately wondered what he would have thought of it. She had even started using him as a sounding board for the mess of ideas she was trying to turn into her PhD thesis and it amazed her how deeply he understood and engaged with ideas she had spent years studying. The mental connection she felt to him became a powerful force when combined with his undeniable physical magnetism. The initial vague attraction she had felt for him on first walking into the bar grew with every conversation and burned its way into something much deeper in her soul. But Derry seemed to be made of stone. Her jealousy made her wonder if there was someone else in his life, but all he seemed to do was work. He never showed any interest the women who came into the bar, plenty of whom had bright smiles for the brooding, muscular bar tender who served them. So there was only Lamont, and she began to torture herself with the thoughts that the unspoken bond between them was evidence of a physical relationship that went beyond friendship. In some ways it was a comfort – if Derry was gay, then it wasn't her fault he wasn't attracted to her. But if he was, then all her dreams and desires were so irrevocably hopeless that she still would have preferred to see him walk through the door with some dumb blond cheerleader on his arm. At least that way she would have some hope. Then Lamont walked in one day with Sandra. Niamh looked to Derry to see his reaction, but it was clear he was pleased for his friend and he made an instant effort to make Sandra welcome. So he wasn't gay, it was her fault all along, Niamh thought. All the insecurities about her appearance that had plagued her as a child came flooding back. She spent ages staring into the mirror, criticising her every flaw – the too small eyes, her unmanageable hair which she let grow into a natural, kinky frizz after years of burning it with straightening solutions, her freckles which you could still see in spite of her blackness. She compared her figure to the willowy white girls who wandered round campus flicking their shiny hair from side to side, wearing the shortest of shorts over long, slim legs and cropped tops showing their slender waists and neat breasts. Her mixture of Jamaican and Irish descent had given her a thickness that she was horribly conscious of next to these model-skinny girls; a backside that was too round, breasts that jutted out and stretched at her clothes so they didn't swish and drape themselves elegantly round her the way theirs did. Growing up she'd been the skinny, fast kid who ran for the school team, and even though puberty filled her out with unexpected curves, she still had a lithe, athletic body which she knew from experience could turn heads. But Derry's imperviousness made her doubt herself, and believe that if she could only be like those waiflike white girls he would look at her. Or maybe more like Sandra, more like the real black woman she had often in her life felt that she didn't know how to be. Sandra's deep skin tone and glossy weaves gave her an air of composure and confident identity that Niamh coveted. Of course Niamh knew deep down how unfair this was; she had profited enough times in her life by looking as if she could 'pass' to know that life was stacked harshly against darker skinned women, but Derry's indifference made her irrational. And now this perfect storm of insecurity and doubt came flooding over her as she waited for Derry and Lamont to reappear. She tried to push the slow, creeping feeling of dread from her mind and tell herself that the party was a good idea. It's just a party, she thought. And how bad could it really be?[Chapter 4] The night before Niamh's party, Derry didn't sleep well. Niamh had spent the week before trying to get him interested in all the details of invites, cocktail lists and music. He tried to show willing but every time she talked about it he felt that same sick feeling in his stomach and just wanted it to all be over. He could tell it meant a lot to her, though, even though he didn't really understand why, so he tried to smile and not let his doubts affect her. What Lamont had said to him that night Niamh first mentioned the party was playing on his mind, too. When he and Sandra had come into the bar that evening, he had called Lamont down into the cellar to try and help him find a way out of it. 'What you freaking out about?' Lamont had asked. 'The girl just wanna get her party on for her birthday.' 'Shit, I know, she's young, she wants to party,' he sighed. 'But why here? Why does she have to bring all those people to my bar?' Lamont had looked sideways at him, with narrowed eyes. 'Well, maybe she wants you to party with her?' he said, lightly. Derry scowled at Lamont. He thought they had gotten beyond stupid comments like that. When Niamh had first started in the bar, Lamont used to flirt with her, like he did with most pretty girls that he came into contact with. 'Damn, she is fine ,' he had said to Derry after their first shift. 'Now that is an English muffin I wouldn't mind waking up to.' Derry had felt a stab of anger and jealousy at the image. 'She's not English, she's Irish. And don't talk like that about her,' he had snapped before he could help himself. After that, Lamont was careful not to hit on Niamh, and watched Derry's reactions to her closely. 'You know, D,' he said once, when Derry was watching yet another customer offer to buy Niamh a drink, 'if I had those Irish eyes smiling at me every day, I'd try and smile back sometimes.' 'What the fuck do you mean?' Derry had rounded on him again, sounding angrier than he had meant to. 'Yo, don't take it the wrong way, a'ight,' Lamont hit back, defensively. 'I'm just saying, she seem to be going out of her way to get your attention, and you seem to be going out of your way to not pay her any.' 'Don't be stupid. She doesn't want anything from me,' Derry replied quickly. Then he seemed to deflate slightly and added quietly: 'And, even if she did, what the fuck do I have to give her?' He had shaken his head as if to clear it of the thought, turning around to rearrange the bottles on the shelf behind the bar. If he hadn't, he would have seen Niamh turn to look at him, wanting to see if he'd noticed the guy hitting on her, but instead all she saw was the back of his head, again. It bothered Derry when Lamont said things like that, and Lamont soon stopped when he saw how Derry reacted. So why would his friend stir that shit back up again now, now he had this stupid party to deal with? When he woke up on the morning of the party it took a long time to get his head ready to face the day. His usual morning workout left him feeling dissatisfied, so he jumped up to catch the pull-up bar welded to his living room ceiling and began to heave himself up and down, grunting with the effort. Even that couldn't burn away the irritability welling up inside him, so he threw on jogging pants and his ever-present long-sleeved t-shirt and went out for a run. He ran hard, until his legs and his lungs were screaming at him to stop, but he pushed on, feeling a masochistic pleasure in the pain he was causing himself. Finally, he could go no further and he came to a halt, leaning forward, hands on his knees, breath ragged and head spinning. It's just a couple of hours, he told himself. This time tomorrow and it will all be over. The daytime shift seemed to drag as if time itself was mocking him. There weren't enough customers for him to busy himself with, but nor was the bar empty so he could go sit out back and brood on his thoughts. Finally, at 6pm he cleared the final few customers out and hung the sign on the door that Niamh had spent far more time than was necessary designing and carefully laminating. 'Bar closed for private event this evening. Thank you for your understanding.' She had said they would be arriving at 8 but he wanted to give himself time to prepare. He went upstairs, put a CD into the player and lay down on his threadbare sofa with one arm thrown over his eyes. Nina Simone's voice washed over him as he lay there, trying to achieve the state of numbness that would carry him through the evening ahead. When Danny had died, he had nearly gone mad with anguish and guilt. Seeing his mother and sister breaking with grief, he had desperately wanted to give in to the seductive rage that told him to avenge Danny's death. It would have been so easy to go back to that life; there was something so solid and reassuring about hatred. It made you hard and invincible and gave a meaning to your pain. But he knew it was a siren's call that would drive him back onto the rocks he had been broken on before. Yet again it had been Dr Sweeney who was there to catch him when he was about to fall. He listened to Derek rail and rage, allowing him his anger and his pain, but not letting him forget his responsibility to atone for his own sins. Eventually Derek had thrown himself into taking down his old neo-Nazi gang with a fervour that verged on the kamikaze. The tentacles of the gangs spread far into other, more organised, groups and eventually Derek was responsible for information that led to the infiltration of a number of neo-Nazi networks across California and beyond. There was a part of him that had hoped one of the gangs would come for him so he could have gone down in the violent and bloody end he knew he deserved. They didn't, though, and in the end, he took the place in the witness protection programme offered to him by the police. It meant his mother yet again losing her oldest son, but he reasoned to himself that she and his sisters were better off without his malign influence in their lives. He had packed a small bag and headed off to the colder climes of New Hampshire without a backwards glance and Derek became Derry. The ghosts of the dead followed him, though. The faces of two Black men he had brutally murdered the night they tried to break into his home had long haunted his dreams, but now they were joined by Danny. Sweet, funny, stupid Danny. His baby brother, the one he should have protected, lying in his arms, face spattered with blood. Derry knew he had killed Danny as surely as if he had pulled the trigger himself and he raged against the Universe for taking Danny instead of him. The only thing that kept him alive was the thought that he didn't deserve the mercy of the coward's way out. He deserved to live, to suffer and be punished for what he had done. Eventually, the pain was too much to bear, though, and he could only survive by refusing to feel anything. If he couldn't bear to feel the pain, he couldn't deserve to feel anything, he reasoned. He had become an expert in shutting himself down, robotically getting through each day as if it was a duty and nothing more. The only person he had kept in touch with was Lamont, and when Lamont finally made parole, Derek paid for a ticket for Lamont to join him in his new life. He could see how Lamont was shocked by the changes in him, and half expected him to take off for somewhere less depressing. Lamont stuck around, though, and Derek was grateful he had. They didn't talk much of the past, but having Lamont there gave him comfort. He wanted to escape who he was, who he had been, but Lamont knew the worst of him that there was to know and still stood quietly by him. It was a pleasure too, seeing his friend live the good life he deserved. Lamont threw himself into the pleasures of the outside world that Derek denied himself, and Derek got a small vicarious pleasure from knowing he had helped enable this. He had been truly pleased for his friend when he met Sandra. There had been other girls before her, but he could tell from the start that she meant something more to Lamont and Derek rejoiced for his friend even as he felt a pang of loneliness at losing part of him to her. The only thing upsetting his careful equilibrium now was Niamh. She tested the walls he had built around his feelings like nothing before, and it was a daily battle to convince his heart that he felt nothing more than disinterested friendship for her. He knew the wisest thing would be to cut her out of his life altogether, but he couldn't. Like a parched man in the desert who knows the cooling lake he can see on the horizon is a mirage but who can't stop limping towards it. As he lay there trying to control his thoughts, the heart-rending words of the Nina Simone song on the stereo intruded on his consciousness. 'Ne me quitte pas,' beseeched Nina Simone. Don't leave me. Derry sat up. Suddenly he knew why the party was filling him with such dread. It was the dread of knowing he was going to lose her. Of course he had always known that. She was destined for a different world to his, but somehow when it was just the two of them, working together, laughing, talking, arguing, he could block out the world for a few hours and convince himself that he mattered to her. When she asked his advice and listened to his answers so attentively it made him feel for he counted for something. Seeing her with her friends, though, made him painfully aware of how stupid he was to think that. He didn't belong in their world and she would move on with them, leaving him behind – just a memory, if even that, of some guy she worked with in a bar to pay her way through grad school. 'Il faut oublier. Tout peut s'oublier,' continued Nina. You must forget. Everything can be forgotten. But Derry knew too well there are some things that cannot be forgotten.[Chapter 5] **Thank you so much to the people who have taken time to review. You've given me the energy to keep going - hope you enjoy even this half as much as I have enjoyed writing it ;-) Seriously, it means a lot - it's the first time I've done this and it's great to know this story that I love so much has reached someone else. ** Chapter 5: It's My Party Niamh stood in front of the mirror in her room nervously checking her appearance for the millionth time. She had finally given into the nagging of her Moroccan friend, Oumaima, to let her tame Niamh's hair. Growing up with her white mother, Niamh had never learned the intricacies of how to care for black hair and didn't have the patience to sit through the bewildering array of treatments in the beauty shop. This time she submitted, though, and allowed Oumaima to smooth, oil, twist and pull at her hair for what felt like hours, clicking her tongue disappointedly at Niamh's split ends and poorly tamed curls. Niamh had to admit that it was worth the fuss, though. Oumaima had skilfully woven the front of her hair into a tight braid running from one side of her head to the other, lacing a gold ribbon through it that matched Niamh's dress. Oumaima had wanted to tie up the rest of her hair into a bun behind the braid, but Niamh liked the way her natural curls spilled out behind it and refused. The gold mini-dress she was wearing was far more daring than her usual style, cut low at the front and clinging to her curves. It was covered in rows of round golden sequins, like the coins on a belly-dancer's costume, which shimmered as she moved. She wore matching gold high heels which made her even taller than usual and exaggerated the tilt of her hips and the angle of her full breasts. The tall, groomed, confident girl in the mirror almost seemed like a stranger and Niamh fought down the voice in her head that told her she looked like a kid dressing up in her mother's clothes. She shook her hair out, putting one hand on her hip and stared coolly into the mirror as if daring her reflection to betray her. Okay, she thought. Let's do this. She had arranged to meet with some of her friends on the way to the bar and she was running late, as usual. She pulled on a denim jacket over her dress and clattered down the stairs from the dorm, slightly unsteady in the unfamiliar heels. In the parking lot out front she saw Hugo in his car waiting for her, Stefania and Javier in the back. 'Hey, Posh Boy, sorry I'm late,' she said as she opened the door. 'No problem, dahling,' replied Hugo in his exaggerated upper-class accent, whistling slowly as he looked her up and down. 'Gosh. I guess Belle is ready for her ball!' Niamh flicked her hair and pouted, trying not to blush. She hated herself for still letting Hugo's aura of privilege intimidate her. They had met here at grad school, where she found out that they had actually been at Cambridge at the same time, although clearly their paths had never crossed. The son of a Scottish landowner, who rubbed shoulders with royalty at his elite private school, Hugo's life at Cambridge had revolved around formal college dinners and presidency of the Mountaineering club. Niamh, on the other hand, had arrived from her South London housing estate upbringing and immediately hated all the snobbery and pretentiousness of that life. She felt she had more in common with the teenagers bussed in by the colleges from the estates surrounding the city to wait on the students at their formal dinners than she did with her fellow students. She had turned her back on all that, and while she had excelled academically, she never joined in with the balls, the punting trips on the Cam and the other activities that felt so alien to her, escaping back to London at every possibility. She had given Hugo the nickname Posh Boy within weeks of meeting him, and he good-naturedly accepted the moniker, playing up to the stereotype. 'Cagna, you look hot!' said Stefania, with her usual bluntness. Stefania was a wild, intense young woman from Milan who smoked incessantly and viewed the rest of the world as having been put there for her to do battle with. 'It'll be all eyes on you tonight,' she added catching Niamh's eye in the rear-view mirror. Stefania was the only friend Niamh had told about her feelings for Derry. She hadn't wanted to, but Stef had come to the bar one day to see her and was immediately taken by Derry. 'Ciao bello!' she had said to him, eying Derry lasciviously. Then more loudly than Niamh would have liked, turned to her and said: 'Why didn't you tell me your boss was so fucking hot, I would have come to visit your little bar sooner.' Niamh hadn't replied, but nothing got past Stef's eagle eyes and she immediately noticed her friend blush and scowl a little. 'Ohhhh, I get it, you are trying to keep him to yourself! That's fair, I do already have Javier, and he is the jealous type,' she admitted. 'It doesn't matter,' Niamh replied. 'He's not interested in me anyway.' She realised too late that she hadn't denied her own feelings for Derry, but Stef would have guessed anyway. And underneath the hard exterior, Stef was actually surprisingly intuitive and ready, in her own foulmouthed way, to be a shoulder to cry on. She didn't push Niamh any further, but would occasionally ask her how things were going at work, and would offer a small kiss to Niamh's cheek or a hug when Niamh just shrugged in reply. 'Che cazzo, mi cara,' she would say. 'He's either crazy or blind.' They arrived at the bar and pulled up. Hugo opened the trunk of the car and pulled out two large record boxes and Stefania carefully handed the large cake box she had been carrying on her lap to Javier. Here goes nothing, thought Niamh, pushing open the door into the bar and walking in. Derry and Lamont had pushed the tables to the edges of the room clearing a larger than usual space for dancing and were fixing the wiring to a small lighting rig hanging from the ceiling. They both turned as she and her friends came in, and Derry seemed to freeze when he saw her. Lamont grinned and walked over to hug her. 'Yo shorty, it's your birthday,' he sang. 'We gonna party like it's your birthday.' She smiled and introduced her friends, who shook hands and looked around them with critical eyes. 'So, I have my decks in the car,' Hugo said. 'Where shall I put them, my man?' Lamont looked startled for a moment at Hugo's accent and the air he had of being the Laird of the Manor ordering his servants around, but then clapped him on the back. 'Lemme help you,' he said and they walked out towards the car. Niamh turned nervously back to Derry, who was still watching her. 'Hey,' she said, with an uncertain smile. 'Hey,' he replied, quietly. 'Happy Birthday.' Niamh wasn't used to the way Derry was looking at her and she felt unexpectedly awkward. She tugged the hem of her dress down nervously and pulled the denim jacket around her, wishing she'd worn something less showy. The atmosphere between them thickened and neither of them seemed to know what to say next. Just before she could blurt out something stupid to break the silence, Lamont and Hugo came crashing back through the doors carrying a set of DJ decks and laughing at something the others couldn't hear. Derry turned to go and help them, and the moment was gone. The bar quickly filled up with people and noise. Niamh was touched to see how many of the friends and acquaintances she had invited had turned up, most bearing gifts, cards and flowers which piled up on the unused tables. The drinks were flowing freely, and Hugo's music had people up and dancing to an eclectic mix of European dance music and American hip-hop. To her disappointment, though Derry stayed the other side of the bar, seemingly determined to stay in his professional role and not join in the party. Niamh repeatedly tried to catch his eye but he was being kept busy by the constant stream of people at the bar. At least he wouldn't be able to complain that takings were down, she thought, her friends seemed to be trying to drink the bar dry. Stefania had insisted on treating Niamh to a bottle of Italian Prosecco. 'Fuck that French champagne bullshit,' she had said, pouring Niamh another glass of the fizzing white wine. Niamh smiled. It wasn't as if they stocked French champagne in Derry's bar, but she wouldn't have been able to tell the difference anyway. She usually avoided drinking around Derry, knowing he was teetotal, but tonight she didn't care. She had worked so hard to get this evening right and if he was going to carry on ignoring her, she might as well get drunk and have some fun. The bubbles went straight to Niamh's head, and as the evening wore on she tried to mask her disappointment at Derry's inattention by laughing loudly and flitting between groups of friends, smiling and hugging everyone. As she grew drunker, her inhibitions began to melt and soon she and Stef were up on the dance floor together, hands interlaced, twisting and gliding around each other. Niamh felt the tension of the past weeks and months leaving her as she lost herself in the music and in the sinuous physical contact with her friend. Hugo was picking the tempo up, playing Spanish and North African songs with skittering rhythms and the two of them danced faster and faster. The coins on Niamh's dress whirled and flickered as she flicked her hips, holding Stef's hand high above her head as she circled around her. 'See, I told you it would be all eyes on you,' Stef leaned forward and mouthed into Niamh's ear over the noise. The wine and the music had gone to her head and made her forget about what was around her, but looking up Niamh saw a small circle had formed around them, cheering them on. She noticed Derry pushing his way past the edge of the circle, heading to pick up a row of empty glasses left on the table behind them. At that moment, the music changed abruptly as Hugo wheeled the record back and the heavy, pulsing beat of 'American Boy' dropped. Whooping, the circle around them broke as the crowd began to dance to the new song, and Derry suddenly found himself jostled into the midst of the dancing throng. Niamh was just feet away from him and without thinking, she reached out and grabbed his hand, pulling him towards her. Stef immediately saw her move and closed in behind him, smoothly blocking his way out and dancing up against him, pushing him further forwards towards Niamh. Niamh was drunk enough not to care about the shocked look on his face. The moment was too perfect to let pass and she looped her fingers between his, swaying towards him until her thighs were brushing against his as she dipped provocatively against him, locking eyes with him. 'Take me on a trip, I want to go somewhere,' sang Estelle on the track. 'Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.' To her surprise and delight Derry didn't resist and she felt his hand rest lightly on her hip, following the movements of her body. Emboldened, she reached one hand up to his shoulder, their bodies getting closer with each beat. She felt dizzy with exhilaration to finally be close enough to touch him. How many times had she fantasised about what this might feel like? The feel of his strong, muscular frame brushing tantalisingly against the whole length of her body turned her on and her dancing became more provocative. With her heels on she was nearly as tall as Derry and she leant forward with her lips brushing against his ear as, carried away by the moment, she sang along to the words of the song sung by a Black English girl to her American lover: 'Could you be my love, love? Would you be my American boy?' As if in response, his hand gripped her hip tighter and suddenly she found herself pressed hard against his solid chest. Her hand crept around the back of his neck until they were almost cheek to cheek, hips swaying in time with each other. This felt better than she could ever have dreamt. It felt so natural and right to be there, his arm around her and his breath on her cheek. This is it, thought Niamh, feeling as if she was floating on a cloud of joy. Finally, everything I have longed for is here. Her joy was short lived, however. Suddenly, she sensed a commotion next to her and looked round to see Stefania trying to deflect the unwelcome figure of Marc bearing down on her and Derry. Shit, thought Niamh. What is he doing here? I didn't invite him. She had gone out of her way to avoid him since that drunken mistake of a one night stand weeks earlier, but here he was, crashing her perfect moment with Derry. Marc grabbed her arm and swung her abruptly out of Derry's embrace, a blast of alcohol fumes hitting her in the face as he did. He was clearly intoxicated, eyes shining and hair dishevelled. 'Ma chérie!' he cried, pulling her towards him. She swerved quickly enough that his clumsy kiss landed on her cheek and she recoiled in disgust. ''Appy Birthday! We must celebrate, non?' he continued in the thick French accent Niamh found so pretentious. 'Garçon!' he cried, clicking his fingers at Derry and waving a $100 bill. 'Go get me and my girl some Champagne, or whatever the closest is you 'ave in this place.' Overcome with surprise, shame and confusion, Niamh could hardly make herself look at Derry. He stood still for a moment, his face an unreadable mask, then plucked the money from Marc's hand and turned and marched back towards the bar. Niamh wanted to cry out to him and beg him to come back. She wanted to explain away this horrible apparition but the words were stuck in her throat. The stench of alcohol and the wild look in Marc's eyes made her fear what he might do next as, still gripping her possessively against him, he dragged her towards the bar. Derry had disappeared back behind the counter and, without looking at Niamh, he slammed another bottle of prosecco and two glasses down on it. 'No champagne,' he snapped as he threw a wad of bills down next to them. 'Here's your change.' Marc waved his hand dismissively. 'Oh, keep the change, barkeeper,' he said, letting go of Niamh's arm as he went to open the bottle. Derry was still resolutely refusing to meet her eye as if even the sight of her was repulsive to him now. Gulping down a sob at how quickly the warmth between them had evaporated and still trembling from the memory of his arms around her, she could bear it no longer. She took her chance while Marc was distracted and turned and ran to the bathroom, collapsing through the door just as the tears welled up and began to pour down her face.[Chapter 6] **AN: Warning for some more mature content and language in this chapter. Please, please let me know what you think! I'm getting to a kind of dark place with the story now, but please hang in there with me. It will be okay in the end. I think… ** Chapter 6: A Tangled Web Derry watched Niamh run off towards the bathroom with an aching heart. He was overcome with anger at himself for having lost control of his actions and allowing himself to be shown up by that asshole, Marc. What the fuck was he thinking, dancing like that with her, hands pawing away at her in front of the whole room? He had known he was in trouble from the minute she walked into the bar that evening, a vision of shimmering beauty, her dress barely covering her sexy curves and her face shining with excitement. He had never seen her look more stunning and he could barely talk to her or look at her without feeling a hot stab of desire. He hid himself behind the bar, willing himself to ignore her, but painfully aware of her flitting around the room, hugging and kissing the stream of friends who piled into the bar. She seemed to him like a shimmering glow of gold floating around the room spilling fairy dust behind her and leaving everyone staring in her wake. It was when she had gotten up to dance with that crazy Italian friend of hers that he really lost it. That girl – Stef, wasn't it? – had been in to the bar a couple of times before when Niamh was working and Derry couldn't help but notice her suggestive stare and filthy mouth. She had been buying Niamh drinks since they arrived, and seemed determined to get her drunk. He had looked up with dismay to see them up on the dance floor, provocatively winding around each other, eyes locked, sliding in and out of each other's arms. They were both natural dancers, their bodies fitting effortlessly to the rhythms, luxuriating in the physical pleasure of movement and watching them together was unbelievably sexy. Derry wasn't the only one captivated by the spectacle and soon a crowd formed around the two girls. He noticed Lamont staring appreciatively at them and gave his friend an annoyed scowl. 'Fuck, man!' Lamont said, smiling as he spread his hands out in a gesture of surrender. 'What do you want? I'm only human!' 'You don't think Sandra would have something to say about you standing there with your tongue on the floor?' snapped Derry. 'Oh yeah sure,' replied Lamont, shaking his head, as he turned back to serve another customer waiting at the bar. 'It's Sandra who's going to be jealous.' Derry felt a flash of anger at Lamont, and walked out from behind the bar before he could say something he would regret. He was coiled tight like a spring and needed to move to release his tension, so began to walk to the other side of the bar to collect up empty glasses. He tried to keep his eyes averted from Niamh but found himself instinctively walking closer towards the circle crowded around her and Stef. Stef was looking around her, clearly revelling in the effect they were having on the room. Niamh, on the other hand, seemed oblivious to anything but the music, eyes half closed as her hips moved in shimmying, sensual circles to the beat. Stef saw him coming and leant forward to whisper something in Niamh's ear, which made her suddenly look up. Afraid she would see him staring, Derry tried to swerve away from them and towards the back of the bar, but before he could go more than a couple of paces, the music suddenly changed. He'd never heard the new song before, but the crowd clearly had and, as one, they broke into a cheer and began dancing. Derry's way was blocked and turning to go back the way he had come, found himself face to face with Niamh. Her face and eyes were shining, lips parted in a sensual smile, the gold thread in her hair catching the lights as they changed and spun. His breath caught in his throat at the sheer beauty of her and he stood rooted to the spot, unable to move as she reached out and took his hand. He felt as if he were watching himself from far away as she slowly drew him towards her, intoxicated by the shimmer of her dress and her skin, the smell of her perfume and the heat of her body. Before he knew what he was doing, he found his hand reaching out to touch her swaying hip, gently caressing the curve of her body. Her movements infected him and he began to rock in time with her. She moved towards him, closing the space between them and reaching up to rest her hand on his shoulder. She was so tantalisingly close he could feel the soft curves of her body brushing against him and the warmth of her breath on his cheek. Realising resistance was futile, he gave in, allowing himself to revel in the moment, breathing in her scent and closing his eyes. He felt her lips against his ear, and strained to hear what she was saying. She seemed to be singing along to the song, the words dropping into his consciousness and making his heart thrum with desire: 'Will you be my love, my love? Would you be my American boy?' Unconsciously he gripped her tighter, stifling a groan in his throat. He wanted her so badly he was unable to think of anything other than holding her to him and never letting go, when suddenly she stiffened and jerked out of his arms. His eyes snapped open to see Niamh staring guiltily at a dishevelled looking man who was holding her arm. Derry recognised him. He was called Marc, and he had been in the bar repeatedly the last few weeks, sitting at a table in the corner and speaking to Niamh in French. She had seemed agitated when he was there, and Derry had asked her if she was okay. She had smiled and said yes, sure, he was just one of the professors from her department. He guessed it made her uncomfortable to have the two sides of her life cross over like that so had nodded and left them to it. Now the guy was here again, clearly drunk, and pulling Niamh into a controlling embrace, calling her 'Chérie'. Derry felt the floor beneath him shift and sway as he took in the scene. Niamh was so embarrassed she couldn't meet his eye and the guy, Marc, had clear look of triumph as he waved money in Derry's face, snapping his fingers at him to get back to his place behind the bar. Stiff with shame and regret, Derry had marched back to the bar, trying to keep the tumult of emotions from his face as he inwardly cursed his own stupidity. He couldn't bear to look at her as he put out the bottle Marc had ordered, and struggled to keep calm when Marc dismissively waved away his change, telling Derry to keep it as a tip. Marc was around Derry's height, but must have been closer to half his weight, with curly brown hair flopping over one eye. He wore a long dark coat, over a ruffled white shirt with a blue silk cravat knotted loosely around his neck. He looked and sounded like an exaggerated stereotype of a French intellectual, and the idea of Niamh being possessed by such an arrogant, patronising jerk made the bile rise in Derry's throat. He'd always known he would lose, her, but surely not to this ! As Marc turned to open the bottle, he finally let go of Niamh's arm and both men turned in surprise as she pulled suddenly away from him, practically running towards the bathroom. Derry caught the look on her face as she ran and he could have sworn she was crying. Stef, who had witnessed the entire scene, rushed after her friend and disappeared through the bathroom door. Derry and Marc both watched them go in silence, but Marc was the first to recover. He turned to Derry. 'Oh, I am sorry for you,' he smirked. 'I suppose Niamh did not tell you about us?' He sighed theatrically with a Gallic shrug. 'What can I say,' he went on. 'The girl is a terrible prick-tease; she loves to string men along.' Derry tensed and tried to resist the temptation to reach across the bar and punch Marc in his stupid, sneering face. 'It takes a certain kind of man to tame a little négresse like that,' Marc smiled. 'But oh là là, I tell you my friend, it is worth it in the end.' Shaking with fury at the racial slur Marc had used, Derry replied in an icy voice: 'Well my friend , I guess that's the difference between you and me. I don't feel the need to try and prove my manhood by 'taming' her.' He turned on his heel to see Lamont standing next to him with a concerned look on his face. 'Yo D, you okay?' he asked, putting a hand on Derry's arm. Derry nodded grimly, not trusting himself to speak. He noticed Lamont's eyes following some movement over his shoulder and turned around. The door to the bathroom was opening and Stef was leading an unsteady looking Niamh out by her arm. Even at this distance Derry could see she had been crying and his heart softened towards her, wishing he could take her back in his arms and make everything okay again. Stef was leading Niamh towards the street door, and Marc, sensing this, darted over to cut them off, prosecco bottle still in one hand. He was talking to Niamh, his other hand gripping her arm again and she seemed to be trying to twist away from him. He wouldn't let go and was pulling her towards him again, an angry look on his face, as Stef moved in between them as if to break up a fight. Instinctively, Derry vaulted over the bar in one swift motion and reached Niamh's side just as she wrenched her arm free from Marc's grip. Marc was shouting at her drunkenly in French and Derry could understand enough to hear him calling her a whore. Willing himself to be calm, Derry kept his back to Marc and faced Niamh. He went to touch her arm where Marc had been gripping it, but hesitated, holding back. 'Are you okay?' he asked, softly. She shook her head dumbly, and tears started welling up in her eyes again. Stef was unleashing a stream of Italian profanities at Marc, who was still slurring and waving the bottle of prosecco around. Derry felt a shove in his back and swung round to see the red-faced Frenchman still shouting, spittle flying from his mouth. Marc went to swing the bottle at Derry's head. He was so drunk and clumsy, it was easy for Derry to step out the way. Niamh had seen the swing coming too, though, and stepped forward as if to warn Derry. As Derry moved out of the way, the bottle struck Niamh with a sickening thud across her face, knocking her to the floor. Time seemed to stand still and the crowd which had been gathering around the brewing storm gasped and took a step back. A red wave of rage flooded over Derry as he saw Niamh fall and he swung round, face contorted with rage, fists ready to smash Marc into a bloody pulp. Stef was quicker though, and she grabbed Derry by his arms, urgently commanding him to stop, her face inches from his. For a second he thought he would hit her too, and she flinched as if she could read his mind, but stood firm. 'No Derry, no. Do not do it,' she said, trying to twist him around away from Marc. 'Go to her . She needs you.' Oh shit, Niamh, he thought, suddenly ashamed of his reaction. He turned back to see her slumped on the floor, face in her hands, sobbing, and trickle of red blood coming from an ugly gash on her cheek. He sank to his knees next to her. 'Niamh! Niamh!' he cried. 'Look at me! Are you okay?' She didn't reply, and didn't take her hands away from her face. 'Honey, please,' he begged. 'Please don't cry. It's okay, I'm sorry.' He knew he was babbling and wanted above all else to get her out of there, away from all this mess and noise. He gently tried to pick her up, sliding his hands under her arms. She collapsed against him, but allowed herself to be lifted and leant on his shoulder as he supported her out towards the door to the office. Lamont was already there, looking to Derry for instructions. 'You need some help?' he asked. Derry hesitated. 'No, it's okay. But just get rid of… of all this ', he said, gesticulating towards the room and the people, who were all still staring, shocked. 'Sho' thing,' Lamont nodded. Derry led Niamh to the office where he lowered her gently down on a small sofa that was positioned against the far wall. Outside they heard the music come to a grinding stop and Lamont's voice shouting at people to finish their drinks, get their coats and get out. 'Show is over, folks,' he was shouting. 'Nothing to see here. Move along.' Niamh was still sobbing silently and Derry sat down next to her, gently prising her hands away from her face. 'Let me see,' he pleaded. 'I just need to see how bad it is.' He winced as he looked at the ugly red wheal on her beautiful cheekbone. It wasn't bleeding too badly, but he still felt his blood run hot and cold with anger thinking about what Marc had done. 'I should call the police on that motherfucker,' he said. 'You should press charges.' For the first time, Niamh stopped crying and opened her eyes wide, grabbing his arm as if to stop him. 'No! No!' she blurted out. 'He didn't mean to hit me.' Derry looked surprised. Why would she defend the bastard after what he had done? With a sinking feeling he thought she must really love him. Derry stood up. 'I'll go get you some ice,' he said, biting back tears of his own and walking out of the room. The last few revellers were leaving the bar, and Lamont was helping Hugo take his decks down. They looked up as Derry walked in. 'Is she okay?' asked Hugo, his face white. 'Should I go and see her?' 'I'll take care of her,' replied Derry, bluntly. Turning to Lamont, he said: 'Just leave all this and go home. It's been a long night, I'll sort it all out in the morning.' Lamont nodded. When Derry went back into the office with a bucket of ice and a first aid kit in his hand, he found Niamh sitting quietly staring at the floor. She didn't look up as he tore the towel in two, wetting one half and wrapping ice in the other. 'Please look at me,' he said quietly. She turned to face him and allowed him to use the wet towel to gently wipe away the worst of the blood. He opened the medical kit and took out an antiseptic wipe. 'This is going to sting a bit,' he warned, as he carefully cleaned the wound. Niamh barely blinked, submitting passively to his ministrations, but a solitary tear slid out of her eye and rolled down the side of her nose. Having finished cleaning the wound, he put a small dressing over the cut and picked up the towel with the ice in. He went as if to hand it to her, but she didn't move, staring silently at him, an unreadable expression in her eyes. He hesitated, and then lifted the towel himself pressing it against her cheek. She winced slightly as the cold of the ice hit her skin and reached up placing her hand over his. 'I'm so sorry,' she whispered. 'I'm so sorry, but it's not what you think.' Derry flinched. 'You don't have to apologise,' he said stiffly. 'What Marc said to you was a lie,' she continued, almost inaudibly. 'I'm not his girl. I hate him.' Derry held his breath. This was not what he had expected. 'I mean, it is true, I did… we… we, you know,' she faltered, blushing and looking away. Derry tried to remain impassive but inwardly his jealousy bristled. 'But it was just once, I swear,' she whispered. 'You don't have to explain anything to me,' he said. 'It's none of my business.' 'Yes it is!' she cried, suddenly angry. 'Why can't you see that? The only reason I went to bed with that prick is because of you! I hated it, I hated him , but I was so lonely and you wouldn't even look at me.' Derry froze, stunned by her words. His heart was thudding in his chest and his throat felt dry. Why was she saying these things? What did she mean? He tried to pull his hand away from her face but she gripped it tightly, not letting go. She was still staring directly into his eyes, daring him to look away again. Derry swallowed hard. 'I… I don't understand,' he said, aware how lame that sounded. Niamh allowed him to lower his hand, letting the ice and the towel drop to the floor, but kept her hand on his. 'It has always been you I wanted , ' she said. 'Since the first day I walked through that door. But I never dared hope you might want me too until tonight.' Derry lowered his gaze, unable to meet the unflinching honesty in her eyes, afraid his would betray too much of his own feelings. 'Derry,' she insisted. 'Look at me. I can't lie to you anymore. I want you. I want everything about you.' 'No,' he said, looking back up at her. 'You don't know what you're saying. You don't want me. Please believe me, you don't.' There was such despair in his voice that for a moment she paused, but then shook her head at him. 'Don't tell me what I want,' she said. 'I know what I want. And I believe you want the same thing too. But if you don't, you are going to have to tell me. Tell me to leave.' Derry shook his head dumbly. He knew he should, but the words couldn't come. 'Tell me you don't want me and I will go and never come back. But you need to know that I am yours, whether you want me or not. And I want you,' she whispered slowly, emphasising the word 'want' in a way that left no doubt as to what she meant Her words burned into Derry like a flame and as she spoke, Niamh leaned forward and brushed her lips softly against his. The touch of her lips ignited a yearning he could no longer deny and his eyes darkened with desire. 'Tell me,' she repeated, kissing him again. 'Tell me you don't want me.' At these words, something snapped inside Derry. He reached a hand up behind her neck, pulling her in to him and kissing her back with an intensity which made her gasp. Her lips were soft and he pressed harder and harder against them, wanting to lose himself in this feeling. She was kissing him back fiercely too now, her lips opening and allowing his tongue to slide inside her mouth, tasting the tang of prosecco on her tongue. All semblance of self-control had gone and Derry kissed her wildly, trailing kisses down her neck and shoulders, exulting in the moans this elicited from her. Without realising what he was doing, he pushed her back so she was lying on the sofa. He continued his trail of kisses down her neck, over her collar bone, his hands sliding the dress off her shoulders and roaming greedily over her body. He ran his hand down under her butt and she lifted her leg, wrapping it around his waist, pulling him closer. He groaned as her dress rode up over her hips and his hands travelled up the bare flesh of her legs to feel the swell of her backside through her underwear. All rational thought had gone, all that mattered was this – the feeling of her skin, her flesh under his hands, her moans in his ears, calling his name. She was responding to his touch with a wildness that drove him on, one hand in his hair pushing his head down into her neck and breasts while the other grasped at his back seeming to want to feel every inch of him. He lifted his head from her breasts, pulling himself on back top of her, kissing her, wanting to taste that sweetness again. She was kissing him back, pushing her body up against his, inviting him on. He felt her hands run down his stomach and suddenly he froze, realising she had undone his belt and was starting to tug at his t-shirt, trying to loosen it from where it was tucked in to his waistband. He leaped back, suddenly horrified at what he had done, looking down as she lay there, her dress bunched up around her waist, exposing her bare breasts and a small pair of white panties. She looked suddenly confused, and alarmed by his expression. 'Derry, what is it? What did I do?' she asked, sitting up and tugging her dress back into place, her eyes pleading with him. He couldn't answer, and stood there panting, trying to control himself, his desire draining away at the thought of what had been about to happen. He felt cold and sick at the idea she could have pulled his t-shirt up and seen what was hidden under there. 'Derry, please, you're scaring me,' she cried. A wave of self-loathing crashed over him as he looked at her face, seeing the tears forming again in her eyes. Why did he always end up hurting those he loved? Why couldn't he learn that all he brought was pain and destruction? His anger at himself made him turn cold. Drawing himself up straight, squaring his shoulders, he stood in front of her with a hard expression on his face. 'I tried to warn you Niamh,' he said. 'You don't want me. You don't want me , because you don't know me.' She tried to contradict him but he cut her off. 'No, Niamh, you don't,' he insisted. 'Everything I have told you is a lie. You don't even know my name.' The look of fear and confusion on her face tore at him and he longed to sink to his knees in front of her and beg her forgiveness, but he knew he didn't deserve it and ploughed relentlessly on. She needed to know the worst, he had to make her leave and never come back. He took a step back, taking hold of the bottom of his t-shirt. Taking a deep breath, he pulled his t-shirt and his undershirt over his head in one swift motion, dropping them on the floor next to him. He watched the expression on her face go from desire, to confusion, to dawning fear and horror as her brain struggled to register what she was seeing. Her eyes recoiled from the huge swastika plastered over his chest, and he saw her taking in the iron cross on his forearm, the Nazi eagle on his bicep. 'My name is not Derry. It's Derek Vineyard,' he said in the same hard tone. 'I was the leader of the DOC, a skinhead gang in California. I murdered two men because they were Black. I shot one in the chest and killed the other by stamping his face into the curb, breaking his neck.' His words were hitting into her like bullets and she was rocking backwards and forwards, arms pulled tight around her, shaking her head and crying 'no, no, no' under her breath. 'I was sent to prison, only for 3 years, because in this country Black life is cheap,' he spat. 'And when I came out, I killed my little brother, Danny, for trying to be like me. He was only a kid, still at high school.' Derek's voice choked slightly as he said this. He couldn't go on. His own pain, magnified by the hurt he saw in Niamh's face was too much. He turned around facing the wall, arms folded across his chest, fighting down the tears that wanted to come. He stayed motionless that way as he heard her footsteps stumbling across the floor and only turned around when the click of the door closing told him she was gone.[Chapter 7] **More warnings for mature language and themes that could be distressing for some people. Please don't read ahead if you're not sure** ** So... I'm tempted to mark this complete now. This is one of the endings to my story. There are others, but want to know what you think? Should I go on? Please let me know...** Chapter 7: It Takes More Courage Niamh stumbled through the darkened bar sobbing, her brain unable to come to terms with what she had seen and heard. Her mind was still fuzzy from the drink and she couldn't tell if it was that or the words Derry had spat at her that made her feel so nauseous. Her cheek throbbed where the bottle had hit her and she could feel her skin burning where it had been rubbed raw by the fierceness of Derry's kisses. The memory of how he had aroused such crazy desire in her fought with the sickening image of him standing there, a huge swastika plastered across his chest calmly telling her those awful, horrible things. She pushed her way out of the door and into the street, the cool night air slapping her face and sobering her up. The cold reality of what just happened began to hit her, and she ran, kicking off her stupid heels and running barefoot, not caring about the sharp stones of the pavement cutting in to her feet. She ran until the sobs tearing through her pulled all the air from her lungs and she stopped. She leaned against a wall, unable to stop herself from retching violently, vomiting uncontrollably at the images swirling in her brain: the vision of Derry, half naked and beautiful in front of her, defiled by those horrible tattoos, and the terrible, violent images his words conjured up. She stood there trembling and gasping for breath. Please, she thought. Please let this all be a mistake. Why would he say those things? It couldn't be true! She knew Derry, she was sure of it. He couldn't be capable of killing another person, surely? Of killing his own brother? He never even spoke of his family, she never even knew he had a brother. Thinking about all the things she didn't know about Derry made her suddenly remember Lamont. How could he be Derry's best friend if what Derry had said was true? Why would Lamont treat Derry like a brother if Derry was a murderous neo-Nazi who killed people over the colour of their skin? None of it made sense. She heard a car coming down the empty street ahead of her and looked up, dazed, into its headlights. Dimly she was aware of the car stopping next to her and the window being wound down. It was Lamont, with Sandra by his side. 'What the fuck, Niamh?' he said as he took in her appearance. She couldn't speak, shaking her head dumbly. 'Derry… Derry…' was all she could whisper. A sudden look of fear crossed Lamont's face, and he yanked open the door and jumped towards her. She lurched back, putting her hands up as if to ward him off, still shaking her head. He stopped, reaching his hand out to her and speaking softly. 'Niamh!' he said. 'I need to know what happened. Please. What did D say to you?' 'I… I…can't. It's too horrible,' she sobbed. 'Tell me it's not true, Lamont, it can't be true!' 'Shit!' Lamont swore, turning and slamming his hand against the roof of the car. 'Stupid mother fucker !' He turned back to her, his face suddenly filled with dread. 'Where is he now?' he asked her urgently. 'I…I don't know,' she stuttered. 'I just left. He was in the bar, in the office.' They looked at each other, an unspoken fear rising between them. 'No. No, not that. He wouldn't,' she said, without conviction. But Lamont was already running, running back towards the bar, cursing as he ran. Niamh stood frozen for a moment and then turned and ran after him. She heard Sandra getting out of the car, calling after them, but she didn't stop, running after Lamont, panic rising in her throat. Lamont reached the door of the bar before her and found it locked. Cursing, he fumbled in his pocket for a key, unlocking the door and pushing it open. The bar was dark, with the debris of the party strewn everywhere. Niamh's presents were still piled up on one of the tables and glasses littered every surface. Their eyes searched the room, neither of them daring to admit what they were looking for, but the room was empty. Lamont ran to the door to the office, pushing it open. The light was still on, the first aid kit open on the floor next to where a small puddle was forming from the ice that had spilled from the towel. His t-shirt lay abandoned in a heap on the floor, but Derry was nowhere to be seen. Lamont tried the door that led up to Derry's apartment, hammering on it with his fists when he found it locked. Only Derry had a key to that door. 'Derek!' he shouted. 'Derek, it's me. Open this fucking door!' Niamh winced at hearing him use the unfamiliar name, but there was no answer to his cries. She heard Sandra enter the room behind them, looking from Niamh to Lamont questioningly. Her eyes scanned the scene in the room, taking in Derry's discarded shirt on the floor and Niamh's dishevelled and tear-stained appearance, and her eyes widened. 'Oh,' she said, understanding dawning in her voice. 'Oh, shit.' Niamh's jaw dropped. 'You knew? ' she cried, incredulously, looking angrily from her to Lamont. 'Why did no one tell me?' 'Why?' Lamont rounded on her, shouting. 'Why? Because the stupid motherfucker said he would rather die than let you know who he was. And now you do know. And now he's… he's… fuck !' He looked frantically around the room for something to break the door with. Spotting a fire extinguisher on the wall behind the desk he grabbed it from its holder and started smashing at the lock on the door. He cursed loudly as he swung, calling Derek's name. Niamh flinched at the noise of the door splintering under his blows. The door finally crashed open and Lamont dropped the extinguisher, running up the dark staircase to a door at the top. There was no lock on that door and he flung it open, light from the apartment spilling over him. Niamh was a few steps behind and looked up to see Lamont stagger back, an expression of horror on his face and a strangled cry on his lips. Niamh felt as if she were moving in slow motion as she pushed past him and into the room. Even though she knew in her heart what she was going to find, she wasn't ready for the horror that met her eyes. Half blinded by the sudden light, she winced as she took in the austere, sparsely furnished room. A small kitchen, tidy and impersonal, a row of bookshelves made from long bare planks propped up on bricks. A CD player on a low table, playing a tune she knew she had heard before but couldn't place. A collection of gym equipment taking up most of the floor space: dumbbells, a weight bench, kettle bells all neatly lined up. A pull-up bar in the ceiling, with a jump rope looped neatly through it. And, hanging from the other end of the jump rope, swaying gently above an upturned chair, the lifeless form of Derry's half-naked body. She heard a voice screaming and realised it was hers. Sandra pushed into the room too, gasping in horror. She pulled a phone out of her bag and called 911, shouting at Lamont to try to hold Derry up. 'Niamh, pull yourself together,' she commanded. 'I need your help. Go find something to cut the rope. A knife, scissors, anything.' Her words brought them back to their senses and Lamont sprang forward, grabbing Derry by his legs, trying to take his weight. Niamh started desperately pulling out drawers in the kitchen, scrabbling through them until she found a large knife. Sandra had an operator on speaker phone and was following the commands coming down the line. She picked up the chair lying on the floor next to where Derry was hanging and stood on it, grabbing the knife from Niamh and trying to reach the rope to cut it. She couldn't reach, though and looking around, shouted at Niamh to drag over the small kitchen table instead. Sandra went to climb on it, but Niamh stopped her. 'Give me the knife, I'm taller than you,' she said. Sandra nodded and handed it over, jumping down to help Lamont who was shaking with the effort of trying to hold up Derry's weight and stop the terrible pressure of the rope on his neck. Palms sweating and shaking with sobs, Niamh clambered on to the table and began sawing desperately at the rope, trying not to look down at the unresponsive body below her. 'Hurry the fuck up,' swore Lamont, as she hacked through the strands of the jump rope. Finally it was done and Derry's body came lose, Sandra and Lamont buckling under the dead weight. The voice on the phone was telling them to lay him flat on his back and try to cut the rope from his neck. Lamont grabbed the knife and with a savage flick severed the rope, pulling it away from the ugly purple line around Derry's neck. 'Is the patient breathing?' asked the voice on the phone. 'Look to see if his chest is rising and falling.' 'I'm going to need you to initiate CPR,' the operator continued, urgently. 'Place one hand on the patient's chest, on the breastbone…' The voice of the operator sounded fainter and fainter to Niamh, muffled by the rushing of blood in her ears. As if in a dream, she slid slowly off the table, watching Lamont leaning over his friend, his dark hands pumping desperately on Derry's white chest, the black swastika tattoo jolting obscenely with every compression. Everything seemed to be coming from far away and the room began to spin. She was aware of flashing lights, voices of paramedics running up the stairs and bags being ripped open, machines set up as they swarmed over him. She could hear equipment bleeping, air bags hissing, and a voice shouting 'clear'. Her consciousness seemed to be floating away, unmoored from her body as she watched Derry convulsing as the shocks ran through him, followed by the terrifying flat bleep of the paramedics' ECG. Trying to escape the horror in front of her, her brain zoned in on the words of the song on the stereo and she remembered where she knew it from. It was Nina Simone's cover of the Jacques Brel song, Ne Me Quitte Pas. Derry had been playing it one day when she arrived to work and they had argued over it, Niamh declaring its untamed passion inferior to the polished beauty of Brel's original. As she listened through the fog of fear enveloping her, she numbly realised Derry had been right. Niamh just hadn't been able to appreciate the raw pain in the singer's voice before. Niamh tried to stand up but as she did, a wave of heat spread through her body, engulfing her in darkness. The last thing she heard echoing through her brain before she lost consciousness was Nina's voice, cracking with uncried tears as she pleaded. 'Ne me quitte pas. Ne me quitte pas. Ne me quitte pas.'[Chapter 8] What else could I write I don't have the right What else should I be All apologies Nirvana ** If you have come here expecting a new chapter in the story, I am sorry. This isn't a new chapter, but an explanation. Ironically, I started the last chapter with a trigger warning because of where the story was going, but what I hadn't realised was that I was the one who needed the warning. It wasn't until I read back over the last chapter after I had published it that it suddenly hit me what I had done. It's funny how the subconscious works, but somehow all the way through the writing of the story so far, I had completely failed to notice what it was I was doing. All the clues were there, I really should have been able to read them. A long time ago, something bad happened to someone very close to me. I don't want to use his real name, but let's call him Christos. It's a long and complicated story, but in essence it can be summed up in 3 lines: Christos loved me. I hurt him. He died. I have to write it like that as three separate sentences as the links between the three of them are too painful to think about. I met Christos at University. We had an amazing and immediate connection, even though we came from different backgrounds, countries, languages and social groupings. We loved to argue and he challenged me incessantly, teaching me to open my eyes to different perspectives on the world. He was tall and muscular, with short, dark hair and goatee. He played basketball and had tattoos – okay so they weren't swastikas and he had never been a neo-Nazi, but I think you see where this is going. On a date back in the late nineties we went to see a film called American History X. We had just started going out together – we had been close friends for 4 years, but I knew he had always wanted to be more than friends. I had just had my heart badly broken by someone else and was on the rebound, so convinced myself that the fact that I truly and deeply loved Christos as a friend was enough to build a relationship on. It wasn't. I realised soon after we got together that it wasn't going to work out. All his friends told me how happy he was and how he'd been in love with me for years and how amazing it was we'd finally gotten together. I tried so hard to love him the way he loved me, but in the end I couldn't. The last time we spoke he told me I had broken his heart. He went back to his country for the summer, leaving me a note telling me he hoped I would have a good life but that I wouldn't see him again. I knew he was angry, and as I was spending the summer working in a remote location overseas, I let him go, figuring I would see him in September and we would talk. I was away for 6 weeks in a remote village with no mobile phone or internet. On the day before I flew home, I travelled back to the city and made my way to an internet café to see what news there had been over the summer. I found a short, terse email from a friend of Christos telling me he was dead. I'd never met his family as they lived in a different country, and he was buried before I even knew he had gone. His friends didn't speak to me again and I didn't feel I had a right to try and reach out to them. 3 days after returning to my country, I started a new course, moved away from all the places Christos and I had been together, left behind anyone who knew us both and buried my grief. I couldn't talk about what had happened, I couldn't cope with the guilt and the pain so I made myself forget. Il faut oublier. Tout peut s'oublier. I really thought I had forgotten and haven't thought about him in years, but somehow my subconscious didn't forget and when I reread the last chapter it hit me like a freight train and I just sat and cried and cried. I cried for someone I had truly loved and lost, but who I didn't feel I had a right to say I missed. I cried for myself and the bad choices made and wished they could have been different. I cried for his family and friends who hadn't screwed him over like I had and who had to live with having lost him through no fault of their own. I know Derry and Niamh deserve a happy ending. Derry needs to live, they need to find a way through this, but right now I can't write it for them. Christos didn't get his happy ending and I will never be able to tell him I'm sorry. I hope one day I'll be able to write a different ending to this, but right now I can't. Sorry.** ","Summary":" *AN: Of course I don't own Derek Vinyard, but since I first watched this film nearly 20 years ago, "},{"Movie":"Were the World Mine","Title":"Were the World Jon's","Author":"Ssatsuki","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6208754","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Were the World Jon's Everything changes with a different Point of View. 'My name is Jonathon Cordon. I've never felt like this about anyone. I was in love with Timothy!' WtWM from Jon's POV. 'I opened my eyes and saw him there, fairy wings and all, and thought him beautiful.' \" But I fell in love with you, today.\" … Ok, about all the dialogue taken from the movie in this story. Most of it I'm pretty sure about, but some bits I had to guess on because my dvd DOESN'T HAVE SUBTITLES. Grrr. Seriously, it's one of the most unhelpful DVDs I own, and I own quite a few. In any case, please forgive me if something seems odd or if you heard the line differently or whatever. I did my best with what I had. Hope you enjoy Jon's POV on the movie Were the World Mine. Presented in 3 parts. … My name is Jonathon Cordon. Most people know me as the star rugby player at Morgan Hill. Morgan Hill is a prestigious academy, and by prestigious I mean that it takes a whole lot of money to get enrolled there. Also, you have to be a boy. Which was all good and well, unless you were gay, like me. I was pretty much flawless at hiding it from the world, even myself, so no one suspected a thing. I was captain of a rugby team, had a lot of money, near perfect grades, and a girlfriend that I kissed every time I saw her. My life was pretty much set that way and I had almost completely convinced myself that I liked my girlfriend as much as everyone else thought I did when my world got flipped upside down. One day, a week into term, a new kid showed up in class. He wasn't actually new, because he'd been on the roster since day one, but it was the first day he showed up to class so he was considered new by all the other guys in school. I met him in gym class first. At first I didn't even notice that anyone new was in the class, and then I turned around in the locker room and my face met with his chin. He let out this odd yelp and backed off, fell over the bench between the rows of lockers, and hit his head against the lockers on the other side before landing in a probably aching heap on the ground and holding his head. \"Ow,\" he murmured and opened one eye to look up at me. \"Sorry. My bad.\" Then both his eyes opened and he let go of his head and simply stared at me as I stared back. He seemed to have randomly started daydreaming and I couldn't blame him for it, because my mind wasn't really working either. His ridiculous maroon colored gym shirt was riding up and the muscles in his lower stomach were showing. Now, I've been working out for awhile to be a great rugby player, so my muscles were much more impressive than his, but for some reason I felt the greatest desire to reach out and map out those muscles in grand detail. \"Alright, warriors, let's go, let's go!\" Coach Driskill yelled out from somewhere beyond my sight and I came back to myself. \"You alright?\" I asked, and thanked God that my voice was normal. He nodded and gave a faint smile. \"Yea. Just a bump. I'll be fine.\" I moved so my legs were pressed against the bench and held my hand out to him, but before he could take it, Cole slammed his locker shut and grabbed me by the wrist, yanking me towards the door to the gym. \"Watch yourself, Cordon,\" he warned like I was some stupid child. \"He'll rub off on you.\" \"What are you talking about?\" I asked, pulling my arm back and stopping just in sight of the new kid, who was starting to pull himself up using the bench. \"He's a fag,\" Cole said with a shudder and a voice laced in poison. I saw the new kid freeze mid-stand from the corner of my eye. \"Now let's go.\" Without waiting for permission, Cole grabbed me by the wrist and finished pulling me from the locker room. Had I been braver, I may have stopped him and told him I was gay too, and what was wrong with that? As it was, I stayed silent to save my own skin. … … Three weeks later I found some guys from our school behind the storage room beating the new kid, whose name I learned was Timothy, up and throwing his stuff all over the place. I couldn't understand it. I mean, I understood why the guys were beating him up and tormenting him, it was how certain people responded to something that frightened them or threatened them. What I didn't understand was why Timothy wasn't fighting back. He was taller than anyone else in school and he wasn't weak (if his stomach muscles meant anything), so why was he just letting them hit him? \"Hey!\" I yelled, unable to just stand by and watch at they continued to hit him. They sort of jumped and dropped Timothy's stuff, and Timothy, and ran. I scoffed and moved to help Timothy collect his things, but he was super fast and had already grabbed and stuffed everything messily into his bag by the time I'd taken one step. \"You alright?\" I asked, feeling a sense of déjà vu. \"I'm fine,\" he said, sounding a bit defeated and keeping his head down. \"It's nothing I wasn't expecting. Don't worry about it.\" Then, without even looking at me, he turned and sauntered off. It wasn't until the next day that I realized he may have kept his head down because of the black and purple bruise across his left cheek and his split bottom lip. I wondered if he had any more bruises under his clothes that he was hiding, but I couldn't find the courage to ask. … … Every time I saw Timothy after that, he seemed to grow more and more quiet. He rarely raised his head from staring at the floor and he randomly seemed to go off somewhere, something similar to daydreams like I'd seen the day I first met him. I was completely enthralled by the contradiction in his mannerisms and the intense look in his eyes. There was something there, inside, that was just waiting to be let loose. A part of me couldn't wait for that day to come. I dreamt about him. I dreamt we sat and held hands for hours and ate lunch together and no one cared. And I dreamt we kissed. I kissed him so many times in my dreams that sometimes I got scared that I was actually awake and had only thought I was dreaming and had kissed him in broad daylight in front of all of Morgan Hill. Sometimes we were chaste and wanton with our kisses, and sometimes we kissed like they were the very air we breathed and if we stopped we would die, desperate and passionate. I don't remember it ever going beyond kissing. That was probably because I'd barely caught any sight of the body underneath those clothes and my mind either could not or simply would not fill in the blank spaces for me. It was both a comforting and aggravating thought. … … It seemed every time we had gym class, Timothy got hurt. Golf, basketball, baseball, dodgeball – no matter what they did in class, everyone seemed to aim for him. It didn't help matters that some crack about his sexuality was made every four seconds. It was pissing me off because I knew that one slip up and they'd be saying the same shit about me and it wasn't fair. And I was too cowardly to say anything to stop them. We were playing dodgeball the day everything started to change. Or at least, it was the day I noted that something clicked and things changed. Timothy, for once in a blue moon, had made a comeback statement to the crap statements thrown at him and for once the laughter wasn't directed at him, but at Cooper. The moment Timothy got hit with the dodge ball, Coach Driskill called time and told us to get ready to leave. I'd noticed that was a trend of his, to wait until Tim got hit or hurt in some way before letting us leave for the day. I think that's called discrimination, people, and it's wrong. In the locker room, I moved as slow in changing my clothes as I could without being suspicious in the hopes that I'd catch Timothy alone once everyone else was gone. It was the only time I got up any courage to talk to him, which was embarrassing. He reached into his locker for a towel while taunts were thrown around him and the only back talk he gave them was a simple 'My name is Timothy.' How could he stand it? Then we were alone and I turned to face him. A few seconds later and he hadn't really moved, simply holding the towel in his hands in front of him. \"Need some ice?\" I asked, trying to sound sincere in my offer. \"I can handle it,\" he responded almost bitterly. It hurt. I couldn't explain it, but Timothy's apathy hurt me. I really wanted to help him, but I couldn't do it in front of the other guys. I couldn't tell Timothy that either, because I was afraid. If I told him that I cared about him, and that I wanted to be his friend, it would never work out. We could never hang out or go anywhere together because of the taunting, and if my feelings developed any further than simply being ok with the dreams then I'd be hard put not to reveal myself to him and then…what if he wanted to go public and do PDA? I couldn't do it. I was too used to the fame-like status my captain's spot had given me and I wasn't ready to give it up. Not even for Tim. No matter how much I wanted to. I didn't want to hurt him….so I kept a certain amount of distance between us. Because I think I was already starting to fall for him then, before I knew anything about him. … … I think he missed the entirety of Ms. Tebbit's class. He stopped reciting the words she said like the rest of us and the one time I glanced back at him, he was staring at the front of the class in a daze. Now I say this was the day things began to change because this was the day that Ms. Tebbit told us the senior play was A Midsummer Night's Dream and that we all had to audition on Friday before rugby practice could start. I panicked. If I got cast as a girl, it'd be all over for me. If I got cast as a guy who was supposed to act like he was in love with a girl played by a guy, it'd pretty much be over for me anyway! Any one suspicion and my life would be over! But that wasn't until Friday, and I forced myself to not think about it until then. If I started screwing up in rugby, that would only cause more damage to me later if they found out I was gay. My girlfriend showed up to watch us practice that afternoon. I never could figure out how she managed to get here from her own school so fast. I think she was skipping her last class, but I never asked. It didn't really matter to me all that much. Like she didn't matter all that much. Today I glanced over at the bleachers, something I made a habit of doing when she was watching, and saw Timothy instead. I called time and hurried over to the bleachers, to my girlfriend, to see if it was really Timothy hiding behind the bleachers. It was. The holes were so large between seats that he was in plain sight. After a quick glance his way, I leaned in to give a complementary kiss to Becky and immediately regretted it when Timothy walked away. \"Hey,\" Becky nearly whispered. \"Looking good.\" \"You like watching us out there?\" I asked, hooking my arms around the bars of the bleachers. \"I love watching you play,\" she emphasized quietly. I laughed and it was almost a scoff. \"Yea, I bet you do.\" It was almost sarcastic and I bit my tongue to stop myself from getting angry at her. It was my fault if I was pushing Timothy away in some way. … … Friday came around too fast for me and I tried to be the first one in the audition room so I could be the first one done. I was. Thus I was also the first person dressed out for rugby and sitting by the auditorium doors waiting for the auditions to be over. I listened to all the other guys auditioning and realized with horror that I should've flubbed the audition, but I'd done too well and I was bound to get a good, important role with a lot of stage time. I was so frightened by this fact that I forgot that Timothy was going to be auditioning too. I didn't recognize the voice coming through the door when he began to sing. I think maybe, if I'd heard him speak a bit more, I would have, but maybe it wouldn't have made a difference. I heard Ms. Tebbit singing and sighed. I'd heard her teach the song to like…twelve people already. It was getting old, so I blocked her out. Then someone, I was too bored to realize who it was, asked who was singing and I looked through the crack in the door and forgot to breathe. I don't think I'd ever thought of anyone as beautiful until then. But he was. His voice was. I turned away from the door and closed my eyes, feigning the same boredom I'd had only moments before as I tried to catch my breath. His voice washed over me in waves and I kept seeing the little smile he gave me the first time we met, before he'd been bullied into submission. Suddenly, I was overcome by the desire to see him smile, really smile. I could just imagine what he'd look like wearing a full blown smile, and it made my chest hurt my heart beat so fast. I didn't do my best at practice that afternoon, to say the least. … … That night, he sang me to sleep and we had a long conversation in my dreams that was mostly me listening to the sound of his voice: a deep rumble, but warm and kind, with a sad tinge to it. … … Monday, Ms. Tebbit announced that the cast list would be posted on the auditorium doors after school. I'd never changed into my rugby uniform so fast. I ran up the stairs towards the auditorium and froze halfway up. Timothy was standing in front of the doors, just staring at the cast list, not moving. I walked slowly and quietly up to the doors until I was standing next to him, and when I saw his face, I could tell he wasn't all there. His mind was somewhere else right now, like usual. I smiled at how cute I found his daydreaming and then mentally shook myself. Someone could come along any moment now and it wouldn't do to see me staring at Timothy with some goofy smile painted on my face. But…we were alone at the moment, weren't we? This was my chance to talk to him! To tell him I thought his voice was the most beautiful thing I'd ever heard in my life. But how to go about getting his attention and start up the conversation? I was a jock. I had no reason to talk to him. I looked at the cast list. My name was right beneath his. Aw. Wait. I'm a guy. I don't have stupidly girly thoughts like that! Ah. Wait a minute! I lifted my arm up until I could land it on Timothy's shoulder (which was higher than I expected it to be. It's amazing I wasn't embarrassed about being shorter than him.) and smiled generously at him when he startled back to the real world and looked over at me. \"Looks like I'm one of the lovers,\" I announced simply. Timothy didn't seem to know what to say to me and the moment he opened his mouth to speak I spotted the other guys in our class rushing up the stairs behind us. I inwardly cursed and lifted my arm from Timothy's shoulder a moment before Bradley shoved past me to see the cast list. I stood back and waited, hoping I could talk to Timothy once they were gone. One sentence of conversation wasn't enough for me. \"I'm not shaving,\" Bradley protested. \"At least you're not the jackass,\" Ian tried in consolation. \"At least the jackass doesn't have to wear a dress,\" Bradley whined as he turned and walked away. Ian stared at the list as other guys came and went and his face took on something akin to concern. \"What is Thisbe?\" he looked around and noticed all the others, Bradley included, had left. Running after them he called, \"Is that a chick?\" When everyone else was gone, Timothy and I took a simultaneous step forward as he looked at the list. He was Puck. I supposed it fit. He was known to be a fairy, and he was tall and thin, and he had a great voice. I refused to admit I'd read the play over the weekend, but I had and Puck seemed like a pretty pivotal character…so it was good that Timothy got the role. \"Congratulations, gentlemen,\" Ms. Tebbit said suddenly and we both turned to look at her. \"Awaken and empower what's within,\" she announced in that cryptic way of hers. What did that even mean? Timothy let out a breath and glanced at me before leaving down the stairs. I had to stop him! I hadn't said anything yet! How…how do you announce you like someone's voice without openly announcing you like them? Um…Um…! \"Nice pipes!\" I called out and he stopped and turned around. Ok. Don't chicken out now, Jonathon Cordon. Tell him you- \"I heard your audition.\" I'm such a coward. I fumbled for the door handle and vanished inside the auditorium before I could beat myself over the head for my stupidity. … … I saw him come to school the next morning on a bike instead of the bus. Well, that was useful information. He lived close enough to ride a bike. I could- What was I thinking? What am I going to do, stalk him home or something? God, Jon, pull yourself together man! I pressed my fists into my eyes for a few seconds and held my breath until I felt like I'd pass out, then took a deep breath and lowered my hands. Together. Together. You can do this. … … Ms. Tebbit's class that day was a rundown of the play's accessories; the stage and costuming and music. I was feeling a bit unbalanced and was looking for anything to make myself feel better. My costume looked cool enough. Timothy's looked better. Bradley complained about his costume, (\"Where's the rest?\") and if Dr. Bellinger hadn't walked in, I would've probably yelled 'It's a dress, moron. There is no more!' \"These are for the Pyrmus and Thisbee finale, which I have reinvented as an incredibly hip song,\" Ms. Tebbit announced. \"That's hot, Ms. T,\" I said loudly, louder than I'd meant to. I was trying to sound interested, not overly excited! \"Shakespeare was meant for the masses,\" she agreed, but no one had laughed or anything, so it was still embarrassing. I glanced back at Timothy and felt myself beginning to blush when I realized he was looking at me too, so I quickly faced forward again and looked at my desk instead. God, I must've sounded so stupid to him! It took all my self control not to lay my head down and cover it with my arms in shame. … … The next day in class, Ms. Tebbit handed out copies of A Midsummer Night's Dream and we had to read it in our parts. \"Either I mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite called Robin Goodfellow: are not you he that frights the maidens of the village…ry?\" Cooper read blandly. \"Thou speak'st aright; I am that merry wanderer of the night,\" Timothy said in response. It was read too fast in my opinion, but it was just the first class reading. Besides, I was listening more to the voice and not the words. \"I jest to Oberon and make him smile.\" Me too. … … We played basketball a few days later and Timothy, surprisingly, didn't get hurt. He actually shot a basket himself. He didn't move fast or anything, and no one really tried to stop him, probably because they thought he'd be an easy target to stop. But he simply lined up the shot and landed the ball in the hoop with almost no net easily. The smallest of smiles graced his face at the accomplishment, even as everyone was already heading to the other side of the court to try and land a shot in the other hoop. That kinda turned me on. And it gave me enough courage to actually pat him on the butt and say \"Nice form,\" before hurrying back into the game. Dear god, did I just flirt ? In a crowded room? Maybe I could do this after all. Timothy ended up on his back about five seconds later when Cole started barreling back towards the hoop on that side and didn't see him. The best part? Cole just stepped on him, right on the chest, and kept going. The next best part? Coach called time and told us to go to the showers and never once asked if Timothy was alright. Sometimes I hated my school mates. I knelt by him as he held his hands across his lower chest and kept his eyes shut and simply breathed. \"You ok?\" I asked, trying not to let too much of my worry slip into my words. \"Yea,\" he coughed out. \"I got it. I'll be fine.\" \"You can breathe alright?\" I persisted, not quite believing him. He even sounded wounded. He nodded and opened his eyes a bit to look up at me and I sort of lost the air in my lungs. \"Good,\" I breathed out before taking a deep breath and clearing my throat. \"I mean, I'd hate to not hear Puck's final song in the play.\" I was attempting it to sound like a joke, but I failed miserably and sounded simply sincere. He gave me a curious look and let his arms fall from his chest. I must've been as red as a tomato I felt so foolish. I cleared my throat again and stood up, not offering to help him, and scurried like a dog with its tail between its legs to the locker room. … … \"This play is a complete waste of time!\" I sighed silently into my mashed potatoes. My father kept bringing up his opinion on Ms. Tebbit's play every chance he got. It was like he expected me to be able to weedle out of it or something. \"Darling,\" my mother tried quietly and motioned to the food on the table between us. She sat at one end, to my right, while my father sat at the other end to my left. My youngest sister, age six, sat next to me on my mother's side and my oldest younger sister, age fourteen, sat directly across from me. \"I'm serious!\" my father raged on. \"The boys shouldn't be acting in plays like sissies! They should be out doing more manly things, like rugby!\" \"Honey, acting is a perfectly respectable past time that men have been doing for centuries,\" mother explained gently. \"And it's just one senior play.\" \"That's not the point!\" He stabbed his steak harshly and held it up as he spoke. \"I just don't want anyone thinking that my son is a…a-\" \"Jon!\" Hannah piped up from next to me. I gave her a smile to show she could say what she wanted, even though father looked aghast. \"Are you playing a girl in the play?\" she asked happily, bouncing in her seat. I laughed once at how cute she was and ignored the seething I could feel behind me. Taking Hannah's hands in my own, I shook my head. \"No. I'm playing a man who gets tricked into thinking he's in love with a girl he really isn't in love with.\" \"Are you cool, Jon?\" she continued cutely, a beaming smile on her face. \"Uhuh. Super cool,\" I supplied and she looked so happy and proud of me that I couldn't stop the beaming smile coming to my own face. \"Now, eat your dinner.\" I turned back to my food only once she had and kept the smile on my face as I ate, not able to stop myself at all. I looked across the table and saw Hayley giving me a curious look. My smile faded and I gave her a curious look in return, but she averted her eyes and went back to eating her food. What was that all about? … … The set was coming together nicely the next day, a Wednesday, and so Ms. Tebbit decided we should practice laying out the scenes in practice on the stage that day. Russ was still stumbling over his words, but Timothy sounded like he could probably read them without the book as reference. He was right in front of me all practice, or sitting next to me when he wasn't in a scene. I never even spoke a word to him, and we never made eye contact, but the atmosphere around me felt charged. I've never felt like this about anyone. It kind of scares me because I'm not sure how much longer I can hide it. From him and from the world. ... Please review and leave lots of comments! I'll post part 2 soon![Chapter 2] Were the World Jon's Part II Thanks to all who read and commented on part 1! ... I saw him a moment before it happened, dressed in purple and white and looking more upset than I'd seen him ever look. \"Who did it?\" he demanded, throwing his bag down. Practice skid to a halt as everyone turned to look at him. \"Oh look who just flew in from fairyland!\" Cole taunted. \"Was it you?\" Timothy asked, turning to look at Cooper. \"Hey bud, calm down!\" Cooper taunted back. I didn't understand the sick pleasure these guys got from tormenting him. Couldn't they tell it was killing him? \"Who did it?\" Timothy yelled. I put my hand on his shoulder and gently pushed him away. \"Let's walk,\" I offered calmly and quietly. I didn't know what they'd done, but I would definitely find out and I'd punish them for it any way I could. But right now, Timothy needed someone to help him calm down. He looked about to break. I don't know what happened, but suddenly Timothy moved around my hand and shoved Cole back, seething. Everything moved so fast after that. Timothy was shoved to the ground and Cole jumped on him. In Timothy's defense, Cole never landed a blow because he was able to keep him busy by trying to push Cole off, but he probably would've lost a long term fight – if only because he decided to stop fighting part way through, which is what he did in this fight, actually. He flipped over and tried to get away from Cole, but Cole wrapped his arms around Timothy's torso and yanked him to his feet. \"Hey look guys, I caught a fairy!\" I saw red for a minute. People were jeering and cheering and I couldn't hear a word of it as I grabbed Cole and tore him off Timothy. I think someone intervening killed all the fight in him, because Cole didn't try to get back in the fight. I could tell he still wanted to, though. \"Get outta here,\" I told Timothy, knowing that the minute I let go of Cole, he might try something, or one of the other guys would. I glared at Cole and pushed him away from me with one hand. \"It's not worth it.\" Not worth it to fight. I never wanted anyone to hurt him again. Never. I don't think there would ever be anything Timothy did that would make me think fighting and hurting him would be the answer. I did think it would be worth it to hurt Cole though, but I held back. Mollified, everyone started walking away towards the locker rooms and I paused a moment to glance back at Timothy as he walked away. His over shirt was stained with grass and he looked generally defeated. He'd tried to fight his own battle and I'd intervened because he couldn't win it himself. That must've hurt him. I'm an asshole. Besides that, my thought process doesn't make any sense. I want to stop people from hurting him, so I stopped the fight, then I feel guilty because I stopped the fight and hurt his ego. No matter what I did I was probably going to feel stupid or guilty for it. It was a lose-lose situation and neither side was winning. If I didn't find a winning side soon, I thought I might just go crazy. … … Hayley knocked on my door that evening after dinner while I was memorizing my lines. I rarely read them aloud because my father was already so opposed to the idea of the play, but I could read them a hundred times over and remember them in a moment when the time came. The part I was looking at when she knocked, though, wasn't mine. It was one of Puck's lines; one of Timothy's. 'Churl, upon thy eyes I throw, All the power this charm doth owe.' \"Jonathon,\" Hayley said along with her knock and I jumped and shut the book with a soft snap. \"Yea, Hayley?\" She came in, shut the door behind her, and settled onto my bed. I kept my place in my desk chair next to the bed. She was acting in that funny way she did when she knew something you did and was about to blackmail you for it. I couldn't think of anything I'd done lately, but I was on guard anyway. \"Jon, you're my brother, and you know I love you, right?\" she asked sweetly, batting her eyelashes at me charmingly. \"Yes,\" I answered cautiously. Now I worried she was asking me to do something for her that would likely end up with me in trouble later. \"Then I have something I'd like to say to you,\" she began, re-situating herself on the bed so she was facing me completely and could stare me in the eyes. \"Jon….Dear Jon…Why oh why have you not seen fit to tell me you were gay?\" I flinched so badly I nearly fell out of my chair. I dropped my script in my hurry to grab the chair and support myself. \"What?\" I asked, and my mouth felt dry. She rolled her eyes. \"Jon, I'm almost fifteen. I've been living with you my whole life and you have never, ever shown interest in a girl, not even Becky.\" I shut my mouth from where I'd been about to point Becky out. Hayley sighed dramatically. \"I had my suspicions, but then I took a walk down by your school and I happened upon a sight that made me realize I was right.\" She grinned. \"Oh look, I just rhymed.\" I narrowed my eyes at her. \"What 'sight' did you see, Hayley?\" So far I saw no proof. Still, Hayley was cunning. She was a teenage girl after all. \"Just a certain incident where you looked like a kicked puppy.\" She lifted her eyes to the ceiling. She spoke like Ms. Tebbit; overly dramatic. \"A tall guy came to your rugby practice, someone obviously gay, and a fight broke out between he and one of your teammates. Unable to watch, you stopped the fight and then stared as that guy walked away with a look that so expressed your love and devotion that it made my heart weep,\" she said dramatically, pressing a hand over her heart and falling backwards onto my bed. \"What?\" I gasped out before I could catch myself. I so hope she was exaggerating. I cleared my throat and tried again. \"I was jus-\" \"Oh, come on , Jon,\" Hayley interrupted exasperatedly, flinging her arms to the sides on my bed and then pushing herself up onto her elbows to glare at me. \"Just admit it! It's not like I'm going to condemn you for it or anything! He's cu~te , and we both know it.\" I leaned over and picked up my script as she continued to babble. There was nothing I could do to deny it, she already knew. \"What I don't understand, fearless warrior, is why you aren't dating him yet.\" \"Hayley,\" I started in a tired voice, lifting my head to look at her pointedly. \"Dad thinks it's bad enough I'm being forced to be in a play and that people might think I was gay. Can you imagine the backlash if I told him I actually was?\" I shook my head. \"More than that, what he'd do to Timothy?\" \"Ooh, Timothy , is it?\" she cooed, moving to sit on her stomach with her chin propped up in her hands. I glared at her and she sighed, rolling her eyes. \"I know you're scared of what dad'll think, and the town, and your teammates. But, Jon, if you love the guy, then does all that really matter?\" My brain died. My heart stopped. For a full twenty seconds I didn't move a muscle. Love? … … \"Here is my bed. Sleep, give thee all his rest,\" I said, a little smile forming on my face. I admit, I was having a bit too much fun making Cole feel uncomfortable after how he tormented Timothy the other day. I got way too close and made it difficult for him to push me off like the play called for. \"Sleep,\" Ms. Tebbit said, sounding a tiny bit cross, from the sidelines and I obediently fell back against the tree and pretended to sleep. I barely heard Timothy's footsteps as he walked around the stage, but I could hear his voice and I watched as he walked through that sound. \"Through the forest have I gone, but Athenian found I none…on whose eyes I might approve this flower's force in stirring love.\" He jumped onto the raised platform and sighed. \"Night and silence.\" A pause. \"Who is here? Weeds of Athens he doth wear.\" I fought not to move, but knowing he was looking at me made me want to open my eyes and look back at him, and made me worry that I looked foolish or rumpled on the ground. But Timothy continued with barely a pause and I got over it. \"And here the maiden, sleeping sound, on the dank and dirty ground.\" Cole coughed out the word 'fag' and I clenched my fists to keep still. Could he not shut up for a few minutes while we practiced the play? \"Aw,\" Cole said aloud, \"the fairy brought his own props,\" he teased cruelly. Stay calm, Jon. Don't kill him. He's your friend. I heard Timothy walking and forced myself to calm down. It would be just my luck for him to see me angry and think it was at him. He knelt down and I couldn't help myself. I opened my eyes and saw him there, fairy wings and all, and thought him beautiful. I'd never seen his face this close, this clear, ever. From the side or from afar, when he was upset or in pain, but never just him. Remembering that this was practice I quickly shut my eyes and tried to act asleep. \"Churl, upon thy eyes I throw….All the power…this charm doth owe,\" he said quietly and then something wet hit me in the face. I gasped and squinted my eyes shut against the liquid invasion and brought my hand up to wipe it away. When the water was gone, I opened my eyes and saw Timothy there still, but there seemed to be a power about him. In fact, I'm pretty sure he was glowing ….or maybe that was just me. The point was, that the tingle I usually felt around him had exploded and now the desire to kiss him was overriding anything else and I suddenly didn't feel afraid of the people around us, watching us. \"Timothy?\" I asked and reached for his face to bring him to my level so we could finally kiss in real life. Would he accept, or think me weird for suddenly wanting to kiss him in front of my teammates? He smiled and let out a soft, breathy laugh and I thought my heart might burst. Did I say he was beautiful before? I must've been mistaken. With a smile, he was perfection. Our lips were so close, I was so close to him, and then, \"Ah, nasty!\" Cole! My mind barely registered the anger I felt at him when Timothy stopped and looked over at him instead, a look of barely concealed anger on his face. He jumped up and ran to Cole, throwing something on his face, and then on everyone on the stage except Ms. T, and then on Coach Driskill when he came in the auditorium. Part of me registered that everyone was suddenly kissing each other, but they were nothing compared to Timothy in my mind right now. I stood and walked toward the edge of the stage, pulling my tie looser as I went. I felt too warm all of a sudden and all I knew was that I had a desperate need to be beside him. Why was he so far away? I jumped off the stage and took a step towards him, but he looked back at me and then ran. Why? Suddenly I felt so sad. Why was he leaving me? Had I done something wrong? I thought he liked me too. I mean, he nearly kissed me before Cole interrupted!...and if I didn't stop thinking about Cole, I might end up killing him, so I'd better think about something else. But what else? Timothy. What else was there but Timothy? I had to go after him. Why was I just standing there? I needed to know if he really liked me the way I liked him – no, loved. I loved him. Hayley was right! And right then, without cause or provocation, I wanted to shout it from the roof tops. I was in love with Timothy! I ran back onto the stage and found my jacket, pulled it on as best I could (I wanted to look nice for him, didn't I?) and ran out the double doors after my love. I found him only after several minutes of running, and of all the places I found him, it was on the practice field with his two friends. Bypassing the girl and boy, I wrapped my right hand around his bag strap and looked up into his eyes, suddenly not minding my height at all. \"How far I have chased you,\" I breathed out. \"Sweet, why do you flee so fast?\" He smiled but pushed me away. \"You have practice,\" he told me almost half-heartedly. But who cared about practice? Right now, all I needed was to be with him , the one who had haunted my heart for so long but was finally within my grasp. Or so I hoped. \"I can see your heart beat,\" I told him, and I found, to my amazement, that it was sort of true. The glow I could practically touch around him pulsated like the beating of a heart. \"I'm not done here yet, Sport,\" the girl said, anger lacing her words. She tugged me backwards and I nearly tripped. \"Was this the accident? You….seducing my boyfriend?\" \"Boyfriend?\" the black boy asked in dazed confusion. \"Yea…,\" the girl said almost sarcastically. \"Yes,\" Timothy answered, pushing futilely at his friend, who seemed to want to attach himself to Timothy physically and kept trying to kiss him. I went around his two friends and held onto his bike handles instead, ready to keep him there with me until we had had a chance to talk, at least. \"Max was the accident. But I'll fix it. I promise.\" He turned to me and said, \"Let's walk.\" It was ironic, because I'd said the same thing to him the other day for this same reason….almost. In any case, I wasn't about to tell him 'no,' so I gave him a brilliant smile to show him how happy this made me and we began to walk. It was suddenly so easy to show my emotions and I never wanted it to stop. I never wanted to be afraid to let people know I loved Timothy ever again. \"Where to?\" I asked, putting my hand on the small of his back and loving the feel of the muscles there. If I could just hold him forever, I'd be happy. Some small part of my brain said there was something fundamentally wrong about that thought, but I didn't care to decipher it. \"Wherever, I really don't care. I just wanna walk,\" Timothy said. I thought for a few moments and then it hit me. The festival was tonight. \"Wanna go to the Spring Festival tonight?\" He gave a little smile, quirking the edges of his mouth. \"Sure.\" A few minutes later I took a step ahead of the bike and smiled a bit nervously at him. \"So…I like you and…and you like me, right?\" He let out the same laugh he had when I first tried to kiss him. \"Yea,\" he admitted, glancing down at the ground and then back up at me with the same smile on his face. \"Yea, I lot.\" My smile became a beacon. \"So…that makes us boyfriends?\" Timothy paused for a moment and I stopped too, then he smiled and nodded. \"Yea. I guess it does. I mean, if you want to be.\" He shrugged, looking a bit sheepish. He was so cute. \"Yes,\" I said determinedly, grabbing a hold of the handle bars and leaning in close. \"Yes, I want to be. More than anything.\" He beamed back at me and took my hand as we continued to walk away from the school. I led him through town and helped him with his bike when it got stuck somewhere or had to be lifted or lowered. It was probably unnecessary, he did ride it to and from school every day after all, but I couldn't help it. At one point he bumped the nose of a car while dismounting a sidewalk. \"Oops,\" he laughed. \"Here,\" I offered, grabbing the end of his bike and turning it with him so it could maneuver between the cars. Then we were crossing the street. About the time we hit the other side walk I became aware of a woman's voice calling Timothy's name. Turning around I saw a woman in black with her hair done up and nice make up on. She was pretty. \"Hey, do you know her?\" I asked. I mean really, if this was someone else trying to make him love them, I don't know what I'd do. \"Yea,\" he revealed begrudgingly. \"My mom.\" His mom? Perfect timing! Now I could introduce myself and make a great first impression. I felt amazing, so I had no doubt I'd make a great impression. Just as she caught up to us I took her hand. \"Hi, I'm Jonathon. You have a brilliant son,\" I told her happily. She smiled at me, and then frowned. \"Oh shit.\" I frowned too. What'd I do? She looked down at her hands and pulled them both up to show me. \"Sorry. We just got our nails done.\" She turned around and waved to someone. \"Nora Fay!\" I could practically feel Timothy panic. \"No no, Mom!\" I looked at him, ready to help him in any way I could, and he put his hand on my shoulder and guided me in front of him, away from his mom. \"We've gotta go. We got a lot of…practicing to do,\" he lied, not meeting his mother's eyes. Why lie? Was he ashamed of being gay? But he was so open about it that everyone who met him knew! Was he….ashamed of me? \"Wait…,\" his mother said quietly, seeming meeker than a moment ago. \"Oh, Timothy!\" Nora Bellinger greeted grandly, grabbing his hand and shaking it with both of hers. \"A pleasure to finally meet you. And-,\" she gasped, removing her sunglasses, \"Jonathon Cordon! Well, you look….quite… luminous ,\" she complimented me. Without pausing for an instant to wonder about what she might think, like I usually would, I went along with my earlier plan and told her exactly how I felt. \"I'm in love,\" I told her. She smiled and so did I, looking at Timothy for a moment before looking back at Nora Bellinger. \"Yes…! This is exactly what I meant by rising above, Donna,\" she said to Timothy's mom. \"Your son, compatriots with Morgan Hill's star rugby player!\" I felt a bit of aggravation rise up in me. I just outright told her I was in love and looked at Timothy, couldn't she tell we were together? \"We're not compatriots,\" I started. \"We're boyfriends .\" There. Deny it now, Nora Fay. Donna and Nora's faces fell from laughter into confused frowns almost instantly. \"I…I'm sorry?\" Nora managed, looking at Timothy in an odd way that made me nervous for him. Timothy seemed to notice too, because he got suddenly nervous as well and gave a false smile as he said, \"We have got to go,\" and led me around the corner. I let him simply because I didn't want him to feel so anxious, and Nora Fay and his mother obviously made him anxious. \"Jonny!\" Oh my god! I couldn't wait to get away! There were too many distractions here in town! I tried to ignore her, but Becky ran up and grabbed a hold of my arm as we walked. \"Has your coach lost his mind?\" she asked almost teasingly, a smile on her face. I frowned pointedly at her. \"I've outgrown you.\" I grabbed Timothy's arm to support him when the almost palpable pulse of the glow around him beat faster. \"Ah-eh….I…Is this a joke?\" she asked incredulously. Why could no one see how much I loved Timothy? \"Don't mock my love,\" I demanded hotly but quietly. Glancing at Timothy then back at Becky I said, \"Who would not change a raven ,\" I looked her up and down, \"for a dove,\" and I smiled up at Timothy. \"What?\" I felt absolutely no pain or guilt in dumping her. I'd never really liked her to begin with. \"Fly away,\" I told her bluntly. She couldn't possibly not understand that. I didn't want her now that I had Timothy. As she left, I turned all my attention on Timothy. I tried to ask with my eyes if he was alright. Could he feel my emotions as well as I could his? His were so tumultuous right now and I had no idea how to help him. That hurt me deeply. He half-sighed and put a hand on my shoulder. \"Wait here.\" He walked away, and after only a moment my heart was aching. I wanted to be near him always. Somewhere in my mind I knew that I had always wanted that, but it had never been a physical need , like now. I also knew that it shouldn't be possible for me to see his heartbeat in a glow, or the glow at all, but I did. It was magic that gave me this courage to tell everyone about my love for Timothy and to understand him so intimately, and I didn't care. I didn't care how it happened or why, I was just so happy and I felt so free because I wasn't hiding anymore. I could be me and as long as Timothy accepted me, no one else mattered. Then Timothy was back and all my ills vanished like wisps of cloud in a sunny sky. \"So, where are we going?\" he asked conversationally, probably to get his mind off of Nora and Becky's negative reactions. I leaned in close to his ear and smiled as I whispered, \"How about your place?\" He gave a little smile at my suggestion and I considered a battle won. … … Timothy's house was….surprisingly small. The front door entered into a small kitchen, then into a living room, and a small hallway with a bathroom and two bedrooms. We went straight into his room after he told me which door was the bathroom and when he flipped on the lights I couldn't help but stare. Christmas lights. Well, not really. They were ball lights, but some of them looked like Christmas lights. White lights around his bed, colored crawling up the walls near his closet, and lamps scattered all around the room. I made my way over to the bed and inspected the headboard and the pictures there. They were of Max and the girl (Frankie, a picture was captioned) in random odd outfits and doing funny things. \"Why don't you go to school with your friends?\" I asked. I heard Timothy sigh and glanced over to where he was heading into his closet. From this angle, I could see the desk in the closet and the script book laying on it. There were also a few stuffed animals, but I let it pass. \"What?\" I asked in concern, moving to stand in the doorway as he riffled through his clothes. \"It's…I used to live by Frankie and Max, but then we moved over here and Morgan Hill is this really prestigious school. Mom had been planning on sending me there anyway at some point, so she saved up the money after the move and here I am. I suppose I could still go to my old school, since we didn't move all that far, but I think it'd be a bit unfair to waste all my mom's hard work getting me into Morgan Hill.\" He pulled out a black jacket and slid off his white shirt, revealing his arms to me. He had muscle there, toned if not overly strong. I almost reached out to touch them. \"Oh, I get it,\" I told him. Morgan Hill was pretty expensive, and if his parents spent a lot of money to get him in there, they probably wanted him to stay. After all, it really didn't look like they had much at all….I felt really rich all of a sudden. Timothy shook his head. \"Look, don't worry about it. I still hang out with them, so it's not that bad.\" I took a step into the closet and placed my hands gently on his biceps and whispered, \"But you're miserable here. I see it every day.\" A tiny smile fought to gain presence on his face, but it vanished too quickly to matter. His muscles tensed a bit as he gripped the jacket in his hands and then he gave an easy going smile that didn't reach his eyes. \"Come on. Let's go,\" he insisted with a nod toward the door. He waited only long enough to pull on the black jacket and then we were back outside and heading towards the school grounds. … … I could tell Timothy was a bit nervous, his heart was beating a tad faster than usual, but I would be with him to make sure nothing bad happened. I swore I'd make sure tonight was special for him. We were going to have a great time. All of a sudden, just outside the festival, Timothy stopped and my hand was pulled out of his. I looked back at him quizzically. \"Let's not go,\" he said quietly, reserved. \"Why?\" It would be fun. There were all these different booths I'd seen being prepared that looked really interesting. A kissing booth, tai food, sand art, cotton candy mountain, flower arrangement, hot dogs and hamburgers, and all the junk food you could eat. I fiddled with the end of my sleeve nervously and glanced at the festival grounds. Did he not want to be seen with me? \"You're different now,\" he said by way of explanation. What did that mean? I was ready to be open about my feelings and that made me different? Was that bad? \"Come on. What about cotton candy mountain?\" I coaxed, pulling lightly on the zipper of his jacket and skimming my fingers over his chest through the black shirt. All I wanted right now was to make him happy. He needed to have some fun. \"I don't think you're ready for this.\" Oh. He was concerned for me. Warmth crawled from the area of my heart to fill my whole being. I think I loved him more than ever in that moment, and I was sure to love him more and more as time went on. \"I cross my heart,\" I assured him, even physically making a cross over my heart and giving him a smile. I could do this. He stared at me for a moment and I held up my hand in promise. With a shake of his head he disagreed, \"Seriously, I was beat up for being queer before I even knew what that was,\" and he turned his head towards the ground again. And I would beat the living crap out of anyone who touched him. \"Well don't worry, I'll protect you,\" I promised him quietly. Well that was the wrong thing to say. \" I don't need someone to protect me !\" he said loudly. \"You didn't even like me yesterday, remember?\" he told me almost sadly, staring me in the eye. \"Well, sure I did,\" I assured him. I was causing him pain because I was too cowardly to tell him of my feelings before today? Well today- \"But I fell in love with you, today.\" He still looked sad and I felt a desperate need to fix that because it was so wrong . \"Come on,\" I insisted, tugging on his jacket. \"Come on, come on.\" \"Stop,\" he told me. \"Stop.\" What could I do to make him see that I was ready to show myself to the world for who I really was? What could I do to prove my love for him was true? I let out a breath and leaned in close to him. \"You're perfection,\" I breathed. He let out a breathy, somewhat bitter, laugh. \"That's the pansy talking.\" The what? Pansy? Oh, that flower he had on stage during practice? Suddenly all the pieces fell into place. Timothy had used that flower, somehow, to take away my insecurities. Maybe it was meant to make me love him, since all the other guys in our class were suddenly fawning all over each other and making out, but I was already in love with Timothy. Maybe that was why I suddenly felt so ready to be myself. I was glad for it. I laughed under my breath. \"Come on, it'll be fun,\" I promised lightly, suddenly happier than I'd been a few moments ago. This time, he let me pull him along towards the festivities and I smiled. \"There's a kissing booth,\" I mentioned suggestively. He laughed quietly. \"I think we can kiss without it.\" Could we? Really? We hadn't kissed once and I was dying for it! \"Really?\" He smiled at my innocent, sincere joy and squeezed my hand. \"Come on, let's just sit and talk for a bit.\" There was a tree with a simple rounded spiral trunk that would give us the perfect path up to a thick branch that made the perfect bench. I pulled him over to it, ready to hear everything he had to say. I wanted to know everything about him. Once seated, we just stared at each other for a minute. \"Ok,\" he said at length. \"How about…I tell you something about me, and then you tell me something about you?\" \"Sure.\" He wanted to know more about me too and that made me happier than I thought it would. We'd never kissed, but I was sure he liked me like I liked him. \"Alright,\" he took a deep breath. \"Um…I'm an only child.\" Oh, I could've guessed that from seeing his house. I pouted for a moment but then grinned. \"I have two younger sisters.\" Fair's fair. He laughed lightly at my tone, then looked away from me and to the festival for a moment. When he looked back his face was serious and he seemed a bit nervous. \"I hate this town,\" he admitted. \"I can't wait to graduate and get the hell out of this place forever.\" It took all I could to smile at him through my disappointment. \"It's…not that bad,\" I told him. If he didn't like this town, would he really leave after graduation? Was he going to leave me all alone again? \"Try looking at it through my eyes.\" What could I use to convince him to stay? \"What about your family?\" I'd stay for my family. He looked up and then back down at me. \"You mean my mom?\" \"Everyone.\" He shook his head a bit. \"It's just my mom….on a good day,\" he admitted. Suddenly somber, I stared down at the tree branch. I wondered what had happened to his father. Had he died? Was he in jail? Did he simply abandon Timothy and his mom? And his mother…She'd looked so shocked to hear he had a boyfriend. Did she not approve of Timothy being gay? Was he really all alone in this fight? I glanced back up at him and his gaze turned sad before he looked off at the festival again. Without waiting for me to tell him something about me, he continued. \"I don't wanna go back.\" He sounded partially devastated. \"To what?\" Were we still talking about his family? Was something wrong with his mother or father? Something horrible? \"To real life.\" Ok, you lost me, love. \"This is real,\" I told him. \"Yea,\" he agreed, then glanced down at the tree. \"But so… so far from where I woke up this morning.\" He lifted his eyes to mine and I saw something desperate and sad in them that I wanted to make go away. But then he looked away again, as if to hide his eyes from me, and when he looked back he was changing the subject again. \"People were staring at us,\" he joked nervously. I almost rolled my eyes. \"So stare back,\" I told him. Timothy should have hit himself with that pansy thing, so he could stop caring so much about what people thought. It was making him miserable! And if he was miserable, then I was too. And I wasn't as good at keeping emotions like that in as he was. \"People are just jealous,\" I choked out, \"because I'm with the best fellow in town.\" He looked almost hopeful and I needed to prove to him I was telling the truth. Maybe all he needed was someone to tell him everything would be alright. Maybe then he wouldn't be so ashamed of who he was, because he was amazing and had no reason to be ashamed. None at all. So I leaned in to kiss him and he met me part way and put his hands on my face as we kissed for the first time. And the second time. And the third. I bumped his nose with mine barely as I pulled away and looked him in the eyes. \"People can change,\" I murmured. I had changed. His eyes flicked from mine to the ground and he pulled away completely. For a minute I feared he'd changed his mind and he didn't really like me. Then a funny smile grew on his face as he breathed out and he said, \"If they experienced that , they might.\" And that just made me want to kiss him until we were both blue in the face. But anything more intense than what we'd just done and we might fall off the branch, so I held myself back. He looked towards the festival and, this time, so did I. \"Look,\" I laughed. Cole and Cooper were making out at the kissing booth. They looked glued together. \"How many people are in this town?\" Timothy asked randomly. My head spun he changed topics so fast. \"Ten thousand….maybe.\" Maybe not even that many. He thought for a minute while I simply watched him and then he got a sly grin on his face and met my eyes. \"Let's go.\" \"Why?\" Now that we were here, I was perfectly content to just sit and talk for the rest of the night. He smiled at me. \"I've got people to change,\" he said cryptically as he slid off the branch to the trunk and made to walk away. I hurried to follow him. \"What's that mean?\" I asked nervously. \"Are you gonna go kiss other guys?\" He laughed once, freely, and stopped to wait for me to catch up. When I was by his side, he took my hand and stared down into my eyes. \"No. I'd never dream of it.\" I felt like such a school girl in love the way my heart burst and I felt like I could fly at that statement. Maybe I was the girl in this relationship. Without releasing my hand, Timothy led the way into the festival. \"We'd probably best avoid the kissing booth, though,\" I muttered to him and he snorted and nodded in agreement. And then, as if fate was against me, Frankie walked up to us. \"Game's over, Sport,\" she announced. Was she talking to me or Timothy? \"What?\" Timothy asked in confusion just as Max ran up and grabbed him by the shirt. \"I missed you!\" he gushed and it made me feel sick. Frankie gave an aggravated sound and grabbed Max by the arm and yanked. \"Get the hell offa him!\" she ordered, but Max just shook her off and ran back to my boyfriend and pulled me off as we were walking away. \"Leave him alone,\" Timothy ordered. If Max kept at it, I'd get really mad really fast. \"Listen, he's just messing with your head,\" Max told Timothy conspiratorially and pointed at me. I wasn't messing with him! I loved him! \"He's mine,\" I told him possessively. \"Stop teasing him and go back to your cheerleader!\" he said like it was a curse and shoved me. I tried to get around him and to Timothy, but he wouldn't let me go. \"Any love I had for her is gone. I swear,\" I said almost desperately. Please don't leave me , I begged silently. \"Look, Max, Max,\" Timothy began in a placating tone of voice, taking Max by the shoulders and staring at him pointedly. \"You love Frankie. You know I know.\" \"Yes. Thank you,\" Frankie said tiredly and wrapped an arm around Max's shoulders and neck to drag him backwards. I made my way back to Timothy, who looked upset. But Max escaped Frankie and came back and stared intensely at Timothy as I tried to lead him away from the situation. \"I love you,\" he nearly breathed out. Timothy stopped and turned to stare in what seemed to be shock at Max. \"With my vow, I weep. My tears do tell the truth.\" He lifted his hands to brush Timothy's cheeks and I saw red. Luckily for him, Frankie grabbed a hold of him and nearly yelled, \"Ok! I'm going insane, officially!\" and tried walking away. Max wasn't cooperating though and they fell to the ground with a near simultaneous 'ah!' I almost laughed but then I got shoved from behind. Great , what now ! \"You…asshole!\" Becky cursed at me. She kept hitting me and I glared at her. \"Stop it.\" \"Look just,\" she began in a breathy angry voice. \"Just come here,\" she ordered and pulled me away. Why was everyone trying to pull us apart? \"He's mine!\" I told her and ripped myself backwards and away from her. Then Timothy was between us and had sprayed them with the flower the way he'd sprayed me. I grinned, wondering how it would affect them. Frankie stood up just then and I saw Timothy's heartbeat spasm. \"No no no, no!\" She looked up at him as he took a hold of her shoulders and watched Becky and….Becky's friend, warily. \"Look, can you please let me in on this?\" she asked wearily. \"Who is this goddess?\" Becky asked airily. \"Nymph.\" \"Perfect.\" \"Divine.\" Becky grabbed Frankie by the face and kissed her full on the mouth. Cool. Let Becky take a walk in my shoes for a bit. It was perfect. I was liking this flower thing more and more by the minute. Then Max just had to ruin my moment, again ! \"Timothy,\" he whispered, just loud enough that it caught my attention. He was touching him again! \"I love you.\" \"I love you more than he ever could,\" I swore, pushing Max off of him and pleading with Timothy to believe me. Max shoved me harshly. \"Prove it!\" I glared at him. \"Wanna fight?\" I asked hotly. This guy kept ruining my time with Timothy! He was always in the way! I never knew I was so possessive. Must be a pansy thing. \"You're on, Jock boy,\" he accepted. Frankie jumped on his back. \"Max!\" I scoffed at him. \"You comin'?\" He threw Frankie off. \"Let loose!\" He stared at her on the ground and said, \"Be certain, I do not love you anymore,\" so coldly that I felt even more justified in kicking his ass. He was supposed to be her boyfriend, wasn't he? \"Follow if you dare,\" I said and walked away. The sooner I finished this fight, the sooner me and Timothy could get back to just having fun. If I lost, which I wouldn't, I might just die. ... One more to go.[Chapter 3] Were the World Jon's Part 3 … The Final Part! I hope everyone's enjoyed this, my version of Jon during the movie. ...MOAR! lol :-D ... The fight wasn't long. Max may have been fighting for love, but he didn't know how to fight at all. I had every advantage and I used them. If beating Max would prove I loved Timothy more, then I'd do it. I stopped after the first bit of blood began to show, and told him the fight was mine. Afterward, leaning on a tree and waiting for Timothy to find me, I faltered. What had I just done? I was acting foolishly. Fighting wouldn't prove who loved Timothy more! I worried what he'd think of me for hurting one of his friends. I had no idea what to expect because I'd ignored his heart ever since Max and Frankie showed up at the festival. How could I have been so stupid? Just as I was beginning to really hate myself and the first rays of daylight were showing in the sky, Timothy walked into view with his bike beside him and his bag across his shoulders. He walked right up to me and gave me a kiss on the lips, and I thought that maybe he could tell how I was feeling after all. \"Come on,\" he whispered against my mouth. \"Let's go.\" Yes. I'd follow you anywhere. I swear. … … There were two lakes in Kingston. One was in the park, and the other was on the outskirts of town where hardly anyone ever went, on the edge of a forest. It was there that Timothy and I spent our night, or…what was left of it. He kind of leaned on me as we watched the sunrise and the way the light played across the lake and we both dozed off for a few hours. When we woke up, the sun was high enough in the sky to shed a gentle morning light on everything around us. We ate a breakfast of two rolls Timothy said he'd taken from his house when he'd stopped there to get his stuff. It wasn't much, but I wasn't hungry anyway. While we ate, I realized something about Timothy. The glow I'd been seeing all day yesterday had dimmed quite a bit. He looked a bit less ethereal now, but he was no less beautiful to me. In fact, I think I preferred him without it. I wondered if, sometime soon, I would fail to see the glow at all…. \"Let's go swimming,\" I suggested randomly. Timothy laughed deep in his throat. \"We just ate.\" \"Oh, come on,\" I insisted. \"It'll be fun.\" I kissed him on the nose and then shed my shirt and lept into the lake six feet away. Turns out it was only deep enough at the edge to cover up to my knees. Timothy cracked up when I looked at him sheepishly. \"Great swimming,\" he teased. Oh sweet, laugh again. \"I love your laugh,\" I admitted softly, a blush coming up to gently brush my cheeks. The glow thumped faster and he blushed too. \"Truly.\" He moved to sit on the edge of the grass by the lake and gave an embarrassed smile. \"I'm pretty sure I love you ,\" he whispered and my heart forgot to beat. \"When…When I figured out I was attracted to guys….It was usually their bodies that captivated me, and just that. But…You're personality is great too.\" ' Too .' Yea. That meant he thought I was hot. A goofy smile hit my face and I sat down in the water. \"Well thanks. You're really kind as well.\" Without warning, I stood up and splashed water on him. He let out a surprised laugh and yelp and I sat down again, prepared to do it again and maybe get him in the water with me. \"I,\" he began, the smile slipping away and all of my plans ended abruptly. \"I'm not kind…not really.\" He looked at the grass at his elbow. \"I'm actually really selfish.\" \"How so?\" He tried to smile but failed and didn't look up at me. \"I was really mad at everyone for treating me the way they did. Really mad. And after I got cast as a fairy in the play, it just got worse, even with my mom.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I murmured, trying to catch his eye. I hadn't realized that being Puck had caused him so many issues. If there was something I could do…. He looked at me then. \"Don't be. You're the only good thing I've got at Morgan Hill. And besides, I changed all that.\" He looked away at something in the distance. \"I changed everything to fit me.\" \"And that's what makes you selfish?\" I asked, pulling myself out of the water and sitting next to him. He nodded and met my eyes. He was so close. \"Know this….There is nothing you could do to make me hate you,\" I assured him and gave him a kiss. When we parted he shook his head and smiled at me half-heartedly. \"Let's talk about something else. Something about you.\" And that's how we passed the afternoon. I told him about my father and mother and what they did for a living and my two sisters, why I played rugby and why I liked it, my favorite color – purple but I told everyone it was green, favorite books and movies, favorite foods – snow crab but my father and mother found it too messy and we rarely had it, and that I was completely and totally in love with him. For some reason, he seemed bittersweetly happy about that last one. He told me about his mom and her job hunting, the fight he'd had with his father when he'd come out about being gay, his favorite color – the green on his bedroom walls, his favorite books and movies, favorite food – macaroni and cheese, that he was shit at fighting, and that he loved me too – he'd whispered it beautifully in my ear. By the end of it, we were leaning against a tree and it was mid afternoon. He was in my arms and I had never felt more at peace in the world. I ran my hand along his arm and back to his hand in slow movements, not caring if the world ended right then because I was so calm and happy. He caught my hand. \"Hey, what's this?\" he asked, a smile in his voice, as he traced a little scar between my index finger and thumb. \"Oh,\" I laughed lightly. \"I cut myself cooking.\" \"Cooking?\" he asked incredulously and looked up at me above him with a laugh barely held behind his lips and a smile lighting his face. I tickled him and he jumped and laughed. \"Yea, cooking,\" I said. \"Got a problem?\" \"No, no!\" he yelped, trying to pull away. I stopped tickling him as quickly as I'd begun and held him close to me. He sighed and wrapped his arms around my arms and relaxed against me again. \"This is perfect,\" he breathed and rolled his head a bit on my stomach, making me giggle like a girl. \"I never want it to end.\" I held him tighter. \"It doesn't have to end. We can stay together. Forever.\" … … When I woke up, it was to Timothy's mother's voice. \"Hi Sugar,\" she said quietly, but it still made me panic for a minute. \"I gotta get you to the school.\" Timothy looked at me as he got up and suddenly I remembered. The school play! I got up and followed as Timothy got into his mom's car. I held his hand in the back seat and he leaned on me like I was his rock in a swift river. I'll admit. I was worried. What was wrong with him? There was no glow, not really. I had to really focus to see it and it was already dark outside, so it should've been easier to see. Now I even worried about that. When the glow disappeared for good, what would happen to Timothy and me? I didn't want to lose all the confidence I'd gained in myself, in my sexuality, in Timothy. I kissed the top of his head and then lifted our joined hands to plant a kiss on his fingers. He gripped my hand a bit tighter and I stopped. What was wrong? Just as I opened my mouth to ask, the car stopped outside the school and Timothy led me by the hand out of the car. There were a lot of people milling about outside, waiting for curtain time. I thought I saw my sister Hayley, but it was so quick that it could've been anyone. Did that mean my parents were here too? Dad had been so against the play… Then I was in make-up and costuming, and then the play had started, and I never got the chance to ask Timothy what was bothering him. He acted fine during the play, but then again, he was acting. Just before the one of the last scenes, I noticed he looked nervous and gave him a peck on the lips and smiled to give him a bit of my confidence. He gave a tiny, shaky smile in return and then hurried around and onto the stage to call the lovers back and reverse the spell. \"Follow my voice. We'll try no manhood here,\" he said loudly. I stepped out onto the stage with him. \"The villain is much lighter heeled than I: I followed fast, but faster he did fly,\" I recited, adding a bit of breathlessness to it to make it seem I'd been running a lot. Even as I acted and did the silly poses of Shakespeare, all I could really think about was Timothy right next to me as Puck. He looked fantastic as a fairy. I wasn't there when they did that to his hair, but it was amazing. Then again, he looked amazing all the time. \"Come, thou gentle day!\" I said, setting myself down on the ground by the tree as I had for the scene where I had the spell put on me. \"For if but once thou show me thy grey light, I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.\" \"Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?\" Timothy called gently yet mockingly and I fought not to smile. I was supposed to be asleep. A goofy smile would give me away. \"Where art thou now?\" Taylor called, louder than I had. \"Come hither: I am here,\" Timothy beckoned almost gently. \"Nay, then, thou mock'st me.\" Taylor ran around the stage and onto the platform as Timothy landed right by my side near the tree. \"Thou shalt buy this dear, if ever I thy face by daylight see: Now, go thy way.\" As Taylor jumped down from the platform, Timothy ran away and I missed his closeness physically. It was a real fight to stay still and not chase after him. \"Faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed. By day's approach look to be visited.\" With that, Taylor laid back against the stage wall. I know because I kept opening my eyes during practice to watch Timothy move. \"O weary night, O long and tedious night,\" Bradley began and I heard the soft steps of Timothy as he exited the stage. Behind Bradley's short monologue I heard Ms. Tebbit speaking, but I couldn't hear what she said. \"Abate thy hour! And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye, steal me awhile from mine own company.\" Bradley lay down with his flowers in sleep. Timothy came back on stage then and a bit of the tension in me left. \"Yet but three? Come one more; two of both kinds make up four. Ah, here she comes, curst and sad: Cupid is a knavish lad, Thus to make poor females mad.\" And he was right next to me . I could practically hear him breathing, or his heart beat. I tilted my head ever so slightly towards him, trying to be closer without giving up the act of sleep. Cole spoke his lines near perfectly and it made me wonder if maybe him being with Cooper had been good for his personality. \"Never so weary, never so in woe, bedabbled with the dew and torn with the briers, I can no further crawl, can no further go; my legs can keep no pace with my desires.\" And he lay down and pretended to sleep. Timothy knelt next to me silently. I only realized he'd moved when I heard him let out an audible breath. I held my own. \"On the ground, sleep sound…,\" he sang, and it was so beautiful. I began to breathe again. I wanted to watch him as he sang, close up this time. I felt his fingers as they gently toyed with my hair for a moment. The music played again and he let his hand drop back to the platform. \"I'll apply…to your eye…gentle lover, remedy…\" He stood back and, as the music began to pick up, I heard thunder roll outside. It added the perfect drama to the song and made Timothy seem just that much more perfect when he started singing again. \"When thou wakest, thou takest true delight, in the sight of thy former lady's eye…Jack shall have Jill.\" I felt something wet hit my eyes and clothes and gasped. It felt like something was being pulled from my very being: not painful, but uncomfortable. \"Nought shall go ill…The man shall have his mare again…\" I opened my eyes then and saw Timothy standing there, imagination in its finest moment, finishing the song. But he looked different…No…he looked the way I've seen him for weeks now, but different from how I'd seen him in the past twenty-four hours. \"…and all shall be well.\" He sounded upset… That was it! The glow was gone! And….and I didn't feel the frantic need to comfort him. Sure, I wanted to comfort him, but I wasn't desperate to do so anymore. I was suddenly aware of everyone else on the stage and the people in the audience….all staring at us on stage. There were so many people here, and I could hear them all muttering to each other. Timothy knelt by me again and looked me right in the eyes. He looked like he was about to cry… \"Goodbye,\" he murmured sadly. What? I opened my mouth to ask why?, where are you going?, you're coming back right?, but he was already leaving and I couldn't just call out to him on stage. People would stare! Wait. I looked down at the stage and realized that, somehow, the magic was gone. I was a coward again. It was just then I realized I was getting wet and looked up into the strange rain falling on everyone. \"Is this part of the show?\" I asked aloud. \"Damn, this is cool,\" Taylor laughed quietly from the sidelines. Then Ms. Tebbit called us off stage so the finale could begin. Timothy went to stand by Ms. Tebbit while the rest of us headed back stage to wait for curtain call. If Ms. Tebbit wasn't standing there, I'd be next to him in a heartbeat. I had so much to ask him. Why did he remove the magic? Did he still want to be with me? Why did he say good-bye? I didn't understand. I'd thought he wanted to be my boyfriend all along. I mean, he was the one who started this whole thing, right? But now… I heard him beginning to speak on the stage and sighed. But now he'd ended it. That was it, wasn't it? He'd had enough, or changed his mind, or found that he didn't love me after all. I could always claim that the magic made me do it, but I didn't want to! I wanted Timothy back! But….if he had decided to end it….then I guess, if I love him, I should respect his decision. It'll kill me inside, but I'll do it. If that's what Timothy wants… Taylor tapped my shoulder and I stepped in line for the curtain call. I walked right past Timothy and refused to look at him. If I did, I might break down, and how unmanly and out of character would that be? We all bowed on stage, and then Cole held out a hand to me. We clapped hands, like real men do, and then walked to the side of the stage. As practiced, everyone lifted their hands to welcome Puck out onto the stage and he came, smiled at the audience, and bowed. We all clapped along with the audience, but I wasn't really feeling up to it anymore. I kinda just wanted to go home and die. Not literally. I wasn't that depressed yet. But I wanted to lay in bed and never get up again. I'm such a girl. We all left the stage and I went in back to change out of my costume and wipe my make-up off. I kept my eyes on the floor except when other cast and crew members came up to congratulate me on a job well done or talk about the show. Then I acted like my normal self. I didn't even pull my normal clothes on, just took my costume off. I just wanted to be out of there. Everyone was still changing when I made to leave. Just as I reached the door to the outside, Hayley burst through and threw her arms around me. \"Whoa! Hey Hayley, what's the rush?\" I asked, trying to seem normal. She giggled happily in my ear. \"It's Puck, isn't it? Am I right?\" she gushed, pulling me around in a circle. \"I am right, I know it. I saw you two walk in together, hands clasped and everything. Jon , I'm so happy for you!\" I was so glad no one was around to hear this. \"Hayley,\" I sighed, putting a stop to her jovial spinning and cheering. \"It's not…we're not together anymore.\" I couldn't look her in the eyes, so I stared at her shoulder. \"I'm not sure we ever were, really.\" \"What? But, Jon, I saw you,\" she insisted. I shook my head. \"Hayley, I'm gonna tell you something, and it'll probably sound crazy, but you've got to believe me.\" She nodded insistently and I took a deep breath before meeting her eyes. \"Somehow….Timothy did something like magic and made everyone fall in love with everyone else….like in the play. The first thing they saw, they went for it….Well, I saw him first and I realized you were right. I'd always loved him.\" She opened her mouth with a smile as if to say 'I told you so,' but I put a finger on her lips to stop it and she stared at me seriously again. \"For awhile, everything was great. He even said we were boyfriends. But tonight he changed everything back to the way it was. No one is in love with anyone anymore,\" I told her, trying not to sound too sad. \"Sooo….,\" she tried, and I could see her mind working, \"…what's the issue?\" I sighed something between depression and exasperation. \"The issue is that, why would Timothy change everything back and take the spell off me if he still wanted to be with me?\" I explained as calmly as I could. Hayley stared at me for a minute and then gave an over exaggerated sigh herself. \"Jon, where have you been? The entire town's been going crazy today!\" \"Crazy?\" \"Yea!\" She waved her arms around frantically. \"Everyone was suddenly gay and people were randomly marrying their neighbors and people who'd never been attracted to one another suddenly fell head over heels in love.\" \"They…they what?\" The whole town? \"Yea!\" she exclaimed and her eyes bugged out. \"The few people that weren't suddenly in love got real mad cause their kids and family were gay now and the play almost got shut down! I know, I snuck into the meeting. Ms. Tebbit got everyone calmed down somehow, I still don't understand it. She just held her hands up and told everyone to calm down and come see the show and everything would be alright, and they did.\" Hayley shrugged. \"Maybe she's a bit magic too.\" I shook my head. \"That's all good and well, Hay, but what's it got to do with Timothy and me?\" She rolled her eyes at me and shook me by the shoulders. \"Fool! The town was coming apart at the seams! He probably had to reverse it!\" \"Had to….,\" I trailed off. I suddenly heard, in clear detail, the sad way he'd said goodbye on stage after his song. So….did Timothy think I wouldn't want him once the spell ended? Maybe…I looked to the side. Hope sprung up in my chest and I grinned. Then I frowned and stared at Hayley again. \"Hay, I'm in trouble.\" \"Why?\" she asked, a smile on her face and in her voice. \"You love each other, right?\" I shook my head. \"Yes…probably…but that's not the point. Hayley…the only reason I had enough courage to confess the first time was because I wasn't in my right mind. How am I supposed to manage it without the extra confidence?\" She rolled her eyes again. \"Jon….People have been confessing their love to other people for centuries.\" She pat me on the shoulder and whispered, \" I think you can handle it ,\" before suddenly leaving me and putting her hands on the door handle. \"I'll take care of mom and dad and Hannah. Take your time!\" she said happily, as if I wasn't freaking out on the inside, and then left. \"Great,\" I breathed out into the still air. \"No pressure.\" I took a deep breath and headed back towards the dressing rooms. Timothy was probably still in there wiping all his makeup off. Ms. Tebbit told me Timothy was in the dressing room up the stairs and I hurried up them. He was sitting in front of a mirror with his back to me, wiping the last of his makeup off and taking his sweet time doing it. I was standing just a tad too far to his right to be in the mirror. Perfect. Perfect. Now how could I confess to him quickly so I wouldn't chicken out part way through and in a way that he'll believe me? Let's face it, anything I start to say will change part way through cause I'm a retard with no backbone. So it was left to actions. Actions. Well, the best action to do with someone you love, something I'd loved doing this past day and I'd dreamt about for weeks was…. Before I could rethink my plan, I jumped forward, flipped his chair around, and kissed him straight on the lips. He pushed me away and I almost ran until I saw how confused he looked. Ok….words….words… \"You were unbelievable tonight,\" I complimented. Nice words. A strange stutter came out of his mouth. \"D-don't you f…feel…\" \"I feel like myself,\" I assured him, and myself as well. Now that it was over, I couldn't believe how public I'd been about my affections. I could've ruined our lives, or gotten one of us really hurt. Thinking about it made me feel all out of sorts with myself. But now I was back to normal, ready to start a relationship with Timothy the way I wanted to. \"It is not enough to speak, but to speak true,\" Ms. Tibbet said from behind us and we both turned to see her just in time for Cooper, Max, and Frankie to hurry up the stairs. \"Dude! Awesome job!\" Cooper shouted. Max and Frankie looked happy, so I figured Max wasn't about to throw himself all over Timothy again…..You know, I should probably ask him why Max was in love with him in the first place. Cooper looked between Timothy and me and laughed open mouthed as he continued to look back and forth. When he'd managed to calm it down to a simple smile, he told us what he wanted to say. \"Dude, you two love birds better be at my party tonight, cause it's gonna be beyond , alright?\" he said, sounding….actually, truly gay. He wasn't picking on Timothy, he was just talking…and he was still wearing his eye makeup…Whoa. Cooper got up and left and I don't know where Max and Frankie went, but Timothy was looking at me with something akin to amazement, so I didn't really care either. He got this funny little smile on his face and it was contagious. He hadn't told me to leave yet, so he liked me, right? As if to prove it to me, Timothy suddenly leaned down, put his hand on my left cheek, and kissed me right on the mouth. When he pulled back I gave a little smile and blushed, I could feel it. Timothy let out an airy laugh. He was still amazed? I leaned my head up a little bit closer to him and my smile widened as I whispered, \"I think I love you, for real.\" Timothy's eyes widened and then his eyebrows came together and his eyes narrowed. At first I thought I'd done something wrong, but then he wiped his hand across his face, sniffled, and kissed me again. \"Should I be worried?\" came an amused voice and I turned around where I knelt to see Timothy's mom grinning at us. How long had she been there? Timothy let out another breathy, amazed laugh and found my left hand with his right, then smiled at her then back at me. … … Riiiing…..Riiiing…. \"I'll get it,\" my mother called throughout the house. I was sitting in my room again, probably twice as big as Timothy's and I still felt a bit self-conscious about that. On my desk, in the corner, was the script book from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Inside the front cover was a picture of the whole cast from our final bow. I was fiddling with the remote to my dvd player and staring at the tv across the room. On it was the dvd of our play. Ms. Tebbit had dropped it off this morning at my house, and now it was paused on the moment when Timothy was sitting next to me, right after he'd said 'Gentle lover…Remedy…' At that moment, because he was the focal in the scene, the camera had zoomed in on us. I fiddled with the remote and stuck it under my chin as I studied the image on the screen. If I hadn't figured out that he still wanted me yet, I would've realized it after watching the video. He looked tortured. No one else would notice, because no one else was watching him so closely, but I did. I'd watched this scene six times now already. He kept delaying; looking around and simply sitting. He didn't want it to end. My heart ached at this moment in the play and the only thing that comforted me was that we were together now. It'd only been a few hours since the play, just one night, but I felt light as a feather knowing I had all the time in the world with Timothy. \"Honey.\" I hit stop on the dvd player and flipped around casually just as my mother walked in my room. \"A friend of yours is here….From the play?\" I brought my eyebrows together and got up to follow her downstairs. \"They called a few minutes ago, but I forgot to tell you they were on their way.\" \"Who is it?\" I asked. She shook her head and shrugged. \"I don't know his name, but he's cute.\" I rolled my eyes as she opened the front door and then stopped. Timothy was sitting on his bike, one leg holding him and the bike up, the other on the pedal farthest from me. He had on a white shirt and a black jacket with white accents and dark grey tight jeans with square black and white sunglasses. Is it strange that I found that really hot? \"Um…thanks, mom.\" I nearly stuttered. \"I'll take it from here.\" \"Alright then,\" she acquiesced and went back inside. I stepped off the front porch and held my hands out to my sides a bit. \"What?\" was all I could manage. When I was only a step away he pulled off the sunglasses in one fluid motion and pulled me in for a kiss. I didn't protest and after only half a second I kissed him back, one hand suddenly wrapped up in his t-shirt. It felt like a century passed, but probably only four seconds, when we pulled apart. \"What was that for?\" I asked in a daze. That had been the most passionate kiss we shared yet. He smiled apologetically. \"Sorry….I just had to see if it was real, what happened yesterday I mean.\" I nodded. \"I get it.\" I took a hold of the handle bars on his bike and grinned at him. \"You wanna do something today?\" He beamed and opened his mouth to answer when all of a sudden, \"Yes!\" I rolled my eyes and let my head drop onto the handle bars between my hands. \"Oh I knew it!\" \"Wh-\" \"Hi, Hayley,\" I greeted without lifting my head, then stood up straight and used my hand to motion to her. \"Timothy, my sister Hayley. Hayley, my boyfriend Timothy.\" If I'd been looking, I'm sure I would've seen Timothy's shocked face that I'd introduced him to family that way, but I think Hayley shocked him more. She got right up in his face with the biggest smile on her face, teeth and all showing, and grabbed him by the face. \"Wow. You're cuter up close.\" She giggled lightly to herself about something or other. \"Thanks?\" he said through his squished cheeks. I cleared my throat and she jumped back from him. \"Oh. Did I interrupt something?\" she asked humbly. \"Just a little,\" I said. She put a hand to her mouth and then bowed to us a tiny bit. \"I'm sorry. Where are my manners. I'll just…leave now…Bye.\" She ran back into the house, and I sighed and turned back to Timothy, who was looking at me with a severely questioning look on his face. \"My sister, drama extraordinaire of our family.\" I smiled and pressed my nose to his for a brief moment. \"She's been bugging me about you since you fought Cole during rugby practice.\" \"Rugby-,\" Timothy cut himself off and let out a breath. \"How long have you liked me?\" I shrugged. \"I don't know.\" I leaned heavily on the handle bars. \"The first day in the locker room? But then I just thought you were good looking. So….I don't know. It was progressive.\" I grinned. He laughed that same breathy laugh he always did when he was shocked. \"Really? The whole time?\" I shrugged and smiled but said nothing. \"Man…I must've been more oblivious than I thought,\" he joked. I stared into his eyes, beautiful eyes, until he blushed. \"So, what were you saying before Hayley interrupted?\" \"Oh,\" he glanced down and then back up at me. \"Yea. I wanna do something today.\" \"Like what?\" He shrugged. \"Whatever.\" His smile still made my heart melt and I smiled too. \"Let's play a game.\" He tilted his head down a bit but never broke eye contact so I kept going. \"I'll tell you something about me, and then you'll tell me something about you.\" He laughed once, softly, and nodded. \"Sure. The lake?\" I nodded and we started to walk away, my hand on his bike's right handle bar and his on its left handle bar as we went. A few feet down the road I glanced at him again. \"You look good today.\" \"Really?\" he asked with a little smile. \"You too.\" Fin. ... My sister told me the ending is weird. I tried to imagine it how a movie would end. It's like…the movie is fading out so you barely catch the last two lines as they walk away. It seemed cute to me so I left it at that. And that is THE END. Thank you all for reviewing and keeping with me! I love you all! ","Summary":" Were the World Jon's Everything changes with a different Point of View.

Luckily, he can't read me! And there's one thing that drove me here... \"FRANK! NO!\" I yelled, as I tackled him off his feet and onto his bed. \"Get off me Gee! I need to do this! It's not fair!\" Frank cried on my shoulder, but I was happy he was still alive. \"It's only me, Frank. You can't do this\" I whispered in his ear. I kissed his cheek softly, and his hazel eyes stared up at me longingly. Frank's POV With that kiss, I new exactly what I wanted to do. I pressed my lips against Gerard's and sat on his chest. Ripping off his shirt, I planted several kisses on his neck, and he moaned with satisfaction. Off came the pants, and to my pleasure, he had no objection. But what really startled me, was when Gee climbed on top of me and pulled off my clothes! We were in nothing but our underwear, and my hard-on was easily visible. So was his. Gerard's POV As Frank and I stared at each other, I noticed a lust deep within me dying to come out. Frank dived on me, and wrestled me to the ground. His hand was down my boxers, and it felt so good. He rubbed up and down viciously, and I groaned at the pleasure I was getting from it. \"Frank! I'm gonna cum!\" And with that warning, I ejaculated all over Frank's hands. He just pulled them out and licked them. I'd never been so turned on! I ran to his bathroom and grabbed a tub of Vaseline. And, well, you can guess what comes next... Frank's POV I could feel Gee's erect cock sliding inside of me, and I breathed in hard and swallowed gallons of air. This was so wrong, but so right! It was the best feeling I'd had in my entire teenage life! \"GEE! HARDER!\" I screamed. I was thrust so hard I banged my head on the wall, and I let out a loud yelp. Chills shot down my spine as my orgasm erupted. Gerard Way was my definition of perfection. 'Hmm, an orgasm over Gee' I thought. 'They're totally rare!' Oh, did I forget to mention, I'm in love with him...[Chapter 2] A/N I do not own Gerard or Frank, although I would like to This chapter is dedicated to a certain someone who shines a light on my heart. I love you Gerard's POV I woke up to a beam of light shining annoyingly through Frank's curtains. Speaking of Frank, where the fuck was he? There was no noise in the house whatsoever, which meant he'd gone out, leaving me home alone. Awesome! I raced down the stairs, and almost broke the kettle as I set it to boil. \"I need coffee\" I thought. I don't know why, but I've always loved coffee, and now I was obsessed with it! I often took a flask of it to school with me, and if I ever stayed over at a friend's house, I'd bring coffee-making utensils with me. Yes, I really am that sad... The door crept open, and Frank stood in the doorway and yelled jokingly \"Honey, I'm home\". As he hung his coat on the door, I ran up to him and hugged him. As I kissed his cheek, I grasped his firm ass in one hand, and squeezed so hard, Frank let out a high-pitched yelp. Frank's POV \"Love you too Gee, but next time maybe let me through the door before attacking me?\" I giggled, and Gerard hit me playfully, and I clutched my arm in fake pain. \"Ouch! You're so strong! You might kill somebody one day!\" I was answered with a sharp punch to the gut, which made me bend over and cough. Gerard then stood behind me and pretended to do me up the ass. If only the pants would disappear... \"Fancy some coffee?\" Gee shouted from the kitchen. \"No thanks! We're not all freaks like you!\" I heard him giggle quietly, and he returned with a mug of steaming coffee and a plate of biscuits. We'd planned to go to the park today, but I couldn't be arsed! I'd been out once today, and it wasn't even 11 o'clock! Of course, Gerard was not happy about this, and I was constantly tackled and punched throughout the day until I gave in and ran to the park. Me being a lot quicker than him also made him unhappy, and he cursed at me a lot, which was okay bearing in mind the life I had. Gerard's POV Don't get me wrong, I love Frank to bits. But it doesn't stop me from kicking his ass at every given opportunity! But it always ends in cuddles and kisses anyway, so it's okay. It's actually pretty funny sometimes. I just love to see his tiny body fall down in front of me. It's so cute! He's so cute! \"Hey, Frank! Come push me on the swing?\" I pleaded, licking my lips sexually. \"Only if I get some of those lips too!\" He winked at me, then pushed gently on the swing, kissing my neck every time I swung back, and I found that incredibly cute. I wish I could tell him how madly in love I am with him. Frank's POV I wish I could tell him how madly in love I am with him, but I'd just be making a complete ass of myself. He doesn't love me! At the most he just likes me, and what happened the night before was a one time thing for him. If I had my way, we'd be doing stuff like that every night! \"Come on Frankie. Time to go home\" Gerard smiled at me. He has the most perfect smile. \"I think you'll find it was you that wanted to come here!\" I clasped his hand in mine, and we walked all the way home like that. Maybe he does love me... No, that's stupid. It must be my imagination. \"Frank,\" Gerard said softly, stopping in his tracks and turning to face me. \"I'm in love with you\" Was this really happening? \"I love you too...\" A whole 10 minutes passed before we said a word to each other, but it was Gee who spoke first. \" So what are we gonna do? I mean, I love you, you love me. What's keeping us apart?\" I gulped at that question. I couldn't control myself. I was dying to shout at him \"LET'S GO OUT!\", but of course, that would be weird. I just simply kissed him and said \"I'm game if you are\" When we were home, I ripped Gerard's pants off, and shoved my hands into his boxers. \"You disobey me; I'll snap it like a twig!\" I threatened. I started stroking his semi-erect cock. I could feel it growing bigger and harder in my hand as I stroked faster. It eventually became a full on hand job, and just before he creamed on my hands, I dropped to my knees and stuck it in my mouth. I finished off, and the warm white liquid oozed down my throat. I took a large gulp, and wiped any extra jizz from my face. Gee grabbed my hand, and led me upstairs whilst unbuttoning his shirt. \"Now I'm going to show you a really good time!\"[Chapter 3] A/N I do not own Gerard, Frank and Mikey, although I would like to Mikey's POV \"Mikey! Go get your brother from Frank's house!\" my mum yelled up to me as I was just finishing my shower. My brother Gerard was still at his friend's house. He'd been there for 2 days now, and mum was starting to get worried. I don't know why, she just worried a lot about us since dad died. I pressed my glasses to my face before heading to my room to dress. I didn't bother drying; these weren't going to be my clothes for the day. I threw on an Iron Maiden shirt and some black skinny jeans. Of course, I put on boxers. I still have flashbacks to the first time I tried on jeans while going commando. I slipped on my DC's and headed to Frank's house around the corner. As I set off, I couldn't help but noticed the lack of life in the street. It was unusual to have no cars going down the street at this time. Oh well. I plugged in my headphones and started head banging to Avenged Sevenfold. Sure I looked like a complete ass, but the thing is, I am a complete ass! I came to Frank's house and knocked 3 times; no answer. I tried again, but there were still no signs of anyone answering. Trying the door handle, I noticed it was unlocked. \"Hello?\" I shouted as I walked into the living room. No one was downstairs. I walked upstairs and heard a loud moaning. Maybe someone was crying. I continued to ascend the staircase until I was outside Frank's room. Gerard's POV There was a knock at the door of Frank's bedroom which startled us both. Who the hell was in his house? And what the fuck did they want? We couldn't stop now! I was at the peak of my orgasm, and it felt so good! \"Gee, we're gonna have to stop!\" Frank panted. I retreated reluctantly and opened the door. \"MIKEY?\" My little brother stood in the doorway open-mouthed, staring at the scene that lay ahead of him. Oh shit! This couldn't have got worse! Why did it have to be him? \"Hey Gerard. Mum wants you back home now. That okay or d'you wanna finish up?\" Mikey giggled. How could he find this so normal? \"I'm bi too bro. It's no big deal. Oh, hi Frank. Nice cock you've got there\" He winked at my naked lover on the floor, then came in and sat down on the bed. \"So, are you gonna watch us get dressed or are you gonna give us some privacy?\" I asked sarcastically. All three of us knew what I was thinking. \"No, I think I'll watch. Mum said Frank can come round too\" Mikey always has been the sarcastic type. I personally think he got it from me, but he sometimes takes it over the top. I still love him though, even if he is a bit weird... I pulled on my Misfits hoodie, baggy jeans and Converse trainers before walking out of the bedroom to brush my teeth. This has got to be the weirdest moment of my life. I mean, my own brother just saw my dick! And he wasn't fazed by it at all! But most of all, he knew I was bi. He couldn't let mum know! She'd kill us both! So my brother's bi. Awesome! Now I have complete confidence and faith in him! I now know I can talk about anything with him. I'd been dying to tell him for ages, but I didn't want him to hate me like the rest of our school. Wait, my brother and my boyfriend are in a bedroom, and one of them is half-naked. I swear to god Mikey! You touch him, I will tear you limb from limb![Chapter 4] A/N I do not own Gerard, Frank, Mikey and Mrs Way, although I would like to Frank's POV As I quickly got dressed in front of my boyfriend's brother, I noticed he was staring at my private area. \"Do you mind?\" I asked him forcefully. \"No, not at all\" was his only response in his usual cocky manner, a cheeky grin spreading across his face, and a large boner raising his pants. Oh god. My lover's brother found me attractive; how awkward. As soon as I was fully clothed and Mikey's erection had gone down, I turned on my Xbox and threw a controller at him. We played CoD for 20 minutes before Gerard finally arrived. \"Oh. Big mistake Frank! Mikey's amazi-\" Gerard stared at the screen in awe. \"Oh my god. You're winning!\" Of course, I was a pro at this game. I had no friends – well, except for Gee – to go out with, so I just stayed in and played video games most days. After I had whooped both their asses on the Xbox, we set off to their house, where we were greeted by Mrs Way, who was – as ever – thrilled to see her 'babies' again. \"Mum, it's only been two days\" Gee rolled his eyes behind his mother's back which made me giggle slightly. He was just so full of wit and humour. He has got to be the funniest guy I know. It's impossible not to love him really; he's perfect. I didn't know love existed until I saw Gerard Arthur Way. I knew from the moment I first set my eyes on him, I wanted to be with him. I just needed the courage to talk to him. Thankfully, he spoke to me, so it wasn't as much an effort for me. It turned out we liked the same music, clothing, movies. We have so much in common; it should be illegal for us not to be together. But now he's mine, and I'm not letting go without a fight. Mrs Way's POV I know my sons are bisexual, and I really couldn't care less. I think it's a beautiful thing to be honest. It really does pain me when I see Gerard and Michael acting 'normal' when they should be expressing themselves. But what hurts the most is that they don't even trust their mother enough to tell her. \"Gerard! What do you want for lunch?\" I shouted up to my eldest son. He ran downstairs, closely followed by Mike and Frank, who were talking about one of their favourite 'rock' bands: The Misfits. Of course that wasn't real rock. Rock was The Beatles, The Rolling Stones. They built every modern piece of music there is! \"We'll just grab some sandwiches in our room, if that's okay?\" Gerard asked politely. I made them their lunch and they took it upstairs so they could play more video games. I just got on with the house work as normal. Well, it was normal until I heard a smashing noise. At first I was frightened, until I heard Frank's voice calling \"Everything's fine Mrs Way!\" Gerard's POV How dare he do that! He ate my sandwich for god's sake! Frank sat and laughed as I snarled like a wolf at the boy who had snatched my food. \"I'm going to break your neck Mikey!\" I growled playfully. I'd forgotten about the smashed picture frame until my brother cried out in pain and clenched his foot. There was a lot of blood coming from a deep wound, and there was a large shard of glass sticking out of it. \"MUM! MIKEY'S HURT!\" I screamed whilst looking for something to stop the bleeding. There was a dirty t-shirt next to my knee which I quickly wrapped around Mikey's foot. There was so much blood lost, he passed out, and we had to take him to hospital. I was on the back seat stroking my brother's head which was resting on my lap. Frank was in the front with my mother trying to calm her down. We reached the hospital in 10 minutes, and he had to go straight into the emergency room to have the glass removed. I was so scared for my little brother. I prayed to god that he would be okay, but I just burst into an endless sob. Frank ran over to me and hugged me reassuringly. I cried for hours, until the doctor came to deliver the news to the three of us...[Chapter 5] A/N I do not own Gerard, Frank, Mikey and Mrs Way, although I would like to Gerard's POV I cried on Frank's shoulder for at least an hour before I decided enough was enough. I marched up to the doctor who was sitting with my mother, and grabbed his shirt. \"When the fuck is my brother gonna get out of this shit hole?\" I screamed in his face, but looking at the tears spilling from my mum's eyes, I knew it wasn't going to be anytime soon. I let go of the doctor and dragged myself back to Frank. \"How's he doing then?\" he asked, kissing my cheek discretely as I sat down. I couldn't bare the stress. I took one last look at Frank's eyes, kissed him, that shot off to where my little brother was being treated. \"Hey! You can't be in here!\" a nurse yelled at me as I came to Mikey's bed. \"Fuck you, he's my brother!\" I clasped his hand in mine, and prayed for him to get better. Mikey's face was a lot paler than usual, and he couldn't say a word. I didn't want to be an only child! We had plans for a band already! He would be on bass; he was an amazing bassist, and I would sing. We even had a name; My Chemical Romance. We got it from our favourite book: 'Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance'. He couldn't die; we had so much to do. Mikey's eyes opened slowly, and he whispered the words \"Hello brother\". His vibrant smile beamed up at me, and I cried joyful tears that dropped onto his forehead. I'd never been so happy to see my little brother. I walked to mum and Frankie, who were sitting together and talking. \"Mum, Frank! He's okay!\" I smiled as I ran towards them and hugged them. \"He should be out by tomorrow\". My mum was thrilled, and so was I. Frank's POV The three of us were in the car driving back to my place, and we all had a smile on our face. Gerard's mum let him stay over at mine again tonight, which meant we had more time for fun. Of course, we were doing it for Mikey. He's so lucky sometimes, I think he's supernatural! But we were all glad that he was okay. As soon as Mrs Way pulled up outside my house, we leapt from the car. She was given a kiss from both Gee and me, which she chuckled at, and she drove away. \"Do you think she'll be okay dude?\" I asked Gerard. He nodded briefly before running at my door. I threw the key at the back of his head, and he let out a cute yelp before letting himself in and closing the door in my face. We were sat in the living room watching a film about some wannabe model named Gia. We were at a scene in which Angelina Jolie was completely naked, and of course, being a teenage boy, Gee had his hand down his pants and was rubbing rhythmically. I wasn't though. Girls just weren't my thing at all, but Gerard swung both ways. \"That film's got me in the mood\" he whispered, nibbling on my ear. That had got me in the mood, so I grabbed Gee's hand and pulled him upstairs enthusiastically. After all the drama of the day, I needed to relax. And I think Gee needed it more. I unzipped his jeans and whipped out his boner. I crouched so I was in line with his cock before slowly and gently licking his tip. My tongue moved down the full length of his penis and back which made him exhale deeply. As soon as I got back to the tip, I shoved the whole thing in my wide mouth and moved my head at a nice, calm pace. He obviously found this pleasurable, as he let out loud moans several times. As soon as the whole thing was covered in spit, I turned around and dropped my pants. Gerard's POV After receiving a wonderful blow job from Frank, he'd bent over and pulled down his skinny jeans and Marvel boxers. Seeing as though my dick was covered in his saliva, I stuck in his rear entrance, and he inhaled a sharp breath. Although it hurt him slightly, I knew he loved every single second of this. I thrust my hips backwards and forwards, gaining momentum every time. I almost made Frank fly into his TV at one point. Then it came. My orgasm was ready to explode in Frank's ass. \"FRANK! I'm gonna cum!\" I screamed through several pants for breath. With that exclamation, my cock was taken from his ass to just in front of his face, and I ejaculated all over him. After all the mess had been cleaned up, me and my lover had a long make out session, involving many ass grabs. I really was in love with him, and he was with me. I never wanted to let him go. Me and him together can face the world, and whatever it throws at us. Because Frank and Gerard on our own are useless. But together as Frerard, we're unstoppable![Chapter 6] A/N I do not own Gerard, Frank, Ray and Mikey, although I would like to Mikey's POV I was in the recreation room on my own reading a Kerrang! magazine when Frank and Gerard appeared in the doorway. I ran up to them and hugged them both tight for what seemed like an eternity. I was so pleased to see them, especially Gerard. And I was incredibly proud of myself for getting through this, but I couldn't have done it without my brother Gerard. \"How're you feeling bro?\" asked Gerard casually, punching me in the arm. I felt like shit inside, but I just really wanted to get home. \"I'm fine. How does my hair look?\" I smiled. Frank giggled quietly. \"You've just been through a life-threatening ordeal, and you're only bothered about your hair?\" My bass, my brother and my hair are the three main things in my life, and I won't go anywhere without it looking just how I like it. Once I had combed and styled my long black hair, me and the 2 'love birds' ran from the hospital to the park where we instantly started play fighting. Before long, Frank and Gerard were making out under a huge tree, leaving me to swing by myself. But I noticed a tall teenage boy with a small brown afro staring at me from behind dark retro sunglasses. The boy approached me and extended a welcoming hand. I shook it gently, and offered him the next swing. He sat down and began swinging back and forth in time with me. \"Ray Toro\" introduced the tall boy. His voice was calm yet strong. And boy was he hot! \"Mikey Way\" I responded, flattered he was even talking to me. I'm not used to random people just talking to me out of the blue. Ray soon picked up on my red hot cheeks. \"So, I guess you're pretty embarrassed about me talking to you?\" He nodded at my cheeks, which immediately burned up again. \"Not embarrassed. It's just, well it's not everyday a cute guy just starts talking to me having never met before...\" I didn't even mean to say that! The words just slipped out! But fortunately for me, he didn't mind at all. In fact, I think he enjoyed it, as he grabbed my hand and we swung together in the summer breeze. Gerard's POV As me and Frank sat talking underneath the oak tree, I stared over at my brother on the swings with some random guy. And they were holding hands! I didn't understand. He'd only just met this guy, and they were already holding hands on the swings as if they'd been madly in love with each other for years! They actually looked like me and Frank. \"So Mikey's got a boyfriend, big whoop. You should be happy for him; he's your little brother\" Frank tried to make me turn back, but I was content on finding out who this boy was. As soon as I got up close to them, they both turned and looked at me. The boy let go of Mikey's hand and stood up. I heard Mikey murmur something, then his 'boyfriend' sat back down on the swing, taking my brother's hand in his again. \"Gerard, this is Ray. Ray, this is Gerard: my brother\" Mikey introduced us both, and we shook hands. \"So this is your new boyfriend is it?\" me and Frank teased. Ray looked at Mikey and smiled. My question was answered with a brief nod from my brother, who then leaned over and kissed his new partner. \"Welcome to the family\" I smiled at Ray, and he laughed softly. The four of us went back to Frank's place and watched Star Wars together, me and Frank on the armchair and Mikey on the sofa while Ray led down with his head resting in Mikey's lap. By the time the film ended, we were all asleep and dreaming dreams of the four of us like this for the rest of our lives. But we should have dreamt about what would happen the next day.[Chapter 7] A/N I do not own Gerard, Mikey, Frank and Ray, although I would like to Ray's POV When I opened my eyes, I peered up to see Mikey still fast asleep with his head resting over the back of the sofa. I giggled at the sight, and rose to my feet. Walking to the kitchen, I tried the door to get the post, but it was locked. I didn't think much of it; I just sauntered to the kettle and began to make some coffee. The warm drink felt angelic as it trickled down my dry throat. I glided quietly to the living room, where I sat down in the antique armchair and turned on Star Wars. The previous night, we'd been watching it, but we fell asleep before we could witness the sad ending. It was only at the end of the film that I noticed something; Frank and Gerard weren't here. They'd slept in the same spot I was now sat in. I wondered where they'd gone, but I just pushed the thought to the back of my mind before I got too worried. The house seemed deadly quiet as I switched off the TV. Mikey let out a large exhale of breath in his slumber, and turned over. The only entertainment I had now was watching him sleep. Although after 5 minutes, I was bored again, so I decided to explore upstairs, where I found a polished electric guitar that almost looked brand new. My eyes peered down to the bottom, and I saw silver letters that spelt out the word 'Pansy'. Frank had told us all about his guitar on the way home, and about how his guitar skills and Gerard's vocals make a great combination. I'd briefly mentioned how I played guitar too, and Mikey commented on his bass guitar. \"Well, all we need now is a drummer\" Frank had said jokingly, and we all laughed. He had a point though, and I had a feeling that we would soon discover our musical talents put together made an excellent sound to listen to. My hands slid along the neck of the Gibson Les Paul as I slowly placed it on my lap. I thought back to a song I'd been working on, and began playing the intro, whilst whispering some lyrics I'd put with it. \"I've got a bulletproof heart; you've got a hollow point smile...\" My performance trailed off to a stop, and as I let the final chord ring, I heard clapping from behind me, and a sniff, as if someone was crying... I turned my head to see who had been observing while I strummed the beautiful guitar, praying to God it wasn't Frank; he'd kill me. Luckily, it was Mikey. He had tears in his eyes, which were smudging his eye liner, but he was smiling. \"That was beautiful, Ray\" he ran up to me as I placed Pansy back on her stand and wrapped his arms around my neck. At least someone appreciated my music, which is more than I can say about my whore of a mother. Gerard's POV Oh shit. This was bad. Oh holy fuck! Running, just keep on running. There was no time for stopping, or even for thinking. I just wanted to keep on running, and that's what I did, I just ran. Frank's house, I could get help there. Mikey knows first aid, he could fix Frank's ankle. No, he needed a professional. Balls to it! I ran as fast as I could to Frank's home, passing my own on the way. I hadn't even noticed the tears until my vision started to blur, but I could worry about that when I was inside. I burst through the door, almost knocking the door off its hinges. \"MIKEY! WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?\" I screamed into the empty living room. My feet banged loudly on the stairs as I pelted to Frank's bedroom. My brother and his partner stood in the center of the room, staring at the door. \"Come with me, I'll explain on the way\" I cried as I said this, but set off to the woods, closely followed by Ray and Mikey. I was walking faster and faster, down back alleys and forgotten trails, with the two younger ones lagging behind, panting for breath. I'd said I would explain, but I hadn't said a word for the whole 20 minute journey. Finally, I arrived at the top of the steep slope, peering over the edge. It was a good 45 seconds before anyone joined me by my side. Eventually, we were all at the slope, and staring into the nettles, but there was no Frank... Mikey and Ray stood over me, watching as I lay curled on the ground, crying over my missing Frank. Where the fuck was he? Disgusting thoughts crept their way into my mind. What if he was dead and his body had been dragged away by some wild animal. Or maybe some sick minded bastard had kidnapped him! Oh god! Oh please, god, no! More tears came flooding down my face; I couldn't bare the thought of a life without Frank Iero; my Frank Iero.[Chapter 8] A/N I do not own Gerard, Mikey, Frank and Ray... Yeah, you get the picture... Mikey's POV I couldn't, I wouldn't believe what was happening. There was no way in hell someone could fall down a hill and then just vanish, especially not on a broken ankle. Apparently, Frank had sent Gerard to get help after his accident, but when we got there, he was nowhere to be seen. Secretly, I was disheartened at the thought of Frank dead, almost as much as my brother. What was I thinking? Frank couldn't be dead! He's a fighter. At least I hope he is. The sound of my brother's wailing brought me out of my thinking world and back into our harsh reality. Frank had been missing for a month now, and Gee was still pretty miserable. I think he'd given up hope to be honest. \"I just can't believe he's gone! I miss him so much!\" he would cry into my chest, whilst I was comforting him like any brother would. He may think Frank was dead, but I had a feeling he was still his old self, only a bit dirtier. Staring down at my plate, I reluctantly ate dinner with Mum, Ray and Gerard. I felt his pain, but our mother couldn't see what her own son was going through. \"So, how's school everyone?\" my mother said sweetly, trying to make polite conversation. All she received was three murmurs, not even audible. I wasn't even sure what I'd say. But Mum then mentioned Frank to Gerard, and he shot out of the dining room with a flurry of tears. \"GEE! OPEN THE FREAKING DOOR!\" It was no use. There was no way he was coming out of that bathroom, and I knew exactly what he was doing. I had to stop him! He couldn't do this after what happened last time. I headed downstairs, but as I did so, I heard a knocking on the door. I say knocking; it was more of a scratching, as if a dog was trying to get in. I was scared. Gerard's POV Someone was at our front door. Great, that's all I needed. I'm having a fucking breakdown, and some dickhead salesman's probably talking to mum right now about whatever piece of shit he's trying to sell. I tried to put it out of my head, but I heard another knock knock knock at the bathroom door. \"Gee\" My brother whispered softly. \"I think you'd better come downstairs. Someone wants to see you\" \"Tell them to piss off!\" \"It's pretty urgent bro. Best not to keep them waiting\" As I unlocked the door, I was greeted by a warm hug from Mikey who had tear stains all down his cheeks. I wrapped my arms tight around him, before releasing and grabbing his hand. He gave me an encouraging smile before taking the first step down our stairs. On the ground, there were muddy footprints. I turned to face my visitor, and I stood silently, staring at the scene in my living room. A filthy black lump was lead on our cream sofa, leaving muddy stains on the soft material which my mother would undoubtedly make me clean up later. The clothes of the stranger were tattered and torn, like they'd been ripped down the side of a cliff. Their left foot was resting on a very comfortable pillow with an ice pack on top of it. All in all, the character was pretty unfamiliar. But when he looked up, and those eyes locked with mine and held my gaze... \"F-f-f\" I don't quite know what happened after that. It was all just a big blur. I woke up with a searing pain in the back of my neck though, so I guess I'd fainted. I looked to see if the stranger was still there, and sure enough, he was sat staring at me on the sofa. \"Frank?\" I knew it was definitely him by the cheeky grin he gave me. He was alive! Thank God! \"Where the fuck have you been, Frank? We were worried sick!\" I half yelled, half comforted him as I snuggled my body up to his. His skin was paler than usual and deathly cold. I'm sure he enjoyed my company as much as I enjoyed his. Shivering vigorously, he managed to put a shaky arm around me, and he pulled me closer. \"Frank\" I whispered. \"No offence, but you smell worse than Mikey's room. You need a wash\" I kissed his cheek, and helped him up to the bathroom.[Chapter 9] Frank's POV Gerard was practically carrying me up the stairs. I knew I smelt bad, but him throwing up definitely proved just how dirty I was. He sat me down on the toilet seat while he started filling the tub with hot, clean water. I began to remove my clothing, but stopped when Gerard turned around. \"Uh, Gee. You can watch me get undressed. We've done worse!\" I chuckled, and he quickly spun round and stared at me, a wide grin spreading across his face. Once I was down to my boxers, I stood up in front of Gerard – well only half stood up really – and winked at him. He knew exactly what I was thinking, and he complied as such with no urging. His knees cracked when they hit the hard, cold floor, but that was ignored as his attention was turned to my semi-erect cock, which was soon whipped out of my descending underwear and slotted into Gee's mouth. I moaned all the way through the dream-come-true situation. To my dismay, the boy at the end of my boner knew exactly when my climaxes were coming and stopped as I reached the ejaculate explosion. I looked down at him with puppy dog eyes and silently began demanding him to finish what he'd started. \"If you're a good boy in the bath\" he teased, \"I'll make you cum all over this fucking bathroom\" Gee smiled wickedly, and lowered me into the warm water. About halfway through my much needed wash, I drifted off to sleep. My dreams were full of water, and of course, Gerard Arthur Way. I was really enjoying my sleep too, which is more than I can say about the past few nights. Unfortunately, a stinging towel to the face awoke me from my slumber, and I almost drowned after the startle. I turned to see Gerard in hysterics and splashed water at him. \"Oh, you're so funny Gee!\" I smiled as I mocked him sarcastically. Ironic much? Gerard's POV After being brutally attacked by the one footed wonder, I helped him out of the soapy water, and kept him up as he began to dry. I was still giggling from the practical joke I'd used to wake him up because I was really that easy to entertain. I left the bathroom and went for some thinking time before Frank came back. I curled up into a ball on my bed and began to cry tears of happiness. I was so relieved that he was okay and with me again. There was an urgent knock on my bedroom door, and shouting; it was Frank. \"GEE! Open the fucking door!\" I sensed through his tone he had been there for some time while I'd fallen into a land of bliss and grace. My dreams had been torturing my sleep the past few days, but now they were back to images of Frank and I, and sometimes even Mikey. That's just how I liked them. I decided to let the howling puppy into my room after another two minutes of sweet daydreams. As soon as the hinges creaked towards me, Frank lunged at me and head butted my chest. I let out a yelp and we both laughed. Even if he was killing me, I was still in love with Frank Iero, and nothing's gonna get in the way of us. Not Mikey, not Ray, not even the homophobes at school. He's my Frank. I tried to concentrate on my drawing, desperately scribbling at least a half decent manga boy. I'd been contacted by Kamikaze Comics, and they wanted me to illustrate their most popular cartoon strip! Finally it was my chance to shine, but first I had to send them a sample. But if I got the job, that'd mean moving to Japan. Moving away from Mikey; moving away from Frank. Frank came in five minutes later crying. \"Frank! What's up baby?\" I rushed over to him and clutched his head into my chest. He flinched as my hand rubbed his arm. I then noticed a sticky red substance on my fingers. I rolled up his left sleeve and cringed at the horrific sight. 4 red marks lay on his pale skin, right above his veins. He pulled out the letter from the Kamikaze Comics owner. There were blood spatters all over it. \"How could you fucking leave me?\" Frank screamed as he repeatedly hit me in the gut. \"After everything we've been through!\" I held his arms as we cried together. How did he find out? \"Frank, I don't know if I'm going yet. I might not even get accepted. Please, calm down\" I whispered into his ear. I kissed his lips, but he pulled away and fled. I stood heartbroken in my room. I collapsed...[Chapter 10] A/N This is the final chapter in this fan fiction, but I'll probably write a new one some time before the end of May. Happy reading :') Gerard's POV I woke up at 1:00am and stared at the dimly lit lamp shade dangling from my ceiling through blurry eyes. My head was throbbing with pain, so I guessed I'd hit my head on the way down to the ground. I peered around my room, but there was no sign of Frank. I'd really fucked up this time. Great going Gee! I noticed a folded up piece of paper at the bottom of my bed which had my name on it. I knew it was from Frank by the way he wrote the G in my name. I missed him so much, even though he could have been just upstairs. I craved him. If I could just have his arms around me, I'd be happy. I unfolded the paper and read the words that lead me to the reality of things. Dear Gerard, I hope you're okay after your little ordeal last night. I've gone to stay with my Aunt in New York for the weekend, just so I can clear my head. I'll be back on Sunday at 7:00pm. Hopefully you won't have left for Japan by then. My aunt's number is on the back if you need me, but I doubt that. I love you forever and always Frank I scrunched the note into a ball and threw it across the room. My body curled up into a ball and I cried my heart out. I now had to decide whether to follow my dreams or keep Frank's alive. It was too much. I had to make my mind up soon, and then tell Frank when he got back. \"Gerard?\" I was drained of energy, so I didn't look up, but I knew it was Mikey at once. \"Are you okay?\" I heard the sound of paper being unfolded. Oh god. Now Mikey had found the letter. I knew now he'd tell mum, and then it'd be an utterly chaotic night in the Way household. Mikey's POV As my eyes skimmed the letter, I felt them welling up with tears. I couldn't lose my big brother! He's the only good thing I have left in this fuck of a world! \"Oh\" was all I could manage. I was completely destroyed by the news. \"Look, Mikey. I mi-\" I cut Gerard off by running out of the room. I went straight out of the door and ran to Frank's house. I got to the bungalow just as Frank was locking the door, and I collapsed at the end of the foot path. \"MIKEY! What the fuck are you doing here?\" He picked me up and laid me down in the back seat of his car. We set off back to my house and sat in the garden until Gerard came out. He stood still in the doorway and stared from me to Frank. He came and sat down with us, and we spoke about the matter at hand. It was now past midnight, and we'd reached the end of our conversation. \"So Gee\" Frank said as they finished hugging. \"What's happening with Japan?\" My eyes began to fill with tears again. We stood in the silence for a good 10 minutes before anyone said anything. It was Gerard who spoke. \"They accepted me. I'm leaving for Japan in 10 days\" ","Summary":" A/N This is my first Fan Fiction, so it may not be entirely great. I do not own Gerard or Frank, al"}]
