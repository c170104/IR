Author's Notes: For writers_choice , this is \"Echo.\" x-x-x-x-x The last day of Sanborn's tour was as scorching and sand-blown as any other. He spent it saying goodbye to the men in his unit, and running through enough prayers to rival the flowers in his grandma's church-hat that he wouldn't get called out for bomb duty one last time. He didn't need that jinx. Instead, he made it out safely, the transport riding over broken roads all the way to the airport, and the plane lifting off and soaring skyward through the long half hour to the demilitarized zone. Only then did he let the thought escape: I am never going back there again . When the last plane brought him home, he kneeled on the tarmac and kissed the ground. It was over, the whole deadly nightmare finally behind him. He'd survived—both the war and SSG William James. The first was luck. The second was some kind of goddamned miracle. Sanborn went back to the work of living. He got a job managing a Home Depot and met a girl named Shonelle while volunteering for his church. The girl was gentle and as pretty as her name, and she made Sanborn feel peaceful when the world got too loud. They were married in April and expecting by August, and it all felt so right . \"Are we ready for this, JT?\" Shonelle asked. \"It's happening so fast.\" \"This is everything I ever wanted,\" he said, and he meant it. His very own family, with first words and steps and new experiences around the corner, was exactly what he needed to be certain he was actually alive. He could gather them close and fill the emptiness left by all he'd seen and done to make the world a safer place. There were times he'd been afraid he might never have the chance. A year later, Sanborn got the news. He was bouncing his baby girl on his knee and listening to her laugh, thinking how foolish he'd been to get so worked up over the idea of a son. He'd never seen anything more wonderful than the sweet-smelling, chubby little girl right there in front of him, unless it was her Mama. \"The phone's for you, honey,\" Shonelle said. \"I don't recognize the voice…\" They went to the funeral, of course. A full day's drive and too much time to punish himself with questions like whether liking someone you didn't trust and were mad at most of the time still counted as friendship. He and James hadn't contacted each other but once after Sanborn went Stateside. He'd heard James had re-upped ( crazy motherfucker ), and now he was just glad the man had gone down on somebody else's watch. With James it was never if, only when , and Sanborn would never understand what drove him to be that way. It made him tired just thinking about it again. He wondered how it happened-whether James had even been wearing the protection suit—and whether there'd been anything left of him to ship home apart from the box he'd always kept under the bed. Eldridge wasn't at the funeral, but that was no surprise. It was just Sanborn and Shonelle, James' wife and family, and people James had probably known in high school. They all stood by the graveside with the sun beating down so hard that Sanborn could almost feel the scrape of sand at the back of his neck, like he was back in the desert just trying to make it to the other side of one more day. James' widow seemed more resigned than anything, and Sanborn realized James had abandoned her long before he died. With a beautiful wife and son waiting for him at home, James had still been too fucked-up to put their future first. Sanborn spoke to her afterward, offered whatever help she needed. He couldn't give her the comfort of kind remembrances, couldn't even tell her that Will James was the bravest man he'd ever known. Bravery on the battlefield would never make up for lacking the courage to come to terms with living as an ordinary man. On the long trip home, Sanborn drove with one hand on the wheel and the other wrapped around his wife's fingers, the touch of her skin keeping him tethered to the present. He'd never forget his time in Iraq, never silence the nightmares or lay the ghosts of fear and desperation to rest. But he'd already chosen to surround himself with what he wanted instead of what he couldn't change. He drove on through the night, Shonelle sleeping there beside him and a baby girl with her Mama's brown eyes waiting for him at home. He couldn't get there soon enough. - fin - ","Summary":" Title: Another Lifetime Gone Author: HalfshellVenus Characters: Sanborn, OFC ( Gen ) Rating: T(lang"},{"Movie":"Hurt Locker","Title":"From Heart To Heart","Author":"Firda Ulfia","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12811965","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Main : Lee Ayya Byun baekhyun Other : Chanyeol Park Heera Kim Jongdae Happy reading \"LEE AYYA!!!\" Teriak seorang pria yang baru saja datang dari arah gerbang pintu sekolah, wanita yang dipanggil namanya pun kini menengokkan kepalanya ketika mendengar namanya dipanggil. Saat menengok dan pria itu melambaikan tangannya. Wanita tersebut melengos begitu saja dan membalikkan wajahnya pertanda tidak perduli dengan pria tersebut. \"Aishhh…Lee A-yya!!!\" teriaknya kembali dengan berlari mendekati Lee Ayya kini lalu menangkap salah satu tangan Lee Ayya. \"Kau ini sedang apa? Lepaskan!\" ketus wanita bernama Lee Ayya tersebut dengan berhasil menghempaskan tangan pria tersebut. \"Lee A-yya, kau ini kenapa? Kau tau aku sakit! Kenapa kau tidak menjengukku?\" tanya pria tersebut dengan nada sedihnya. \"Benarkah?\" tak percaya Lee Ayya. Pria itupun menganggukan kepalanya. \"aku tidak percaya!\" Lee Ayya pun pergi meninggalkan Byun Baekhyun. \"Yakkk!!!\" kesalnya saat melihat Lee Ayya pergi. Saat pria itu menggerutu kesal \"Baekhyun!\" Pria itu menengokkan kepalanya saat namanya dipanggil \"Ohh, Chanyeol-ahh!\" serunya lalu memeluk temannya tersebut. \"kau ini kemana saja?\" tanya Chanyeol. \"aku sakit\" ucap Baekhyun. \"yahhh, jangan berbohong!\" Chanyeol menyerengitkan keningnya. \"uchh, kenapa kau tidak percaya? Apakah Lee Ayya mendoktrin-mu?\" kesal Baekhyun. \"Bodoh! Kau pasti bertengkar lagi kan dengannya?\" Baekhyun menganggukan kepalanya pertanda benar pertanyaan yang dilontarkan Chanyeol. \"aish, kenapa dia tidak percaya aku sakit?\" Baekhyun menghembuskan nafasnya. \"Yah! Kau ingat terakhir kali kau bilang sakit dan ada orang yang menelepon Lee Ayya karena kau masuk ruang ICU dan ternyata saat Lee Ayya tiba kau malah sedang bercanda gurau dengan suster-suster disana! Dan ingat itu bukan yang pertama dan kali ini dia tidak percaya karena kau sudah berulang kali melakukan seperti itu!\" jelas Chanyeol yang jalan lebih dulu dari Baekhyun. \"aku kan tidak ingin dia khawatir\" gumam Baekhyun kecil. \"Yahhh, sampai kapan kau mau disitu? Ayok!!\" ajak Chanyeol saat Baekhyun bergumam dengan dirinya sendiri. Byun Baekhyun POV Anyeong, Aku Baekhyun! Kalian lihat, bukan? Perlakuan teman dan pacarku. Hufttt, sebenarnya apa yang dikatakan Chanyeol ada benarnya karena ini adalah kesekian kalinya aku sakit dan \"Baekhyun, kau absen lagi? Apa alasanmu sekarang?\" tanya guru padaku. Aku hanya terkekeh lalu menjawab dengan santainya \"pak, aku sakit!\" ucapku dengan suara manis padanya. \"aishh, bilang saja jika kau bolos. Ini udah kesekian kalinya, Baekhyun! aigoo, kenapa Lee Ayya bisa menyukaimu?!\" ucapnya mencoba menyindirku. \"karena aku Tampan Manly!\" jawabku dan membuat seluruh orang tertawa kini, lalu aku menengok ke arah Lee Ayya. Lihat? Kini dia malah menggelengkan kepalanya. Sebenarnya aku tidak bohong, karena aku memang sakit! \"Lee Ayya, jangan marah lagi kumohon!\" Baekhyun kini sedang merayu Lee ayya saat kelas sudah kosong dan Lee Ayya serta dirinya berada diruang osis. Lee ayya adalah ketua osis disekolah ini sedangkan Baekhyun hanya anak biasa tanpa mengikuti klub atau apapun karena dia lebih sering membolos dibanding sekolah. Lee Ayya menghentikan aktifitasnya lalu menatap Baekhyun, senyuman terpancar diwajahnya kini \"jangan main-main dengan tubuhmu!\" ujar Lee Ayya tegas. \"aku tidak main-main. Aku benar-benar sakit!\" ucap Baekhyun. Lee ayya menghela nafasnya lalu menaruh kedua tangannya diPundak Baekhyun. \"jika kau memberitahu ku maka akan aku dengarkan! Jujur padaku, Kau bolos lagi?\" Lee ayya memperhatikan wajah Baekhyun dengan seksama. \"ne, mianhe\" Lee Ayya menghela nafasnya kembali. \"Kuharap ini yang terakhir kalinya\" ucap Lee Ayya lalu memeluk Baekhyun dengan erat dan mengecup bibir nya. \"ehnn, mianhe\" Aku selalu mengatakan yang sejujurnya tapi, dia selalu tidak tercaya. Dan akhirnya aku pun berbohong padahal aku benar-benar sedang sakit \"Baekhyun, bagaimana keadaanmu?\" tanya seorang suster pada Baekhyun yang sudah tidur manis di tempat tidurnya. \"aku bahagia, karena hari ini Lee Ayya mencium dan memeluk ku\" ceritanya pada suster tersebut. Park Heera. \"uchh, menyebalkan sekali ceritamu\" ucap Park Heera. Baekhyun malah tertawa kini \"hahha, suster Park lebih baik kau cari pria saja dari pada mengurusiku dan pasien-pasien lain\" \"ini pekerjaanku, lagi pula kau pasti akan menangis bila bukan aku yang mengurusmu?huh?!\" Baekhyun lalu memeluk suster tersebut. \"ehmm, hampir tujuh tahun kau bersamaku. Aku tidak akan lupa padamu saat disurga nanti nona Park Heera!\" tepat saat perkataan Baekhyun habis Heera menyentil jidat Baekhyun. \"aauuua Appo!\" ringisnya pada jidat yang baru saja di sentil. \"kau akan sembuh, jangan mengatakan yang aneh-aneh!\" Baekhyun pun menganggukan kembali kepalanya. Tok..tok…tok \"masuklah!\" Heera berjalan menuju kedalam ruangan tersebut, dan memberikan map berisikan laporang kondisi terakhir pasien yang ditanganinya. \"hanya Baekhyun?\" tanya dokter tersebut. Kim Jongdae. \"ne, dia pasien terakhir hari ini yang kuperiksa\" Jongdae memeriksa dengan seksama. \"bagiamana kondisinya?\" tanya Heera. Jongdae tersenyum tipis kini \"ehmm, kau tau? Seperti prediksi sebelumnya\" Heera mengangguk mengerti. Hari demi hari terlewat sampai pada suatu hari \"Dokter!!!!\" teriakan seorang ibu dari kamar Baekhyun membuat seluruh perawat mengerti pun berlari. \"OEMMA SAKIT!!!\" jerit Baekhyun sembari memegang kepalanya. Sang eomma hanya dapat menatap lemas dan tangis. \"sebentar ya..mianhe ini akan terasa sakit untukmu\" ucap Jongdae pada Baekhyun yang akan dimasukan jarum suntik. \"Aghhhh…APPO…AP-Po…hikss…hiks…\" \"Dokter..kumohon hentikan…ini sakit..sakit..dokter\" rengeknya pada Jongdae untuk menghentikan suntikan. \"setidaknya ini bisa menghentikan rasa sakitmu yang berlebih\" ucap Jongdae setelah menyelesaikan tugasnya. \"nyonya byun, ikut…\" \"Jongdae saem!\" Baekhyun memanggil dengan suara parau dengan setengah sadar. Membuat Jongdad menghentikan langkahnya untuk memandang Baekhyun. \"katakan saja disini\" Jongdae menatap Heera serta nyonya Byun. \"Katakanlah!\" Jongdae menghembuskan nafasnya kasar \"prediksi umurmu tidak akan lama\" ucap Jongdae pelan membuat nyonya Byun menangis kini. \"aishh, eomma kenapa kau menangis? Jongdae saem sedang bercanda lihat? Dulu saat aku berumur 15 tahun dia pernah berkata seperti itu namun hasilnya aku masih hidup sampai umur 19 tahun ini\" ucap Baekhyun santai. \"ne, mungkin aku salah!\" lanjut Jongdae. Melihat Baekhyun yang kini malah memeluk sang eomma. \"Lee A-yya!!!\" Baekhyun merangkul tangan Lee Ayya tiba-tiba saat baru saja datang. Awalnya Lee Ayya ingin menyingkirkan tangan Baekhyun namun niatnya tak jadi karena melihat wajah Baekhyun yang pucat \"kau sakit?\" \"aishh, kenapa kau malah mendoakanku sakit?\" decaknya kesal. \"aniya, wajahmu pucat. Gwencana?\" khawatir Lee Ayya dengan memegang dahi Baekhyun untuk memastikan dirinya tidak apa-apa. \"gwencana\" ujar Baekhyun melepas tangan Lee Ayya. Keduanya pun berjalan dengan bergandengan kini. \"Lee Ayya !\" Baekhyun memanggil Lee Ayya kembali saat istirahat tak tanggung-tanggung dirinya memeluk Lee Ayya dari belakang membuatnya menjadi ladang perhatian. \"Yakk, kau ini kenapa?\" kesal Lee Ayya. \"aku memelukmu\" polos Baekhyun menjawab. \"aku tau, tapi bukan disini tempat yang tepat\" jelas Lee Ayya pelan walau ada sedikit kesal dihatinya. \"lihat, semua orang melihat kita\" ucap Lee Ayya dengan nada sedikit lebih tinggi kini. Baekhyun pun melirikan matanya untuk melihat \"biarkan saja!\" celotehnya santai. \"Kajja, kita makan!\" Baekhyun malah mengajak Lee Ayya untuk makan tanpa perduli Lee Ayya marah atau tidak. \"A…A….A…A!!!\" seru Baekhyun mencoba menyuapi Lee Ayya. \"Ayolah, makan!!\" pintanya pada Lee Ayya seperti layaknya pada seorang anak kecil. \"SHIRO!\"ucap Lee Ayya. Baekhyun menatap kesal Lee Ayya \"ayo..nanti kau sakit\" pinta Baekhyun kembali. \"Jebal Lee Ayya\" Baekhyun meminta kembali dengan suara sedih. Sampai akhirnya Lee Ayya menyerah lalu memakan suapan Baekhyun. \"Aigooo, kenapa hari ini kau manja sekali. Byun Baekhyun!\" decak sindir Chanyeol yang ada disampingnya dan Lee Ayya. \"aku hanya rindu Lee Ayya\" \"aishh, maka-nya jangan sering bolos\" ucap Chanyeol. Kemudia Baekhyun memukul pelan Chanyeol ketika meledeknya. Saat bel pulang, Baekhyun tidak akan pernah pulang sebelum Lee Ayya selesai rapat dengan rekan-rekannya. Kini dirinya berada didalam kelas seperti sedang menulis sesuatu. 'clak' Tetesan darah kini mengotori kertas putih dimana dirinya sedang menulis kini. \"Ottokhe?\" bingungnya karena kertas tersebut ternoda. Namun kebingungannya terhenti sesaat dia merasakan sakit dikepalanya. \"Ahhghh…penyakit ini kenapa menyebalkan sekali\" decaknya kesal dalam kesakitan. Baekhyun mengelap hidungnya dengan sapu tangannya lalu mencoba berjalan menuju suatu tempat seperti mencari tempat aman untuk melampiaskan kesakitannya. Dengan jalan tergopoh-gopoh dirinya kini melangkah \"Baekhyun?\" Baekhyun menghentikan langkahnya ketika mendengar suara Lee Ayya. Dirinya kini berbalik berusaha sekuat tenaga melihat kearah Lee Ayya. \"Anyeong!\" ucapnya mencoba tersenyum manis didepan Lee Ayya. \"kau sedang apa?Bukankah kau bilang akan menunggu dikelas?\" tanya Lee Ayya. \"Lee Ayya!!\" dengan senyumannya memanggil Baekhyun lalu membentangkan tangannya. Lee Ayya menggelengkan kepalanya. \"kau mau aku memelukmu?\" Baekhyun tersenyum kembali dengan mengangguk pelan, Baekhyun tidak menampakan kesakitannya saat ini didepan Lee Ayya padahal tanganya sudah mengap sejak tadi dimana dirinya membebankan kedua tanganya itu sebagai peredang rasa sakitnya. Lee Ayya kini mendekat kearah Baekhyun karena dirinya tidak melangkah sejak tadi. Saat Lee Ayya memeluk Baekhyun, tanpa diketahuinya Baekhyun sudah meremas pakaian Lee Ayya dibelakang untuk menghilangkan rasa sakitnya \"Hei, dengar! Ini hanya kulakuan karena kau tersenyum manis tadi\" ucap Lee Ayya dengan memeluk erat Baekhyun. tanpa berkomentar Baekhyun hanya dapat mengeluarkan air matanya sedikit. \"jangan bolos lagi, pria jelek!\" ucap Lee Ayya yang masih dibalik pelukkan tersebut. \"lee..aa..yyaaa\" dengan terbata Baekhyun mencoba bicara. \"wae?\" \"aku tidak mau pulang\" ucapnya lancar seketika. Lee Ayya merengangkan pelukannya.\"egh?\" \"hehe, aku rindu sekolah\" ucapnya membuat Lee Ayya tertawa kini. \"kau mau menginap di sekolah?\" Baekhyun menganggukkan kepalanya. \"bwoyah?\" \"mau menemaniku?\" Lee Ayya mengacak rambut Baekhyun kini. Kini hari sudah memasuki malam, Baekhyun dan Lee Ayya berada di ruang osis dimana mereka memang lebih sering membuang waktu mereka disini. \"kenapa rasanya hari ini kau manja sekali\" tutur Lee Ayya karena kini Baekhyun masih dengan setia memeluknya erat . \"aku rindu kau\" ujar Baekhyun. \"uchh..\" \"ehmmm, Lee Ayya !\" panggil Baekhyun. \"jika nanti angin berhembus itu pertanda aku sedang menciummu \" \"lalu jika hujan turun disaat kau sedih, itu tandanya aku pun ikut sedih\" \"ehhhm dan jika banyak cahaya bintang dimalam hari itu tandannya aku sedang tersenyum melihatmu\" Lee Ayya menyerengitkan keningnya kini \"Yahh, kau belajar dari mana kata-kata seperti itu?huh?\" Baekhyun malah tersenyum. \"ehmm, aku membolos di perpustakaan beberapa hari lalu\" \"jeongmal?\" Baekhyun menganggukan kepalanya. \"Ayya-ahh…Ayya-ahh..Ayya-ahh…Yakk, LEE AYYA!!!\" Baekhyun tiba-tiba menyebutkan nama Lee Ayya berkali-kali hingga berteriak. \"bwoyah?\" \"aniya, aku hanya ingin memanggilmu\" Lee Ayya kini menatap Baekhyun. \"kau aneh\" \"biar saja\" santainya membalas. \"cium aku\" ucap Baekhyun dengan sudah menutup matanya. \"aigoo, sebenarnya ada apa denganmu?\" \"Yahhh, Palli!\" ucap Baekhyun dan Lee Ayya kini menempelkan bibirnya pada Baekhyun lama sangatlah lama. Hingga mereka kini tertidur dengan Baekhyun menaruhkan kepalanya di dada Lee Ayya dengan diselimuti Lee Ayya oleh jas sekolah yang dikenakannya. Baekhyun sekarang membuka matanya dan melihat Lee Ayya yang masih tertidur dengan telatennya dia melihat lekuk wajah Lee Ayya. \"aku akan merindukanmu\" ucap Baekhyun dengan parau. \"sangat merindukanmu\" \"Saranghae\" Baekhyun mencium bibir Lee Ayya namun seperti nya Lee Ayya yang tertidur amatlah lelap membuatnya tidak terbangun. Hingga pagi pun datang dan dirinya terbangun kini \"Baekhyun?\" bingungnya saat Baekhyun sudah tidak ada disampingnya. Lee Ayya mencoba tenang dan berpikir jika Baelhyun sedang pergi ke toilet. Namun hingga bel masuk \"Kau lihat Baekhyun?\" Lee Ayya mulai panik kini. \"Chanyeol, kau lihat Baekhyun?\" tanyanya. \"aniya, aku tidak melihatnya dari saat aku datang!\" jawab Chanyeol. \"Lee Ayya!\" Lee Ayya menengokkan kepalanya saat seseorang memanggilnya. \"aku menemukan ini tadi saat menyapu sepertinya ini terbang dari meja Baekhyun\" seseorang memberi Lee Ayya secarik kertas. Lee Ayya, tidurmu pulas sekali! Aku pergi ya! Ehhmm, nanti siang temui aku dirumah Baekhyun. Lee Ayya mencoba menelepon Baekhyun kini \"kenapa dia membolos lagi\" decaknya kesal. namun nihil Baekhyun tidak mengangkat teleponnya sama sekali hingga dirinya menyerah saat bel masuk kini berbunyi. Saat bel pulang mulai berbunyi Lee Ayya langsung pergi dari kelasnya dan dengan cepat menuju rumah Baekhyun, entah ada apa dengannya yang dia inginkan hari ini adalah ia ingin menemui Baekhyun dan ingin memeluknya erat. Langkah kaki Lee Ayya terhenti ketika rumah Baekhyun terlihat sepi. \"Apakah Baekhyun ada?\" tanya Lee Ayya pada penjaga rumah itu. Namun senyuman paksa datang dari penjaga rumah tersebut dan memberikan Lee Ayya secarik kertas lagi. Ayya-ahh, appo sungguh appo Aku berada dirumah sakit sekarang Jeongmal Appo Lee Ayya kembali mengambil handphonenya untuk menelepon Baekhyun, sebenarnya ini sudah ke seratus kalinya Lee Ayya menelepon Baekhyun pada hari ini namun hasilnya nihil. Dengan cepat Lee Ayya menuju rumah sakit yang sering digunakan keluarga Baekhyun jika sakit. \"aku mencari pasien bernama Byun Baekhyun!\" ucap Lee Ayya khawatir. \"kau Lee Ayya?\" Lee Ayya menengokkan kepalanya saat seseorang dari belakang menyebut namanya. Park Heera \"ne, neo?\" \"ingin bertemu Baekhyun?\" tanya Heera. Lee Ayya pun mengangguk. Lee Ayya POV Aku mengikuti langkah kaki perawat ini. Namun ada yang aneh dengan perasaanku kini langkahku terasa amatlah berat dan tak ingin menuju tempat Baekhyun yang dikomandoi oleh suster ini. Entah kenapa semuanya menjadi aneh tiba-tiba saat dia malah mengantarku ke suatu tempat yang mana hanya orang-orang tertentu yang bisa menempati tempat tersebut yakni untuk orang-orang yang telah tiada. \"masuklah, Lee Ayya didalam\" ucapnya dengan lemah. Aku pun melangkah masuk sesuai perintahnya \"Baekhyun?\" kaki ini bergetar hebat hingga membuat tubuh ini terjatuh. 'bruk!' \"ini bohong kan?\" pelanku tak percaya. \"Suster, kau jangan main-main!!!\" kesalku melihat suster yang baru saja mengantarku. Air mataku datang dengan lancarnya kini. Dengan lancang air mata itu keluar. Setelah kulihat wajahnya lah yang terbingkai amat tampannya dengan bunga-bunga cantik dibelakangnya. \"Lee Ayya, Baekhyun pergi pagi tadi\" ucap suster tersebut. Semuanya terasa aneh kini. Inikah maksud ke anehanmu? Inikah? Wae? Lee Ayya, ahh rasanya aku ingin mengatakannya bukan menulisnya. Lee Ayya, aku benar-benar sakit, sakit teramat sakit dari tujuh tahun lalu dokter memvonisku mengidap kanker otak stadium akhir. Aku tidak pernah membolos!!! Benar, aku hanya berada di rumah sakit untuk menyembuhkan penyakit ini! Jangan marah ya? Aku tidak membolos hanya sakit Ayya-ahh, kau percaya kan sekarang jika aku tidak berbohong? Hehe Bagaimana menurutmu aktingku selama ini, menutupi penyakitku darimu dan teman-teman lain. Aku hebat bukan? Kumohon jangan menghukumku, aku hanya tidak ingin kau khawtir dan sakit. Ayya-ahh, ingat angin? Ayya-ahh, ingat hujan? Ayya-ahh, ingat bintang? Ingatlah aku walau hanya dalam kenangan kecilmu. Mulai dari sekarang aku akan membolos untuk selamanya. Saranghae Note : mianhe, kertas ini kotor karena darah dari hidung ini Lee Ayya meremukan kertas tersebut dan menangis sejadi-jadinya kini karena kebodohannya selama ini. \"Pabo..aku terlihat bodoh bukan sekarang?\" \"kau benar-benar pandai berakting!\" \"jadi saat pelukan itu kau diam kau merasakan sakit teramat sakit?\" \"Jawab aku!\" Lee Ayya berbicara pada batu nisan Baekhyun kini. \"Kumohon jawab aku!!!\" \"panggil namaku… Palli…Palli!!!\" \"aku tak butuh tulisan dengan noda kotor itu, aku butuh dirimu sekarang!!! PALLI SEBUT NAMAKU!!!!\" \"Ayya-ahh….Ayya-ahh,...Ayya-ahhh. LEE AYYA!!!!\" Lee Ayya memanggil namanya sendiri dengan mengikuti cara Baekhyun memanggilnya disaat terakhir kalinya. \"Bangunlah, Jebal!\" pinta Lee Ayya yang terduduk memohon pada nisan Baekhyun kini. \"panggil namaku, Ayya-ahh…Ayya-ahh..Ayya-ahh…BAEKHYUN-ahh, bangun!!!\" teriaknya tak terima. Air hujan kini terjatuh, Lee Ayya mendongakkan kepalanya keatas \"apakah kau menangis?\" tanyanya pada langit dengan air mata yang tidak henti-hentinya menangis. Baiklah aku akan berhenti menangis sekarang, Jebal jagalah dirimu baik-baik disana, aku akan menyusulmu, Aku akan berdoa pada tuhan agar ia selalu menyayangimu. Karna sekarang kau lebih dekat dengan nya. Nama mu bukan hanya saja terukir dibatu nisaan ini, Tapi nama mu akan selalu terukir dihati ini, Terima kasih atas pelukan hangat terakhirmu. Aku mencintaimu, Tetaplah menjadi Angin, Hujan, dan bintang, Karna darisanalah aku bisa merasakan kehadiranmu.

He's survived ten missions with this psycho, and any one of them could've been the last. This one, maybe. Will James thinks he's invincible, and every bomb-threat deployment brings them one step closer to finding out he's not. Will James can still pretend there's no possibility of failure, because he didn't have to pack up his commander—his friend —and send what was left of him home in a government-issue box. Sanborn did. It still hurts, two months later, and the whole sequence replays itself endlessly: the stalled robot, Sanborn and Eldridge sealing Thompson in the suit, Thompson going into danger-range to free the robot, and then the earth and sky exploding all around them. Sanborn knows the risks, the cost to everyone if the mission goes sour, and yet he has to stand there and watch Will James throw sense and protocol out the window exactly when the situation demands them most. Hell, half the time the motherfucker takes off the protective suit. He's going to get himself killed, no doubt. Problem is, he might take Sanborn and Eldridge along with him. The bastard's good with bombs, maybe even the best yet. He's got some kind of feel for them, some superhuman instinct for where they are and whether there are more he hasn't found. That seven-bomb cluster three weeks back… they were lucky, unbelievably lucky. James didn't quit after finding the first series of wires (even though it had already taken too damn long), and he didn't set off any of the bombs in that grouping. Three square blocks, Sanborn figures, would've been the minimum. Nothing but bodies and debris after an explosion of that size. Sweat trickles into Sanborn's eye in the unrelenting heat as he scans the perimeter while trying to tether James back to the team before he goes loose cannon again. James is approaching the suspicious vehicle. \"Do not open the door,\" Sanborn commands, only to see James reach out his hand. \"Do you copy? Respond!\" he barks, for all the good it does. He braces himself as James opens the door anyway and slides into the passenger seat, and why the fuck do they even bother calling this a team? James doesn't listen to him and they can't help him, other than monitoring the area. Any sharp-shooting soldier could do that, without wasting all the special bomb-squad training Sanborn worked so hard to learn. The next five minutes stagger by slowly, every nerve in Sanborn's body alert and messaging home constantly as he surveys windows, doorways, the edges of alleys and the roof-lines above. Then James gives the \"all clear\" signal, and they cover him while he makes his way back to the jeep. Sanborn can't help noticing how relaxed the Sergeant seems, cucumber-cool apart from the smile, while Sanborn himself fights to stay focused as they pack up and leave the area, always watching for snipers or other danger along the way. They get drunk later, back at the barracks. Sanborn and the Sergeant take shots at each other like last time, testing something that might be anger or revenge, or some twisted kind of friendship that has its roots in disregard and distrust. It's fucked-up, no matter how you look at it, but all of them are laughing in the end. It makes no more sense than any other damn thing that goes on in wartime, that's for sure. Months go by, and all three of them are still alive by grace or miracle. Sanborn's no closer to understanding James or his dumbass antics, and he never will be. He's no more comfortable with the risks either, no surprise there, because only a fool would ignore them. He'll never be that stupid. It's when they find the abandoned body of the boy—packed with enough C-4 to take out the surrounding buildings—that something finally changes. James stays behind so long that they almost go back to get him, and he doesn't set the body to blow like he's supposed to. Instead, he staggers out into the sun with the dead child in his arms like a precious burden. What for? Sanborn wonders, because it's too late to do anything that matters. They're on damage-control here and the clock is ticking, and this isn't the first child to die in this godforsaken war. Then he unravels the look on James' face, something vulnerable and fleeting. Will James might think he's invincible—probably still does, and maybe always will. But today he finally realized that other people are terribly, heartbreakingly mortal. - fin - ","Summary":" Title: Lethal Games Author: HalfshellVenus Characters: JT Sanborn, Will James ( Gen, Drama ) Rating"},{"Movie":"Hurt Locker","Title":"Rough Hands","Author":"SparkeyScene","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7418938","Passage":"[Chapter 1] She didn't know what it was; maybe it was his eyes, blue as cobalt and ten fathoms deep. Maybe it was his manner, carefree and wild as he roamed without fear of reprisals. Maybe it was his commitment, the way he followed his military life with unerring loyalty, never faltering, never unsure. Maybe it was the set of his jaw, softly squared and strong. Maybe it was his dangerous profession, she had always liked a bad boy and it seemed he was one of the worst. Maybe it was how sentimental he could be, keeping parts from jobs under his bed to remind him that he could have died many times in the past. Maybe it was the way he cared for her, the way he taught her to look after herself in the field. Maybe it was his hands, soft and capable as they sifted through wires and metal to find the small detonator. Yes, that was it. It was his hands, and the way they would guide hers through the mess of electrical tape to find her goal. The way they used to stroke her forearms gently, a ghost of a touch, as if hoping she wouldn't notice. The hands that had patched her wounds, cut her hair, saved her life. The tools that, with the right person, could change the world. Or atleast the life of a scared little GI Jane who had never seen a second of combat before she landed in Delta Squad. She found herself remembering his touch; recalling the way it felt whenever his hand landed on hers by accident, the way her heart would pound when they stacked up and his chest pressed tight into her back, the way he made her feel. He made her feel alive. But he loved only one thing, and she knew that to be by his side she would have to do that thing with him. Maybe that would earn her a place in his heart. Her little Jack-in-a-Box, with his illogical feelings and his irrational desire to put himself in harms way. Who knew she could fall so deeply in love. So deeply in love that it did not matter whether he was her squad leader, that it did not matter if he was five years older than her nineteen years, that it did not matter if she died by his side. \"James?\" \"Yeah.\" He looked up from the dead man switch he had acquired at the UN building in Iraq, his strong fingers curling around the black plastic and coloured wire covering. \"What would you do if you were about to die?\" It was a curious question, possibly not curious enough to warrant the overly strange answer. \"I'd touch the sky and think of you, Sergeant Scott.\" ","Summary":" She didn't know what it was; maybe it was his eyes, blue as cobalt and ten fathoms deep.

Mais, que je n'avais pas pu la finaliser jusqu'ici, en raison de toutes autres occupations, dont l'écriture de fanfics sur la série NCIS Los Angeles. Mais ayant temporairement perdu tous mes fichiers informatiques, je me suis trouvée ce week-end complètement bloquée sur mes textes en cours. Aussi en ai-je profité pour la reprendre et terminer ^-^ Maintenant, parce que dans le film, la réponse du sergent-chef William James pour décrire son ex-femme qu'il qualifie de « fidèle & loyale » m'a interloqué. J'avais donc voulu développer cette idée en l'illustrant sous la forme d'un petit texte (sans beaucoup d'intérêt, disons le bien ^_^''). D'autant que les trop rares scènes avec Connie James nous la montrent souriante et jamais agressive envers Will. De quoi me conforter dans l'idée qu'elle n'est pas une harpie qui ne comprend pas la passion d'un soldat shooté à l'adrénaline. Mais juste une femme compréhensive et aimante pour le père de son enfant. Un peu à l'image de deux jolies photos dénichées sur ce film, affichant plein de complicité entre William et sa femme - reflet de deux scènes pourtant absentes du film (suite au montage, j'imagine). En espérant que si d'aventure un francophone venait à lire ces lignes, cette vision personnelle ne lui semblera pas trop sortie de nulle part. . Fidèle & Loyale . Posant un pied sur le tarmac de l'aéroport militaire du Missouri, le sergent en chef William James soupira lourdement. Il venait tout juste de finir sa mission en Irak. Et maintenant ? Ce retour au pays ne l'enthousiasmait pas une seconde. Mais ce n'est pas comme s'il avait le choix. Même à l'armée, dorénavant, on imposait des congés. Aussi, se devait-il de patienter un minimum de trois mois - période imposée d'un retour à la vie civile - avant de pouvoir s'engager dans une nouvelle rotation. Restait pour lui, de trouver un pied-à-terre où se poser durant ce laps de temps. Aux dernières nouvelles, sa maison était toujours habitée par son ex-femme. S'ils avaient continué à vivre ensemble, malgré leur divorce, les quelques mois précédents son départ. Il ne savait pas trop à quoi s'attendre à présent. Dans les faits, il se demandait déjà s'il n'avait pas tout simplement perdu sa demeure, suite au jugement de divorce. Pas comme s'il avait beaucoup lu les papiers qu'on lui avait présentés, à cette époque. Tout s'était passé, peu avant son départ pour l'Irak. Aussi pouvait-il comprendre l'envie de Connie à reprendre sa liberté en le sachant partir pour une contrée d'où beaucoup n'en revenaient pas vivants. Bien qu'il ne sache toujours pas quoi en penser. Tout simplement, parce qu'il avait envie de revoir son fils, c'est finalement à son adresse officielle qu'il se rendit en premier lieu. Se faisant déposer par un taxi, il sortit du coffre son paquetage avant d'avancer vers l'entrée de sa petite bicoque. Ce n'était pas une belle maison de plusieurs étages. Juste un petit quelque chose qui leur appartenait et qu'il avait pu payer comptant avec sa solde de démineur obtenue de ses précédentes missions en Afghanistan. Au moins l'une des rares choses qu'il n'avait pas loupées dans sa vie. Il n'avait pas encore atteint la porte bleue que cette dernière s'ouvrait d'elle-même. De quoi répondre à sa première interrogation : Connie vivait toujours là. Espérant qu'elle le laisserait voir son fils, il rompit rapidement le silence d'un mot quand il se trouva enfin face à elle. - Salut. - Salut. Au moins lui avait-elle répondu sans crier. A priori, calme, pour ne pas dire étrangement sereine, elle lui offrit même un sourire empreint de douceur, tout en se décalant suffisamment pour lui permettre d'entrer. - Je pensais que tu passerais un peu plus tard dans la journée. - Comment… ? - L'administration militaire prévient les proches du retour de chaque soldat. Simplement, je n'imaginais pas que tu souhaiterais passer ici en premier. - Je peux revenir plus tard, si je dérange. - Oui. Je veux dire : Non ! Tu ne déranges pas. C'est très bien. Juste, le petit ne va pas tarder à s'endormir. C'est l'heure de sa sieste. - Oh... Je peux quand même le voir ? Juste un instant ? - Bien sûr ! Le poussant à entrer dans le salon, Connie s'éclipsa aussitôt dans la chambre d'enfant y sauver un petit monstre toujours désireux de s'évader de ses barreaux. Quand elle le voyait aussi décidé à fuir son lieu de veille, elle avait le pressentiment qu'il serait aussi casse-cou que son père. Le prenant dans ses bras, c'est heureuse que ledit géniteur ait exprimé de lui-même l'envie de voir son fils aussi vite qu'elle lui apporta. - Regarde qui est là, mon cœur. C'est papa ! Prenant avec précaution son petit, William sentit son cœur battre à tout rompre à sa simple vue. Il avait tellement grandi depuis son départ. S'asseyant pour mieux le tenir devant lui, il sourit naturellement aux risettes offertes par ce petit bonhomme. Il n'était peut-être pas le père le plus présent au monde. Mais il l'aimait réellement de tout son cœur. Aussi le tient-il avec grande attention et affection, heureux de sentir son enfant venir se blottir contre son torse. Relevant un instant ses yeux, il ne vit pas Connie autour d'eux. La preuve qu'elle lui faisait encore suffisamment confiance pour ne pas faire tomber le fruit de leur passion. Laissant retomber la tension qui habitait son corps depuis son arrivée sur le sol américain, William ne prit pas conscience de tomber doucement dans le sommeil, miroir exact de l'assoupissement de son fils. Les observant de loin, émue du tableau affiché, la jeune femme les rejoint finalement, décidée à pousser le soldat en une position plus confortable. Mais à peine l'eut-elle touché, qu'il sursautait vivement, serrant plus près de lui son fils dans une crainte inconsciente qu'il s'échappe de son étreinte. - Chutttt… - Non… Laisse-le-moi encore, rien qu'une minute. - Il ne te quitte pas. Juste, ôte tes chaussures et essaie de t'allonger. Vous serez plus confortables ainsi. La laissant le guider, il reposa sa tête lourde sur un épais oreiller, sentant avec bonheur le poids de son bébé sur le torse, ce dernier se blottissant naturellement toujours plus contre lui. Soupirant d'aise, il se laissa tomber dans le sommeil, inconscient bien plus tard du fait que son petit lui soit finalement retiré. THE HURT LOCKER C'est d'un second sursaut que William James sortit finalement d'un sommeil étonnement réparateur. Au vu de l'absence de toute lumière en provenance des fenêtres, il n'y avait aucun doute quant à l'heure avancée. Il n'avait pas réalisé être aussi épuisé par son voyage en avion cargo. Se redressant non sans mal des profondeurs d'un canapé trop confortable pour son bien, l'homme vit venir à lui sa femme… enfin… ex-femme pour être précis. - Bien dormi ? - Comme un bébé. - Tu ne sais pas si bien dire. Souriant à sa mine déconfite, Connie lui tendit une bière fraîche, qu'il prit avec reconnaissance. En buvant de longues goulées, il se releva tout en se grattant la nuque de gêne. Qu'est-ce qu'il devait faire maintenant ? Alors qu'il se posait la question, il la vit à présent, s'asseoir dans un fauteuil pour y donner le biberon à leur fils. À l'évidence, le petit était affamé. - Prêt pour le diner ? Ou tu préfères prendre une douche avant ? - Je peux ? - Quelle question. Bien sûr. Tout est dans le four, ça ne risque pas de refroidir. Je t'ai posé des vêtements à toi dans la salle de bain. - Pourquoi ? - J'ai un peu changé le rangement des placards depuis ton départ. Alors, c'était pour t'éviter de devoir chercher partout. Ça… Il se doutait bien que si elle vivait toujours ici, ses affaires avaient dû migrer dans quelques cartons stockés dans le garage. C'était déjà surprenant qu'elle n'ait pas juste tout balancé aux ordures ou donné à la paroisse locale pour les plus pauvres. Mais lui se questionnait sur la raison de son accueil si bienveillant. Quelque peu démuni par tant de naturelle, il ne chercha pas plus à la comprendre. Acceptant plus simplement ce qui lui était offert. - Merci. Je n'en ai pas pour longtemps. Elle se contenta de hocher de la tête, tandis qu'il partait à l'étage, sa bouteille de bière toujours en main. La douche chaude lui fit un bien fou. Ne pas être limité aux 3min chrono des douches militaires était un luxe qu'il appréciait. Même si avec la chaleur du désert, c'était plutôt l'absence d'eau froide qui frustrait tous les soldats sur le terrain. Habillé de vêtements souples et confortables qu'il avait toujours apprécié porter dans le confort de cette demeure, il rejoint Connie dans la cuisine où elle terminait de servir les deux assiettes présentes sur la table. Ça sentait bon. - Merci. lui chuchota-t-elle dans un sourire. À l'évidence, sa pensée avait été exprimée oralement. - Assieds-toi. Ils mangèrent alors calmement, presque en silence. Mais cela n'avait rien de pesant. Déjà au début de leur rencontre, ils n'avaient jamais été de grands bavards. S'appréciant justement pour le calme de leur rapport. Ils finissaient finalement le dessert, une sorte de gâteau au chocolat, affalés sur le canapé devant une émission de deuxième partie de soirée à la télévision, quand il se dit qu'il était sans doute temps pour lui de dégager. Mais il était tard et malgré sa sieste, il n'était pas passionné à l'idée de devoir chercher une chambre d'hôtel à cette heure tardive de la nuit. - Je peux rester dormir sur le canapé, pour cette nuit ? - Très sincèrement, j'aurais espéré que non. Voilà. C'était dit. Elle le voulait dehors. N'ayant aucune volonté à s'imposer, il se leva donc pour aller chercher son sac. Mais il n'eut pas le temps de faire un pas, que Connie lui prenait déjà la main pour l'attirer à elle, clairement inconsciente de son intention première à quitter cette demeure. Se laissant faire, ne sachant plus trop quoi penser, au vu de son comportement en incohérence totale avec ses paroles. C'est non sans surprise qu'il découvrit qu'elle l'entraînait très clairement dans sa chambre. Se tournant finalement vers lui, elle l'embrassa alors tout doucement sur le coin des lèvres. - Je passe à la salle de bain et j'arrive. Ok. Sans être un génie, elle le voulait clairement dans son lit, là. Non ? Dans l'attente de son retour, il fit un pas vers la chambre voisine, voyant son petit plongé dans un profond sommeil. Posant une main ferme sur le ventre du bébé, le rythme lent et stable de sa respiration eut le don de le calmer. Quand il l'entendit revenir vers lui, au bruit de pas sur la moquette, William ne put garder plus longuement pour lui ce qu'il pensait de ce petit être de chair. - Il est beau. - Magnifique. eut-elle pour seule réponse. S'approchant, Connie l'enlaça aussitôt pour nicher son visage dans le creux de son cou. - Tu nous as manqué. - Je… au risque de casser l'ambiance, je ne comprends pas trop. - Quoi ? - Ta réaction. - Tu trouves surprenant que je souhaite que mon enfant puisse voir son père ? - Un peu. Mais ce n'est pas vraiment de ça que je parle. Aux dernières nouvelles, on n'est pas censé être divorcés ? - Si. - C'était juste pour être sûr. - Idiot. S'il n'y comprenait rien, le fait est que Connie était toujours une femme attirante qu'il avait aimée sincèrement et que – s'il était honnête avec lui-même – il aimait encore infiniment. C'est elle qui avait demandé le divorce. Pas lui. Aussi, après des mois de vie entouré de GI, isolé en plein désert, un peu de douceur, pour ne pas dire, une bonne nuit de sexe, n'était pas pour lui déplaire. Alors, la suivant à nouveau, c'est sans plus de surprise qu'il entra dans la chambre à coucher. N'ayant plus de doute quant aux attentes de la femme qu'il aimait, William n'eut aucun mal à prendre enfin la commande. L'attirant à lui, d'une main autour de la taille, il commença par l'embrasser comme il en avait eu le désir inhibé, depuis son retour dans cette demeure. Un baiser passionnel et dévorant qui les fit gémir tous deux aux sentiments de bien-être que cela généra en eux. Dieu qu'elle lui avait aussi manqué. Sa douceur, le goût sucré de sa peau, son odeur... si loin du lait de bébé. Il avait surtout tant oublié cette tendresse qu'elle lui retournait si naturellement. Oh oui, elle lui avait terriblement manqué. La poussant tout doucement jusqu'à son lit, William ne put retenir son rire, quand elle changea brièvement leur place pour le jeter littéralement sur sa couche. Définitivement, une femme selon son cœur, qui savait parfaitement ce qu'elle voulait de lui. Bien peu contrariant en la matière, il l'attira sans attendre à lui, pour à son tour inverser leur position et la coincer sous son corps pressant. Satisfait de son œuvre, il plongea ses yeux bleus dans ceux noisette de sa compagne. - Alors ? - Alors ? lui répondit-elle en écho. Tous deux amusés que l'autre ne cède pas le premier, l'un et l'autre se rapprochèrent finalement pour échanger un second baiser, plus emprunt de langueur, de lenteur et tout simplement d'une sensualité partagé… Alors très vite, les vêtements volèrent de part et d'autre de la pièce, sous parfois quelques ricanements bébêtes dus à la gaucherie de leur empressement. Et enfin, l'homme dont la patience infinie était habituellement chaque jour mise à contribution face aux bombes qu'il déminait usa de tous ses dons pour prendre le temps de reconquérir le corps tendre de sa femme… de l'aimer tout simplement. THE HURT LOCKER Le soleil était levé depuis quelques heures déjà quand Connie observa avec affection l'homme endormi à ses côtés. Allongé sur le ventre, le corps détendu… Il semblait serein, et toujours terriblement séduisant à peine couvert d'un drap fin. Aux bruits provenant de la chambre, elle se détacha doucement de sa prise - simple bras couvrant sa taille. Puis, se leva sans brusquerie pour aller préparer le biberon du matin et revenir dans la chambre, son fils et sa pitance matinale avec elle. C'est ainsi que William se réveilla. Le visage enfoui dans un oreiller moelleux, il ouvrit ses paupières lourdes d'un trop long sommeil pour voir femme et enfant reposer à ses côtés. Se relevant juste un peu, il caressa les cheveux courts et si soyeux de son fils. - Tu veux lui donner ? - Je… suis pas sûr. - Moi, je ne doute pas que tu t'en sortiras comme un chef. C'est ainsi qu'il finit à son tour par nourrir ce petit être affamé qui ne le quitta pas des yeux le temps complet de sa tété. Suite à quoi, Connie lui proposa de l'accompagner faire des courses. - Ouais… Pourquoi pas. Après tout, ça ne lui ferait certainement pas de mal de sortir un peu pour revoir ses concitoyens. D'autant plus que les psys qu'on les forçait à voir avant leur retour à la vie civile ne cessaient jamais de leur rebattre les oreilles du besoin de retrouver au plus vite une interaction saine avec tout à chacun. Alors pourquoi pas… Il pourrait toujours en profiter pour trouver un petit quelque chose à offrir à son fils, ayant bien conscience d'avoir certainement oublié un anniversaire ou un Noël au cours de son absence… Si lui ne portait aucun soin à ce genre de chose, et qu'il supposait le petit qui l'observait toujours avec ses yeux grands ouverts, encore trop petit pour s'en soucier. Il ne doutait pas que Connie verrait en cette action une preuve concrète de son attachement sincère pour leur enfant. Aussi oui, l'accompagnerait-il, bien qu'il n'en ait pour autant aucune envie. THE HURT LOCKER Cette première journée de son retour à la vie civile s'était ainsi passée tranquillement, presque silencieusement, entre lui, Connie et son petit bout de chou. Et puis une seconde nuit avait pris sa suite, pour débuter une semaine, puis deux, et trois, pour finalement clore un premier long mois… Le temps passant, le rythme lent et récurrent avaient repris ses droits. Une vie fait de menus travaux au sein de leur maison, pour maintenir cette dernière en bon état pour mieux lui permettre d'affronter ses futures absences. Une vie aussi essentiellement composée d'un retour au travail - certes physique, mais terriblement calme au sein des eaux et forêts - incapable qu'il était de rester à ne rien faire plus de quelques journées entre deux rotations. Seules ses soirées et nuits en compagnie de Connie et tous ces instants partagés avec son fils avaient réellement su trouver grâce à ses yeux. Mais autant pouvait-il les aimer du plus profond de son cœur, autant cette vie ne lui était pas adaptée. On ne ressortait pas indemne de tant de mois passés à combattre la mort. De tant d'années imprégnées de cette puissante adrénaline qui ne le quittait presque jamais, lorsqu'il était en faction… Bien sûr, il avait aussi eu son lot de moments difficiles à encaisser, là-bas. Mais ce n'était que des instants voués à pousser plus haut encore son aspiration à y retourner. Allez savoir pourquoi… Alors qu'il prenait son fils par la taille pour lui permettre de sautiller sans danger sur le matelas de son lit, William sourit avec force à ce dernier. Il espérait tant un meilleur futur à son enfant que celui vécu par ceux qu'il avait croisés des mois plus tôt. Il se surprenait encore parfois à penser à ce gamin dont il avait dû déminer les bombes enfouies dans ses entrailles. Comme il lui suffisait parfois de croiser un adolescent de son âge, traînant dans leur quartier, ou juste de voir une publicité pour l'un de ces mauvais films de série Z, pour qu'il pense aussi à l'autre môme… Ce Beckham … Celui qu'il avait d'abord cru être victime du plan macabre d'un intégriste terroriste désireux de faire sauter tout un quartier, dans le seul but d'emporter dans sa folie une poignée d'envahisseurs que l'armée américaine représentait au sein de ces territoires où régnait l'anarchie. Avoir dû déminer cet enfant, conjugué à la disparition temporaire du petit vendeur de DVD… Il avait réellement cru à l'époque que le jeune footballeur amateur était ce môme dont il avait ouvert l'estomac cousu au fil de fer… Cette incertitude lui avait fait perdre le sommeil, au point de le pousser dans la folie pour réussir à confirmer ses doutes, s'assurer qu'il se trompait... ou pas. En agissant comme il l'avait fait, il avait failli se perdre. Dans la folie, d'abord. Mais plus sûrement dans la mort, en plongeant en un territoire ennemi qu'il n'aurait jamais dû côtoyer d'aussi près. Alors qu'il continuait à jouer tranquillement avec son bébé, lui faisait à présent découvrir tout l'amusement qu'il pouvait tirer de son nouveau jouet : une petite boîte faisant sortir à son ouverture, un petit diablotin coloré. Le père qu'il était aussi derrière le militaire, accumulait en cet instant, nombre de mémoires heureuses et sereines, seules aptes à effacer ses plus sombres souvenirs de guerre. Et parce que son fils avait ce pouvoir d'apaiser toutes ses plaies à vif d'un simple sourire enfantin, l'homme se mit de nouveau à penser à tous ceux qui n'avaient pas une jolie maison à eux. À tous ceux qui n'avaient pas la chance de pouvoir vivre dans un pays où l'on ne craignait pas encore de sauter d'une bombe posée par leur voisin sur le pas de leur porte… Quoique sur ce point, les choses tendaient à ne plus être aussi catégoriques en leur pays. Alors, oui, il aurait pu demander à rejoindre une équipe de démineur de la police… Mais il jugeait qu'avant de s'y résoudre, il pouvait encore faire la différence outremer. Parce que oui, plus le temps passait en ces lieux, plus son fils grandissait sous ses yeux, plus sa femme l'aimait chaque nuit depuis son retour. Et plus son désir de repartir gonflait en lui, poussé par un instinct et une raison qu'il ne s'expliquait toujours pas. Alors que Connie les rejoignit sans un bruit, elle l'informa de son entrée en murmurant son nom, tout en se collant à son dos. Déposant un baiser sur sa jugulaire, elle le laissa installer consciencieusement leur enfant dans son berceau pour une nuit qu'ils espéraient tous deux faite de beaux rêves emplis de couleurs chaudes et sentiments de sécurité. Suite à quoi, ils quittèrent sa chambre pour une nouvelle soirée en tête à tête. À la différence que ce soir-là, l'homme avait besoin de trouver des réponses à ses questions. Aussi s'enquit-il d'enfin les lui poser quand ils s'assirent tous deux sur leur canapé, leurs deux bières posées sur la table basse. Peu dupe quant à son besoin de s'exprimer, Connie lui facilita la tâche, en l'abordant la première. - Will ? - Hum… ? - N'ai pas peur de me parler. Si cela lui semblait plus facile à dire qu'à faire. Le soldat qu'il était au fond de lui ne manqua pas l'ironie de la situation. S'il ne craignait pas de se rendre sur un terrain miné, apte à le tuer dans la seconde à la moindre erreur. Il appréhendait jusqu'au plus profond de ces tripes de décevoir sa femme à la moindre parole trop véridique. - Je… Pourquoi avoir accepté que je parte en Afghanistan ? Attendrie par son regard de chiot battu accompagnant cette première question, la jeune femme se nicha tout contre lui, pour poser son menton sur son épaule tendue. Alors, elle caressa doucement sa mâchoire serrée, pour le pousser à la regarder dans les yeux. - Hé… Tu étais déjà militaire quand nous nous sommes rencontrés. Alors, je n'étais pas surprise par ton affectation. Et encore moins par ton souhait de partir comme on te le proposait. - Alors, pourquoi demander le divorce avant mon départ en Irak ? - J'ai cru au début que je saurais m'y habituer. Aux absences répétées, à la peur de ne pas te savoir revenir. Mais finalement, ce n'était pas le cas. Sachant bien que sa réponse ne faisait que le perdre un peu plus, elle tacha de se montrer plus explicite. - Parce que je ne suis plus ta femme, je n'ai plus rien à te promettre. Je n'ai pas à rester comme une épouse bienveillante à t'attendre. Je peux vivre ma vie comme je le souhaite, ou… rencontrer les hommes que je souhaite. Si seulement, un jour l'envie m'en prenait en ton absence. Il pouvait comprendre son besoin de liberté. N'avait-il pas été le premier à se sentir libéré à l'annonce de son désir de divorcer. Pour autant, il y avait surtout eu la peine de se savoir trop minable et pitoyable pour rendre sa femme heureuse… Mais réaliser, suite à ce divorce, qu'elle n'était pas partie pour autant, qu'elle ne l'avait pas quitté. Mieux, qu'elle lui avait explicitement fait comprendre qu'ils étaient toujours ensemble. L'avait tout autant rassuré que déconcerté jusqu'à son départ. À présent, tandis qu'elle vivait toujours dans sa maison, élevant son fils comme une mère célibataire en son absence, elle l'accueillait encore à bras ouvert à son retour de guerre. C'était… désarmant. - William. Si j'osais, j'ajouterais qu'en étant toi-même dorénavant célibataire, tu peux ainsi plus facilement accepter de nouvelles rotations. Sans que là-bas, on ne te juge ou te le reproche, si tu avais un statut marital plus stable. Ou que toi-même te restreignes en pensant que ton vœu de fidélité doive se traduire par une obligation inappropriée à devoir rester à mes côtés, quand tu ne le désires plus. Redressant plus vivement la tête, l'homme eut du mal à encaisser cette nouvelle information. Était-il vraiment possible qu'elle se soit sacrifiée pour lui faciliter la vie ? Pour lui permettre simplement, en le libérant officiellement de toutes attaches, qu'il soit finalement libre de les quitter sans remord ? N'ayant aucun mal à deviner le contenu de ses pensées à cet instant, Connie poursuivit, naturellement. - Quoi qu'il arrive à l'avenir, quel que soit le nombre de missions que tu continueras à prendre. Sache que tu auras toujours une place dans cette maison, dans mon lit ou ailleurs. Tu auras toujours des murs et un toit qui t'attendent à ton retour, aussi court soit ton séjour parmi nous. Ce n'est pas là, la promesse d'une femme à son époux. Mais d'une mère au père de son enfant. Même si tu ne passes qu'une seconde pour le voir, je serais heureuse de t'accueillir parmi nous. Mais je sais que tu n'es pas fait pour être enchaîné. Je l'ai finalement compris, même si trop tard pour t'éviter le mariage. - Je vous aime vraiment, tous les deux. - Je sais. Caressant de nouveau doucement sa mâchoire carrée, elle n'en avait même jamais douté. - Nous aussi on t'aime… C'est pourquoi nous ne souhaitons qu'une seule promesse. - Laquelle ? - De toujours tout mettre en œuvre pour rester en vie… pour nous. - Je promets. - Alors, tout va bien. D'un baiser échangé, ils scellèrent cet étrange pacte. Qu'avait-il donné au monde pour obtenir une telle femme à ses côtés ? Elle méritait tellement plus qu'un drogué d'adrénaline comme lui. Un drogué à la guerre… Incapable qu'il était de rester plus de quelques mois en leur compagnie, pourtant si douce et aimante… Sachant bien qu'il faudrait lui avouer son choix quant à un futur départ, William jugea que ce moment était encore le plus opportun pour cette lourde tâche. - Je comptais… - Quand ? l'interrompit-elle simplement. - Dans deux mois. - Pour combien de temps ? - Un an. Avec une permission d'une semaine chaque trimestre. - Bien. L'embrassant alors, d'un baiser bien prude aux regards de tous ceux partagés depuis son retour. Connie s'enquit de se relever d'un bon, pour préparer leur diner. - J'ai prévu des steaks. Cela te convient. - Ouais… Je… - Pas question de te défiler. Tant que tu resteras ici, j'aurais toujours besoin de toi pour laver et couper les légumes. Ne se faisant pas prier, bien que peu enclin à jouer les commis de cuisine, William se leva pour la rejoindre. C'était bien peu de choses, que de l'aider à cette simple tâche, le temps de sa présence auprès d'eux. Et puis, ces moments de complicité et tous ces baisers volés, au sein de leur petite cuisine, étaient aussi riches en doux souvenirs que ces instants partagés auprès de son fils. L'homme n'avait pas besoin de plus pour l'aider à tout mettre en œuvre pour tenir le moment venu, sa promesse de rester en vie. . Ainsi passèrent les trois mois de sa coupure imposée. Rythmés par la succession maladivement lente et sans intérêt d'une vie calme et posée. Jusqu'à ce qu'enfin, son heure vienne. Son sac porté à l'épaule, il embrassa les joues joufflues de son fils avant d'échanger un baiser épicé d'une caresse à son ex-femme. Alors, il rejoint son taxi, prêt à repartir pour une rotation d'une année. Une longue année durant laquelle, il espérait pouvoir faire la différence, sauver des vies et se sentir utile à son pays. Là était la vie rythmée d'adrénaline qu'il avait choisi de vivre. Bien plus tard, quand de nouveaux équipiers le questionnèrent sur l'alliance toujours présente dans sa boîte à objet de la mort. C'est sans difficulté qu'il leur indiqua comme à chacun avant eux, son statut d'homme divorcé à une femme fidèle et loyale. La meilleure qui soit… Sa femme. . FIN. Voilà. Sans doute pas un texte qui restera dans les mémoires, si seulement quelqu'un vient à le lire.

This is meant to be super dramatic and intense. I hope it shows Enjoy! In Iraq, you would be lucky to have a 90 degree day. You'd have to be a praying man who believed in miracles for rain. It just never happened. The dust, though. The dust is what makes people hate this dry, dead, hot place of a warzone. True, war was not comfortable, but inhaling the deadness of the land day in, day out. Unbearable. The heat makes everyone feel a little crazy. Add in the stress of war, the absolute horror of war, and it would take an idiot to not see that PTSD was abound. Tie the two together, and add the longing that comes from knowing you are weeks away from being back home, possibly with family, safe from IEDs and mortars and everything else that this hell hole stands for, and you have a potentially deadly mix of a soldier. That's all you are. A soldier. Disposable. Replaceable. A puppet. A tool. Always replaceable. Never forget it. There are mere weeks before his bomb squad rotation was set to be completed, and Sanborn and Eldridge were feeling the pressure mount. Only a week prior, they had lost a member of their team, Matt Thompson, to an IED. This helped no one. Sure, Thompson was dead, but who cares? This is war, everyone is disposable. And yeah, Eldridge was slowly losing his marbles, fearing death at every turn of a dirt street, or due to an equipment failure, not even expecting to make through the rest of the day. Possible, but it is not logical to dwell on the possibilities. The mere thought of not being able to trust his team to keep them all alive set him running for base with his tail inbetween his legs. But Thompson did. He risked his life for his team's safety. And it killed him. It fucking killed him. And with a one-time-use soldier comes another to replace him. Sergeant First Class Will James. Sanborn saw right through him. James is nothing but careless trailer-trash with no respect for intelligence or authority. But he was good at what he did. Maybe too good. Eight hundred and ninety three bombs defused. Counting the copious amount in the car designed to blow up the United Nations building. He is the type who never backs down, never to admit defeat. Careless. Sanborn called it. As he was carelessly risking the safety of his time, maybe not so much from bombs as the possible backlash of soldiers being caught on camera, to simply see if it could be done, every bomb defused. No suit, no headset, no clear thoughts. No foresight. Hell, no hindsight! The entire building was cleared, no one was around, the squad should have simply left the car. No. James is a Wildman. Risking his life, and his team for what? A gold star for every bomb? Not worth it. Sanborn is ten times the man he could ever be. Eldridge maybe twenty. Sure he was afraid, but fear is a human emotion. It did perplex Sanborn as to why he enlisted. But at the end of the day, does it even matter? Because at the end of the day, you're here, in this wasteland with nothing but the men you are with and a pile of bombs you must defuse. Down at the testing range, Sanborn and Eldridge are minding to the explosives being detonated down range, while James is listening to his iPod. As if from the blue, James exclaims he left his gloves down range, and takes the Humvee down there. Sanborn and Eldridge stand and watch him. Sanborn still has the detonator in his hand, Eldridge eyes him carefully. \"Should we kill him?\" Sanborn looks with longing to the detonator in his palm. There are so many planted bombs and discarded flammable shrapnel that to detonate the bomb would make it seem like a tragic accident. After the carelessness displayed today, it seems like a good idea. Get him out of the way. James will be replaced, of course. An accident. All their fears about dying due to an idiot on their own team. James' life held in the balance between Sanborn, much like today when James was not reachable. An eye for an eye. Fair enough. But would it be? James has a family. As dysfunctional as it might be, they still would mourn him. His son would never know his father. A son. Sanborn's one wish. Could he really take that away from someone? And James was talented, probably the best there was. Could that cocky confidence be replaced? Probably not. Everyone's replaceable, so it is likely not anytime soon, at least. And before Sanborn could make that decision, James was already driving back up the range and out of the hot zone. I don't know about you, but I really like this. Maybe a little poetic-ish? Hah I don't know. Review perhaps? ","Summary":" So cool, I'm a writer for a fandom that has only 12 stories!

Of course, right after I came here to try and find some fanfics, and was surprised by how few there were. So this one-shot came into being. It is important to note that I am in no way at all suggesting that the military gives its soldiers faulty equipment. But I wrote the fic before I though to look up how effective the EOD suits were, and decided to bend that info to my plot line. Also, all mature language is used for the effect of portraying real soldiers. Enjoy! Disclaimer: The Hurt Locker and the lovely Jeremy Renner are unfortunately not mine. \"Sanborn, you have forty-five seconds.\" \"Come on, James—\" \"Forty-five seconds!\" he repeated, although the timer had mockingly dropped down to forty . Thirty-nine ... \"Go!\" \"Shit!\" Sanborn gave him one last desperate look before charging away from the suicide bomber, back towards the other soldiers. \"Every body get back!\" James' grip tightened on the bolt cutters, and with a strained yell of effort he finally succeeded in cutting through one of the reinforced locks. Encouraged, he chucked it aside, glancing at the timer. Fuck. Thirty seconds. His stomach dropped. James picked himself up off the ground, not bothering to reach for the bolt cutters. The bomber's incessant mumbling took on an even more frantic tone, and he reached his arms out despairingly. Save me , his face pleaded. But the watch read twenty-two seconds . Not enough time. \"I'm sorry, but I can't get it off.\" James tried to get through to the man, recklessly stepping closer to grab his shoulders. \"There are too many locks! I'm sorry, ok?\" Twenty seconds. The man started to cry, and James stared him straight in the face. \"Listen to me, I'm sorry!\" Fifteen seconds. James finally turned tail and sprinted back the way he came, stumbling along as well as he could in the bomb suit. Although it was meant to protect him, in this situation it was slowing him down. He slammed the helmet visor down, his legs pumping, but knew he was still too far into the blast zone. Five seconds. This is it , a treacherous little voice in his head spoke. This is the time you finally die. Still running, James looked back. If he was going to die, he at least wanted to see this. Boom. The force of the blast threw James backwards. He was airborne for all of three seconds before slamming down onto the rocky ground, hard. The air was pushed from his lungs in a harsh grunt, and he smashed his face against the glass of the helmet. Almost immediately the metallic smell of blood was overwhelming. And then there was silence. \"James!\" Will blinked slowly, trying to focus on something in the sky. What was that? A trick of the sun? or was some idiot really flying a kite in the middle of this fucking desert? \"Ah, shit. Breathe, Will! Breathe, God damn it!\" Was he not breathing? That might explain why the edges of his vision were graying out. Experimentally, James sucked in a breath, and groaned at the ache of cracked ribs from the force of his fall. But the air did him good. Suddenly he was aware again, aware of every ache in his body, aware that Sanborn was kneeling next to him, his hands pressing hard against his chest. His chest that felt like it was on fire. \"H-hey buddy,\" James croaked, trying not to gag on the taste of his own blood. \"How ya doin'?\" Sanborn gave him a look of exasperated relief. \"I'm alright man, but I can't say the same about you.\" James blinked in confusion, and coughed. \"Waddaya mean? I'm wearing my super suit.\" If Sanborn had looked relieved before, now his brow was furrowed in concern. He answered his CO distractedly, waving another one of the soldiers over. \"Right. Just hang on a moment for me, huh? Keep breathin'.\" The other soldier jogged over to them, stopping short by as he took in the bomb tech's body. \"Oh… fuck, man!\" \"Soldier!\" Sanborn gave him deadly look, and James wondered briefly what was so wrong. \"Grab a couple of guys and the stretcher for the back of my Humvee. Imma pack this down, but we gotta get him back to base ASAP.\" James watched with a strange detachedness as the soldier took off at a dead sprint, yelling to some of the other men. Sanborn was already ripping open a large pack of gauze, leaning down to pack it into his chest. James was wrenched back into the present as he let out a strangled scream of pain that left him gasping for breath and realizing that the liquid that was thick at the back of his throat was blood. \"Alright man, you're good, okay, I got you.\" Sanborn reassured him as he continued to pack gauze into the injury site. \"Just hang on and Imma get you outta here.\" James' only response was a strained groan as he fought to raise his head to look at the injury. There, sticking out of the suit that was supposed to be able to protect him from all this, the suit that he trusted his life to each and every day, was a broken piece of rebar. The green suit was already soaked in blood as it gushed out around the foreign object. Sanborn was talking to him again, but James couldn't hear anything past the rushing in his ears as the world faded to black. When Will finally came around, he knew he wasn't in Iraq any more. In a hospital, yes. In a shit ton of pain as his meds wore off, yes. But dead in the middle of the desert, no. \"Look who decided to rejoin the land of the living.\" Sanborn was sitting in a chair next to his bed in civilian dress. He offered up a cup of ice chips that James devoured greedily, soothing his throat enough for him to talk. \"What happened?\" Sanborn had been expecting the question. \"The bomb exploded in the middle of a construction yard, and a piece of rebar penetrated your suit. Stuck you like a pig in the lower chest. You're pretty lucky, man.\" James snorted a laugh, then immediately wished he hadn't as the movement pulled at freshly healing sutures. \"Oh yeah? How so?\" \"Missed most of the important stuff,\" Sanborn explained, leaning back in his chair. \"Nicked a lung and a kidney a little, but nothing the docs at the base couldn't handle. Sent you home on time and everything.\" James took a deep breath before answering. He couldn't tell the younger man at his bedside that he didn't necessarily want the good news. That he had been waiting for an incident just like that every day since he'd signed up, that if he was going to die sooner or later, he wanted to die doing something epic and heroic and important. Instead, he deflected. \"Not so lucky that my fucking suit didn't crap out on me. I was told stuff like that couldn't happen.\" Now a dark look passed across Sanborn's face. \"It's not supposed to. The men up high took note of the incident and told me they'll be 'looking into it.' It's bad enough they expect you to play around with bombs. They don't need to be sending you in there with faulty gear, too.\" \"Well, at least I could count on you,\" James grunted uncomfortably as he lay back in bed. Sanborn smiled slightly to himself, knowing that was about as close to a 'Thank you' as he was going to get. \"Have to admit, I'm a little surprised to see you. I figured that once we got state side…\" \"Nah, man,\" Sanborn cut him off. Yes, he'd had issues with his CO, but that didn't mean the man deserved to wake up to deal with impersonal nurses and a hole in his chest alone. \"I've already had one CO die on me, I didn't need a second. Just, uh, don't expect a card from Eldrich.\" This simple joke from an uptight man whose head was so far up his ass that it was probably slowly turning into a diamond practically killed James. A laugh that was so pure and lighthearted and real practically burst out of him, leaving him clutching the bed rail as he cracked up. Sanborn couldn't help but join in, even when a nurse passing by the doorway gave them a funny look. \"Ow, shit, that hurts!\" James gasped, clutching at his chest as his laughter faded into a quiet chuckle. \"Sanborn, you're alright.\" \"And you're just crazy, James,\" the dark skinned man answered. Exhausted by their outburst, it wasn't long before James drifted off into a deep sleep. Sanborn excused himself quietly. As he left the hospital, he noticed that the day looked brighter, and that his heart was lighter than it had been in a while. They were going to be okay.

I came here to do my job. To serve my country. To help my fellow soldiers. I am a medic. My name is Jane. But I don't like Jane. I like to be called Baby. I've been shot 5 times. In the shoulder. In the back. In the stomach. In the leg. In the heart. War has torn my life apart. Ripped it up into little pieces and then ran it though a shredder, making sure I would never recover. I joined Bravo Company on June 3rd. Camp Victory is small, only a total of about 50 soldiers. This was my new home. Carrying my duffel bag, I stomped up the steps of my new cabin. I knocked lightly. No answer. B6… This was the right one. I knocked again, this time harder. \"Excuse me ma'am?\" I turned around to see a young man dressed in uniform, \"Are you looking for Bravo Company?\" I nodded quickly. \"Oh. They have patrol right now. You might have to wait for them to come back before you can get in.\" I nodded again. \"Thank you.\" So sighing, I lugged my stuff back down the stairs, and waded through the sand and plopped in front of the base. A young boy was walking around, heckling off DVDs with a soccer ball underneath his arm. \"Hey! Nigga nigga! You want one? They fuck cheap!\" Men turned the young boy down, and kept walking. He kept socializing with the men, only a few bought movies from him, and after about 5 minutes he lost patience and started to kick his soccer ball around. I sat in the hot sand, waiting for Bravo Company to pull up from the patrol, watching the boy kick and juggle his soccer ball. Sand kicked up into the air. The sand brought back lots of memories. I remembered how much I first hated this place when I first came here. It was hot, uncomfortable. Most of all, dangerous. But, now I had grown to find beauty here. Not sure how or why though… The sun had started to set, and finally a Hummvee pulled up. \"Finally…\" I groaned and got up, stretching. Three men hopped out of the transport chuckling and joking around. \"I mean we could have a really awesome tank battle with the Russians if they ever showed up but-\" \"You guys Bravo?\" I asked quite straight forward. One of they guys, with sleeves rolled up replied, \"Ya. And you are?\" \"Baby.\"[Chapter 2] Day 4 with Bravo Company Soccer and Bonding The ringing phone caused her to stir in her sleep. \"Eldridge…\" she growled. Baby practically rolled out of her cot. Stalking over to the specialist, who at the moment had his headphones on and eyes closed, Baby flicked his nose. \"Ow!\" he snapped to, removing his headphones, \"What was th-\" \"Phone.\" She grumbled pointing to his nightstand. The annoyingly loud ringing continued as Owen reached over grasped the small plastic phone and flipped it open. \"Welcome to Bravo Company's hotline, I'm being stared down by a bitch at the moment so if you could call me back-… No Sanborn… I'm not getting ass…. Again? Yeah…. Yeah, hold on.\" Hanging up the phone, Owen threw it at Baby, who caught it and tossed it on his nightstand. \"I'm going back to sleep.\" She remarked. \"Nu-uh. Sorry Baby-poo, Will needs us to kick some butt in soccer with him. He says Beckham challenged him again and the numbers are unfair. Again.\" The blonde groaned. \"This is the 2nd time in 4 days…\" Baby questioned, \"What the hell does he do to piss off the kid? We lost by 37 points last time….\" Snorting, Owen tied up his boots and headed for the door. \"You coming?\" \"I don't have a choice, do I?\" \"Nope.\" \"Yeah, I'll be there in sec.\" Baby grabbed one of her tan tank tops, not daring to put on a short sleeve shirt… It was far to hot for that. Throwing her tags around her neck and tying up her boots, she headed out the door of the cabin. The hot, Middle East sun beat down on her already sunburnt shoulders as she trekked through the sand to the edge of the base. Loud shouts and laughing could be heard as she came closer to the game. As she neared, she spotted Will throwing his foot out to reach the ball that flew through the air. He missed. \"Goalllll!\" Shouted Beckham, cheering and whooping with his friends. \"Wow… You put Will in goal?\" Eldridge asked as Baby laughed, James and Sanborn greeted the two. \"Yeah. I suck. I know.\" Will chuckled clapping Baby on the back, \"That's why we're puttin' you in.\" Laughing, Sanborn ruffled her hair, and shoved her into the goal. Upon realizing who had just been put into goal, the group of younger boys started to mumble and talk to one another. Some even consulted Beckham, who talked rapidly back at them in their own language. \"Hey, man! Girls aren't allowed!\" Beckham protested. Will raised a brow. \"Oh really?\" Will asked playfully sauntering up to Beckham. Grasping him by the shoulders, he ruffled his hair, \"That's no girl, 'kay Beck. That is a full-grown woman. Blonde and all. When you're older, you'll be wishing she'd play with you.\" \"Will!\" Baby shouted, kicking sand in his direction. \"As I said, when you're older.\" He continued. Standing up, he motioned for the boys to start playing. \"C'mon! Let's go!\" The game ended at sundown, the final score being 39 to 42, Beckham's team. Praise was given to Baby by Bravo company, who insisted that she was awesome. Collapsing on her cot, Baby groaned. \"I have sand in places where no girl should have sand.\" \"Oh suck it up. I have sand in places where no human being should have sand.\" Sanborn remarked, peeling off his sweat covered shirt and sitting down on his cot to untie his boots. Tipping them upside down, a pile of sand toppled out. \"Ugh.\" Baby whiped the sweat from her forehead, \"Sometimes I really hate this place.\" \"I always hate this place.\" Owen snorted. From the bathroom, Will was heard making a sound much like, 'Aw…'. \"You okay in there, James?\" Sanborn shouted. Opening the door slightly, Will popped his head out and said, \"Yeah… Just wondering how all of this sand got in my pants.\" He shut the door and Owen laughed. \"I'm going to the main building… Might play some Gears of War. Anyone wanna' come with…?\" \"Yeah, I'll come O'. I think AC would do me some good.\" Sanborn stood. \"What about you Baby? Will?\" Owen called out, asking. \"Nah. I think I'm gonna sleep.\" Baby said. \"No thanks! I need to get this sand out of my pants before some major chaffing starts.\" Will replied from the confines of the bathroom. \"Alright. Have fun.\" Owen and Sanborn gathered their stuff and retreated out the door, heading for the AC main building. Lying stiffly on her bed, Baby sighed and flipped her pillow over to the cold side. Sighing contently at the cool sensation, she didn't even hear Will creep out of the bathroom. He had ditched his sweat and sand covered shirt and wandered over to his dresser, searching for another shirt. Baby peeped and eye open. \"What happened?\" \"Huh?\" Will turned his head to her and raised his eyebrow, confused. \"You chest. The scars. What happened?\" \"Oh… uh…\" \"Lemme guess...\" Swinging her legs over the edge of the messy cot, she ran a hand through her blonde hair. \"Mortar right? I had to deal with a hell of a lot of those with my last company.\" She hoisted her small frame up off the sleeping device and made her way to Will. \"Yeah? It kinda' sucked. Put me out of commission for 2 months.\" Suddenly, Will jumped at the touch of her warm fingers. \"Yours healed pretty well…\" she observed. Not taking any note of Will's sudden flustered face, \"Some guys got hit so bad with this, the best I could do is just let the wound heal by itself. Even then, it wasn't as good as this.\" She looked up and blushed. Will was staring at her with both eyebrows raised. \"Sorry…\" She removed her hands from his chest and went back to her cot, \"I'm a medical officer… It's what I do…\" Laughing, Will told her that she could do that again anytime she wanted. Baby feel asleep blushing. A/N: I know, I know... Where has this chapter been! Well... I don't really know... The Twilight Zone maybe? But, yeah. It's here. and expect more soon.

Michael Valkyrie sat in his command chair straightening out his uniform when Gross said, \"Too tight captain?\", Michael said, \"No, I'm just use to wearing the other uniform. Are the hanger doors repaired yet?\", Gross said, \"In about a half hour sir, same goes to the VerKa.\", Law said, \"Sir I'm receiving a transmission from Vega IX requesting medical assistance.\", Michael said, \"Unfortunately we are not in shape for anymore missions till we finish repairs in dry dock. Relay their message to command.\", Law said, \"Aye sir.\", Michael turned to Petra and said, \"Ms. Arkanian how is Commander Wiggin doing after this ordeal?\", Petra said, \"Exhausted. I even had a hard time trying to drag his but out of bed to have him go take a shower, let alone change his clothes!\", Michael said, \"Do you want to know the quickest way to get him out of bed?\", she looked at him puzzled and he said, \"Cherry bombs.\", some of the crew hid their laughter as Petra laughed before Law said, \"Sir I have a message from Zhargosia Command. They want us to head to Vega IX immediately and render medical assistance or any aide the inhabitants request.\", Michael turned and looked baffled and said, \"US! Do they know our situation?!\", Law said, \"Yes sir, and they informed us when we reach orbit they will send a ship to continue repairs while we assisted the inhabitants.\", she paused as she touched her earpiece and said, \"They are also informing us that the disease the inhabitants are suffering from is contained on one region of the planet and it is equivalent to a case of rabies.\", Michael sighed as he turned to Petra and said, \"Engine status.\", Petra said, \"Warp drive is operational only up to warp factor three.\", after a short pause Michael said, \"Law, inform command that we will comply and we will proceed directly to Vega IX.\", Law said, \"Yes sir.\", Gross said, \"At least sir this is a case of rabies. According to sick bay we have plenty of medicine to treat it and is a easy cure.\", Michael said, \"Yea, thank goodness. Ms. Arkanian proceed to Vega IX warp factor two!\", Petra said, \"Yes sir.\", Michael said, \"Law open all channels to the rest of the ship.\", the Challenger (battle scarred and damaged) turned away from the rest of the fleet and went to warp leaving a blue warp trail. Michael walked down the hallway rubbing his face as he looked exhausted and felt hair on his cheeks as he sighed while crewmen passed him some carrying boxes or tools for the upcoming away mission as he walked into his and Chloe's cabin and went straight to the bathroom and shaved not looking into the bedroom. When he came out freshly shaved a voice said, \"Seriously, you are just going to ignore me?\", and he looked to see Chloe wearing a pink robe lying on her right side facing him revealing one of her legs and Michael said, \"Not really. Just want to get rid of this caveman beard.\", Chloe said, \"That's a relief.\", and they both stared at each other as Chloe smiled and said, \"We have a lot to make up for.\", and Michael said, \"We sure do.\", and he pressed a button on a panel and the lights in the room dimmed. Once the Challenger achieved orbit to Vega IX Michael appeared in the transporter room where Carol and three other medical staff were already waiting and she said, \"Sir is it wise you should come? The area we are beaming to is a peninsula and it will be teaming with people that are trying to evacuate.\", Michael stepped on the pad and said, \"For something this small I think it is wise for the commander to beam down and assure the inhabitants that everything is cool.\", Carol rolled her eyes, sighed and said, \"Are we ready yet?\", transporter chief said, \"Yes ma'm.\", Michael said, \"Energize!\", and they dematerialized. They rematerialized on what looked like a helo pad and four blue terrain jeep like vehicles waited for them with drivers wearing blue plastic fitted suits and wore hockey like helmets that are blue and had a single glass shield in front of their faces with displays showing on them. They loaded the supplies they were carrying on the vehicles and they were driven away and noticed people were either walking or running past them and Carol said, \"Why are they moving away in a hurry?\", the driver said, \"They are evacuating the hazard zone.\", Carol said, \"Take me to this hazard zone!\", the driver said, \"Sorry ma'm but I have orders to take you and your team to the designated field hospital.\", Michael was about to speak till Carol yelled, \"As the chief medical representative of the Federation of Planets I order you to take me to the hazard zone or else you try to cure this disease on your own fuck tards!\", Michael looked a little baffled but amused as the driver looked really frustrated and he turned the wheel and the lead vehicle turned making the other three follow as they entered a highway that is clogged with people that are moving the opposite direction. As they drove a little farther there were more people running and they began to move faster and faster as they drove farther till it seemed like people were trying to sprint but were carrying their belongings or little ones with them that prevented them. Michael then leaned over and said, \"Driver what the hell is going on?!\", but the driver continued looking ahead and Michael stood up to see over and a hovering solar powered cycle sped up right beside Michael on the left side and yelled, \"GET DOWN AND TURN AROUND RIGHT NOW!\", and Michael sat down as he leaned over to speak to the cycle driver as the driver also yelled, \"REMAIN IN...\", then he was slammed from behind and was crushed beneath a motorhome as the medical personnel and Michael looked in shock as the motorhome kept going, crushing people and smashing vehicles in its path till it slammed into what looked like the back of a moving truck and it fell on its right side as people screamed and some raised their hands to stop it only to be crushed beneath its weight. Michael then looked back as he heard what sounded like a dog snarling and he stood back up on the vehicle and looked ahead as his robotic vision enhanced his view ahead and at first he squinted as the sun shined down on him and in an instant had a look of terror in his eyes and expression while around him more people ran and many of them started to scream or yell and Carol called up to him, \"Captain what is it?!\", and Michael continued to look as he saw a wall of beings charging towards them as if they are a wall of water running over each other and on top of people trying to run away either ignoring them as they were crushed or were started being eaten and he looked back down and Carol and the rest of the medical team looked nervous as they saw his expression and he yelled out, \"ZOMBIES!\", he then screamed at the driver, \"GET US THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!\", and the driver began turning the vehicle around as well as the others but they were swarmed by the onrushing people trying to flee and they couldn't move. Michael then yelled into his communicator, \"LAW BEAM US UP!\", Law yelled back, \"I can hear you fine loudmouth! I can't beam you back to the ship due to interference from whatever it is around your position!\", Michael said, \"Then beam us north of here!\", Law said, \"Where sir?!\", Michael yelled, \"ANY FUCKING WHERE!\", and they heard louder snarling and a low thundering noise as they looked up and see a wall of charging zombies either running over either each other or non infected people as some were being eaten while others were ignored and were crushed or swarmed beneath the zombie wave and Michael and the others pulled out their phasers only to be dematerialized. When they rematerialized they were on a grassy hill with trees behind them and they over looked the same road still crowded with people and moving fast only this time no one is screaming or rushing through. Michael pulled out his communicator and said, \"Law where are we?\", Law said, \"Thirty miles north of where you were sir. Is everything all right?\", Michael said, \"We're fine now, notify Gross and tell her the situation is more serious than we thought. We'll contact you later when we have more information, captain out.\", he then turned to one of the former vehicle drivers and said, \"We need an aerial transport now!\", they still looked shocked but one of them pulled out a communications device and started talking. Three non bladed helicopters landed (colored blue and white and were powered by a jet engine on top) and they all boarded and left the hill before refugees started moving up the hill. When they flew away they watched in the distance zombies swarming the countryside, forests, and roads trampling over people as behind them they were either consumed or infected by zombies behind the onrushing wave. They also saw makeshift barricades of vehicles or other large objects as soldiers and police stood behind and fired on the zombies as they charged at them but the barricades fell as well with jets and non rotor helos flew over firing rockets and machine guns at the zombies. Carol then called out and told the pilots to head to the field hospital but one of the pilots told her that place is being evacuated but Carol told them to fly there anyway and the pilot shook his head and turned the helo. When they reached it Carol and the others looked in horror as the medical center is in total chaos as ambulances and med. buses try to leave but people were clambering onto them and pulling and pushing people out including patients and amongst the chaos they saw zombies mixed in with the people running around in the chaos making it confusing who is infected and who is not and Carol told the pilot to take them as far north as they can. The helos reached what is called Tall City and they landed on a makeshift military firebase and when they disembarked Michael pulled out his communicator and told Law to have two regiments of security standing by and when they reached what they believed is the command center he told Carol to get the rest of her med. staff out but she told him she is staying there and if he has a problem then oh well. Michael just shook his head and moved away as Carol and the medical staff went the opposite direction where nurses and medical staff were running in and out of a large white building and Michael walked up to a large tent and at first the two guards stood in his way but they parted when one of the pilots showed his ID and told them who Michael is and he entered and saw military generals and older men and women in suits standing over a large table chart with a tv screen in front showing what Michael believed is the president of this nation and they stopped talking when he entered and Michael looked furious and yelled, \"DUDE, you call this a fucking rabies epidemic?! W nearly got our asses chewed off and all I see is police and civil defense forces! Where is the fucking army, navy or even your air forces?!\", the president told him he is trying to prevent a mass panic and it is all taken care of and then the president told Michael he finds his tone offensive and rude and he will not tolerate it or listen to him continue if he talks in that tone and Michael fired back, \"How about this , I leave and make a report to the Federation Council how you've lied and endangered the lives of the away team and myself due to just covering your ass and have you only defend yourselves without any aid! How is that for tone fuck face!\", and all military personnel looked at Michael with a mixture of shock and anger and then the president said, \"As of right now Captain Valkyrie we do not need your help anymore and you have one hour to get off the surface and leave or I will authorize...\", and all of a sudden the screen went blank and one of the generals said he didn't hear him but then another called out, \"TREASON! You should be arrested and tried for...!\", the same general that turned off the screen said, \"Go ahead! See if you can hold the southern defenses when my infantry divisions leave! Without me those soldiers will literally drop their weapons and leave!\", same other general said, \"Then they will be executed as well for mutiny!\", another general yelled out, \"ENOUGH! That is stupid! No one is executing or arresting anyone!\", they all started arguing amongst themselves till one called out that the president is far away and is obviously thinking for himself and clearly not aware of the seriousness of the situation. Then a woman in a suit said, \"Mr. Valkyrie what do you think we should do in this crisis?\", and Michael went straight to the point and asked how far the zombies have spread and they told him in the Northeast they were as far as New City to Cleve and Pitts and in the Southeast as far as New Jack to thirty miles from where they are now. Michael told them that they must fully evacuate Tall City and every place east of the Main River to the other side and have their civil defense forces along the river to as far west to the Thendore Mountains to form a wall at least twenty feet high while defense forces west of the mountains build walls along any gaps and close off all the roads except the main highways and rail tunnels in case the Main River barrier doesn't hold. He also went over plans to have all naval and coast guard ships on the West coast inspect every ship that approaches the safe zone and if anyone is infected they are to be separated from the rest and discreetly execute anyone or destroy any ship that is infected and the same goes for the Main River gates. Michael then pulled out his communicator and said, \"Law this is the captain, send in all data relating to zombie extermination and survival including Max Brooks Zombie Survival Guide to the Vegians computers on these coordinates.\", Law said, \"Yes sir.\", all of a sudden Carol entered the tent and told Michael they must get to the CDC in Lanta and help get all the diseases and cures out before the zombies get there and that stuff may hold any chance of finding a cure and Michael agreed and once they were dismissed they left. They flew out in a non-prop small airplane and they looked out the side windows and saw large pacts of zombies approaching in the distance and there are military jets that made passes dropping bombs, firing missiles and made strafing runs in the hopes of thinning the large clumps of zombies or slowing them down while gunships and helos flew over what they believe is the front and flew around making strafing runs or their door gunners fired. Carol said, \"Do you believe there is any chance of these people surviving this madness?\", Michael said, \"I don't know.\", and their aircraft and the one behind them carrying the rest of the away team flew away from the approaching madness to Tall City. Once they landed in Lanta they were escorted to the CDC where it is already being evacuated and Carol left with the rest of the medical team as they helped loading all the diseases in safe containers for transportation and helped with the rest of the evacuation while Michael stood aside and called Law and told her to send down the security detail and the two regiments of security teams were all rematerialized on the surface and Michael told the team leaders to help gather all the equipment before the zombies arrive as they are within fifty miles from their position. They all hustled as fast as they could loading the large transport trucks that are about twice as high over an average person to climb on (due to the large wheels) and shuttling them to the airport where they are put on private blacked out transport aircrafts as they are flown to New Day where they have a new CDC building built. As Michael was carrying a box a figure jumped from a corner snarling as a zombie in a straight jacket and face mask appeared and Michael jumped back with his phaser drawn and yelped, \"DUDE WHAT THE FUCK!\", but the zombie pulled back as the holding stick leash jerked by Zombie Handler Kelley who also smacked the zombie's head to the wall and escorted it outside along with four other zombies with their handlers and Michael found the nearest senior doctor and asked why are they holding live zombies and was told they need them in case they need to test for a cure or something to kill them and Michael okayed it as long as they are away from him and the doctor told him they have a special aircraft waiting for them that is separated from everyone else. When they were finishing up they heard the growing sound of explosions and gunfire and Michael pulled out his communicator and ordered to beam up the security detail and Michael and Carol boarded the last transport truck and they drove away leaving an eerie quiet CDC. They followed the bus where the rest of the medical personnel are riding on as they drove through deserted streets littered with wrecked or abandon vehicles and other goods as people were not able to carry everything as they fled. They also passed through solid quiet neighborhoods with homes and stores either half empty or ransacked and Carol said, \"It's too quiet for my taste.\", they finally turned on the last street to the airfield only to find a massive hoard of civilians at the gates and Michael yelled, \"What the hell are they thinking?! Do they know the zombies are going to be here any minute?!\", the bus in front of them is crawling forward trying to make its way in and Michael called the bus driver on the radio and told him to drive through faster or else these people will tear them apart. The bus picked up speed and they were almost on the airstrip with the last military transport in sight until the bus ran over a couple of people and it stopped and Michael yelled over the radio to get moving but they watched in horror (except Michael looked angry) as the riot tipped the bus over on its right side pinning the people within and a couple of cocktails were thrown at it and they began to try to turn their transport truck over as well. Michael yelled for them to get to the bus and force the backdoor open to get them out while he takes care of the riot. He then smashed the side window as he pulled out his phaser and fired a few shots into the crowd set on stun and the people pulled back a little giving Carol and the others to get out while Michael followed behind and when the reached the back of the bus with the people inside screaming as the fire spread Michael (with little effort) tore the back door off with his right hand and Carol helped get the people out. They heard the sound of snarling and moaning and the people either started running away or began coming after them again. Michael then pulled out both sets of phasers and fired at the angry mob that was charging after them and they still kept on coming. Michael yelled for them to run and they all ran with Michael behind and the drivers fired their assault rifles into the crowd and as they reached the field Michael saw the zombies breaking into the airfield and began attacking the mob still coming after them and they all began sprinting towards the aircraft as Michael ran while continued to fire. The transport was already pulling forward on the tarmac and Carol and everyone else boarded the back ramp except Michael. Carol yelled, \"MICHAEL, RUUUUUN!\", and Michael heard her over the roaring props and he stopped firing as he was running back and sprinted towards the aircraft. The transport moved faster and faster down the tarmac and Carol yelled back for the pilot to slow down but he said, \"We can't, or else we would not have enough room!\", they all watched as Michael ran faster and faster while the zombies gave and mob gave chase and he got closer and closer breathing heavily as he ran as hard as he could. The transport then lifted off and Michael jumped just as when the ramp rim was almost as high up as his head and landed halfway in. He then began to slid back out and he clambered crazily on the flat ramp trying to grab hold of something and Carol just grabbed one of his hands and stopped him from slipping. Michael was pulled up all the way and the ramp fully closed and he sat on the folded out side seats and breathed heavily as Carol said, \"Out of breath? I thought a cyborg like you should be able to run with no problems.\", Michael (breathing heavily) said, \"Shut up.\", Carol, Michael and the others looked out the windows to see the mob gave up the chase but were quickly consumed by the zombies that were chasing them from the start turning the tarmac into one large feeding ground. The transport later landed at New Day and Michael and the others stepped off as personnel vehicles were waiting for them and Michael told Carol he is going to the command center and she and the others should rest before they leave again and before Carol could protest he jumped in the vehicle and told the driver to drive off leaving her stammering and furious as she stomped away. When he arrived at a large tent Michael was escorted inside and he past another large map with various commanders around it to another tent in the back that was connected and saw a large tv screen and a different man sat behind the so called leader's desk and they were both left alone when he told Michael that he is the new leader as the last one was narrow minded and he told Michael that as of now Michael is in charge and once this zombie epidemic is over Michael will find what lead to this catastrophe and report before he leaves. When Michael left the separate tent and entered the conference room with the large map he asked the status of the spread and was told by a general that they have reached Indy, Louis, Charleton and are ten miles north of Capital City. Another general told him in the South they have reached Mob City, Chat, Column and Myrtle and Michael looked over the chart and sees what they are described and tells them that the bottleneck between Louis and Chat must be held open at all costs so the forces and civilians east can escape. He also says, \"Blow up bridges, roads, tunnels or any type of path that those things can cross.\", general, \"Sir what if we can't?\", Michael said, \"Then bury it! Cause rock slides, mud slides, blow up damns! Hell, even create a wall with derelict vehicles! Just as long as they can't pass!\", one of the generals asked why can't the Challenger fire its weapons to do this job and Michael told them the ship is still undergoing repairs from the last battle and its weapons system is out of commission. Michael told them that he is going to Louis to assess the situation of the evacuation and no one spoke in protest before he left. The small private jet left the tarmac with Michael and Carol onboard and Carol told him that the medical away team has beamed back onto the Challenger to study the results and their examinations to see if they can find the right cure for the virus and as she told him she and then Michael noticed the streets and highways below are clogged with vehicles and people leaving the cities and towns and headed toward the safe zones. They also saw large groups of people crossing through either fields or forests around the clogged roads till the pilot announced they are arriving at Louis. When they reached the city they saw zombies either running or stumbling into the river and tried getting across but the forces on the other side shot at them both with sniper and automatic rifle fire and they also fired artillery into the river as well. Their aircraft landed and Michael was taken straight to the forward command base while Carol went to the main medical facility in the center of the city. Once Michael arrived at the forward command base the commander called out to him and Michael followed him till he noticed they were all alone inside one of the tents and he said in a low tone, \"Mr. Valkyrie we have to evacuate and leave now.\", Michael looked concerned and said, \"Why?\", the commander showed him a thermal red image of the bottom of the river and said, \"This is before the zombie hoards arrived.\", he then showed him another and another and each one grew brighter red and said, \"These images show they are falling to the bottom and every time more arrive and sink they fill up the bottom and are making the river shallow with their bodies.\", Michael said, \"Can you stop them?\", the commander said, \"We are using artillery to blast them but we do not have enough guns or ammo to stop them all.\", Michael said, \"How much time?\", the commander said, \"A day, two the most.\". At the medical center Carol was standing at the front desk and asked where Dr. Woo is and over the loud commotion the attendant asked why and Carol told her she is the acting doctor from the USS Challenger and according to her sources Dr. Woo is of extreme importance. The attendant said, \"He maybe in B wing! I can't call cause the lines are down so I can't help you out from here!\", Carol pushed her way through the crowd of nurses, doctors and injured patients till she reached what she believes is the B wing and to her luck a doctor bumped into her and she noticed it was him from one of the archive images at the CDC and she called out his name. He looked at her and she told him who she is and she wanted to ask him about the zero patient of the epidemic. Without saying a word he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her outside as she looked both angry and surprised and was unable to break his grip as he hurried outside where suddenly he let her go when they are alone behind a corner and he said in a low and stern voice, \"There is no zero patient.\", Carol (still angry by him grabbing her) said, \"Why?\", the doctor explained to her that once he got there the whole town of Lock was quarantined and half the people were already infected. He was told the hospital apparently let the people go and told them to stay indoors because the hospital was unable to respond to all their patients due to the doctors and nurses reporting to work less and less. Woo then explained that he went over the reports before is started to fall apart and found out it started when four teenagers were fooling around in the woods till they saw an object fall from the sky and crashed deeper into the forest and they followed it but when they came out they were fine at first but then they became more tired throughout the daytime the next couple of days until all of a sudden they seemed to just die in their sleep. Their bodies were taken to the morgue and were about to perform an autopsy when all of a sudden one of them reanimated and bit one of the doctors over him. They were able to secure the reanimated corpse and the others before they also awoke and struggled under the restraints and the doctor that was bitten was treated as if he was bitten by a wild animal and was let go for the rest of the day. Woo also said he asked the military commander that reported to the town about the location and the whereabouts of the object that fell from space and he was told the defense force destroyed it in a matter of national security. Without the object where the disease originated from Woo said he tried to find a cure to this disease the best he could but without success. Dr. Woo was able to figure out the runners are ones that have a very high metabolism and a stronger urge for hunger compared to the slow ones and based on his observations he ruled them as zombies. He urged the defense forces and the government to destroy the town but they refused and continued to send medical assistance and believed these people can be treated by this new form of rabies and he continued pushing his true findings and recommendations till the government ordered the CDC to fire him on the bases of insanity and obsession and that is how he ended up as a regular doctor in a hospital. Carol said, \"Do you still have the lab results for the cure?\", Woo said, \"No, it is pointless! I told you there is no cure, the only way to stop them is to destroy the brain!\", someone yelled, \"INCOMING!\", and Carol and Dr. Woo looked up to see a twin engined passenger liner flying down and everyone screamed as they took cover as the aircraft just barely missed them but smashed the roof of the building and on instinct Carol jumped into a large trash can and closed the hatch as debris fell on top and all around. As the liner came down directly towards Michael he jumped into the nearest ditch as the nose of the liner smashed the ground and created a path of destruction as flames raced over Michael's back as he laid down face forward while above the command base was whipped out as the liner made impact and one of the artillery batteries was smashed by the left wing of the liner and consumed by flames as the gunners and soldiers screamed and the liner ran into a large ammo depot and created a large explosion sending bullets, bombs and artillery shells all around causing secondary explosions that blasted apart other battery positions nearby and trench lines where the soldiers were trying to take cover but end up being trapped as flames and unexploded ammo rained down on them as they yelled and screamed. When the explosions ceased and the flames stopped blowing over him Michael got up and saw a path of destruction and fire and saw a lot of dead bodies when he heard moaning sounds and some of the dead soldiers including the commanding officer stood up and began stumbling towards him. Carol peered out of the trash can and saw people stumbling around as some of them cried in pain and she got out and looked around to find Dr. Woo only to find out he is gone. She looked around and saw people coming out of the hospital with doctors and nurses helping the injured to get out of the building. She then noticed a woman on the ground with a broken arm next to what appears to be a dead body and Carol began administering first aid for the woman until the dead person right beside her jumped and bit her broken arm as she screamed making Carol jump back but then immediately grabbed the zombies head and tried pulling it away as it continued to chew till with growing frustration and anger Carol cried out and ripped its head off with all her strength. She then heard more screams and moaning mixed with snarling noises as more dead bodies reanimated all around and inside the building. Carol started running as did everyone else and she saw ambulances trying to drive away with patients inside but the zombies swarmed after them causing them to wreck and she saw another ambulance as a few zombies jumped on the back of one and yanked the back doors open and leapt inside while patients inside screamed and the ambulance swerved uncontrollably and ran over a few people which later reanimated before ramming into a telephone pole and it fell knocking down a medical tent with patients inside setting it on fire as people screamed within as they desperately tried to get out. As she continued to run she saw people around her continued to scream but then noticed she was in the middle of a feasting ground as zombies began attacking and either eating everyone or just bit them and created more zombies as Carol slid beneath a car and watched and counted \"1 1000, 2 1000, 3 1000, 4 1000, 5 1000, 6 1000...\", and she watched as one of the bitten began flopping on the ground making gurgling sounds, shivering and his eyes rolled back and when she said, \"10 1000.\", the infected person stopped shivering and it slowing got up and began moaning as it looked around and stumbled away in the confusion as the zombies were mixed in with the non infected. She remained under the vehicle looking around scared but tried to remain calm when she saw to her shock an old couple walking through the middle of the chaos as zombies ran or stumbled past or around them completely ignoring them as they attacked other people as she ignored the fact she was being beamed away. When she rematerialized on the transporter pad Crow was there waiting for her but she heard loud noises coming from behind him and as she stood up as Crow scanned her she noticed Michael was yelling at the transporter chief as to why he was beamed back on the Challenger till Gross appeared and said, \"I gave the order.\", Michael said, \"Why?\", Gross said, \"We have received word that New Day is being attacked by zombies within the city. They also report people that are dead and not bitten by zombies are being reanimated. The Capital, Rich and Will have gone dark but we are receiving transmissions of resistance or survivors within.\", Michael yelled, \"FUCK!\", Carol said, \"Sir, when I was on the surface I saw an old couple walking through the chaos as zombies were running around them as if they are not even there. I think there is something but I need to analyze any old person on the surface so I can have more data and find out why they are being ignored.\", Michael said, \"You got it, but once we are transported behind the Thendore Mountain chain.\", she and Crow left as Michael pressed the call button and Michael said, \"Lt. Law, inform whoever is in charge of the Thendore Mountain defenses to destroy the passes and seal all passageways into the western safe zone and tell those in the central area to form their own safe zones and to seal the gates and blow the roads and bridges to the Main River Barrier and have those trapped on the other side to spread out and find a safe place to hole up and tell them about the current situation using all channels and frequencies.\", Law said, \"Yes sir.\", Michael began working on the controls on the transporter and said, \"Beam me to these coordinates in the safe zone.\", and the chief complied. Gross said, \"Sir before you go I think...\", Michael stepped up on the pad and waved her off and said, \"Not now commander, energize!\", he rematerialized on the surface of a rocky terrain of a hill with soldiers and people running about excitedly and yelling till a female voice boomed out, \"GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASSES AND DO AS YOU ARE TOLD NOW!\", and Michael looked around with surprise and concern as he thought to himself that voice sounded familiar till he looked up at the top where he saw what appears to be a command tent and started moving up till his eyes popped open and he yelled, \"WHAT?\". In the command tent surrounded by various military and political figures Michael stood face to face with Chloe and a commander whispered to a politician, \"Do you see anything that makes them attracted to each other?\", and the politician shakes his hand \"so so\". Michael said, \"I still do not want you here!\", Chloe said, \"Well tough luck captain.\", and Michael looked furious but turned away and faced the holographic table and charts with the others surrounding it and said, \"So what's the situation.\", he was told that all the mountain passes are sealed as instructed and word has been passed down to all commanders east of the mountains to hold onto their positions and to destroy all dead bodies no matter if they died under natural causes and Michael still sees the concerned faces of all of them and asks, \"So what's the problem?\", and he is told the people from the east not attached to any military units are still coming to the sealed passageways demanding to be let in and the chaos on their end of finding bodies of dead people not attacked by zombies is proceeding slowly. One of the generals asked Michael if his people found the cure yet and Michael told them that his chief medical officer may have something and she is now testing her theory. A politician then said he recommends they go on the offensive and some of them shook their heads and they started to agree with him till Michael said, \"Not until our side is safe and all the chickens in the hen house have settled down.\", there was silence as they all looked at him confused and Chloe said sarcastically, \"Chickens in the hen house, nice analogy.\", and Michael rolled his shoulders and said, \"Sort of fits.\", then Michael asked where is the acting president and they all spoke low to each other until a military commander said, \"He is trying to find a place where he can put his office.\", Chloe said, \"Tell your president if it's not an inconvenience he should get here so he can help save whatever is left of his country or make himself a high class meal for the zombies when they compromise the safe zone.\", they all looked at her stunned while Michael smirked and then his communicator goes off and when he answered Carol spoke, \"Captain I have found the reason why the zombies won't attack these old people. It appears that if someone is terminally ill or has a very weak immune system these zombies will completely ignore them. Unfortunately we cannot simply infect someone with a dangerous disease to act as a camouflage because these diseases on the planet will kill the hosts and even if we could vaccinate them the zombies can tell if someone is recovering from any form of sickness.\", Michael looked depressed and thanked her. Michael then got everyone's attention and told them all what Carol told him and they all looked depressed as well and one of them said, \"Great, what are we going to do now?\", and Michael said, \"We are going to proceed as planned and make sure all the normally died people are truly dead.\", one of the generals asked if they can try to get people out of the hot zones or at least give them supplies and Michael told them they could get them out but it would have to be quick but resupply is not an option unless they can find a way to mask the noise of their aircraft so they won't alert all the zombies in the area plus most of the aircraft right now are needed to establish the safe zone. A scientist in the room said they can use remote control gliders to carry the supplies to them. Michael agreed and he said he will have the Challenger send their shuttles to help them speed up the building and supplies in the safe zone and beam down security and medical teams for assistance. The shuttles from the Challenger descended through the atmosphere as the other starship finally rendezvoused and began landing and unloading supplies and equipment as away teams from both medical and security beamed down and began assisting the crews, civilians and military personnel on the surface till all the excitement started settling down and the people began living normal lives within. An assembly was called and all the commanders are assembled in an auditorium and the President arrived as Michael and Chloe looked on. He thanked everyone for coming especially Michael and Chloe and he revealed his plan that they are going to attack the zombies and reclaim the homes they have lost to these monster hordes. He looked to a couple of generals and admirals to his right and said he has divided the offensive into two phases. The large ultra tv screen behind him came on and showed the map of the entire country with 2/3 covered in black to stand as the occupied zone of the zombies and he continued to speak as he pointed with a long stick on the map. The first phase is for all ships along the shoreline and artillery and heavy gun crews to unleash a bombardment to destroy as many of them as they could and attract them away from the boundary. The second phase is for establishing beachheads, reclaiming the coastal cities and maintain a defensive posture as their main forces in the mountains attack in a three prong maneuver. One will move along the North securing the northern territories, another will move through the central area while the southern group will move south to where they believe is the most heavily infested area and link up with the secured coastal cities and move up to link up with the central forces and eventually with the North and whip out the zombies once and for all. Everyone in the auditorium clapped and cheered as Michael and Chloe looked humbled and Chloe whispered, \"He makes it sound so easy.\", and Michael said, \"Shhh, don't jinx us!\", and Chloe smiled. Once the applause stopped the President told them the offensive will begin the day after tomorrow and once they start this will be a blitzkrieg maneuver so the conflict will end quickly and avoid any chances the zombies could swarm and the meeting was adjourned. Unfortunately the rest of the civilian population also knew and they came to the mountains either to celebrate or protest and the whole area next to the mountain barrier was crowded and Michael had multiple squads of security with him and Chloe when they begin the offensive. Then people began shouting through a couple of loudspeakers and other the other side of the mountain barrier the zombies heard the noise from the loudspeakers and at first a few zombies began clawing the sides of the mountains and eventually more and more arrived and they ended up on top of each other and started clambering on top of each other and up the side of the mountains. As they wait for the word to begin Michael and Chloe sat down to rest and eat and Michael asked her if she is ready and Chloe replied, \"That's a stupid question.\", Michael laughed and then he stopped and looked around concerned before standing up and Chloe looked at him worried and said, \"Michael, what's the matter?\", he walked away towards the mountain's edge as he was hearing a low continuing rumbling sound like thunder as security looked at him with an odd expression as well. As Michael got closer and closer to the edge the sound got louder and Michael looked over and saw a massive horde of zombies climbing over each other and even though lots of them fell they still kept climbing and Michael looked wide eyed and said in a low voice, \"Oh shit.\", and Chloe looked over as well and looked shocked. Michael and Chloe yelled to the security teams what they saw and they ran to the nearest command center and Michael yelled, \"THEY'RE CLIMBING UP THE WALL! START THE ATTACK NOW AND GET RID OF THOSE LOUDSPEAKERS AND CIVILIANS! THEY ARE ATTRACTING THE ZOMBIES!\", all the soldiers radios went off and they jumped up from resting or relaxing and began hauling their gear to the edge of the mountains and began firing downwards ranging from assault rifles to gatling guns. Attack helicopters flew over the side and saw the massive hordes of zombies climbing over each other to get to the top and the helicopters started firing along the middle of the climbing hordes including the door gunners and the pilots reported their findings over the radio. As they continued firing downwards some of the zombies got over and began running to the nearest body only to have their heads explode from phaser fire from the red uniformed security teams from the Challenger then more zombies came over and one jumped on one of the red shirts and he tried holding it back as it snapped its teeth at his face till all of a sudden it was thrown off and a red armored soldier with a Neo-Zeon crest stabbed the zombie in the face with his long musket like rifle with a bayonet at the end. Neo-Zeon Knight yelled, \"YAHOO!\", and more of them appeared from behind and gave the rebel yell as they charged and either chopped the zombies heads off, stabbed their faces in the ground or fired bolts of light from their rifles blasting holes through the zombies bodies or exploded their heads. They even shoved the zombies back with their rifles as the knights behind them gave them covering fire and either shoved them or threw them back over the edge like rag dolls. In the chaos some zombies even grabbed some of the Defense Forces soldiers along the edge and either pulled or threw them over to the zombies below. Chloe (The Green Comet) first fired her handguns at the hordes but when they came over the edge she pulled out her swords and either chop their heads off or stab them through their heads. Michael was firing his phaser repeatedly like a machine gun blasting apart the zombies trying to make it over the edge till he saw one running up behind the Green Comet and Michael yelled, \"CHLOE!\", and he ran, grabbed the zombie with his right hand on its back collar threw it past the edge a good few feet before falling to the bottom and the Green Comet yelled (over the firing and zombie snarling), \"Sorry, won't happen again!\", and before Michael could reply the president's voice came on over their radios and said, \"Begin phase two!\", and then all the artillery guns, tanks, aircraft and helicopters unleashed their arsenal either at the zombies climbing over the mountain wall or in the roads, fields and highways behind them vaporizing large groups of zombies while others were either shredded to pieces or burned from the fires created by the explosions and the same goes to the naval forces as they fired their gun batteries into the coastal cities. When the intense fire ceased there were multiple large explosions as the sealed tunnels exploded knocking down or whipping out any zombies that were standing around the entrances leaving a cloud of smoke and dust till bolts of light fired forth and soldiers ran out firing as motorized or hovering vehicles appeared behind as they began their offensive. The Neo-Zeon Knights and Challenger security personnel attached climbing gear as did Michael and the Green Comet and Michael said to one of the knights, \"What are you doing here?\", and the knight said, \"Lord Deikun thought you needed some assistance and he is in orbit above us!\", and Michael just shook his head and smiled. Once the tunnels were blown they repelled down as they saw soldiers with blaster and automatic rifles firing with others using flamethrowers setting fires to multiple zombie corpses as tanks and personnel carriers followed behind. More zombies appeared beneath their dead comrades and started moving towards them and the knights, security personnel, Michael and the Green Comet began firing their rifles and phasers as they continued to repel down and when they reached the bottom and detached their repelling gear helicopters began flying over the area and began laying fire giving the forces aerial cover. The knights started hacking or clubbing away with their rifles or firing while the Green Comet pulled out her swords and Michael pulled out two large knives and began fighting hand to hand stabbing or slicing the zombies heads off. The Neo-Zeon Knights worked together as one grabbed a zombie from behind while another bayoneted its face as another knight saw a couple of zombies coming behind the Green Comet and he ran, tackled both of them as he screamed and immediately pulled out his rifle and in one swing smashed both their heads apart with the butt of his rifle. Michael continued to stab into the temples of the zombies or sliced their throats before shoving his knives through the bottom of their jaws not knowing that he was being surrounded as he continued to fight savagely. Four of the knights noticed Michael being surrounded and one yelled, \"TO THE VALKYRIE!\", and they all yelled as they charged and swung their bayonets slicing zombies in their way or stabbing them either in the face or body before blasting them apart as they barreled in to Michael's assistance and used their shields to shove the zombies away as they charged past Michael and shoved their rifles either over or in between their shields and fired their rifles. A knight jumped over his comrades with a large knife in hand and sliced off two zombies heads off in one stroke, stab another directly over its head and into its brain and ripped its head off as he was pulling the knife out. He then turned and sliced off another zombie's head and he stabbed another in the belly and looped the head off of another before throwing the body over him knocking a few of them down before the rest of the knight's comrades joined in the savage fight. In the chaos Michael continued to fire his phaser rapidly till the zombies were almost on top of him and in his vision the words \"TERMINATE\" appeared and all the zombies were targeted by crosshairs and Michael's eyes glistened red and he fired faster till the zombies swarmed over him as he didn't say a word as they snarled, grabbed him and dragged him down. The Green Comet saw this and she screamed, \"NOOOO!\", and she ran towards him stabbing one zombie in the face with a knife and used its head as she jumped on it before pulling the knife out and sliced off a few zombies heads. She jumped off the zombie and pulled out both her swords and began slicing her way through to Michael yelling, \"HOLD ON MICHAEL! I'M COMING!\", and as she sliced her way through heads, limbs, various body parts, organs and purple ooze flew in the air and all around her till all of a sudden she saw zombies thrown up in the air as if they were blown off someone or something and the Green Comet ducked and covered her face as they fell on top of her as they lost their balance. Instead of attacking her they got up and moved away from her as she was being ignored and headed towards Michael's direction. She ignored this fact as she immediately continued slicing and stabbing her way forward till she stopped and looked shocked at what she saw. Michael appeared with almost half of his face torn away revealing with looked like the face of a T-800 as he grabbed a zombie by the throat, lifting it up, shoving his right hand into its stomach as he looked longly at it while driving his hand in and ripped part of its spine out before dropping the zombie and in one stomp on its face he crushed its skull. The zombies then came after him but as they did so Michael looked up showing no expression as the clothing around his forearms tore and his forearms and hands transformed into silver gatling guns and he fired shooting bolts of light as the zombies in front of him were ripped to pieces throwing bones, organs, limbs and purple liquid all over the place. The Green Comet stood shell shocked ignoring the zombies walking or running past her and Michael's lower body remained in place as his upper body turned clockwise making tearing/ripping sounds as his upper body turned making his skin rip as it couldn't follow. The Green Comet saw Michael turn in her direction and she ducted as over 12,000 plasma bolts per minute (from both gatling guns) fired over her covering her in purple liquid and slime. A zombie jumped on Michael's back and began biting him on the left shoulder only making metal clanking sounds as it chewed into his shoulder and ran into his metal inner skin. Michael swung his left arm/gatling gun and knocked the zombie off before firing at point blank range in its face throwing purple liquid and chunks all over Michael's face and body (leaving only his one robotic and one normal eyes untouched) as he fired and ripped apart the zombie's body from face to toe as Michael yelled till only the zombie's arms and legs remained. Then another zombie jumped on top of him and knocked Michael onto his back and before the zombie could bite him as it snarled Michael locked both gatling guns to the sides of its face and there was a cocking sound of two shotguns before the zombie's head exploded. Michael quickly got up and as more zombie's charged after him he repeatedly fired the shotguns (where they are between the barrels of the gatling guns) at the zombies either blowing them in half, blew apart their limbs before their heads or directly exploded their heads till there was a huge explosion next to him and Michael fell to his knees as the zombies were blown apart. He looked up and he saw a tank with a machine gun nest on top firing away at the zombies around him and the soldiers followed with rifles and flamethrowers and cleaned the area around him as some of the soldiers looked at him in shock seeing his robotic eye and half his face. Even though he kept an expressionless face Michael looked around and the Green Comet knew that he is confused and she walked up to him slowly and said, \"Michael, its over.\", and Michael snapped his head to her direction surprising her with one of his gatling guns drawn and the Green Comet stood her ground with her hands raised and she said in her continued calm voice, \"I'm unarmed.\", Michael scanned her and his display spelled, \"UNARMED\", and the Green Comet said, \"You may stand down. The area is secured.\", Michael looked around as if ignoring her and the Green Comet pulled off her mask and looked at him innocently while walking towards Michael till she was in arm's length and he looked at her again and she said, \"Please Michael.\", and she touched his metal cheek and said, \"Come back to me.\", and she continued to look at him innocently and Michael's display began to fluctuate as he looked at her sad and innocent face while lightly touching his cheek till all of a sudden his display snapped to normal sight and his robotic eye turned blue. Michael's expression then went from expressionless to a look of shock and breathed heavily as he stumbled and almost fell till Chloe caught him and said, \"Are you all right?\", Michael looked around still in a state of shock until he finally said, \"What, happened?\", Chloe said, \"I think in human terms you lost your cool.\", he looked down at her and saw she was covered in purple slime and he suddenly looked disgusted and flinched back and said, \"Eww! You look disgusting!\", Chloe frowned in anger but calmly said, \"You should see yourself pretty boy.\" As the offensive continued onward Michael and Chloe saw from the distance that as far as the eye can see the entire landscape was scorched earth or dead and they saw the ground was covered with limbs or bodily remains of the zombies that once covered the landscape as they tried to make their way to the mountain barrier. Chloe said, \"No wonder the president made it sound so easy.\", Michael said, \"Except they made this entire area uninhabitable, and this noise!\", Michael is referring to the tracked vehicles rolling over headless or dead zombies making crunching sounds as bones and skulls were crushed beneath their weight. They even encountered zombies that had no legs or unable to walk and they still moaned and snarled even as a tank rolled right over one crushing its skull, muscle and bones beneath its weight as it drove right over. Reports started coming in that the coastal cities were able to establish beachheads and take about half the cities encountering small groups of zombies till they reached the downtowns and encountered the rest of the population and with covering fire from air support and gunships (including survivors that are still able to fight) they were able to cleanse the cities. When the forces Michael and Chloe are attached to reached New Day they heard a radio report from a reconnaissance aircraft that the CDC is still secured but is attracting zombies throughout the surrounding area as they tried to climb over the perimeter wall. Michael immediately grabbed the handset in the tank and said, \"This is captain Michael Valkyrie in the Eight Ball, we'll take care of the CDC. Just make sure we have aerial support on standby in case we need them.\", the tank commander said, \"Sir that's almost five miles of city blocks and streets filled with dead people!\", Michael said, \"Then you are going to earn your pay today.\", tank gunner yelled out, \"RUNNERS!\", Michael and the tank commander looked through their scopes and they saw a large number of zombies growling or snarling as they ran towards them while others stumbled as they walked their way. Michael went on the radio and said, \"Platoon, batten down the hatches! We got an entire city coming down on top of us!\", as he watched the zombies coming after them Michael called for air support but was told that they are heading back to base to reload and Michael yelled, \"WE ARE NAKED DOWN HERE! OUR TROOPS CAN'T HOLD AGAINST AN ENTIRE CITY!\", a voice said, \"I'm sorry sir! The only support you will get from us is to drop spit balls on them! WE ARE OUT!\", Michael changed the radio dial and yelled, \"ALL TANKS, LET'EM HAVE IT! DO NOT LET ONE PASS!\", the tanks in formation ahead of the troops unleashed their firepower from both their machine guns and fired their main cannons blowing apart the zombies running at them but they still kept coming and Michael pushed the machine gunner inside the tank aside and yelled, \"GIVE ME THAT!\", and he fired shredding the zombies to pieces even as he yelled but they still kept on coming like a small tidal wave as they were almost on top of them till suddenly they were thrown back by an invisible force and some of the surrounding buildings exploded or were ripped apart by the same invisible tidal wave including abandoned vehicles and the zombies were ripped to pieces either in mid air or when they were about to hit the ground. Michael and the tank crew wooed at what they just saw and Michael looked around in his scope till he saw Carrie in a purple and black spandex type suit with her hands raised and her hair blowing forward as a constant gust of wind blew forward affecting everything in front of her till all the zombies ahead of them were incinerated and she dropped her hands and the wind stopped leaving the streets clear of zombies or dead people. Carrie breathed heavily as her pupils are still dilated and two large hands laid on her shoulders and a voice said, \"Calm.\", Carrie snapped her head to her right to look over her shoulder to see Arsenal standing behind her as he said again, \"Calm. Remain control.\", and she began control breathing and her pupils returned to normal and she began stumbling till Arsenal held her ribs and said, \"Steady.\", Michael watched as one of the gunner's said, \"We might as well sit back and let her clean up this town!\", Michael kicked him in the back as the gunner yelped and the gunner yelled, \"I'M NOT A FRICKING DOG YOU...\", the radio went off and heard reports that the survivors in the city are trying to fight back but they are being overrun by more zombies than they could handle. Michael got the radio and called back to base to send aircraft to pull them out and was told, \"Yes captain, we have more than enough aircraft to handle this due to we are running low of explosives.\", Michael said, \"What! Pull out your reserves!\", commander's voice, \"We have been captain, and as a result we almost have nothing left!\", after a few moments of silence Michael said, \"To all commanders, continue forward. Make sure you use silencers. If you see any large groups report immediately and if you have any doubts of attacking them then don't engage.\", the soldiers then proceeded to check every building from block to block with soldiers on the rooftops looking down ahead of the columns for zombies that are obstructed from the view of the rest of the forces and fortified every odd building (not destroyed by Carrie's power) as they slowly continued forward. They finally reached the CDC eliminating either lone or small groups of zombies in their path as they saw the zombies outside the compound were crushed up against the wall surrounding the place as Carrie's wrath had extended to their destination and the people within the compound started to cheer till the soldiers either made signs for them to be quiet or in one instance a soldier ran up to one of the defenders and clamped a hand over his mouth and said, \"Shut up moron! I don't want to be their next meal!\", one of the tanks opened and Carol emerged along with her sister Chloe and said, \"Who is the senior doctor here?\", one of the soldiers pointed inside and she went in as the rest of the soldiers helped secure a perimeter while in the meantime she asked the doctors and the senior in the CDC that during their time isolated did they find any cure or weapon that they can use against the zombies. They told her they found a weapon they can use to liquify the zombies brain and make them die instantly and told her it can be delivered either as a gas form or insert the chemical in the projects or tools used to kill them and they can hit anywhere in the zombie's body and the chemical would work up to its brain and will perform its work. In the meantime Michael sat inside the command tank as the rest of the crew went outside to either eat or relax as he listened to the radio of reports coming in from everywhere else in the offensive as he sat looking tired and he heard Carol's voice on the radio as she cut in and told him what she had learned inside and showing no excitement he acknowledged her report and set the radio channel to high command and relayed it. Michael was then told that Can City is having problems and they need reinforcements and Michael said, \"I'll be there and fix their problem. Send one of your jet helos to pick us up.\", Michael got out of the command tank and saw the Green Comet and the Neo Zeon Knights waiting for him and Michael smirked as the non propelled helos landed, boarded the aircraft and they took off heading towards Can City. Once they are airborne Michael was handed a headset with a glass shield from the copilot and he said, \"For you captain!\", and when Michael put it on it showed a 3D map of the country with areas highlighted which are secured and which areas are still infested. The president's voice came over the headset and told Michael that he heard about the BD (Brain Dead) virus that could kill the zombies and his military officials have already implemented a plan to have all aircraft equip with gas canisters and spread this virus through the air over the eastern region and once that's completed all the soldier's will have darts instead of bullets to clean out the rest of the zombies that haven't been affected and was told by his scientists that the virus only affects dead tissue so the soldiers or civilians will not be affected. The pilot said (over the roar of the engine above), \"Sir, we have reached our destination!\", Michael said, \"I'll call you back later Mr. President!\", he removed the helmet and saw the Green Comet was glued to the window ignoring Michael as he called out to her till he saw exactly what she is seeing and looked shocked and said, \"Oh, my, god.\", the city was in total chaos as fires were ragging out of most of the skyscrapers and various self propelled weapons or rockets flew blindly from one part of the city to the other. They also noticed that a few tanks and mortars were firing on a building where zombies were either lying over the sides or trying to get out and fall into the streets below. There were also soldiers running out of the buildings with a lot of zombies chasing after them making areas that were secured now filled with zombies. Michael told the pilot to take them to the command post in the city and the pilot radioed before the jet helicopters flew off. Once the jet helos landed Michael and the Green Comet were taken to the command post just outside the helo pads and saw that the commanders were already assembled and waiting for them. Michael looked astonished, threw his arms out and yelled, \"Dudes! What the hell is going on?!\", the Green Comet and the others looked at him confused and she said, \"Michael, you have to stop saying that. It means absolutely no sense.\", but Michael looked like he was ignoring her when he was told by one of the commanders that they entered the city and everything was running smoothly until they entered the heart of the city where the banks are and when they began entering them the zombies stampeded down the large buildings down to the streets and they could not contain the waves of zombies coming out but they are able to contain them within the city but the troops inside are in disarray and there is no definite frontline or established perimeter to contain them and as a result they are everywhere and aerial reconnaissance cannot tell who is a zombie or not unless they see the muzzle flashes of their weapons at night. Michael said, \"Are we in contact with anyone inside?\", a army commander said, \"Yes sir, but the lines are jammed requesting assistance from various areas in the city.\", Michael said, \"Retrofit as many of your jet helicopters as you can with loudspeakers and have the pilots order the soldiers in the streets closest to the skyscrapers to get indoors and secure the stairs and elevators leading up to the upper floors and the same goes to the soldiers outside the city center as well till reinforcements arrive. I am going to one of the skyscrapers and assess the situation from within.\", all the commanders began talking either confused or shocked and the Green Comet said, \"Are you serious?!\", Michael smiled and said, \"Come on, we fought in this kind of situation before!\", the Green Comet said, \"Yea but people were trying to shoot us not eat us!\", Michael said, \"Excuses, excuses. Since when did you decide to become a fairy all of a sudden?\", the Green Comet rolled her eyes and sighed. The jet propelled helos flew into the city and Michael and the Green Comet looked down to see the troops starting to resume forward while at the same time liberating those that fortified themselves into various buildings. As they reached the target skyscraper they flew around to make sure the rooftop was secure before they landed. When the helo carrying Michael and the Green Comet landed the Neon Knights were waiting for them as their choppers were the first ones to arrive and Michael drew his phaser while the Green Comet drew her swords and Michael said, \"Do it.\", and to their surprise the first Zeon soldier ran up and rammed the door down before the rest of the soldiers charged through but quietly. The knights used the stairs and they walked down one step at a time, with Michael as the third person back and the Green Comet in the rear. As they carefully moved fast down the stairs trying not to make any noise Michael looked over the railing and saw a never ending stairs barely lit and said, \"I hate to be the person on the bottom if someone barfs.\", and one of the knights said, \"Sir.\", and Michael looked to see one of the Zeon knights standing in front of a closed door and Michael said, \"Might as well start somewhere. Go ahead, but quietly.\", he opened the door and there was a loud crook as one of the zombies charged at the knight and he quickly stabbed his blade to the hilt into the zombie's forehead before falling motionless. Loud crooks, snarls and moans echoed through the building and Michael made a face and said, \"Damn it I said quietly! Now we're fucked!\", they all drew their weapons and aimed them down the staircase as they heard the sound of multiple footfalls growing and Michael said, \"Raise shields and charge forward! Those on the left side mind the doors and watch your motion sensors! Same goes for the rear!\", they watched as a massive horde of zombies appeared coming up the staircase and as they leaped at the knights with their shields up they either bounced off or stumbled back and many of them fell over the side or knocked their comrades down behind. A Zeon Knight yelled, \"HAIL ZEON!\", and all the knights echoed the call and they drew their rifle blasters or swords and they surged forward forcing the zombies back or pushed/threw them over the side and down the stair shaft. They moved down a dozen or so floors till one of the knights told Michael that they are running out of energy for their rifles and Michael yelled, \"Get out of the stairwell!\", and the next door they reached (after they checked the coast was clear) they all poured in while keeping the zombies at bay till the last knight threw a small device down the stairs and jumped in just when there was a large explosion and the knights surrounding him barricaded the door with furniture and various loose items before there was multiple poundings and snarls, moans and hisses on the other side. As the zombies continued to pound on the barricade Chloe yelled, \"Great plan dumbbell! Now how are we supposed to get out of here!\", Michael looked around and out the windows behind and saw they were more than two dozen stories up and he said, \"Uh, just give me a minute.\", the barricade then started to break apart and some of the zombies appeared showing their grotesque faces and tried to claw their way through and Chloe yelled, \"We don't have a minute!\", Michael then pulled out his sword he had hidden and said, \"Those of you that have swords or sharp objects, prepare to fuck them up! Those that don't, just bash their heads in and keep them from...\", all of the sudden the entire wall facing them collapsed and a massive horde of zombies came pouring in and started jumping on top of all of them before they knew it as the knights started to scream. Michael sliced the head off of one before he was jumped and held another at bay as a zombie (more of a skeleton) began chomping its jaws at his face while being held back by Michael's sword at its throat. Michael looked away at his right to see his wife but lost sight of her as she was engulfed by them as she screamed in anger and Michael yelled, \"CHLOE!\". All of a sudden he heard a loud explosion above and flames shot from behind the zombie as it was engulfed by flames and Michael covered his face with his left forearm. As he tried to look up he saw an outline of a female figure with her arms out and hair flowing up with solid black eyes when all of a sudden he felt himself falling as he heard the sound of crushing/falling cement blocks and steel as he noticed the building was falling apart around him. He tried to grab hold of anything as the flames dissipated but found himself suddenly bouncing/slamming about hitting cement debris and steel till his vision went black. When it ceased the whole ground was covered with ash and burnt debris and rubble till there was a small disturbance as some of the ash fell away little by little. Then it all flew back as a figure jumped up screaming and Michael turned wildly only to notice he was the only one standing and almost covered in black and grey with the exception of his eyes. Michael said as he breathed heavily, \"What the fuck?\", he then heard the sound of choppers and he looked up to see them flying with their jet engines spraying the BD gas all over the city where he then started hearing popping or dropping sounds as zombies began falling like flies all over the city even falling from the sides of tall buildings or skyscrapers to the ground below. Michael suddenly looked around noticing he was alone and yelled, \"Chloe!\", and he began pushing or digging through the ash and debris trying to find her as the Zeon Knights started to get up moaning or groaning with pain and Michael kept yelling Chloe's name till suddenly a female voice yelled, \"Shut the fuck up! I heard you the first time!\", and Michael looked to see her with her Green Comet uniform torn and frayed as she pushed away large pieces of false wall off her. Michael said, \"Are you okay?\", Chloe said, \"Now that's a stupid question after falling a good few stories. Which how the hell did we survive that?\", Michael responded as he looked back, \"Maybe you should ask your sister.\", and Chloe and the others looked to see Carrie emerging from the fog from where the center of the building was and walked calmly towards them. Michael said, \"I guess the Challenger was able to replicate the gas to spread throughout the city?\", Carrie said, \"Yes. Gross also wanted me to tell you that they also were able to install the gas into the torpedoes and fired them at various parts of the country.\", Michael replied, \"And why couldn't she notify me through my communicator?\", Carrie said, \"Because it's broken.\", he looked at his belt and pulled it out to notice the controls are smashed and said with a dumb look, \"Oh.\", Chloe said, \"I'll notify the Challenger and tell them...\", before she could finish they were all suddenly in the transporter room and the transporter chief looked up in shock and yelped, \"What the...!\", the knights, Chloe and Michael looked around in shock and Michael said, \"Where's Carrie?\", and Chloe replied, \"Don't ask me.\" Arsenal entered his quarters and dropped off his belt with his communicator and other equipment from the surface and was about to walk out till he noticed the light is on in the bathroom. He went close to the door and hears Carrie whispering and when he knocked on the door and asked her if she is all right she stops and begins to sobs quietly. He opened the door and notices she is wearing a black spandex/armor uniform as she was kneeling on the floor. He kneels down to her and lightly touches her left shoulder as she looked away from him as she was shaking lightly and he asks, \"Okay?\", and Carrie replied, \"I felt her. I felt my mother when I killed those zombies and tore down that building, and I enjoyed it. Its if she has possessed me.\", Arsenal replied, \"Michael and Chloe.\", and Carrie said, \"I know, but I still felt her. I just got them away in case I started killing again.\", Arsenal was about to caress her and she said, \"Can I please be alone for a while? I'll be fine.\", Arsenal had a look of sadness as he turned away and closed the door behind him, but when he came back later he saw she was still in the bathroom but lying on the floor asleep. Arsenal closed the door behind him and he lied on the floor behind her and caressed her as they both lie on the bathroom floor. In the transporter room Michael went to the control console and called the bridge and Gross said, \"Captain are we done?\", Michael said, \"It's a little complicated, what's the status on the surface?\", Gross said, \"It looks like this conflict would be ending soon cause we are getting messages from people that are hiding in the hot zones that the zombies are falling like dominos.\", Michael said, \"Good, send a message to Arsenal to check up on Carrie.\", Gross said, \"Is there a problem?\", Michael said, \"Maybe, I just want him to make sure. Notify me or Chloe of any changes on the surface, I am going to my quarters to take a nap.\", everyone around him in the transporter room looked at him confused and even Gross said, \"Sir did you say you are going to take a nap?\", Michael said, \"That's affirmative Ms. Gross.\", and when he started to leave Chloe said, \"Seriously, in a time like this!\", Michael whirled back with his hands out and said, \"What else is there to do? The zombies are almost eliminated and we are all safe back onboard with the ship ready to launch more of that gas in case anymore zombies are still roaming about. I don't know about you but I am taking FULL advantage of this and get a nice, long, rest.\", and he looked at her smug before walking out of the transporter room towards his quarters with Chloe running after him leaving the Zeon Knights looking at each other dumb until one said, \"What the hell are we supposed to do?\", one of the rolled his shoulders and grunted, \"I don't know.\" while the others scratched their own heads confused. In the dark quarters of Michael and Chloe, there was a low beeping sound as Chloe was woken up in a silent shock and she saw the computer monitor light bouncing off the wall and she looked back to see Michael sitting in front of his computer and she heard him say in a low tone, \"Excellent, give their president my regards and prepare to leave orbit. I'll be on the bridge in a half hour.\", he turned off the monitor but as soon as he did the lamp light came on and he turned to see Chloe sitting up on the backboard with the covers just covering her chest and she said, \"Now tell me.\", Michael said, \"Sorry, I forgot to turn off my alarm.\", Chloe said, \"Doesn't matter at this point.\", Michael said, \"Anyway I was just checking in on Arsenal and he said your sister is okay. She was just overwhelmed with her powers and needs to rest a little. Plus the zombie epidemic is now over on the surface and all the leaders placed all their security and civilians on alert in case there is one that is still about or if it flares up again. Lt. Law also said the nearby systems are also placed on alert in case the supply or transport ships are carrying anything infected.\", Chloe said, \"Then I guess we are finished here.\", Michael replied, \"We are.\", in a swift motion Chloe threw back the covers and grabbed Michael's pants and threw it to him and said, \"Get dressed.\", to Michael's surprise. The turbo lift doors opened and Michael struggled to keep from smiling as he said, \"I don't snore!\", and Chloe replied, \"The hell you do! I...\", they stopped as they noticed some of the crewmen looked at them nervously including Lt. Law while others were working fast at their stations on the bridge and Michael looked at Law and said, \"Commander what's going on?\", Gross appeared from her science station and said, \"Sir we have received a message that I think you should hear.\", Michael stood at Law's station as she gave him her ear piece and she pressed a button and Michael heard an ominous calm male voice at it said, \"You have defeated the greatest threat to your world and you all think you are safe. We all knew the galaxy would not be the same. A few people laughed. A few people cried. Most people were silent.\", Michael had a serious but alert look as he stood as Chloe looked at him nervously while everyone else either looked frightened or somber as the voice kept saying, \"Do you remember the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita? Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, Now I become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\", the line went dead and Michael lowered the ear piece not watching and he said in a low voice, \"My God.\", and Chloe looked nervous as well as she saw Michael's shocked face. The Challenger moved at full impulse from the planet's orbit and just as it left the ship suddenly went to warp towards Terra II.

Z Town was located on the coast of decaying Hawaii and was home to all of the survivors throughout the world. Gerry quickly took the leadership role of Z Town because he saved the world from the infected, and he was very brave and courageous. Although Z Town was the home to all survivors, it was not a safe place at all. As the world became a darker place overrun with infected, people started to lose hope and lost their minds. As the new leader of Z Town, Gerry's first plan was to push all the crazy corrupt people out of the town. While exiling all of these insane people, he does not realize the consequences that will come after. When he pushes these crazy people out of Z Town they become crazier. These insane people are forced to survive on their own and have no other way to survive other than by eating human flesh. The crazy people create their own town called Nibal Town (short for cannibal) and over the year the people of Nibal are constantly attacking Z Town. Then people of Z Town started going missing. One night Gerry hears a noise in his daughter's room and rushes into her room only to find an empty bed. He sees a note that says, \"Come find her before we get hungry\" written in blood laying on her night stand and quickly realized it's the Nibal people that have done this. The people of Nibal Town would stop at nothing to get another meal and also get back at Gerry. Gerry was thrown into a panic and was not sure what he was going to do because the barbaric people of Nibal were fearless and impossible to reason with. Once Gerry calmed down he realized that he had to rally up some men from Z Town to destroy Nibal Town and save his daughter. When he finds the few people that are willing to help him, he is outnumbered by the Nibal 4:1. His vision is not altered by the horrible odds that he is facing, because he just needs to save his daughter. Gerry waits until nightfall to leave for Nibal Town and when he and his army arrive to Nibal Town they are disgusted by the gruesome sight. There were decomposing bodies creating a barrier around their town. When they enter the town they caught most of the cannibals sleeping, and were able to maneuver their way through the maze of bodies to the tall metal building in the middle. Gerry and his troops are unable to find a way to get into this tall structure from the bottom, so he is forced to go in through the top. He throws a grappling hook on the top of the structure and he and his troops proceed to the roof scaling the building. When they reach the roof they find a secret door that is locked, and the only way for them to get into this building is to break the lock. When Gerry hits the lock he opens it, but in turn wakes the cannibals. In a hurry Gerry and his troops run down the stairs to find his daughter in a room guarded by two cannibals. He rushes the two cannibals where he is stabbed in the shoulder. After he and his troops annihilate the guards he gets into the room where he is reunited with his daughter. After a glimpse of happiness, Gerry is brought back to reality by the stampede of footsteps from the cannibals of Nibal coming to the door of the building. This causes Gerry and his troops to make a split decision and make a run for it. Cannibals are coming from left and right as they retrace their footsteps out of the maze of bodies. There are too many for Gerry and his troop to fight off, until Gerry discovers an old grenade on one of the soldier bodies forming the maze. He waits until he and his troops are out and of the Nibal walls and throws the grenade behind him. This causes a corpse avalanche which covers the cannibals drowning them in rotting flesh. Gerry is able to get back to Z Town safe with his daughter, and none of the troops were killed in the journey. Z Town is never going to be harmed by the Nibal people again.

Summary: The main character has an agonising decision to make, a decision that could possibly save the future of the human race or could result in his death. A/N: This is from the end of the film and my look at what might have been going through his head at the time and his emotions at the events that had taken place already. This is a totally new fandom for me and I hope I got it right. I watched the film when it first came out and I wrote the story then but have only just come across it in one of my notebooks. The creature was there still waiting, and watching it seemed from outside the room I was in, his dead eyes peering in at me through the glass of the door. I knew that it was impossible for the creature to see me, the person that had been the creature was gone, their consciousness of what it was to be a human being forever gone, destroyed by the virus that had wiped out so many of my fellow humans. The sound of more bang on the door as the zombie banged into it again, no intelligence in its banging on the door, just pure instinct, it knew I was in here and in it's hunger for human flesh the zombie wanted in. Again another and another bang on the door as if it thought, if it could have any thought at all, that banging on the door would break it down, shatter the glass against which it banged but I knew the glass would not break or at least I hoped and prayed it would not. The glass was designed not to break from a human banging into it but that thing was no longer human. This instinct that these zombies had for finding and devouring the flesh of the living, driven by a hunger that none of those still living could understand, I wondered briefly to myself if we would win this fight against this deadly virus or if the dead would consume the Earth and all living things on it. I scanned around the small lab searching for the thing that had brought me here, a small vial containing vaccine, a man made vaccine that was a cure for the virus but where was it, I could see it and I had been told by the surviving scientists of this research base that it was in this small lab, deep within the bowels of the place. I had risked everything to come here to find it, even stealthily moving through the empty hallways outside, well hallways empty of the living, there had been a few zombies, listlessly moving about. I had managed to elude them on the way in, the way out however, that was another matter, they knew I was here and they wanted my proverbial blood. As I continued to search the room, the creature outside had stayed at the door, still banging occasionally but not as intently as it had been just moments before. My eyes laid upon a small vial tucked at the back of the fridge, keeping other vials cool and I reached in and pulled it out. Reading the name printed on the label on the side of the vial, I breathed a sigh of relief, I had found it. Now I had the cure but how was I going to get it back up to the scientist who could synthesis more of it, I looked at some bottles on another shelf in one of the other fridges and at the names on the labels a thought, no not a thought, a memory came to mind. Back in Israel when the creatures had broken into the compound, the creatures had attacked the living as they had fled before them but some they had not, some who ill, for whatever reason they had ignored, it was as if the virus had a mind of some kind, some kind of instinct to know that these humans, these sickly ones was no good to it. I looked at the vials again and then my eyes drifted towards the creature outside, an idea came to mind, a desperate idea but one that might work. I glanced up towards the ceiling towards where I could see a camera, the scientists were watching me and I knew I had no choice and I made up my mind. Grabbing one of the small bottles, I held up to the camera and hoped and prayed that some one was actually sitting at the screen to which this camera fed it's live feed. Moving swiftly I moved to where I could see syringes were kept and grabbed one stabbing it through the thin film cover of the small bottle I held, my heart beating frantically against my rib cage at the thought of what I was about to do. If I was wrong, if no one was watching then I was a dead man and not just me but also all those people depending on me, my wife, my children and everyone else still living. For a moment I almost stopped myself but the thought of those that depended on this vaccine getting to the surface, of wiping out the terrible virus before it wiped out all life on the Earth kept me going. I put the tip of the syringe needle against my skin and this was it, it was now or never! I plunged the needle into my arm, the tip of the needle piercing my skin, taking the contents of the small bottle into my veins. I dropped the syringe as a wave of dizziness momentarily overtook me and I gripped the side of the counter in front of me. For a moment, I thought I would not be able to continue but then my mind and consciousness became clearer and I pushed myself away from the counter and staggered towards the door. The creature was at the door and I reached for the button that would release the door, allowing the zombie in. For a second I paused again as a small sliver of fear raced through my mind at what I was about to do but I could wait no longer and slammed my hand down hard on the button.

It affected him in strange ways, almost as if he was bipolar: he would be at the beach, euphoric one minute, and the next he'd be spouting all sorts of \"Judgement Day\" crap. When will it happen? What if it's happening right now and I don't know about? Am I going to die? What will the Feds so about it? Nothing. I mean, of course they'll try, but they can't save anyone from the end of the world. If Death wants somebody, he'll be damn sure to get them. Will I have enough? No. There can never be enough. Can't be too careful in a world filled with maniacs looking for any weak links, any cowards. Getting up from the armchair, Bob crossed the gloomy lit sitting area and entered the kitchen, just as dark, thick curtains drawn. Opening the refrigerator, Davis looked for something to eat. Removing the half-gallon jug of milk, along with a container of deli roast beef and a head of lettuce, he thought of the irony of a prepped having fresh food. It's almost hypocritical , the man thinks to himself. His lunch complete, Bob decides to take his meal on the porch behind his house. His left hand occupied with a peaceful of bread, lettuce and meat, his right holding the glass of milk, Bob uses his teeth to unlock the deadbolt on his two inch thick solid oak back door. Of course it'd be easier to put down either the sandwich or the milk, but Bob doesn't think like that: he wants to to do as many things as he can at any given moment in time. The storm door, reinforced with iron bars, is easily opened with one's elbow. The deck, containing no more than a small table and a chair, is enclosed by a series of wooden posts topped with a banister. A set of three stairs leads down into the yard, where an empty swimming pool sits. The grass plot is surrounded by a six-and-a-half foot high chain link fence, intended to keep other people out. This part of Savannah however, doesn't need much protection, but Bib stated that he'd \"rather be safe than sorry\" when he first had it installed. Everyone knows about me, my prepping. They should see me as an example, not a joke. Yet they scoff at me when I pass, think I'm crazy. And even though I tell them that they should start readying themselves, they choose to ignore my warnings. They'll be sorry. Yes they will. When it finally happens, be it a tsunami, a robot takeover, or a nuclear war, at least Bob Davis will be ready. II In the basement of his townhouse, Bob is going through his nightly routine of checking the stockpile. First the food: counting out how many days he has before running out. Beans, corn, carrots, gravy, condensed milk, grits, pasta, Vienna sausages, fruit cocktail, and countless other foodstuffs in boxes, bags, and cans. All of it sat on shelves, waiting to be used, waiting for their expiration date not for some time in the future. These shelves, four feet long, three feet deep, one above the other in two columns of three, sat on two walls in the corner of Bob's cellar. In total, the shelves hold about three week's worth of non-perishable food, one of the most vital necessities in any apocalypse. Bob needs to protect this area more than any other in his house, so he has installed a sliding door and decorated it as a part of there wall. This false wall would determine any looters who manage to break in, unless they look closely enough. The catch is installed in the opposite wall, hidden behind a loose brick. The guns come next. Two guns: an AR-15 assault rifle and a Glock-18 handgun are contained inside of locked footlocker. As Bob dials in the code (10-2-13), the lock clicks. With the storage unit open, Bob removes the guns and checks their ammunition count, oils and cleans them, and then may or may not practice with them in the backyard, depending on how badly he wants to annoy his neighbors. A third gun, a .44 Magnum, sits under his pillow upstairs, in case of a nighttime burglary. Bob has already checked that one though, and now he has to make sure these weapons are in the correct working condition. He disassemble each firearm, and meticulously applies the dark, sticky oil to each and every screw, hammer, trigger, and barrel. A safe gun owner has a clean gun . Bob's motto might as well be stitched into a canvas hanging above the mantel. When and only when both guns are re-assembled and placed back into the case, does Bob notice how unusually quiet it has become. It is not the peaceful quiet that one would expect on a summer night, with the occasional chirps of crickets or the passing car. It is a much deeper silence, like that of the kind one would feel if they awoke at two in the morning, when no creatures move and no people stir. Instead of sitting and listening to the ominous peace, Bob dares to break the silence by turning on the battery operated radio. Static issues from the device's speakers The man's fingers find the dial and turn. He the weak signal of a local music station, adjusts the antenna, and listens. A man's voice comes over the airwaves, telling of a disturbance in downtown Savannah. \"Our local correspondent, George Ellis, is in the downtown area with an eyewitness of this strange activity. George?\" \"Adam, I'm here at the home of a woman who claims she saw a man-sized creature covered in blood. The gray bipedal... thing supposedly lumbered down Oak hill Avenue towards a hot dog vendor's line of customers. The unknown creature bit a man who was waiting in line to buy a hot dog, taking chunks of flesh out of the victim's body, causing him to bleed to death. Then, the witness says the color left the man's body, and he stood up and wandered off through the park. Law enforcement...\" A crashing sound is heard, followed by a strange combination of a growl, a moan, and a guttural blowing, as if someone were choking. \"George, is everything alright? George? Are you there?\" \"Adam, it seems the witness's testimony is correct. Right now, a pale woman is emerging from her home, but instead of using the door, she has broken a window and is coming through that, seemingly with no regard for her health. She is stumbling, and has bite wounds on her arms and legs. She is coming this way. I am going to see if she will respond to my voice. Hello! George Ellis, from JAMS? I'd like to ask you a few questions about the reports of a gray man attacking a person today. What do you think it could be?\" More of the growling, only louder now. \"Ma'am? Are you okay? Do you need help? You broke a window; do you need an ambulance? I can get one here ri-\" A scream is heard, blood-chilling, that of an animal. Chomping sounds, the clatter of bones on pavement, blood dripping. The phone line then goes dead. \"Oh no. Okay. Um... Well this concludes our nightly report. Tune back into JAMS for all the latest tunes at five a.m. This is Adam Milton signing off.\" It has begun . Robert switches off the radio, walks to his work bench and grabs some 2x4s. He climbs the-wooden staircase to the ground floor. Walking through the kitchen, Bob opens the closet door and pulls out the power drill and a box of screws. Bob begins to board up all the windows and doors to make the house look vacant. By midnight, all the openings in the perimeter had been sealed. III A loud thumping, followed immediately by a crash awakens Bob around dawn. He reaches under the pillow and grasps the .44 and proceeds to exit the bedroom. Peering down the corridor, Davis could tell the sound had come from the front porch. He stuck his head around the corner and saw that a pair of men and one woman had kicked down the front door. It's only been a week. Could there really already be looters prowling streets? \"This doesn't look like the kind of place that has a stockpile of stuff. It looks deserted.\" That was one of the men, a tall African American fellow. \"Trust me. It's all downstairs, hidden behind a false wall.\" The woman's voice sounded familiar to Bob, but he didn't know why. There's only one person in the whole world who knows about the fake wall. \"Where?\" \"Down there. First door on the left.\" At that, she points to the hall where Bob now stands. \"You go. We'll look for useful stuff up here.\" Good luck. I've already hidden my toolbox below the floorboards. But who is this girl and how does she know about my stockpile? It couldn't be. Could it? When he tall man steps around the corner, Bob wraps his arm around the big guy's face, covering his mouth. Stepping out from his cover, Bob holds the .44 to his captive's head and addressed the intruders. \"Get out. Now.\" \"Who are you?\"Turning to the woman, the man said: \"I thought you said this house was empty.\" She retorted: \"It is. Er, it was. This is my ex-boyfriend's house. He was obsessed with the end of the world and I left him because of it. Guess he was right.\" It punched Bob in the mouth. \"Sheri. You thought I had turned onto one of those things didn't you?!\" \"Oh my God! Bobby! I'm so glad you're still alive! Um... That's Michael; the one you have with you. This is my current boyfriend Shane. We were going to take your stuff, but since you're still alive, can we stay here for a while? We ran out of everything: even our knives broke. They were the only weapons we had.\" \"You thought I was crazy. To prepare. Then, when everything went to hell, the first thing you do is come here looking for my help. No. Get out and deal with this yourselves. I won't ever help you. You're no different than anyone else. Leave now, or your friend Michael here is going to have a hole in his skull, and Ill be left with a pretty red splotch on my wall.\" Out of nowhere, the ground begins to shake. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Almost as if a giant were beating on a larger-than-life drum. The staccato beat of the drum grows louder and more powerful with every passing second. As soon as it hard started, the rumbling stops, and the survivors look at each other in confusion. \"What was that? We're in Georgia, not on any faults. I've got a bad feeling about this.\" Sheri moves towards the window, and Michael takes this opportunity to break away from Bob's stranglehold. Sheri screams and jumps away from the window. \"Oh my God! What the? Oh God Almighty.\" \"What? What is it?\" Before the three men can cross the room to look out the window and share in Sheri's horror, a sedan flies through the wall, crushing Shane under it's weight. Through the gaping hole, Bob sees a huge mountain of a creature with flesh rotting off its bones. The tusks of the thing are scratched and covered in blood, hair, and chunks of moldy flesh. The former animal charges the house, and Bob reacts with inhuman speed, diving for his safe house: the basement. He locks the door, and with the finality of the deadbolt sliding into place, Sheri and Michael's pounding and pleas are drowned out by splintering wood, shattering glass, and twisting metal. After five minutes or so, the noises cease, giving way again to the suffocating quiet of the apocalypse. Bob opens the door a crack and peeks out at the upstairs. The two people who had just been alive now filled his gaze. Sheri has been impaled upon a splintered piece of door-frame, her stomach torn open by the beast's tusks, intestines hanging out like a spilled bowl of spaghetti. Michael has been buried by debris, and only his hand his visible, limp now, but once stiff and grasping for something, anything that would let him pull himself to freedom. But, the thousands of pounds of drywall, wire, and shingles have squeezed the life from his body. As for Shane, the car is only partially visible now, for most of the ceiling has come down between the survivor and the vehicle. Looking back at the other two, Bob feels good that they're gone. That'll teach them to try to leech supplies off me. I need a truck. I need to get away from everyone, or what used to be everyone. I need money, although it won't help much, I might be able to buy myself out of a bad situation. I'm a needy person, even with all the prepping I did. Bob's Nissan is now nothing more than a pancake, having been crushed by the monster's foot. Luckily, the silver F-150 is still parked in the driveway of Bob's neighbor, Harold Jones. Bob put his face to the glass and looked in the window. No keys. Not surprising. Jones would probably have them with him, but how am I supposed to find one walking corpse in a country of what? 300 million? 350? That would be the easy part anyway: how would I actually get the ring from him? Forget it. Rock. Rock. Rock. Bob sees a rock in the grass by the sidewalk. When he bends down to pick it up, he realizes it is not just a large stone. Oh. Hello Mrs. Sherman. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. Bob tosses the head away, and swaps it for an actual stone. Fist-sized and rounded, the rock would definitely have enough power to break the window. The glass, so fragile, yet strong enough to withstand the first blow, shatters with the second. He reaches in and unlocks the door, allowing himself access to the interior. It smells faintly of pipe tobacco, Bob notices, as he bends down to remove the panel u underneath the steering wheel. He peels back the outer plastic coating of the wires, and connects the yellow one with the black one after it has been crossed over the red one. The engine roars to life and he puts it in drive, pulling it up in front of his property. IV The Sun had long since gone down by the time Robert Davis had transferred his food and such to the new, working vehicle. He ate a supper of warm fruit cocktail and cold ravioli on the road, listening to a series of country songs ad he chewed. Thank God for automatic playlists. V The world collapsed, Into the dark abyss it fell. Very few remain. The failure of society, The lives of those that are left, All is left to the Dice. Roll them once. Roll them twice. So many have died, They that are weak, Had they listened, To Bob Davis, Perhaps they'd still be around. Now all that is left, Is Chaos and Death, The mistresses of anarchy, And those who bathe in the misery of others.

'' ¡Oh dios mío!'', pensé. Me llevé ambas manos a la boca y rompí en llanto, tan solo ver a mis amigas... mis mejores amigas… ¿muertas?, p-pero ¿Quién haría eso? ¿Y qué exactamente eran esas mordidas? Salí corriendo de aquel lugar, no podía soportarlo, ver tanta sangre…, me cubrí la boca con la mano para impedir vomitar. Cuando me calmé, divisé a una chica corriendo a toda velocidad de entre las tinieblas. En cuanto alcé la cabeza, me miró fijamente, ella se había detenido. -¡Corre! ¡Corre por lo que más quieras! ¡Tienes que irte! ¡Te van a…!- no pudo terminar. Toby- un chico que conocía, era una de mis mejores amigos-, se acercó a ella y le mordió en el brazo, arrancando la piel, y ella retorciéndose del dolor, del susto. -¡Ahhh!- la chica gritaba del dolor- ¡Vete, vete, sálvate!- exclamó. Me quedé petrificada ¿Qué estaba pasando? No podía creer lo que estaba viendo, Toby era un… ¿zombie? ¿Todos lo eran? ¿Mis mejores amigas también lo serían, después… que las hayan mordido? ¿Yo también terminaría así? Parecía que aquello que miraba era un presagio, una advertencia de lo que me pasaría sino aprendiese a sobrevivir. Luego empezaron a llegar más personas -o lo que fueran-, las cuales desconocía y se acercaban a la chica. Empezaron a morderla y comerse todo su cuerpo, no pude resistir. Me quité los tacones esta vez y corrí con todas mis fuerzas de aquel lugar hasta mi casa. (2) Cuando llegué tiré mis tacones a un lado, no me importó dónde cayeron, porque era lo de menos. No me había percatado que había dejado la puerta abierta, no obstante, no me tomé la molestia de cerrarla. -¡Melanie! ¡Mamá! ¡Papá! ¡Tenemos que irnos de aquí!- grité desesperada. Subí hasta mi habitación, y empaqué algunas prendas, sábanas y una carpa que usábamos para acampar. Cerré mi mochila y me la colgué en el hombro. Me calcé unos zapatillas blancas que se encontraban debajo de mi cama. Con ellos podría viajar en busca de un refugio sin que me dolieran los pues por esos horribles tacones. Cuando entré a la habitación de mis padres, los encontré tendidos en la cama con... manchas de sangre en las sábanas...m-muertos... Me quedé horrorizada mientras sollozaba silenciosamente por lo que pasaba. Me acerqué a ellos con pasos torpes, en cuanto me puse a llorar, sin poder contenerme los abracé. No podía creer lo que estaba pasando... Me puse de pie sorbiendo mi nariz, dejando atrás a mis padres... lo único que ahora me quedaba era buscar a mi hermana. Salí de la habitación y miré a todos lados tanteando con la vista su habitación. -¡Melanie! ¿¡En donde estás!?- estaba a punto de derribarme, ¿Qué pasaba? ¿Por qué? Parecía que el destino se empeñaba en hacerme la vida imposible. Como si Dios ya no existiese más. Corriendo a toda prisa, fui a la habitación de mi hermana. No encontré nada, ella no estaba. Tan solo la habitación desordenada y sucia. Tenía que ir a buscarla. Bajé los escalones y me dirigí a la cocina. Tomé algo de comida y botellas de agua para 3 semanas, rápidamente las empaqué en mi mochila. Me acomodaba la mochila nuevamente en mi hombro, escuché la campanilla de la puerta que anunciaba que alguien se había metido a la casa. Me escondí más en la nevera cubriéndome con la puerta de ella, asomé un poco la cabeza para poder ver quien era. Se trataba de pasos rápidos, no creía que fuesen ellos . Examinaba su aspecto físico, no estaba inestable. Poseía una melena rubia, ojos color esmeralda y de complexión delgada. Fijamente se veía asustada, no parecía ser una mala persona. Salí de mi escondite y me acerqué a ella. Ella me miró de pies a cabeza, asintió lentamente aprobándome. Veía más ese asentimiento como si dijera ''Está en buen estado, por lo tanto no tendré inconvenientes con ella''. Después de un largo segundo incómodo en el que una examinaba a la otra, suspiró y se animó a hablarme. -Hay un lugar no muy lejos de aquí, para pasar la noche, digo, si es que te animas a venir… Asentí y esbocé una pequeña sonrisa-Gracias. . Las más lujosas noches que había pasado desde la aparición de los cadáveres andantes habían sido colchones viejos que con mucha suerte lográbamos encontrar en un lugar lejos de los zombies. Una noche, mientras hacíamos una fogata, escuchamos un ruido muy peculiar. Era un gruñido bajo, como el de un perro que estaba a punto de morder. Tomé mi cuchillo y lo mantuve firme, por si acaso. Camile – la chica rubia que me hacía encontrado en mi casa- fue a ver qué era. Soltó un grito y regresó corriendo hasta donde yo me encontraba. -Melissa, tienes que irte, yo me ocuparé de esto.-me dijo. -¿Qué? ¿Qué sucede?- estaba confundida. -¡Solo hazlo!- me lo dijo mirándome a los ojos, pude ver pánico en ellos. -Tomé mis cosas y acomodé mi mochila en mi hombro. Miré a un costado y encontré a un zombie acercándose a Camile. Ella lo notó y rápidamente buscó algo con qué defenderse. Pues, esa persona no era cualquiera zombie…dios, ¡Era Danielle! ¡Mi mejor amiga!La que me ayudaba en todos los problemas que tenía, la persona en la que confiaba. Y ahora… era una cosa como esa. Me detuve a ver en lo que se había convertido, sentí las lágrimas que bajaban por mis mejillas. No. No iba a permitirme llorar. Me sequé las lágrimas y sorbí mi nariz. Danielle se empezaba a acercar más a Camile, y en uno de esos movimientos ágiles la atrapó, le empezaba a arrancar la piel del brazo. Nunca supe que era soledad, de eso me di cuenta cuando mientras me alejaba de lo que alguna vez llamé amiga , volvía a estar sola… otra vez. Corrí a toda prisa de ese lugar; mientras caía la noche, cada vez se hacía más oscuro y me era difícil de encontrar un lugar en donde pasar la noche. Poco a poco, disminuía el paso y ya no corría, solo me aseguraba de que ningún zombie me tomara por sorpresa. Observé a una chica no muy lejos de en donde yo me encontraba. Corrí con cautela -sin llamar la atención- en dirección a ella, pude notar que buscaba algo de comida. Estaba algo nerviosa, no sabía qué decirle, pero mi conciencia sí. Pateó las palabras y salieron repentinamente de mi boca. -¿Has visto a mi hermana? Es de estatura mediana, ojos color celeste y tez clara, de un broncíneo dorado. El pelo apenas tiene unos cuantos tonos más oscuros que la piel, excepto donde algunos mechones del color del lino lo aclaran. Y se llama Melanie.- le mostré una foto de mi hermana. Era vieja y por suerte era una de las muchas fotos que se había sacado este año. -Oh sí, está en el campamente Sub Terra, hace unos días que se unió a nosotros.- me respondió, no se molestó en mirarme, seguía haciendo lo suyo. Acomodaba la comida en una pequeña mochila. Suspiré levemente, sentí un gran alivio el saber que ella estaba con vida. -¿Sub Terra? ¿Me podrías decir dónde queda?- le pregunté. . Cuando Hazel me llevó al dichoso campamento, encontré a mi hermana sentada en un tronco de un árbol. El tronco se encontraba recostado de lado en el suelo. (3) -¡Melanie!-la llamé. Ella volteó para averiguar quién la llamada. Su expresión cambio a una asombrada. Corrí hacia ella y a la vez gritaba su voz con voz quebrada. Cuando llegué hasta ella la abracé con todas mis fuerzas. ¡Por fin! ¡Ella está conmigo! Me permití llorar en su hombro. -Melissa…- susurró en mi oído, ella también estaba llorando- No sabes lo mucho que te extrañé. Me reí tontamente, las lágrimas caían en mi rostro- Yo también. Después de ese maravilloso reencuentro con mi hermana, le conté lo mucho que había sufrido, que había encontrado a nuestros amigos…, traté de evitar el tema de nuestros padres. Le conté que la había estado buscando. Ella también me contó de lo que había pasado, que había visto a nuestros padres morir. » Me dijeron que me escondiese en el armario…, que no me asomara por más gritos que ellos diesen. Era inevitable… ¡La maldita curiosidad! Tan solo imaginarlo sentía que me iba a desmayar. No soporto ver tanta…. sangre, especialmente cuando se trata de un ser querido nuestro. No. No lo hubiera soportado. Desde ese momento, prometí que no volvería a separarme de ella, jamás en la vida lo haría. No me arriesgaría a perderla de nuevo. No me arriesgaría a volver a sentirme sola en un mundo que ahora no reconocía. Por más egoísta que sonase aquello. ¡Hola!

And, two: she was a liability. As a soldier with two hands, a healthy body, a mostly-clear head, she was a neccessity to the people who needed her. As a soldier with one hand, in pain, with alcohol in her system, she was a liability. The whole point of becoming a soldier had been becoming something more than a liability. Now, she was useless.

If you haven't seen it but don't care about spoilers, continue on. Hi there! So I got recent inspiration to write a little snippet from a character's POV from World War Z (the movie, not the novel). I love Mireille Enos, and Brad Pitt was a bonus, but the movie was amazing - it was filled with action and suspense, almost borderline horror - but it kept the realness and the humanity in it. It wasn't a movie about zombies taking over the world- well, actually, it was. But instead of everyone dying, brave people found the zombies' weaknesses, and instead of outright killing them, they found a way to guarantee avoiding conflict - camouflage (I find this a genius [and original] idea). It wasn't a slasher movie, it was an intense action/slight family movie. In short, I loved it and I was grandly impressed. Anyway, to get to my short snippet, it's from Karin's point of view. They are in the store after having been chased from the car jam in Philadelphia. This is before they seriously think about the possibility of a zombie apocalypse. I hope you enjoy! They were racing through the store, trying to scrounge up any necessary items that would save their lives. Gerry took Rachel to get Symbicort refills for her inhaler while Karin took Connie in a grocery cart to get food that could last them long enough to outlive these horrid things. Karin passed a tall man, about 6 feet tall. A small shiver ran down her spine. She could feel him staring down at her. She ignored it, however, because she needed to worry about her family and couldn't spend any time concerned over creeps. She pushed the cart in front of her, Connie seated inside, and stopped to grab jars and boxes of food and threw them all in the cart. She couldn't afford to be picky. The more the better and the longer they lived. She rushed to the next aisle and stopped to do the same. After shoving about ten jars into the cart beside Connie, she felt skinny but strong arms roughly wrap around her body, pinning her arms to her sides. She gasped. \"Hey!\" she commanded. \"Let go of m-\" She was cut off by a firm backhanded hit to the side of her face, and she immediately felt it become flush and hot. No cruel commands were given, but instead Karin felt herself falling to the ground, hardly able to catch herself with her hands. She was immediately flipped over and she realized that there were two males: one took hold of her ankles, keeping her lower body from kicking him, while the other wrestled with Karin's arms. The second seemed to want a grip on her left hand. Her thought process sped up with desperation for understanding. Humans. Male. Left hand. Wedding ring! Karin wasn't going to let two penniless thugs take her wedding ring, her identity. She closed her fingers into a fist and started thrashing her head, torso, limbs, occasionally bringing her whole body off the ground at points where her strength and the two males' strengths combined in a unified force. The sound of Connie's screams - \"Mommy? Mommy!\" - came into her ears lightly, as if she were underwater. Connie. She had to get Connie away from these monsters. She tried getting up or pushing her weight into the cart, but was too restrained. Thinking fast, she swung all of her body weight into the man behind her, and he stumbled backwards into the cart, successfully pushing the cart - and her daughter - back. However, the cart only traveled a couple feet, and Karin was panicking again, desperately trying to escape the men's grips and take her daughter into her arms. \"Gerry!\" she yelled. \"Gerry!\" But her husband didn't appear. Connie's screams eventually pierced the men's ears, and the one trying to wrestle the wedding ring from Karin's hand dropped her suddenly, turned around, and for two long seconds, Karin feared that he would kill her daughter. But to her relief, he was so determined to get that wedding ring that he didn't have time to bother with screaming brats. He simply shoved the grocery cart that carried Connie, and Karin watched as the cart raced down the aisle, taking her daughter to safety. She screamed all the way down: \"Daddy! Daddy !\" Now that Connie was safely away from the desperate men, there was nothing to distract them from taking any valuables from the woman. They had spotted a bracelet on her right wrist and had already started trying to tear it from her arm. The bracelet was becoming so abused, so fast, that, when they had a grip on it, it would feel as if it were digging into her skin, tearing her flesh, split by a single charm silver clasp bracelet that she had received from the family as a Mother's Day present the year before. She was kicking her legs desperately, angrily, scared. Couldn't the men tell that she wouldn't just give up a fight? She was going to make it as hard as she could to keep them from taking her precious possessions. \"Gerry! Gerry !\" she yelled as she thrashed about. Finally Gerry came, shouting her name and waving his arms. One of the men dropped her and fled at the sight of Gerry's rifle, but the other held firm. Karin flipped herself over on her stomach, almost crawling towards her husband, and hit her elbows a little too hard on the tile floor. She gritted her teeth as the tingling sensation made its way up her arms, but didn't complain, knowing that it was better than a broken arm. BAM! She saw the 6 foot tall man fall until he hit the ground, hard. She glanced toward the back of the store, and there she saw Gerry standing there, gun barrel smoking, Rachel standing behind him, holding onto the seam of his coat, and Connie silently crying to his left, still sitting in the cart. She rose and ran for Gerry, her husband, and Rachel and Connie, her two dear, dear daughters. She was okay. They were all okay. The fear that had been masked by the brave face put on for her daughters found its way to the surface, and Karin let out racking sobs into Gerry's shoulder, happy to be alive - but also scared to be alive, scared to have to confront these barbarians again, scared to put her family in that position again, scared for the worse to come. She felt her husband hold her closely, heart beating fast, embracing all of her into himself. She felt her ring with her thumb, and let out a single happy sob that her identity was still with her. They were going to get through this, whatever THIS was, as a family, and survive with all the will that they had. Eh? Eh? What do y'all think? I'd love reviews!

I saw the movie yesterday. It was entertaining but as I saw it I wondered about how poor Tommy must have felt losing his parents and going with the Lanes. It's short but I hope you enjoy it. AN: World War Z doesn't belong to me (((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( (((WWZ)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) ))))))))))))))) Tommy felt alone on that enormous overpopulated US ship. He had presenced what no child should, his parents had been killed and transformed in front of him. He had been helpless to do anything except running. And was lucky enough to reach the americans that had been staying in their house at night before they had left for the safety of that ship. But now that the danger was temporarily over it all dawned on him. He was alone. His parents were dead. And he didn't know what would happen to him from them on. The american family the Lanes were good people and were taking care of him for now but he wasn't one of their children and they had no obligation whatsoever to take care of him when this was all over. However when the Lanes were awake he normally pushed his worries back inside. He had promised Mr. Lane that he would take care of the girls and he tried to honor his word, his father had always told him that keeping a word was something a man should always do. So when the daughters were awake he played with them talked with them and tried to calm them telling them everything was going to be ok. When the night fell and the Lane sisters were asleep he always crept out of his bed and went to a special corner he had found for himself near their room and cried. He was a child after all. The third night he did he must have cried a little louder than he intended to because when he looked up he saw the figure of Karin Lane looking at him with a worried expression. \"Tommy?\" The woman asked coming closer to him. \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing\" He replied with a clearly sad tone of voice. He didn't want to worry Mrs. Lane with his problems. The woman sat beside him and put an arm around the little boy. \"That's not true.\" She said softly. \"You've been crying.\" Seeing that there was no point in lying he finally burst into sobs again prompting Karin squeeze his shoulder comfortingly. \"I-I miss my dad and mom\" He confessed as he buried his head in the crook of her neck. The woman felt her own eyes water at the revelation. Of course, that had to be it, Tommy was a child after all. He had been so well behaved and looked so strong in front of the girls, plus she was more worried about her daughters, that she hadn't realized the child was going through the pain of losing his family alone. She hugged the boy comfortingly and kissed the top of his head. \"Shhhh.\" She soothed. \"It's alright. Shhhhh.\" \"Why- why did they have to die and leave me alone?\" He asked between sobs. \"It's ok\" She said drawing small soothing circles on his back. \"You are going to be just fine\" \"B-but what am I gonna do?\" the small child cried. \"I'm alone\" \"You are not alone\" Karin said comfortingly. \"You are here with us.\" \"But once we leave this ship you won't have to take me with you.\" He said a little more calm. Karin eyes widened as she realized what this child's fears were. He didn't want to be left alone, to be abandoned by everyone. The fear was not unfounded, he was not his child and in his eyes they could discard him once this was all over. She hugged the child strongly with her maternal instincts kicking in. \"Tommy, listen to me.\" She said. \"We are not going to leave you alone. I promise. I won't let you be alone.\" \"Mommy?\" Asked a voice from the room's entrance. \"What's happening?\" Karin looked up to see Rachel and Constance looking at them with confusion in their eyes. She smiled kindly at her daughters and said. \"Nothing is wrong. Tommy is just a little sad because of what happened to his dad and mum.\" She replied. The two girls nodded in understanding and did something that made her feel proud of her daughters. The two joined in the hug. \"Don't worry Tommy everything is going to be ok\" Constance, her youngest said. \"You told me remember, when we were at your home, that everything was going to be just fine.\" \"That's right\" Rachel said. \"We are going to be ok.\" And before she realized it Karin had three sleeping children on top of her. While she was uncomfortable she couldn't help but chuckle and kiss their heads as she too tried to fall sleep.

He paused to toss his change in the little tip tray before going to his usual seat in the back corner. The shop was almost deserted this early in the morning. Just an off-duty cop, and an exhausted young student falling asleep in his bagel. The sun was just barely brightening the streets as he dumped in two sugar packets and pulled a binder of work papers from his laptop bag. Four lab reports to look over before work in an hour, and he might as well do it over hash browns. He took a sip of coffee. The windows shattered. He dove under the table, turning it sideways towards the sound. Burning coffee poured over his shoulders and back, but he ignored it, and peered around the side of the table. A woman in exercise clothes had her nails in the officer's head. The worst sound that he had ever heard screeched from her cracked lips. She bit into the officer's neck and Andrew watched in horror as he fell to the ground and thrashed in pain and fear. The woman behind the counter shrieked. A man leaped through the broken window and dove at her. She screamed and fell to the ground. Andrew slung his bag over his shoulder and took off running for the door, slipping on a fallen napkin on the floor. The student shoved him out of the way and tore the door open. \"What's happening?\" Andrew yelled to him. \"Why are you asking me?\" The boy stumbled out the door and into the street. Immediately, a man ran in and knocked him to the ground. He made the choked cry that the woman- creature- had made. The boy fought in a panic.\"Help me! Help!\" Andrew swung his computer at the creature's head. It collided with a satisfying crunch and the monster toppled off with another inhumane cry. Andrew pulled the student to his feet by his arm. \"Thanks.\" He swallowed. \"No problem.\" He remembered to breathe. The streets were full of people and creatures, shrieking, weeping, yelling names, running, falling. He swallowed, and adjusted his bag on his shoulder. It wouldn't be of much use as a computer after this, he was sure. Another creature came at him from the side and he knocked it off with his bag. He kicked it and ran before it could get back up. He didn't know where he was running to. He just had to run. Cars were scattered over the street, abandoned. Most still had the keys in the ignition. He slipped on something wet and fell. His hands went into broken glass, but he jumped back up and continued running. A woman ran into him screaming her childrens' names. He made eye contact with her for half a second before they were shoved away from each other. He had never seen a greater terror in a person's eyes. He heard a scream and saw a creature on top of that mother. He hesitated for a second and then went back and smashed it away. It leapt at him. He raised his bag to protect himself, and the creature clawed at it, snapping his jaws above the top. Andrew cried out without trying to, and threw the creature to the ground. He brought the laptop down on it's head and felt a crack. He glanced back at the mother to see her seizing on the ground. His pulse pounded throughout his entire body as she sat up and looked at him. Her skin was grayed and stretched over her face. She opened her mouth and chattered her teeth and lunged at him. He ran. He had to get away from here, away from this chaos. There would less people out of the city. Maybe there would be less creatures too. A family hijacked a minivan a few feet ahead. He shoved through the crowd and got to them, tearing open the backseat door before the little girl could close it. She shrieked and began to cry. He slammed the door shut and locked it. \"Shh. I won't hurt you.\" The father glanced back at him from the driver's seat and then took off driving as fast as possible through the crowded streets. Andrew leaned against the door, trying to catch his breath. His veins strained against his skin, blasting blood and oxygen and adrenaline through his body. The little girl was still wailing. An pale older girl sat next to her, while a baby cried in the mother's arms. The older girl touched the little one's shoulder. \"Shhh Addie. He's not a monster too. He won't hurt us.\" A creature slammed into the window next to her and she screamed. The window cracked. Andrew reached over and pulled the girls away. \"Drive!\" The car accelerated, smashing into another creature or a person, who rolled over the roof and was gone. The littlest girl twisted her hands in his shirt and pressed her face into his chest. She trembled. \"It's okay, Addie,\" the mother called, rocking the screaming baby. The car swerved to avoid a crashed school bus. The older girl fell into the window with a cry. The younger one clung to him. The cracked window smashed under the weight of another creature. Both girls screamed. The mother yelled something he didn't make out. He reached over the girls and shoved what used to be a man away from the car. The creature's hand slipped between the bag and the window, clawing at the air. The mother tossed something in Andrew's lap and he used what he saw was a magazine to beat the hand back out the window. He kept his bag pressed to the widow, his chest pounding. His throat was dry. \"Girls, are you okay?\" the mother called. The older girl was twisted in her seat belt, leaning as far as she could behind his back.\"Yes.\" She sobbed. The little one was on his other side, clinging to the back of his shirt. She cried and didn't say anything. The mother looked back at him. \"And you, sir?\" He swallowed. \"I'm fine, thank you.\" He cleared his throat. \"Do you know what's going on?\" The mother frowned. \"No. I don't. I guess you don't either.\" \"I don't...It looks like it's infectious though..\" \"What?\" \"Those creatures can turn people into them. I saw one do it, but that's obviously not enough to make a full conclusion about that…\" \"Oh God…\" the mother said. \"What's he saying?\" The little girl yelled. The older one stared at him in horror. \"Don't let the monsters touch you,\" the mother said. \"It's like a game, okay? Like tag. Don't let them touch you. Run away.\" The older girl nodded. \"I don't like this game,\" the little one said. Andrew patted her shoulder. \"Er... Do you know where you are planning on going?\" \"I don't know.\" She glanced at her husband, who was white-knuckled on the wheel. \"Honey?\" \"Outside the city. As far outside the city as we can get.\" Andrew had a small sigh of relief that at least the people he jumped into a car with were fairly reasonable. The car jerked to a stop to avoid splattering a pedestrian. Both girls fell into him. He fell against the back of the father's seat. A creature flew over the windshield. The mother cried out. The father slammed on the gas and the creature fell under the tires. Andrew felt a horrible smushing feeling as they drove over it. The farther along the road they got, the more creature- free everything was. Eventually they made it out of the city. The car pulled over on the side of the road. The father sighed. \"Okay. Let's think about this for a second.\" The silence of the lightly traveled rural road was only broken by the girls' quiet crying. The mother glanced back again. \"I'm Ellie, by the way. Ellie Green.\" She offered him her hand. He shook it. \"Dr. Andrew Fassbach.\" He immediately thought about how it was pretentious of him to introduce himself with \"Dr.\" when she had just said \"Ellie\". It was probably not the only bad decision he had made today. \"Doctor? What kind of doctor, sir?\" \"I'm a virologist. I study viruses.\" \"But you're just a kid,\" the father said. \"How old are you?\" He smiled. \"Yeah. I'm twenty-five in January.\" \"Wow,\" the father said, and leaned against the steering wheel. The mother reached back and touched the younger girl's hair. \"Oh, Dr. Fassbach, this is Addie. And that's Lilly.\" She glanced at the baby in her lap. \"And this is Franklin.\" Addie raised her head from his sleeve. \"Mommy,\" she moaned. \"What's going on?\" Andrew stared at her. The poor child must have been terrified. Both of them. He was terrified. Ellie stroked her hair. \"I don't know, baby. But it's going to be fine. Don't worry. Daddy and I will take care of you. We should be thankful that our family is safe, and our new friend, Dr. Fassbach.\" She turned to look at him. \"Dr. Fassbach, did you have family with you? Do you know if they're okay?\" \"Er, Andrew's fine. My family lives in England. I don't know where my fiancee is though.. she should be at work right now.\" He swallowed. He wanted Amelia here. Now. With him. He needed to go find her. But now he was outside the city. Without his car. She might be dead already. He didn't let that thought become an idea. She was fine. Whatever was happening was just starting. \"I- Um.. I actually want to call her…\" \"Oh do it!\" Ellie said. \"You poor thing. You must be worried sick. And her about you.\" \"Yes.. thanks…Here, I'll just..\" He gently untangled himself from the children and stepped outside the car. He pulled out his phone. Three missed calls from Amelia blinked on the screen. He hadn't heard it ring. He called her back, and prayed that it would still connect. It rang twice. \"Andrew?\" Her voice was a gasp of hope. \"Yes! Amelia? Where are you? Are you okay?' \"Yes, I'm fine. I'm at the lab. I'm okay. We've been watching on the news- Andrew, what's happening? Where are you? Please tell me you were already at work.\" Her voice was shaking. \"No, I was in the city. I'm okay though. We got away. We're a few miles out. And I don't know what's happening. No one seems to.\" \"You were still in the city?! Were you hurt at all? Oh God, Andrew. We've been watching…\" \"I'm perfectly fine. It's alright. Everything's going to be alright.\" There was a pause, where he could hear his heart pounding. \"I'm scared, Andrew.\" He squeezed his eyes shut and felt them sting. \"I know. I'm scared too. We're going to be fine though, okay?\" Her breathing was shaky. \"Right. What are we going to do?\" He swallowed. \"I don't know.\" \"The first step is probably to get together..\" \"Yes. Right. Here's the thing. I got a ride out of the city with this family, so I don't know how we can..\" She paused. \"I guess I could try and come to you. But I would have to go through the city.\" \"No!\" His heart jumped in his chest. \"No. If you're safe there, you're staying there. I'll figure something out. And I'll come and get you.\" \"Okay. Then we should go somewhere where we can work.. mostly you, but you know. I'll try and help. You should see if your lab is still… functioning..\" \"Yeah. I'll call over there. And I'll call you later to figure everything out.\" \"Okay.\" \"Alright..[Chapter 2] Amelia chewed hard on her lip as she watched Mr. Umutoni back as he lead her . He glanced at her and then away. \"What is it?\" she asked. She had a little burning at the bottom of her throat, nervous vomit. \"What's wrong? Is Andrew alright?\" Mr. Umutoni stopped walking and brought his eyes back to her. \"Dr. East. We've just received news that Dr. Fassbach was shot.\" Her stomach fell. She made a small sound of choking and horror. \"Is he alive?\" \"Yes. But he is severely injured.\" He frowned deeper. \"He is... severely injured.\" He touched her shoulder. \"I would be ready for the worst.\" Her heart felt like it was vibrating. \"Where is he?\" \"He is still in South Korea. They are planning on leaving soon and returning here.\" \"Soon? When is soon? Why not now? Who's taking care of him there?\" Mr. Umutoni looked at her with a sympathetic calm. \"They will leave as soon as can be done safely. There are people there who can care for him temporarily. When he arrives back here he will be very well taken care of. \"He touched her shoulder lightly. \"But, Dr. East… as I said… I would be ready for the worst…\" She shook her head, feeling her eyes start to sting. \"No. Don't say that.\" She bit hard on her lower lip. \"We're supposed.. we…\" Tears broke free to run down her face. She tasted salt with the burn of rising vomit. \"He can't-\" The large hand on her shoulder became a little heavier. \"Dr. East, why don't you come sit down for a moment?\" She sobbed once as he gently pushed her into a chair. \"When can I talk to him? Can I talk to him?\" Mr. Umutoni frowned. \"I'm not sure if he… I can see if that will be possible anytime soon…\" He punched a number into his cell phone and waited. \"Hello? Yes. How is his condition? He is. For how long? Alright. Can he hold a conversation? He is? That is interesting because she… Yes. Yes, I'll tell her. One moment.\" He turned back to Aemilia. \"He is awake. And they will allow you to speak to him because he has been asking and they think that it will calm him. But they want you to be brief and try not to upset him. Alright?\" \"Okay,\" she said, quickly swallowing and wiping away tears. She took a breath and took the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Aemilia?\" He sounded terrible. \"Andrew? Oh God, Andrew, what happened?\" He coughed and her heart dropped. \"I tripped.\" \"You..\" \"I tripped while holding a gun.\" \"Oh God.\" \"I should have known my-\" He coughed. \"My clumsiness would get me someday.\" \"It hasn't gotten you yet. You're going to be fine. You'll be fine, Andrew.\" She could almost hear him smile at her. \"I hope so, darling… Aemilia?\" She swallowed. \"Yes?\" \"If I live-\" \"Which you will.\" \"Alright. If we… make it out of this…\" He paused. \"Aemilia, if we make it out of this, will you marry me?\" Her eyes widened. \"Wait, what?\" Her stomach twisted. \"Aemilia. I want you to marry me. I know, it's a terrible thing to say… because I may die… soon… but..\" \"Yes.\" \"What?\" \"Yes, Andrew. You better not die now.\" He laughed, a weak sound that sent pangs through her chest. \"Ok.\" ","Summary":" Andrew took his coffee and bag from the older woman working the desk.

The party was massive and extremely loud, I couldn't stop thinking about finding true love. Finding the one. \"Smile, I wanna get this moment on my phone\", Charlie laughed gagging down the beer at the same time.\"Do you think you should be drinking that when your going to be the one driving\", I smirked trying to pull the beer away from her. \"Get off it's mine\", she dragged it back, gagging down more beer. Sometimes I wish I haven't even took her here. It's like the second biggest club in the country and well it was-. Charlie interrupted me as she flung her beer at the wall causing everything to go silent.\"PARTY!\", the party was back on, simple if someone died no one would give to shit. \"I'M going to the toilet\", I stated walking off into the bright crowd of people. Banging into nearly everyone who was even there. Finally reaching the door, opening it into a small well kinda big problem.\"Get the fuck out can't you see it's being used\", she moaned setting off a nosy distraction. I think about fourteen boys heard and came to the rescue pushing me out of the public bathroom. Well because of that I had to use the boys bathroom. I don't think in all my life I had done that before. Just after I had finished I started walking back to Charlie I couldn't leave her on her own, how the hell would I get home. Lightning struck still, waiting for the party to end. I thought I was going crazy after the strange noises what appeared behind the metal door. Thunder and screaming I thought it was just the party, well the music. I just couldnt stop to notice someone acting a little bit weird in the corner of the room. His hands were on his head and he was throwing himself at the wall. 6 Years ago... \"Mummy, what's that sound\", I cried, fading into the sofa.\"Hunny, It's just lightning. There's nothing to worry about\", my mothers voice was sweet and caring and I knew there was nothing to worry about. 'Bang' \"AH\", I cried even more, wiping away the tears as if I have been beat up.\"Shh...Sweat pea I told you there's nothing to worry about\", my mother started to stroke my hair gently, pushing my fridge to the side. She slowly picked me up and carried me to bed, tucking me in.\"Mummy where's daddy\", I turned confused as he tucks me in every night not mother.\"Hes...hes at work\", my mother turned quiet.\"I thought he ended work at 5:00\", my eyes started to well up.\"I don't think daddy will be coming home\", she wiped away a tear what lied on her cheek. Present... The party was louder than before, and the screaming was louder. Something wasn't right, and the only people I could see were the people that surrounded us. My breath was cold and weak, I couldn't breath probably. Something wasn't right, and where was Charlie. She was right beside me like a minute ago. A soft, smooth hand touched my shoulder. Scaring the living-. \"Hello, do you want another beer\", His voice was soft and sweet just like my mothers years back. Blonde curly hair with a brown fridge and to match blue ocean eyes. He was hot. Pointless to ask, he probably already has a girlfriend. Well in this place he probably has, its a club its full of girls.\"AHH.\", a man screamed, at the back. Furiously moving dramatically. I threw my head high above the crowd, to see a woman attacking a man. No one seamed to care, but just look and glare at him suffer. Well there's a clue there everyone is drunk, and I could tell hes getting hurt. The woman was biting deep into his lifeless body, as he struggled. I pushed through the crowd and looked, was she mental. I mean like she was actually biting into his neck as she sat on his shoulders. This place was fucked up.\"Hey, are you alright\", I threw my hands up, waving like crazy. Her head slowly turned to my direction, staring blankly at me like I was food. Her eyes were red and they were looking straight at me, like she was a murderer. She looked like he was in her twenty's and she had blonde hair, and hazel eyes. She jumped off the man, and headed straight for me. The man dropped dead down onto the floor, blood flowing messily out of his neck. The woman headed faster and faster after me and I knew I had to gt away. I ran threw the crowd back to the bar, waiting to see if she followed me. A scream apeared before I knew it, people screaming in terror as people ran. Blood was everywhere and people were falling, I had to run. I pushed through the petrified crowd heading straight to the door. Omg thank you if you got this far.

Nora :-*Xx[Chapter 2] I ran through the door, drawing my attention to the city. It was still dark and misty, my breath started to turn cold. People stared screaming, falling over others. People trying to run, but failing as the infected ones catch them. I was to terrified to run, I thought I might burst into tears.\"YOU GOT TO HELP ME\", I got gripped by someone. Someone who was cold and hurt. Soft and smooth hands with cold blood flowing through there body. I turned around, to come face to face with someone. She started to growl, gritting her teeth together a she tried to get closer. I stepped back, as if I could get away she was following me. I pushed her back what just made her angrier. She gripped her arms around me as I struggled to get away but it was to late I was already on the floor. She took a sharp bite near my neck, me trying to push her back in the progress.\"GET OFF ME\", I cried turning sharply to every direction I can. I closed my eyes and wished for an opening, as if one wish would come true in this world. Blood splattered everywhere above my neck, holding my breath as I tried not to puke. Opening my eyes to a friendly hand, I sat up and gripped my hand onto his. He was the guy from the party, the person who worked at the bar. \"Come on we gotta move\", his voice went silent as I took a breath so it would be easier to get through this. I nodded. We took a sharp exit near a ally way, climbing up some ladders to a small house.\"Is this your house\", trying to breath as I sat down on the stairs.\"No its my brothers. He should be here\", I just had this eerie thought that his brother wasn't going to show up. Like my friend Charlie wasn't either.\"So who did you come with, to the party\", he continued to climb the ladders.\"I was here with my friend Charlie, but I can't find her\", he looked down at me, glaring down beneath the ladder.\"Someone is here\", he reached the top floor dragging me in, as he pulled the ladder up. \"Maybe its one of those things\", I continued to gasp for air. I couldn't get over the part I was attacked. And that he saved me, he saved me.\"Maybe, I think we should stay here til its morning\", he replied. I nodded. A shattering sound woke me up, throwing my head out of the window. To see who it was. Nothing. I saw nothing, I turned around to take a look at him. I didn't even know his name. He was sleeping like a baby, it was kinda cute to watch him sleep. But weird at the same time. ***** \"Wake up\", he started nudging me, waking up to find him above me.\"What\", my eyes followed his.\" we need to go, I think its clear outside\", he opened the window.\"What about your brother, and even Charlie\", I moaned.\"NOW\", he growled. We escaped out of the window, climbing down the rusty ladder. Taking a peak around the corner, nothing.\"Just before we go, what's your name?\", I questioned him.\"It's Ben\", he laughed.\"What's yours\", he replied.\"Its Nora\". He smiled but before he could answer something interrupted him...a sound of something moving, growling. What seemed to be getting closer and closer. But before I could take a look something attacked me... CLIFFHANGER...I hoped you enjoyed this little chapter.

I have recently had published my action adventure novel for all readers aged 14+. It is called The Day Trip, it is book one of four. I am very grateful to Black Rose Writing in the USA who have traditionally published my book and kept the story as I wrote it. So many thanks to Black Rose Writing. I am known as one of their cinematic writers, I write at a fast pace and keep the story flowing. The Day Trip is about a small group of American High School Pupils who are on a trip to Manhattan with their senior year group. While visiting the city an alien task force who landed the night before landed in New York begin an invasion. From there it is a fight for survival. Bradley Harrison is the lead character, him and a small group must fight their way through Manhattan to an evacuation point which has been set up by the US military and national guard. But the girl who he loves is kidnapped by the invaders and Bradley is determined to get her back. That's all I am going to say. So below I have put Chapter One, and the intro to Chapter Two in for you to read and come to an understanding of my literature and the way I describe a scene in my own wording. Many people ask me how I put scenes together, and the answer to that is \"music\". When I am writing a specific scene to any of my books I switch the music over. Mainly film soundtracks. Resident Evil is a brilliant series I use when writing. Anyway enough of me chatting now. The Day Trip is the name of my book, it will not let me leave a URL lik.

Many thanks again (Contact me I don't bite) S W Cheshire Chapter 1 A green, five-foot- six tall Armazoid named Gremlon stared out the front of his dropship window. He was an average interstellar pilot away from home on a ship mainly used for troop transport. Moderate sized and dull, the ship had two atomic engines at the back capable of propelling them through universe quicker than the blink of our eye. They were on Planet Sygonia, which is approximately eight point nine trillion light years from Planet Earth—very far away. \"Where are they?\" Gremlon snapped. \"They should have called in by now.\" The situation was tense. Comlon, his co-pilot, looked onto the radio stand on the avionics compartment of the ship waiting for the call. Ibregorg, the only other crewman aboard, looked pointlessly into the foliage for anything that could appear and pose a threat to their position. The dense shrubs surrounding the ship made it hard to see into the distance. \" This is Strike Force One calling Armazon three-one-six.\" Gremlon jumped to attention and saw Comlon sit straighter in his chair. \"That's them,\" Gremlon yelped. \"Answer it!\" \"Go ahead, Strike Force One,\" Comlon stated. \"What is your status and estimated time of arrival?\" There was a short pause. \" ETA four minutes, Armazon three one six.\" \"Power up!\" Gremlon said. \"We are out of here.\" Comlon fired up the atomic engines, and three minutes later watched as the strike force team came from the huge shrubs and bushes, chased by the tribal inhabitants of Sygonia. The gangplank was down—all the troops had to do was run fast and get on board. Alas, they were being shot down one by one by the vengeful Sygonians. Gremlon watched as the sprinting group slowly dwindled as they got closer and closer to the awaiting dropship, the foliage around them swaying with the force from the engines. He stared in disbelief. Colleagues he had known for years were perishing right in front of him. Nowhere in the universe had they come up against such an invincible force of creatures. Apparently, the Armazoids couldn't contend with their tribal nature and ability to unite and strategize. \"Come on!\" Gremlon gasped. \"Come on!\" Only one Armazoid from the strike force remained. He sprinted out towards the safety of the dropship, grasping the weapon he did not have time to recharge and use. Gremlon watched as this last remaining member of the strike team was shot in the back. The body froze, as the blood from his body ran out of his back. Eyes wide open, staring at the Armazoid Dropship, he slammed into the ground, knees first. Gremlon started running towards him. \"Cover me!\" he shouted over his shoulder. \"What?\" Comlon gasped. \"We haven't got time.\" Comlon watched as Gremlon dived out the back of the ship. Comlon had his back and opened fire onto the incoming Sygonians—there was no comrades left standing that he could possibly hit—while Gremlon dove onto the ground near the soldier. The soldier was panting from pain. His voice almost a whisper, he said, \"It is in my pouch.\" Gremlon knew he wasn't going to make it. He pulled a small disk out the pouch of his dying comrade. He looked down as the green blood ran out of the body. He didn't have the time to say goodbye, which added to the anger he felt. \" Gremlon! \" Comlon screamed at the top of his voice. Gremlon leapt up, sprinting back to open hanger of the dropship. He and Comlon shut the hanger door and ran to the control room. The atomic engines were at full power and ready to roll. Gremlon grabbed onto the stick in front of him, lifting the ship of the ground. He pushed the two power throttles forward. \"Hold on!\" he screamed. The nose of the dropship leveled out as it reached cruising altitude. He looked down at the blips on the radar, showing several dots following their own. The Sygonian ships were chasing after them. \"Get the burners on,\" Gremlon yelled. \"They are right behind us!\" \"Won't be a minute,\" Comlon replied. \"They're still powering up.\" Gremlon looked down onto the computer screen. The rays from the chasing Sygonian ships fired onto them as they powered away from the planet. He tried to dodge them. \"Ready!\" Comlon yelled. But before he could activate them, one of the rays hit the engines. There was a small explosion at the back, but the dropship continued to move upwards. Gremlon looked down at his screen as the afterburners continued to fire up. Finally, a blue ray zoomed from the back, blasting the ship forward—luckily they were still working. The Sygonian spaceships could only watch as the Armazoids craft disappeared into the depths of space. Gremlon lay back in his seat as the silver light of the stars passed the main front window. \"That was close,\" he said, relieved. \"You guys okay?\" The two Armazoids nodded, stunned by the sudden fire fight they had just got into. They were lucky to be alive. \"Let's assess the damage,\" Gremlon ordered. \"To see if we can make it back to base with this data.\" Comlon and Ibregorg stood up to take stock of the state of their ship. Gremlon stayed on the helm, but looked up when his two crew-men came back quickly. \"It should be okay until we get back to the ship,\" Comlon said. \"Hopefully.\" He sat down in the co-pilot seat of the dropship and looked out as they sped through the galaxy. He noticed a huge yellow star in the center of their present galaxy. \"How far have we travelled?\" he asked. \"About seven point nine trillion,\" Gremlon replied. \"All that for this!\" Comlon said remorsefully, gesturing to the small disk with the valuable data in Gremlon's hand. \"I knew Iennae and Blapau for years. It should have been me on that raid.\" \" Hey,\" Gremlon snapped, looking Comlon straight in the eyes. Comlon looked at Gremlon, his eyes wide. \"Don't you ever let me hear you say that again,\" Gremlon yelled. \"Those two signed up to defend our motherland, our home, our Armazon. Their deaths will not be in vain, I can promise you that!\" The back of the dropship went unusually quiet. Suddenly, an explosion from the back rocked the ship. The nose of the ship lowered. Gremlon grabbed onto the stick, pulling back. It was a struggle, but it pulled out. Alarms were screaming at him to act. \"Now what?\" Comlon asked. Gremlon looked up at his computer. He watched as the left atomic engine started to shut down. They would never be able to make it to the mother ship. Light smoke started entering the cabin of the ship. There was a sudden surge. He continued looking at his computer as both the engines flared up. \"Declare an emergency,\" Gremlon said. The ship started to slow down as Comlon switched on the radio. On the main ship still light years from them, Circo, the leader of the first attack force, stood in the control room, trillions of miles away. \" This is Comlon,\" the radio mumbled. Circo stormed over to it. The signal was weak. \"Comlon, this is Circo. Can you hear me?\" he asked. There was a short break. \"Yes, only just,\" Comlon replied. \"We have been hit and are unable to reach base.\" \"Comlon—\" started Circo. The radio went completely dead. Gremlon looked up as the smoke filling the cockpit grew thicker. The radio was dead, and the ship had sustained too much damage. He scanned the radar, looking for a place or a planet to ditch the craft. Sparks flew out of the radio. But something caught Gremlon's eye as the ship banked to the left. He saw a medium-sized planet coming into view. He stared through the windshield at the lumps of blue and a funny looking green color that covered the planet. It was their only option. \"There,\" he yelled. \"There!\" \"I heard you the first time,\" Comlon replied. Gremlon was pointing at Planet Earth. He looked at the curious planet as it grew in their view screens. He turned the ship and headed directly towards it. Sparks continued to rain down from the ceiling as the instruments and system gauges started to fail one after the other. The planet filled their view as they continued to slow down with the loss of engine power. The nose of the ship heated up as they entered the planet's atmosphere. Gremlon pulled the control stick back, straining the craft's hydraulic system to try to slow the descent. The two other Armazoids could only sit and watch as the flames sped over the ship, adding to the heat from the burning engines, and the craft gently rocked from side to side. The orange flames and plasma trails disappeared from the ship. Dense, jet-black smoke poured from the back of the engine. Comlon looked out of the window as they continued quickly dropping from the sky. \"What is this place?\" Gremlon demanded. \"I, I don't know,\" Comlon replied. \"How high are we?\" Gremlon asked. \"We are just over five thousand feet above it. We've got maybe two minutes of glide time before we crash,\" Comlon replied. Something else caught Gremlon's eyes. He looked to his left to see two black jets pulling up next to them as they continued descending towards the ground. \"What the hell are they?\" Gremlon asked. The two other Armazoids walked up to the window and looked out as the ground continued to get closer and closer. One of the black jets pulled in front of the dropship, gently rocking its wings. Gremlon followed the black jet over the land. He looked out to see a long strip in front of them, approaching as they passed through five thousand feet. \"Sit down,\" Gremlon ordered. \"This is going to be rough this landing.\" The two other Armazoids sat down as Gremlon reached out and pulled down the landing gear lever. The landing gear came down as the airstrip came closer and closer to them. The wind drag it created helped slow the ship for the landing. The two black jets continued accompanying them towards the threshold of the runway as they descended. Gremlon grasped hold of the control stick and pulled the nose up as the back gear slammed into the ground. The black fumes continued piling out of the aircraft. The speed brakes opened on the top of the wings as the nose gear touched down onto the runway of the huge military airstrip. The end of the runway was getting near, and the dropship had started to slow down, but they were still going too fast. Gremlon felt the nose wheel start to creak. He held on tight as it touched down, skidding along the rest of the runway. The scraping echoed around the cabin as the ship. Luckily it helped to slow them down to a stop. The onlookers at a military base in Yenisei in northern Russia, around 300 miles from the Siberian border, gawked as the alien spacecraft stood on the runway, nose gear collapsed. No signs of life could be seen. Gremlon slowly lifted his head up and peeked out of the window, which already had a dusting of snow settling on it. He didn't know what to expect. The life forms slowly started walking towards them, armed well. \"What the hell are those things?\" he asked in a shocked and confused voice. Comlon walked to the front of the ship. Still shaken from the crash, he stared at the gray uniforms and wide hats. The weather outside was freezing, and snow started to obstruct the view of the beings moving toward them. Gremlon pulled himself together. \"Prepare to disembark—now!\" Gremlon ordered. As the Armazoids prepared to leave the ship, the life forms completely surrounded them. Gremlon looked down at his computer. He pushed the tiny emergency button, which signaled their location to the mother ship light years away from their current position. He also took the time to assess the area outside him via his computer readouts. They reported very high levels of carbon dioxide and very low temperatures. \"Suits,\" he ordered. \"Carbon dioxide out there and lots of it.\" \"We're going out there?\" Comlon asked in a shocked voice \"Got a better idea?\" Gremlon replied, looking into his eyes The group got into their suits, looking at one another apprehensively as they prepared to go outside. \"Hide the data,\" Gremlon ordered, waving the disk in Comlon's face. \"What?\" Comlon asked. \"Just do it.\" Comlon took the disk and hid it in a flap under the floor. They armed themselves, ready to fight to the death. Gremlon looked at his two comrades as he pulled the red lever. The bay doors slowly hissed open. The smoke poured in from the outside. It was extremely cold. \"Here goes,\" Gremlon said. Gremlon walked out first, uncertain of what to do first. There was another group of natives approaching dressed all in white. \"What do we do?\" Comlon frantically whispered to Gremlon, clearly panicking. Gremlon didn't say a word. \"Now!\" Comlon yelled. \"Wait,\" Gremlon shrieked, trying to prevent the fight. Comlon fired onto the men, followed closely by Ibregorg. Their purple rays zapped through the air, mostly slamming harmlessly into the snow, but one hit a man dressed in gray. The men in gray began to run and shout, finding cover and firing back at the Armazoids. \"Shit,\" Gremlon yelled as he dove behind the ships's cargo door. He watched from his position of relative safety as Comlon and Ibregorg, his only two remaining crewmen, fell to the ground, riddled with bullets. He knew he would have to surrender, but the fate of Planet Armazon rested in his hands and on that disk. Gremlon dropped his weapon onto the floor. He stood up slowly, looking at the people as they walked slowly towards him, clutching their weapons. Two of the men placed him in a strong plastic bag. Gremlon felt his body being tightly compressed as he was lifted and placed on a metal table. He struggled to get out but the straps were too tight. He trembled as he wondered where on earth he was going. Volkov Radoslav, the Russian Premier, woke to a banging on his door. His eyes slowly opened to the heavy knocks. His head burned from the warmth of the heaters. He sat up slowly and rubbed his eyes. He got out of the bed and walked across the red carpet toward the front door of his room. He found himself looking at his assistant, Stanislav. \"Sorry to wake you, sir, but there has been an incident,\" Stanislav said quietly. Volkov paused for a long moment before speaking. \"Okay. A minute please.\" He dressed slowly, wondering what on earth had happened for him to be woken up so early in the morning. The sun had started to come up over the horizon of Moscow. Volkov walked out of his bedroom and down to his office. He sat down as three of his military top generals waited to speak to him. He looked at his white coffee cup on his desk as he sat down and noticed the lack of steam. \"Okay, bring me up to speed on the situation,\" Volkov demanded. One of the generals stepped forward. \"Sir,\" he said quietly, \"an alien spacecraft has crashed at our Yenisei air base.\" Volkov didn't say a word. He wondered if he was still asleep and if this was just a dream running through his head. \"An alien spacecraft,\" he repeated. \"Yes, sir. Crash-landed a few hours ago. We only just got the message.\" There was a silence in his office. He looked up at the clock. \"Did anyone see what damaged the ship?\" he asked. \"No, sir,\" his general said. \"It flew in from the north already smoking and crashed at our air force base there. We managed to guide it in.\" \"Did any living thing emerge from the craft?\" Volkov asked. \"Yes sir,\" The general replied. \"Three of them.\" \"Did they offer any resistance?\" Volkov asked. \"Yes. Two were shot and we have one at Area 52,\" the general said. \"Has he tried any type of communication with you?\" Volkov asked. \"No, sir,\" his general replied, \"but we are working at it.\" \"Okay,\" Volkov said. \"I want a media blackout on this. No one is to know—only us.\" \"Understood, sir.\" Chapter 2 Three months later. If you asked Bradley Harrison to write about himself and what was important to him, this is what he would say: We used to be the typical boys, running around with toy guns, shooting at enemies and, of course, not to forget the aliens. You know what I mean. So we had the practice. Who was to know that one day all that pissing around would have been needed on a normal day like today. My name is Bradley. Bradley Harrison. I'm your average, everyday teenager. Love women and have my mind on one thing only. You guessed it: gun clubs and martial arts. Of course, you know what else I mean. I was born on the 2nd August 19.99. So nearly eighteen. Let me introduce you to some of my friends, and to make things better, the enemies too, who are going to have a different view of me after today. Meet Kevin, my longest running and most loyal friend. I have known him since kindergarten. He has a great brother called Will who has joined the US Army. Then we have Max. Nice guy, the best sniper shooting at the local gun club. He has had more bull's eyes than I have had hot dinners. And of course we leave the best man till last. Meet Eric. Yes, Eric. Mind you, Eric did help us out a lot when the Armazoids were invading, but he isn't the sharpest tool in the toolbox. But we all love him very much. Now to the others. Kate is my childhood sweetheart, and Lisa is Kevin's. To this very day we are trying to get in their pants. I didn't just say that, did I? But haven't had much luck since—well, you get what I mean. Now to the fun people. Ms. Hogan, our form tutor. Has had it in for me ever since I started high school. I don't know it's one of those things, but she has a little side-kick named Colin. If I said boo to a goose he would tell her. So there you have it. However, a normal day trip to the Big Apple is going to change the way they viewed life as they saw it.

I have recently had published my action adventure nov"},{"Movie":"Battle: Los Angeles","Title":"Mission: South Central","Author":"Darkpenn","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10826536","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Battle: Los Angeles Mission: South Central There are certain places that aliens should not try to invade. [Author's Note: This story takes place soon after the story Mission: Downtown.] Staff Sergeant Nantz awoke with a start, immediately reaching for his gun. Then he remembered: the invasion, the police station, the alien C&C;, the downed communications ship – \"Good morning, Staff Sergeant,\" said a civilian, a middle-aged woman who was acting as an orderly. \"How long was I out?\" said Nantz. \"Nineteen hours,\" said the woman, as she handed Nantz of cup of hot coffee. \"To be expected. As I understand it, you and your men were on your feet and in the fight for two days straight.\" Nantz nodded. He knew that one of the dangers of a high-stress combat situation was the feeling that you could keep going, running on adrenalin and willpower. You push yourself through the fatigue and the pain ... and then you suddenly collapse. So when the colonel, Ritchie, had ordered him and his men to take a break – Santos, Honorary Marine, was in the infirmary – he saw the wisdom of the advice, and lay down before he fell down. As did Imlay and the others. As he downed some food from the table in the tent, he did some mental calculations. It was a bit under four days since the alien landing. The colonel walked up to him and started to pile scrambled egg onto his own plate. Guy looked like he could use some sack-time as well. \"If you're wondering, we're holding them,\" said Colonel Ritchie. \"They haven't got their air power back since you took down the command ship but they've got some pretty good surface-to-air. And they've established a solid beachhead, from Thousand Oaks to Long Beach. And they've still got their big ship in the water near Catalina Island. The experts say it's sucking up seawater somehow.\" Nantz nodded as the two of them sat down at a table. \"How are other countries doing?\" he said. \"Mixed,\" Ritchie said. \"One thing, though: everyone has chipped in to work on the translation of the Santos Stash. A team of linguistics techs from all over have already got some chunks of it worked out, and are writing a translation program. They say that if we can set up some transponders we might even be able to eavesdrop on their comms. That would help, since we really don't know much about them. We've managed to intercept a few signals from their advance units and it seems like they don't use code. Just speak in plain language. Plain for them, I mean. \"Which brings me to my next point. We need a team to go into an area on the front line and set up a transponder. It would be the last piece in a network. That's where you come in. You and your squad, and your Air Force liaison.\" Nantz gave a grunt. \"Where does it have to go?\" he said. Colonel Ritchie took a map from his pocket and unfolded it. \"Here,\" he said. \"It's an area where we haven't had any troops, so we don't know the level of alien activity.\" Nantz looked at the map. South Central. He located and roused Imlay, Lockett, Adukwu and Harris, made sure they were re-supplied. They were eating breakfast when Santos appeared, saying she had \"escaped\" from the infirmary. Nantz explained the mission to them. \"South Central,\" mused Lockett. \"Dangerous territory. And that was before the aliens.\" \"What's wrong with South Central?\" said Adukwu. Imlay, Lockett, Harris and Santos looked at him – and then laughed. \"The tech boys are preparing the transponder now,\" said Nantz, as he spread out the map. \"It will be a couple of pieces, can be carried in backpacks. The best location is on the roof of a building here, the tallest one in the area still standing, according to drone surveillance. Called The International Mart, 155 West Washington Boulevard, northern end of South Central.\" \"How do we get in, Staff Sergeant?\" said Harris. \"The last time, with Moped in the chopper, didn't work out so well.\" \"Bushmaster light-armoured vehicle,\" said Nantz. \"We go in, set up the transponder, get out. If we can listen to their signals, it will be a big advantage. And maybe the Navy boys will be able to launch an attack on their mother ship off the coast.\" Lockett grunted. \"Sure, we roll into one of the nastiest places on Earth in a light-armour truck, hump a pile of tech up ten flights of stairs and stick it together, avoid the ETs, and be back in time for dinner,\" he said. \"What's not to like?\" said Santos. They entered South Central, going west along Florence Avenue. The freeways had been smashed, as had most of the large buildings. They were passing under the Harbour Freeway when they came across it: the scene of a battle. A dozen alien bodies; looked like a platoon of them had been caught in a cross-fire. They had been riddled with bullets from automatic weapons. Lockett, driving, slowed as they passed. \"I thought that there hadn't been any of our troops in here, Staff Sergeant,\" he said. \"That's what I was told,\" said Nantz. \"But someone took these ones down pretty effectively. Fire points in buildings there and there, elevated position, waited until the target was in a kill box, another fire point back there to cut off the line of retreat.\" They turned north onto South Normandie Avenue. In the distance, they could see The International Mart, the only tall building in the area. And then they heard it: the chatter of gunfire, and the whoop-whoop of alien rockets. \"Sonia's Market, probably,\" said Lockett. \"On our way, couple of blocks.\" \"Let's go,\" said Nantz. It took them only a few minutes to reach Sonia's Market, a smashed-up mall. A dozen aliens were trying to make a stand in an intersection but were taking fire from all sides, guns firing from windows. The aliens fired a cluster-bomb rocket at one of the windows and the guns there fell silent, but the fire from the other points continued. Aside from the machine guns there was an occasional single shot, and each time a bullet whacked into an alien. Lockett pulled the Bushmaster into an alley and the six of them got out. As they did so, they saw a pair of alien tanks coming along the road, cannons traversing to give covering fire to the besieged soldiers. \"Whoever is doing the shooting, it doesn't look like they've got anything that can deal with tanks,\" said Imlay. \"But we do,\" said Santos. \"There's two RPG7s in the truck.\" \"Get them and load up,\" said Nantz. Harris and Lockett took up firing positions, hefting the shoulder-launched anti-tank weapons. The tanks had reached the middle of the intersection now and were spraying the windows with fire, providing cover to the alien soldiers. \"Mow 'em,\" said Nantz. Harris and Lockett fired, and the rockets streaked across the open space, smashing into the tanks. The simultaneous explosions took out the tanks and the last of the alien soldiers. There was a long silence as the smoke drifted away. A voice shouted from one of the windows: \"Yo! Who are you?\" \"US Marines!\" shouted Nantz back. \"Friendlies!\" There was a long pause. Then the voice shouted: \"Not around here you ain't!\" The six Marines looked at each other. \"What the hell?\" said Lockett. Then, from a different building, a woman, black, with long hair tied back, emerged. She was carrying a sniper rifle. She headed for Nantz and the others. When she was only a few meters away, she stopped and looked at them. After a while, she said: \"Ignore Drive-by, he's an asshole. Good to see you. We didn't know if there were any of you guys left.\" She gestured for the others to join her, and a dozen men and women armed with automatic rifles emerged from the buildings. The two groups studied each other. \"Are there any more of you?\" said the guy who had called out before, Drive-by. \"Or is the US army only six grunts?\" \"Re-grouping, getting ready for a counter-attack,\" said Nantz. \"As part of that, we need to get into that building over there, 155 West Washington.\" \"Huh,\" said Drive-by. \"You can't.\" \"Yeah, there could be a problem with that,\" said the woman. \"I'm Shooter, by the way. And I guess we should take you to see General Mama.\" It was a building a few blocks away, looked like it had once been a store that sold whitegoods. Shooter had gone on ahead, and Drive-by – somewhat reluctantly – led the squad through a maze of washing machines and refrigerators. General Mama was a square-built older Hispanic woman, standing at a large table where an improvised map of the South Central area, with little cardboard boxes and blocks of wood representing buildings, was laid out. She and Nantz shook hands. \"Shooter tells me that you took out two alien pots,\" she said. \"That's good, we don't have anything that can do that. All we can do is take out the grunts and then retreat when they call up the armour.\" \"Looks like you've done alright,\" said Santos. \"The General has got a good head for finding ambush spots,\" said Shooter. \"We know the territory,\" said General Mama. \"It's ours. That why we're fighting for it.\" \"Didn't the army tell you to evacuate, soon after the alien landing?\" said Adukwu. \"It's home,\" said Shooter. \"And the army is not much different to the cops,\" said Drive-by. \"What we need,\" said General Mama, \"is heavier weapons. Some of those RPGs – you got any more?\" \"Sorry, no,\" said Nantz. \"But maybe we can have some brought in. It would be good if we could establish communications to the forward army base.\" \"But not radio,\" said Mama General, gesturing to a battery-operated radio set in the corner. \"Their planes fell out of the sky a few days ago – we don't know why that happened – but if you use a radio they can target you with one of their rockets. We think they don't have a long range but they're pretty dangerous. Took us a while to realise that. Even a cellphone brings a load down on you. Lost some good people that way.\" \"They can't track landlines,\" said Imlay. \"Maybe we can find one still working.\" \"Maybe ... a public phone,\" said Santos. \"They have their own power lines.\" \"There's a phone box still standing in the next street,\" said Shooter. General Mama took a battered helmet from a shelf and plonked it onto her head. \"Let's go,\" she said. As they left the building, Shooter leading the way, Nantz and the others saw people putting bottles of water and packs of food into boxes and loading them onto bicycles ridden by kids. \"Still a lot of people living around here,\" said General Mama. \"People who didn't get the evacuation order or didn't understand it. Lot of people who are illegals or have cop trouble thought it might be a trick so they stayed. We're trying to get supplies to them. Taking it from supermarkets. If the people who own the stores have a problem, they're welcome to come and discuss it.\" Santos pointed to a group of men loading weapons. \"Gang colors?\" she said. \"Yeah, that's where the guns come from,\" said General Mama. \"When the aliens first rolled in, the gang-bangers put up a fight, but they were getting smashed up, fighting for their little patches of turf. I told them that if they didn't get their shit together, start co-operating, then I would personally tear them each a new one. Told them they can go back to killing each other once we've kicked the ETs off the planet.\" \"But they're tough critters,\" said Shooter. \"There's been ones I've put six slugs into and they don't fall down.\" \"Weak spot is the side, left of where the heart would be,\" said Santos. \"Huh,\" said Shooter. \"How do you know?\" \"Took one apart,\" said Santos. \"General, what were you before all this happened?\" said Lockett. Mama General shrugged. \"Nothing,\" she said. \"Just another anciano .\" \"How did you learn about military tactics?\" said Nantz. Mama General pulled a tattered book from the pocket of her jacket. It was The Battles of Stonewall Jackson . She showed it to Nantz and said: \"You know it?\" Nantz nodded. \"Compulsory reading for Marines,\" he said. \"Nothing better for small-arms combat. But maybe we can organise some anti-tank weapons for you as well.\" \"Good,\" she said. \"One thing Jackson said was that you have to go on the offensive. So far, we've been defending, setting ambushes, picking them off. It's good as far as it goes, but you don't win a war that way.\" \"Damn right,\" said Lockett. They reached the phone box. Nantz picked up the receiver. Then he realised: no change. He looked at the others of the squad. They all shrugged. \"Damn, I thought you guys were supposed to plan ahead,\" said Shooter, handing Nantz a quarter. \"I'll be wanting it back.\" Nantz punched the emergency contact number. After a long time, someone at Mojave Base picked up. Eventually, he got through to Colonel Ritchie, and explained the situation. \"Hmm,\" said Ritchie. \"RPG7s for a bunch of gang-bangers? I don't know if that's such a good idea.\" \"They're a viable force but they need support,\" said Nantz. \"I'll let their commander tell you herself.\" He handed the phone to General Mama. \"We need RPG7s, at least twenty,\" she said. \"Heavy machine guns, 50-cal or bigger. Bullets for M16s and AK-47s, and for sniper rifles. Medical supplies, at the moment all we've got is illegal drugs and what we've salvaged from a pharmacy. A communications line. Night vision goggles. Got all that?\" Nantz could imagine Ritchie scratching his head. \"Not a whole lot of time to fuck around,\" said General Mama. \"We're in the open and the neighbours have got big eyes. Put it this way, Army. My people have killed maybe two hundred of those suckers, and I've put seventeen down myself. How many have you iced?\" Ritchie said something. Mama General handed the phone to Nantz. \"Can you do all that?\" said Nantz. \"Have to,\" said Ritchie. \"She ranks me. Staff Sergeant, we'll send a chopper in with the supplies, as much as we can muster. It will be flying low to avoid the alien SAMs.\" They agreed to a place and a time. As Nantz and the others made their way back to General Mama's headquarters, several kids on bikes passed them. \"Scouts, as well as supply delivery,\" said Shooter. \"Vehicles sometimes draw alien fire, we think because of the heat. Bicycles don't.\" \"A scout unit has already looked at the building you wanted, and it's not good news,\" said General Mama, as they returned to the map room. She pointed to the area. \"The aliens have got an observation post on the roof, it's caused us a lot of trouble. Always four pots around the building, they're represented here by the jam-jar lids. And a couple of dozen soldiers in the building next door, right here, see? That's a big problem. So we haven't been able to launch an attack.\" Nantz picked up one of the jam-jar lids and looked at it. \"Yo!\" shouted Drive-by from the entrance. \"There's a chopper coming this way, along West Manchester Avenue!\" \"Uh, you mean above it, don't you?\" said Imlay, as they all ran into the street outside. \"See for yourself,\" said Drive-by. And, indeed, the chopper – an MH6 Little Bird – was coming along the street, not two metres from the ground. It landed in an intersection and the pilot jumped out. \"Hey, it's Moped!\" said Adukwu. \"Hi,\" said Moped, shaking their hands. \"How do you like my new ride? Couldn't get another Blackhawk, apparently it's one per customer. When I heard it was you guys I put my hand up for the job. I've brought as much as I could carry, not everything you wanted but enough to start with, I think. The colonel says they'll send a Bushmaster in tomorrow with more.\" There were ten RPG7s amongst the supplies. Nantz, still holding the jam-jar lid, turned it over in his hands, thinking. \"Time to go on the attack,\" he said aloud. \"You sure you want to do this?\" whispered Imlay. \"I was more sure back at base,\" whispered Shooter back. \"Now we're this close, it's a whole different deal.\" Imlay gave a soft little laugh. \"And that's why you should never volunteer for anything,\" he said. \"You did,\" said Shooter. \"I thought that the Staff Sergeant wanted someone to get some beers,\" said Imlay. Shooter smiled. They were close to the alien encampment around 155 West Washington Boulevard, hiding behind a pile of rubble. Four tanks, with a half-dozen soldiers wandering about. More, maybe twenty-five or thirty, in a nearby building. That was the building that was the mission of Imlay and Shooter. \"I guess we could just go back,\" said Shooter. \"Retreat, hell,\" said Imlay. \"We just got here.\" He checked his watch. \"Let's go.\" They crawled forward, slowly. Eventually, they reached the building holding the alien soldiers. They did what they had to do, hiding it at the corner of the wall, and crawled back. They reached their hiding place. Imlay checked his watch again. \"One minute,\" he said. From a block away, they heard the engine of a pick-up start. It was coming their way. On the radio they had secreted, a timer flicked a switch. With a burst of static, the radio came on. Long seconds ticked by. The sound of the engine was coming closer. The tanks started up, turned their barrels towards the sound. Then it began to fade, moving away. From the other side of the street, another engine started up, and a van smashed through the glass window of a store – and the barrels of the tanks were still pointed the other way. The side door of the van opened, revealing a 50-cal, Drive-by behind it. A volley of heavy bullets smashed into the soldiers around the tanks. There was another sound – the whooshing whistle of a barrage of alien rockets. Homing in on the radio signal, they smashed into the building holding the alien troops. The windows blew out in a cascade of glass. There was the sound of alien screams. The van zoomed away, turning a corner. The four tanks went after it – and found themselves in a narrow street with buildings on either side, not more than ten metres away. \"Light 'em up,\" said Nantz. The four RPG gunners – Lockett, Harris, and two of General Mama's soldiers – fired together. Each of the missiles hit their target – they could hardly miss – and all four tanks exploded. \"Outstanding,\" said General Mama, next to Nantz. \"Stonewall would be proud.\" \"Mission's not done yet,\" said Nantz. He and his squad ran for the door of 155 West Washington Boulevard, Imlay and Shooter joining them there. Lockett, Harris, and Santos were carrying the components of the transponder. Together, they ran up the stairs, an exhausting climb. But eventually they were at the door that led to the roof. \"We don't know what's on the other side, so be prepared for anything,\" said Nantz. \"Well, we didn't climb all those stairs for nothing, Staff Sergeant,\" said Harris. He kicked the door. Nothing happened. He kicked again. Zip. \"Strong door,\" he said. \"Hey, try this,\" said Santos. She turned the handle and pushed. The door swung open. \"Very funny,\" said Harris. \"Laugh later,\" said Nantz. They burst through the door, scattering and hitting the ground. Firing. There were four aliens there, only two of them were soldiers. They raised their guns but were obviously stunned at the sudden appearance of the humans. One went down to the concentrated machine-gun fire, but the other stayed up even after a series of hits. Then there was a single shot, and it fell. \"Damn, Santos, you were right, left of where the heart would be,\" said Shooter, as she reloaded her rifle. \"Say, what did you mean when you said you took one apart?\" \"Staff Sergeant, I think I'm in love,\" said Lockett. \"Later,\" said Nantz. He turned to the two remaining aliens. Unlike the others, they did not have guns grafted onto their arms, although they appeared to have comm-packs attached to their backs. \"Techs,\" said Imlay. \"These guys are tech support. Not grunts.\" He gestured for the aliens to put up their hands. They did. Harris and the others were already assembling the transponder, and connecting it to the battery. General Mama came through the door and onto the roof. She was puffing. \"That's a lot of stairs for my old legs,\" she said. She looked around. From here, you could see all the way to the ocean, although the alien landing encampment area seemed to be covered in a grey haze. \"This will be useful,\" she said. \"I'll get some guys to set up a post here for us. What are you going to do with these two?\" \"Take them back, see if they can tell us anything useful, see if the equipment they've got can help us,\" said Nantz. \"The colonel told me that some of our people were close to cracking their language. So some prisoners could be a good source of intelligence.\" He looked south, towards South Central. A good part of it was smashed and ruined. \"Looks like your home has taken a pretty hard hit,\" he said. \"Tell the truth, it was much like this before,\" said Shooter. \"Except that the aliens were illegal and spoke Spanish.\" \"Almost hard to believe,\" said Colonel Ritchie, putting down the report provided by Nantz. \"But it sounds like they're a tough bunch.\" \"Tough and clever,\" said Nantz. \"Sir, has there been anything from the prisoners?\" \"Yes, quite a lot,\" said Ritchie. \"Once they got over their shock about us being able to speak their language – via a computer – they told us a lot. Apparently, no-one had ever told them not to say anything if they got captured. And we've also been able to tap into the aliens' communication network, thanks to the transponder you set up. It seems that all their officers are connected, some sort of cranial implant. \"On the bigger picture, it looks as if they're having some second thoughts. They've stopped trying to expand into Los Angeles, mainly they're just staying in their beachhead, with occasional patrols. Meanwhile, we've been building up our own forces. So you probably know what that means.\" Nantz nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I know.\" END ","Summary":" Battle: Los Angeles Mission: South Central There are certain places that aliens should not try to i"},{"Movie":"Battle: Los Angeles","Title":"Mission Critical Equipment","Author":"TornVocalCords","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9239143","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I Do not own Battle LA or anything having to do with this movie. The man with the rifle hopped down from his perch. The enemy air cavalry appeared to be ignoring him in favor of a more pressing directive to his east. Wiping the sweat from his brow he leaned his rifle against the wall and sat on some rubble. He took his helmet off and placed it on his lap, inside slightly soggy from blood and sweat was a picture of his wife. He knew it was against regulations to take his bucket off in a battlefield, actually it was just plain stupid, but he did it anyway. He did not much care about regulations anymore, the aliens had landed, what did regulations state for that? At that moment a missile of some sort whizzed over his head, his head snapped up to try to identify it. It was going too quickly to make a proper identification but it appeared to be a copperhead surface-to-surface missile. Someone was fighting back. Suddenly the building to his left was destroyed as an alien tank burst through it as if it were made of tissue paper. He dived to his rifle and grabbed it, on his back he prepared for the end. But the tank just kept rolling. Wherever all of these aliens were going in a hurry seemed to be where the party was, that's for sure. He looked to his immediate surroundings for the highest vantage point. it was across the street in an abandoned office building. Kicking open the roof access door he slid to the nearest shadow cast by the setting sun. Using the sights on his older (yet somehow more reliable) M14 rifle he looked to the east. There hovering in the sky like some mechanized mushroom was a thing. He knew it was not human of origin and therefore definitely his problem. With the sights on his rifle he saw a laser waving around at the doom-shroom. \"So that's the team who's calling in those Copperheads.\" he scratched his head and watched as another copperhead zoomed over the rooftops from behind him and smashed into one of the smaller enemy single fighters. He looked at the nearest building. Then at the alien mushroom of death. \"Fuck this shit\" He across the rooftops to the east.

I really didn't have the heart to change it completely, because the first chapter to this story is very much my baby and I have too many memories attached to it. Primavera © Eklipt Battle: Los Angeles © Jonathan Liebesman They call holidays an option for a reason I heard you're coming back to life just for the fourth I've been catching all your ghosts for every season I pray to god you won't come back here anymore Where have you been? - Manchester Orchestra Chapter 1 Forsythia : Good nature, innocence, and anticipation The clouds hung low, providing a source of insulation despite the chilly winter morning. It was six in the morning with the only sound of motion being my deep labored breaths as I enjoyed the early morning jog before the disturbance of the morning rush hour. It was the only time I can accomplish something in peace without the dozens of curious passersby. Or maybe I took a small joy in being the first to make a footprint in the recent blanket of powdered snow on the ground. I paused despite the burning adrenaline of caffeine begging me not to. This morning winter jog will be the last for a while, meaning up to four or more years. I breathed in the crisp air from the result of a fresh snowfall. The pollution of the town felt like it was miles away despite the fact that it will always blanket the area due to the fact that it was literally in a bowl of surrounding mountains. It was the perfect place to locate a mass of civilization- or so the forbearers had thought. The place could have been beautiful if not for the pulp mills constantly pumping out toxins. It was a never good day if there were fog, because more than likely it smelt strongly of sewage and toxins. I enjoyed the scenery of the town at the peak of the hill where the trees were less in abundance to hinder my view. The lights from the lamp posts reflected off the snow and glittered harmoniously with each step I took. By now, I suppose I should be regretting my brilliant idea in joining the marines, however, I was so ridiculously ready to turn over a new page in my life that I can sacrifice the small joys. My only concern was learning to tolerate the hot summers of sunny California. I never liked the sun in all nineteen years of my life. I decided I've had enough of the cold that had started to nip into my skin after the clouds had departed. The heat it trapped in had escaped rapidly and signs of dawn had streaked through the grey fluffy blankets in the sky. By now my cheeks were already an impressive shade of red in contrast to my naturally tanned skin. My lips were chapped and my feet ached. I wanted nothing more than to crawl back into bed, but by now Cathy was probably already up and about and more than likely groaning my name in spite for having to wake up early for my sake. My only coercion was to buy her a coffee in which she begrudgingly couldn't turn down the thought of free coffee. The perks of living with a coffee addict. I swiped my student ID card into the card slot and waited for the door to open automatically. I was dreading the thought of packing up my entire room with no motivation to do so. Who ever knew that the human sloth would have the guts to enter the marine forces, with all the grunt training, the early mornings, and physical labor that I was especially not known for. Despite my flawed logic, priorities, and lack of motivation, I did have my reasons. And that reason being him . To me that was reason enough. It had only been a month since I had made my decision. I reminisced over what happened over that time period as I used my teeth to tear a strip of scotch tape, and placed it over the cardboard flaps of the box that contained the last of my things. My dorm room appeared empty now, and the walls were scrubbed clean. Paper cranes of various sizes and colours no longer decorated the ceiling, and the only evidence left behind were the tiny holes created by push-pins. I sighed, glancing towards the lemon-scented desk. The top shelf had a wooden frame; inside a picture of a tall, silly looking guy with his arm slung around my shoulder. His eyes were droopy in an attempt to create the 'bedroom-eyes', only to fail and appear as a total creep. My lips quirked for a split-second before I flipped the frame face-down and unlatched the back, taking the picture out and folding it up. I placed it in the back pocket of my jeans before I took the remaining box and left the dorm room life behind for the final time. The memories and dreams I created here had been boxed up and ready to be transported five hours away without me. I had other plans, and I sure couldn't go home for four years. I had enlisted into the marines at 20-years of age with only a few years of studies left before I was able to obtain my master's degree in Psychology. The professors and counsellors who had been working with my psychological health for the past few months had turned their noses up at the mention of my plans to drop out of school after my first semester, thinking that I was wasting my potential by joining the marines. That I would only be a huge target for sexual harassment and would be crushed by military standards and expectations due to my petite size. But I wasn't entirely defenseless, despite being only a mere five-foot in height. I had naturally muscular biceps and legs due to genetics, along with fairly broad shoulders that made shopping for shirts, skirts and dresses so difficult. However, genetics and physical traits wasn't the reason for joining. It was him . After he left, so did my dreams. It was going to take a lot of hard work to get my passion back for life, and what better way than to join the marines? Why not fight for my life to regain back my respect and appreciation of it. I knew it was a drastic decision, but I had already measured the pros and cons prior to my decision. It was going to help gain the confidence that I need to tackle problems – specifically social problems, and conquer them rather than escape like I always had done in the past. I was tired of living behind a shell. \"Are you ready, Jaren?\" Cathy asked, revving up her truck as I put the box in the back seat. \"Unfortunately,\" I replied, climbing into the passenger and shut the door. I caught the knowing look my roommate shot at me as she shifted gears and backed out of the narrow parking lot. As soon as she was sure she wouldn't careen into any vehicles, she sped up, causing us to drift along the snow top for a moment before leaving the university behind. I sighed, pulling my hood over my head and sunk down into the seat. I felt comforted by the winter chill that crept down to my bones. It was the last Canadian winter that I would experience for a while, and I would have to adapt to the humid weather of sunny California. It was in that train of the thought that reminded me that I was going to need an entire change of wardrobe. I groaned at the thought, ignoring Cathy's look of curiosity. Despite my desperate intentions to improve my ability to confront my problems, it felt like I was still running away from them. I was taking several steps back from my goal in a last-ditch effort by joining the marines. I was hoping that taking those steps back would give me the momentum I needed to overcome that mental wall that had been my comfort zone for so long. The marines would build me that strength and motivation, even if it meant having to demolish that wall instead. I felt the left side of my head burn and I realized that we were at a stop light. I slowly glanced over to notice that Cathy was staring with a glint in her eyes that shone with raw determination. I twitched my lip, and rested my head against the window as I prepared for the 'voice of reason'. \"You know, we were really good roommates together. We all lived together really well. It's too bad that you're leaving us right after we finally got you out of your shell.\" I flinched at her words. I was a little surprised that she spoke so much, but I realized the truth of her words. In the time of being roommates with Justine, Becky, and her, I hadn't really hung out with any of them until last night. It was our first and only roommate hangout where we went to Dairy Queen, gossiped, and was interrogated about any guys in our lives. It was the first time in a few weeks that I was able to smile after He died. Of course, they questioned about him and his significance in my life. At the time, I couldn't find the words to tell them, and resorted to shoving a spoon full of frozen brownie into my mouth, ceasing their interrogation and turning the conversation onto something else. After that, I spent half the night mulling over the conversation in my head, planning out what I should have said, and then rolling around in bed in regret of not being able to say them. \"What I'm trying to say is that no matter how much your decision makes us sad, we don't hate you for it. I'm sure you have your reasons, and no matter what, we'll all still be friends. So you better visit us soon, whenever you can.\" I snapped out of my reverie and watched as the light turn green. I let the force of the speed push me back into my seat, and before I could open my mouth, she spoke again. \"And don't forget to text us, too.\" \"And there's always Facebook,\" I piped in, and felt a wave of embarrassment soon after. Cathy smiled, \"Skype too.\" My cheeks lost their colour and I smiled too, albeit a little weakly, but a smile nonetheless. I suddenly felt childish for being scared of what she would have said, and relieved too now that it was over. My lips quirked a little higher as I realized how cool my roommates really were. I was going to miss Justine's loud screeches she made in an attempt to sound like a pterodactyl, and Becky's constant jokes and upbeat attitude. I was also going to miss Cathy's kindness, and her quirky way of laughing. I was going to miss how they all made me laugh, and just filled the silence I put myself in. \"I'm gonna miss you, too.\" I finally said after figuring out that her 'guilt-trip' speech was just her way of saying that she was going to miss me. \"Good,\" she laughed. I breathed in deeply at the sight of the airport rolling into view. I was excited and extremely nervous at the same time. Within that night, I was going to leave Canadian soil for the first time after transferring planes in Vancouver. I was leaving behind the mountains of British Columbia that I grew up in. I was also leaving behind the old Jaren. I breathed the air out of my lungs at that realization, and just let everything go.

[Author's Note: This story takes place immediately after the end of the movie Battle: Los Angeles.] \"I'll be borrowing this, sir,\" said Technical Sergeant Elena Santos, holding up the laptop computer as she left the tent to follow the others to the chopper. \"Uh, yeah, er, carry on,\" said the officer, former owner of said computer. Corporal Imlay was filling a satchel with toast and other food from the table in the tent. \"Hard gal to say no to, I think, sir,\" he said to the officer. \"Guess so,\" said the officer, as he handed Imlay an insulated bottle of hot coffee. \"Probably the sort of one we need right now.\" Imlay rushed a salute and ran after Santos, catching her as she, Corporal Lockett, and Corpsman Adukwu joined Sergeant Nantz and Corporal Harris in the chopper. The chopper lifted off and joined a flight of four, heading back towards Los Angeles. Nantz was speaking on the chopper radio-phone. \"Yes, I understand, sir, yes, this squad can do that,\" he was saying. \"Sir, could you please inform 61st Air Base Wing that T/S Elena Santos is with us. As a ... uh, let me think ... call her an Air Force-Marine Liaison.\" \"Does that mean I get paid more?\" said Santos. \"Of course not,\" said Imlay, as he handed out food. \"But you get to hang with us handsome Marines.\" \"I'd prefer the money,\" said Santos, smiling her crooked smile. \"Where are we going, Staff Sergeant?\" said Lockett, as Nantz hung up the phone. \"Downtown,\" said Nantz, hanging up the phone. \"There's an alien ship there. Apparently, it was on the ground when we brought the command ship down. So it's intact, according to the air surveillance. Our orders are to check it out, see if there's anything that can be salvaged. Equipment or technology. Anything that might help us. We might have hurt them but there's a long way to go in this fight yet.\" The chopper peeled away from the others and headed towards the jungle of skyscrapers. Lockett was looking towards the Santa Monica shoreline. It was a hive of activity – activity that was not human. There was a line of the alien equivalent of landing ships on the beach. \"I guess that it would be the same with us,\" he said. \"If we were attacking somewhere, and we lost our headquarters, we would keep going. Even if they have lost their generals, they still have majors and lieutenants and NCOs, I guess.\" \"Like those ones with the legs like spiders,\" said Adukwu. \"Platoon commanders, maybe.\" \"Let's hope they don't get their air power back,\" said Harris. \"You think they can still track radio messages, Staff Sergeant?\" \"Guess we'll find out,\" said Nantz. The pilot, designation Moped, spoke through the speaker in the cabin. \"Target in sight, two kilometres,\" he said. \"But we're seeing a lot of ground activity in the area.\" Imlay pointed. On the ground, not far away, there was a squad of aliens, on foot. One of the LongLegs was with them. \"Looks like they're going to the same place we are,\" he said. Nantz nodded. The aliens had seen them now, and had stopped. Two of them seemed to be assembling something. It took Nantz a few moments to realise what it was. \"Moped, there's an alien surface-to-air weapon down there! Get us out of here!\" he shouted. Moped threw the chopper sideways as the first rocket leaped out of the tube. It had a fiery head, like a large flare, and left a trail of smoke. It streaked by, less than five metres away. But the aliens were already setting up to fire another – and this time the ordinance looked different, like a bundle of fireworks. \"Don't like the look of that,\" said Harris. He hefted his gun and fired, knowing that the range was too great for any sort of accuracy but hoping that a few bursts might at least put the aliens off their aim. The helicopter was still banking sideways when the second rocket launched. It soared upwards, and then exploded into smaller pieces ten metres away. \"Goddamn cluster bomb!\" said Lockett. \"Damn, these guys have got some tricks!\" The range had been too great for the missile to be entirely effective but one fragment smashed into the chopper, near the tail. Immediately, the whole craft began to vibrate. They began to lose height. \"We're going down!\" shouted Moped. \"I'll try and get us to a level spot.\" Nantz saw the downed alien ship flash by, beneath them. It was not one of the clone ships: with a dozen antennae, it looked more like some sort of communications ship. There was no sign of life. The area was littered with debris: fallen girders, smashed vehicles, chunks of concrete. Not more than five square metres of open space anywhere ... no, there was a spot a few hundred metres away, on a street. Moped headed for it. But the chopper was losing height fast. \"Hold on to something!\" he shouted over the speaker. \"This is going to be tight! If you're religious, call in whatever favours you have! If you're not, now would be a good time to start!\" Nantz saw several of his team cross themselves and whisper prayers. He whispered one himself. The chopper came down with a massive thump, and then skidded across the open space and into a wrecked car. The whirling rotor whacked into a concrete power pole, and the chopper lurched violently, spinning on the ground back in the other direction. They came to an unsteady standstill. There was a creaking noise, and then one of the skids broke. The chopper crashed the final half-metre to the asphalt. The squad members stared at each other. \"That went well, I thought,\" said Lockett. They clambered out, and Moped joined them, carrying an automatic rifle and a helmet. \"Not exactly my best landing, but one you can walk away from, right?\" he said. \"Under the circumstances, not too bad at all,\" said Nantz. He looked at the pilot's badge of rank. \"Uh, you're an officer, aren't you?\" \"Yeah,\" said Moped. \"But let's forget about it. Not like I know anything about fighting aliens on the ground. Looks like I'm on your team now, and that means I'm willing to follow your orders, Staff Sergeant.\" \"Huh,\" said Santos, who looked as if she had been planning to knock him unconscious if he had tried to take command. \"We've still got a job to do,\" said Nantz. \"That alien ship can't be far. We get to it and figure out a way back from there. But that alien squad looked like they were going for it too. They're probably about the same distance, but on the other side. Whoever gets there first will be able to set up a defensive position.\" \"Then we should start right now,\" said Adukwu. They set off at a run, watching for alien activity in the surrounding buildings. It was hard going, in the open, in the rising heat, with their equipment, running past bodies. But eventually the alien ship came into view. A hundred metres from it, they stopped next to the remains of a stone wall. Nantz glanced at Moped, who was panting, sweat dripping off him. \"We're almost there,\" he said, handing the pilot his canteen. Moped took a swig. \"I fight better when I'm sitting down,\" he said. \"Probably not going to happen today,\" said Santos. Imlay was studying the craft with the binoculars. \"No movement, no sign of life, Staff Sergeant,\" he said. \"Of course, these guys are pretty good with the traps, and that thing on the top of the ship looks like some sort of cannon or something, like a tank turret.\" \"Okay,\" said Nantz. He knew that crossing the last part would be the most dangerous. \"That looks like a door in the side, open, so we go for that.\" They sprinted for the craft, half-expecting a blast of alien fire. Nothing. They reached the door and went through, and once inside almost collapsed with relief and fatigue. \"Watch out!\" shouted Adukwu. \"There's one still here!\" He hefted his gun. But the alien was dead. Maybe it was the pilot; he was in something that looked like a control chair. He wasn't going anywhere: half his head was gone, and it looked as if his arms had been surgically attached to the ship console. \"Like the guns the soldiers have,\" said Santos. \"I guess these guys do nothing but fight.\" \"Santos, can you see anything that we might grab, give us some idea of how to fight them?\" said Nantz. \"This ship must have some sort of computer technology.\" Santos was already inspecting the equipment. Much of the ship was wrecked. It looked as if the information that it had been on the ground when the C&C; went down was wrong. It was obvious, when you saw it close up, that this ship had come down pretty hard. But there were still some lights blinking on the console, and screens with strange symbols scrolling across them. The command console looked like it would be impossible to take apart – not quickly, anyway. But Santos found something that looked like a plug on the console. \"I don't think we can prise any hardware off,\" she said. \"But maybe I can use this to download whatever information there is in the system.\" She pulled the 'borrowed' laptop from her pack, as well as some tools and wires. She began to prise the plug open, and then checked to see if any of the jacks she carried were compatible. \"Aha!\" she said at last. \"This should do it. Or maybe fry the whole unit, and then I'll have to buy the colonel a new one.\" \"Movement down the street!\" said Harris, who was at a window of the ship. \"I think it's our old friends.\" The alien squad was coming on slowly, carefully. Nantz noted it. Yesterday, they had been confident, even arrogant, as if they thought they had already won. But today, after the loss of their C-and-C ... well, today was a different day. \"Take positions and wait for my signal,\" he said. \"Low and quiet and maybe we can sucker them in. Santos, you keep working on ... whatever it is you're doing.\" \"Data transfer,\" she said, watching the laptop screen as images flashed by. There were pictures, lines of figures, diagrams, and maps – even a map of the Los Angeles area. \"There's a lot of it. But I think it would be useful stuff.\" The aliens had stopped – just inside maximum range. They began to assemble their rocket weapon. \"What the hell are they doing'?\" said Lockett. \"They don't want to protect and keep this ship, they want to destroy it!\" said Nantz. \"Fire!\" They opened up, but the range was long. Three of the aliens went down but the others escaped, falling back to a ruined building, with their missile launcher. \"That's probably the max range of their guns too,\" said Nantz. \"But we don't enough about them to be making bets. Santos, how long?\" \"Another five minutes until the laptop is full,\" she said. \"Damned if I know if our tech guys will be able to make any sense of it, this stuff isn't exactly Spanish. But something to start with, right?\" \"And if the ETs are so determined to destroy this ship, it must mean that it's got important Intel,\" said Lockett. Imlay was looking at the building, to the north of their position, where the alien squad had taken cover. \"If we were them, we'd be calling for back-up,\" he said. \"And out here they've got more boots on the ground than us.\" \"I see more movement in the west,\" said Lockett. \"I ... I think it's a couple of those hovercraft-tanks. And another troop of soldiers as well.\" \"Those things have got a longer range than anything we have,\" said Adukwu. \"Maybe not,\" said Moped. He started to climb into the gun-turret of the alien ship. He looked at the controls. \"Whoa,\" he said. \"This is a lot different to the inside of a Blackhawk.\" He was looking for a button or lever that was different to the others. He found one, a lever, and pulled it. A bolt of energy shot out of the cannon and smashed into the ground twenty metres away. \"Okay, I'm guessing that one is the trigger,\" said Harris. \"Yeah, guess so,\" said Moped, as he continued to try other controls. \"Now, if I can just get it around –\" The two hovercraft-tanks had rounded the corner and were coming towards them. One of them fired, and the shell exploded on the ground next to the ship. \"Two minutes!\" said Santos. The turret swung around as Moped pushed whatever buttons he could find. The cannon fired wildly. Not knowing how to aim the weapon, Moped was just pointing it in the general direction and shooting. Not pretty, but effective. A bolt caught one of the tanks head-on, and it exploded into fire. The other took a glancing shot on the turret. It immediately began to back up. The alien soldiers took the opportunity to make a run for another building, closer to the ship. Nantz and the others started firing, taking several more down, but the others reached cover. \"They'll be able to hit us with their launcher from there,\" said Nantz. \"Santos –?\" \"Done!\" say Santos. \"That's all she'll take.\" \"Then time for a tactical retreat,\" said Nantz. They made for the door and then they were running away from the ship, along the street, back the way they had come. Santos, at the end of the group, turned and looked back – and saw an alien rocket sailing upwards, and then onto the ship. It exploded into fragments. \"Nick of time,\" she muttered. And then a volley of alien fire came at them from a building ahead of them. There was a series of explosions. The squad took cover behind a pair of overturned trucks. \"Grenades,\" said Nantz. Then he realised that everyone was already loading them. He smiled. These guys are turning into a good crew , he thought. He glanced behind them. Then were more aliens coming up – and the tank as well. In a few moments, his squad would be caught between the two groups of them – which meant that the path ahead had to be cleared. He looked at the others and nodded. Together, Imlay, Lockett, Harris and Santos stood and fired grenades at the building, aiming for the windows. The grenades exploded together, making the whole structure shake. \"Outstanding,\" said Nantz. \"Get you a case of beer for that one.\" \"Hold you to that, Staff Sergeant,\" said Harris. \"And now, we run,\" said Nantz. So they ran, even as the aliens behind them began to fire. The tank fired, and there was an explosion a metre away from Santos, at the rear of the squad. She was blown off her feet, and there was a spurt of blood from her leg. Her helmet went flying, and the laptop she had been carrying went spinning across the road, stopping at Nantz' feet. He picked it up, and then looked back, gauging the distance between the oncoming aliens and the fallen Santos. \"Go!\" she said. \"That computer has got to get back!\" Nantz looked at her – and then nodded. The others, not knowing that Santos was down, were already running around a corner. He turned and ran after them. Santos managed to get to her feet. She hobbled towards the nearest cover – a shoe store. A stream of alien fire followed her in: they knew where she was. She hefted her gun and fired – not with much hope of hitting anything, just to give them something to think about. She pulled a strap from her pack and tied it around her injured leg to stop the bleeding. The blood abated but the pain didn't. She looked out the window. The aliens, flanking their tank, were coming for her. \"Damn,\" she muttered to herself. \"This is what I get for hanging out with Marines.\" She put a new clip into her gun. The squad found cover and stopped. \"Where's Air Force?\" said Lockett. \"She got clipped, went down,\" said Nantz. \"She'll try to make cover, make a stand.\" \"Against all of them?\" said Adukwu. \"Not much chance.\" Nantz was looking at the computer. \"We really should do everything possible to get this back to base,\" he said. \"As quickly as possible, without risk. We really should.\" \"Right, Staff Sergeant, we really should,\" said Imlay. He checked his supply of grenades. \"That was the mission,\" said Lockett, reloading. \"I could give you this thing and tell you to go,\" said Nantz. \"You could try, Staff Sergeant,\" said Harris. There was the sound of an engine. A heavy pick-up, painted bright pink, pulled up next to them, Moped at the wheel. \"Sorry, couldn't find a tank or anything less colourful,\" he said. The soldiers clambered aboard, Nantz in the passenger seat. \"Which way?\" said Moped to him. \"You know which way,\" said Nantz. Santos was doing her best to hold them off but she knew it was just a question of time. She was moving from one firing position to another, hoping to confuse the aliens, hold them up, and give the others a chance to get away. But she was running low on ammunition. Only enough in the last clip for one more burst. She saw the LongLegs, standing at the back of the alien platoon. Too far for an effective shot. The hovercraft-tank raked the store with a series of shells. Santos lifted the rifle to fire – and then stopped. Let them think that took me out , she thought. The alien soldiers began to advance – and then the LongLegs was in range. She aimed carefully, inhaled ... and fired. The LongLegs went down. The others scattered. Her rifle clicked on empty. And no more grenades. She drew her pistol. It didn't seem like much. She watched the alien soldiers re-group, although without the LongLegs they seemed confused. But eventually they began to advance again. She fired, hitting them, but they just would not go down – at range, the pistol simply did not have enough punch. Save the last bullet, Elena , she told herself. And then a fusillade of machine-gun fire cut into the alien troop. She looked along the street. A pink pick-up was roaring along at full speed, everyone aboard firing. The tank began to turn towards it. Elena watched as the soldiers leaped off the vehicle, Moped the last one out, rolling out of the cab onto the asphalt. The pick-up streaked along, taking fire but not stopping. It smashed into the alien tank. The two vehicles exploded in a ball of flame, taking out a half-dozen alien soldiers as well. The squad were up and firing now, close enough to aim for the aliens' weak spot. Several more aliens went down. The others began a hasty retreat. \"Do we pursue, Staff Sergeant?\" said Lockett. \"Another day,\" said Nantz, as Santos hobbled up to them. Adukwu took out his med kit and began to apply a field dressing to her wound. \"I was just telling myself that you guys would have to be crazy to come back for me,\" said Santos. \"Pretty right, there,\" said Imlay. \"Guess we've got used to you, Air Force,\" said Lockett. \"But you'd do the same for any of us, right?\" \"Of course not,\" said Santos, although she was smiling. \"Except maybe Imlay.\" \"Yes!\" said Imlay, punching the air. \"Huh,\" said Nantz, almost smiling. \"Moped, Lockett, Harris, see if you can find us a working vehicle. Imlay, you're on watch.\" He turned to Santos. He pulled the laptop from his pack and handed it to her. \"This is yours, I think,\" he said. She took it, staring at him. \"Thank you, Staff Sergeant,\" she said. It was the next day when Nantz sought out Santos in the medical tent at Mojave Base. She was lying on a cot with her leg up. The first thing she said to him was: \"Hey, can you tell these guys to let me out of here.\" Nantz grunted. \"They say one more day,\" he said. \"I thought I should tell you that the techs are having wet dreams over the information you put on that laptop. They're still working on the translation but they say they're making headway, and they think that there is a lot of tactical and strategic stuff there. We've already distributed copies to all the other forces fighting around the world. They're calling it the Santos Stash.\" \"Huh,\" said Santos. \"How about that, eh?\" \"The colonel – the one whose laptop you borrowed – wants to put you up for a commendation. I told him not to bother.\" Santos stared at him. \"Oh,\" she said. \"It's a joke,\" he said. \"He's already contacted your CO about it.\" She started. \"You ... made a joke, Staff Sergeant?\" she said. \"Yeah, well, don't tell the other guys,\" he said. \"Which reminds me, they sent you something.\" He took something out of a paper bag. It was a helmet. \"Since your Air Force one went missing,\" he said. She looked at it. On one side was written: HONORARY MARINE. On the other side was: ONE TOUGH MOTHER. \"As close as Marines get to being charming,\" said Nantz. \"Well, I guess this means that I'm on your team until this thing is over, Staff Sergeant,\" said Santos. \"Looks like it,\" said Nantz.

Wir brauche Luft Unterstützung Jetzt!\" The German transmission from the ground meant nothing to me, I didn't speak the language. My squadron leader however, understood it perfectly. \"Captain Griffon! Take Paladin and Victory flights and engage the enemy aircraft, well take out the ground forces and then assist you.\" I acknowledged his order and spoke into my headset to talk to the other pilots under my command. \"Victory lead, this is paladin lead, engage using AMRAM's then switch to sidewinders. Use your cannon if you have to, these things fight up close, no one lose their wing man!\" The Lieutenant acknowledged and took his Eurofighter flight to attack the enemies orbiting the German tanks from a distance. I then took my flight up above the enemy's position where we would attack the drones from a higher up position. During the fighting in England, we realized that the soft spot of the drone's armor was on the top of the craft. Sending a diversion group while the rest attacked seemed to confuse and disorient the AI piloting the ship, making the enemy aircraft actually pause. They could not issue commands to the drone itself and it sat there. It was a turkey shoot. \"Paladin lead, this is Vic lead, were engaging the enemies and have drawn their fire away from the tanks. The drones have broken out of their 'colony' and have been attacking us. Hurry up, we can't hold them for long!\" As the transmission ended, I could see one of the fighters from Victory flight disappear from my HUD, signaling that he had been shot down. I ordered my men to hit their afterburners until we were at the desired altitude. We then pitched our noses down and sped down towards the earth below. \"Paladin flight, align up your targets, two missiles each.\" The three other Typhoons locked onto a separate target, each until all sixteen of the enemy aircraft were targeted. I then gave the order to open fire. \"Paladin-Lead, Fox-three!\" I yelled, launching my long range missiles at the targets while moving at well over 700 kph. The other pilots followed suite, launching their missiles. \"Paladin-two, Fox-three!\" \"Paladin-four, Fox-three!\" \"Paladin-three, Fox-three!\" We waited half a second for the missiles to contact with the drones, all but five of them exploding into great balls of fire and smashing back into the ground where the Germans were finally turning the tide of battle. \"Royal-Lead to all elements, engage all enemy aircraft.\" My squadron leader commanded as the fighter-bomber flights joined our formation and launched their missiles at the remaining aircraft, downing two more. My flight pulled up and came underneath the last three where we opened up with our 27mm Mauser cannons, tearing apart the enemy's fuselage and killing the AI systems inside, destroying the final aircraft that still posed a threat. \"Walsh and Royal flights, return to England. Vic and Paladin flights, continue to engage the enemy ground units until bingo fuel. We'll see you home soon lads.\" The two flights turned and headed back to England where we were stationed. The rest of us however began a strafing formation on the exposed enemy armor. \"Engage the mechs with your Mavericks, then come around and strafe their lines with your cannons. You should have no AGM munitions when we return.\" I said into the mic as the rest of the squadron formed up in a strafing formation with three planes leading on point and two on each side of the nose flight. Each pilot locked one of the quadruped mechs and fired their missiles. Knocking the Ravager's, I think that's what the Yanks called them, ground armor out of commission. On the fly-by however, we began receiving heavy anti-air fire. One of the flak guns hit my wing man to my left, killing him and it sent his plane spiraling towards mine. I yanked my joystick up but his nose nicked my left engine and set my plane on fire. I pulled up and tried to recover as more anti air fire raked my plane and warning and 'eject signs popped up along my HUD. \"Bloody hell, this is Paladin-Lead, I am ejecting!\" I radioed in before pulling the eject lever. As my body was launched out of my burning plane, the tremendous force of gravity I experienced was like nothing I had felt before. I could literally feel my spine being pushed down and condensed. The pain was so great I blacked out. When I woke up I was covered by my parachute and on my side. Nothing had been broken but I had an intense headache. I started to unstrap myself from the chair and crawled out from under the parachute. Upon standing up, and looking around, I was greeted by several machinegun rounds. One of which struck my left shoulder. I was knocked down from the force, and I started cringing in pain, the incendiary round burning through my flesh. I yelled out loud and crawled behind the heavy fighter seat. I inspected my wound while still receiving fire from the aliens. There was a ten millimeter hole underneath my collar bone. The blood inside was boiling from the intense heat. I reached around and grabbed the first aid kit from the chair and injected myself with a shot of morphine. As another volley of fire came from the Ravager infantry, I huddled down into myself, exposing as little of myself as possible. I pulled out my sidearm and blind fired several rounds over the ejected seat. I ejected my empty clip and loaded a new one. I leaned out of cover and saw about twenty of the giant slugs running at my position. I opened fire and dropped one. I was out of ammo and there was nothing I could do. I turned back around and waited for them to come up and execute me. But, before they reached me, two Eurofighters soared overhead and fired their cannon at the enemy infantry, tearing them apart and igniting their breathing apparatus. German tanks and infantry then rolled up and began firing at the enemy. A German medic came up to me and started speaking to me in German. \"Bist du Gesund? Was brauchst du?\" I pointed to my shoulder and he began dressing my wounds. As I looked at my squadron returning to base, and the German forces pushing the enemy back into the landing zone of their CAC. I realized, there might actually be a chance for us win this war.

Wir brauche Luft Unterstützung Jetzt!\" The German tra"},{"Movie":"Battle: Los Angeles","Title":"Mission: Santa Monica","Author":"Darkpenn","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10833658","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Battle: Los Angeles Mission: Santa Monica The way back is a hard road. [Author's Note: This story takes place two days after the story Mission: South Central.] \"So,\" said Harris. \"The counter-attack of the forces of Earth against the alien invaders is just the six of us, is it?\" \"I'm not seeing any problem with it,\" said Santos. Nantz gave a grunt. He didn't mind his men – and Santos – having a joke; not so long as they were doing their jobs, covering possible points of fire ahead as the Bushmaster slowly made its way westwards. Lockett, in the driver's seat, brought the vehicle to a halt. \"According to the map, this road is the shortest route to Santa Monica Community College,\" he said. \"But ... \" Nantz grunted again. The road ahead was narrow, with three-story buildings on either side. Ambush territory. And this area had been in alien hands since the invasion, five days ago now. True, in the past thirty-six hours they had pulled back a bit, consolidating around their beachhead. Still ... \"Yeah,\" said Imlay, looking at the area with binoculars. \"But.\" Without another word, Lockett turned the Bushmaster back and began to look for another route. Funny, I don't even have to give orders to them anymore , thought Nantz. Many of the roads in the area were blocked by debris or abandoned vehicles but eventually Lockett found a way that looked fairly safe. \"Why are we going to this place, this Community College?\" said Adukwu. \"Highest ground in the area,\" said Nantz. \"And our mission is advance spotting for the counter-attack. There wasn't any fighting at the college, and Command believes that there will be operating landlines there, as well as an emergency generator. We can connect the field telephone that we've got to the existing landline.\" \"Sounds easy, when you say it like that, Staff Sergeant,\" said Harris. \"Why can't they use aerial surveillance?\" said Lockett. Nantz pointed to the haze that shimmered above the alien beachhead. \"That stuff,\" he said. \"The tech people don't know if it's a defence measure by the aliens or just something that they do, but one way or another you can't see much from above. So that means ground surveillance.\" \"They know that that's like, really close ... I mean, really close ... to the ETs, right, Staff Sergeant?\" said Harris. \"I mentioned it,\" said Nantz. \"Well, how hard can it be?\" said Santos. They were in the grounds of the college now, moving slow. Nantz pointed to a building on a rise; there was a radio mast rising from the top of it. \"What's with that?\" said Adukwu, pointing at the mast. \"A lot of colleges run radio stations,\" said Nantz. \"That's often why they had emergency generators, so they could keep broadcasting if there was a disaster, an earthquake or something.\" They hid the Bushmaster in a nearby grove of trees and went into the building. No sign of life. \"Harris, Imlay, go the basement and see if you can find the generator, get it started,\" said Nantz. \"Santos, locate a landline, patch our field phone in. Lockett, Adukwu, we go to the roof, set up an observation point. We all meet there in twenty.\" Everyone set about their assigned task, and met on the flat roof of the building. The generator had been activated and the phone line set up. The six of them looked at the expanse of enemy troops on the beachhead, with dozens of SAM sites, artillery batteries, and tanks. \"Whoa,\" said Imlay. \"These guys are ready for a fight.\" Lockett looked back, at the near-ruined city. One of the few large buildings still standing was 155 West Washington Avenue, South Central. \"When the counter-attack starts, General Mama's people are going to want to be a part of it,\" he said. \"That's good, it looks like we're going to need every gun we can get.\" Santos pulled a long-range digital camera from her pack, and a laptop computer. She began to take photos and video of the alien emplacements, and, with the computer, connected to the landline and sent them to Mojave Command. Nantaz was looking at the mother ship, in the ocean near Catalina Island. It was the size of an aircraft carrier, with batteries of SAMs and interceptor missiles on the upper deck. \"That's the first target,\" he said. \"We have to call in the co-ordinates and provide damage reports. Once that's down, the Air Force will hit the aliens on the beach. Then the ground troops will come in.\" \"None of that is going to be easy,\" said Harris. \"These guys are dug in and have got good organization, even without their C&C; ship.\" \"Yeah, but once their officers are down, they don't do so well,\" said Santos. \"When we were in Downtown, after I hit the Longlegs, the others didn't seem to know what to do. They kept coming, but there was no real strategy or tactical sense to them.\" \"Hmm,\" said Nantz. \"So if we could take down their Longlegs, the attack would have a much better shot.\" \"Yeah,\" said Imlay. \"But ... how would we do that?\" Nantz scratched his stubble. \"The prisoners we got took back from South Central said that the Longlegs are connected by a cranial implant, a built-in radio. So at this range, maybe we can overload it. By putting out a big signal on the same frequency.\" \"Except we don't know the frequency they use,\" said Adukwu. \"Sure we do,\" said Santos, taking a pad from her pocket. \"The techs at Mojave gave it to me so we could set up the South Central transponder right. I've got it here.\" \"But we don't know how to set up the radio for something like that,\" said Lockett. \"None of us have got those skills.\" \"Uh, that's not exactly right,\" said Nantz. \"I have. Back in the day, before I joined the Marines, I went to a college like this one, and I had a part-time job working at the radio station.\" \"What, as a technician?\" said Imlay. \"No,\" said Nantz. \"As a DJ. Had my own program and everything. Mike in the Morning.\" They all stared at him. \"You ... have a first name, Staff Sergeant?\" said Harris. \"And it's ... Mike?\" said Lockett. \"There was a time when you were not a Marine, Staff Sergeant?\" said Adukwu. \" 'Mike in the Morning'?\" said Santos. \"Goddamn,\" said Imlay. \"Well,\" said Nantz. \"There it is. The bottom line is that I can probably rig the equipment to send out a blast that will overload their implants.\" \"Blow their minds,\" said Lockett. \"Literally,\" said Harris. \"I don't get it,\" said Adukwu. \"Hey,\" said Imlay, pointing to the ocean horizon. \"Something is happening out there.\" Nantz checked his watch. \"Right on time,\" he said. There were two US Navy ships heading towards the alien mother ship. \"That's the Arleigh Burke and the Philippine Sea ,\" said Nantz. \"Firing Tomahawks.\" He picked up the phone – and then handed the handset to Santos. \"Santos, you've got the better skills here. You've got the duty.\" \"Huh,\" said Santos, taking the handset. \"And maybe you should try and find the radio studio, Staff Sergeant, and get back to the DJ thing.\" Nantz nodded, and went to search the building, with Harris. Santos began to feed the details of the sea battle to Mojave Command, along with video. The two ships fired a brace of missiles at the mother ships, and then another set. A wall of alien interceptor missiles was sent up by the mother ship, hitting the Tomahawks. The Navy ships fired another volley, and the alien missiles took them down again. \"So far, the Navy's drawing a blank,\" said Imlay. \"Maybe two ships aren't enough to punch through. They need more.\" \"Just because you can't see others, that doesn't mean they're not there,\" said Lockett. Suddenly, there was an explosion on the side of the mother ship, and a massive eruption of water. A few seconds later, another. \"Torpedoes!\" said Imlay. \"The Tomahawks were just a diversion!\" \"Direct hits!\" shouted Santos into the phone. \"Tell them to keep it up!\" Nantz, in the broadcast room, was hitting switches and buttons. He found the frequency dial, and turned it until he found what he was looking for. The power began to increase. \"Harris, over there is an over-ride switch, a big lever,\" he said. \"When I tell you, pull it.\" He switched on the microphone. \"This is Echo Company, Second Battalion, Fifth Marines!\" he said. \"Hoo-rah!\" He pushed all the switches to full power, and gestured to Harris, who pulled the lever. All the dials showed red. A series of bulbs blew as the power built into a burst of static. \"Retreat, hell,\" said Harris softly. \"Look!\" said Adukwu, pointing at the nearest alien SAM site. The Longlegs had fallen to the ground, in convulsions. Santos turned the binoculars towards other alien emplacements. The story was the same. She turned her view back to the battle at sea. The Arleigh Burke and the Philippine Sea fired another brace of cruise missiles – and this time there were no intercepting missiles. The Tomahawks smashed into the mother ship. At the same time, another torpedo hit. Plumes of smoke began to come from the alien vessel, and it tilted, one edge dipping into the water. \"Their defences are down!\" said Santos into the phone. \"Hit 'em with everything!\" Nantz and Harris threw themselves down with the others. Imlay pointed to the alien batteries, where a number of Longlegs were out of the fight – probably for good. \"Blow their minds!\" said Adukwu. \"I just got it!\" \"Staff Sergeant, we have alien soldiers coming up on both the right and the left,\" said Imlay, surveying the area around the radio station. \"I think our secret is out. Damn, there's a lot of them. \" Nantz looked at the mother ship, now clearly burning. He took the handset from Santos. \"Mojave Command, the alien ground defences are compromised, their local command is depleted,\" he said. \"Our position is about to be over-run.\" \"Then get out of there!\" said Colonel Ritchie. \"You've done everything you can!\" Nantz led them back to the Bushmaster. Alien rockets were already beginning to fall around them. They piled in and sped along the road eastwards, Lockett driving. And then an alien tank appeared in front of them, flanked by dozens of soldiers. The tank fired. \"Everybody brace!\" shouted Nantz, from the passenger seat. The shell hit them. Nantz had a sense of the Bushmaster careening sideways, and then rolling – He awoke with a start, to the sound of firing. Adukwu was leaning over him, wrapping a bandage around his head. \"Take it easy, Staff Sergeant, you're bleeding and you've got a concussion – \" said the corpsman. \"Concussion or not, we could really use you on that window over there, Staff Sergeant,\" said Imlay. \"And you covering that doorway, Adukwu.\" Nantz looked around. They were in a building, really just a single room, not large but with solid walls, looked like it had been some sort of food kiosk in a little park. Lockett and Santos were firing in one direction, Imlay in another. Harris, with the chain gun from the Bushmaster now mounted on a window sill, had another direction covered. There was a vicious black globe in his head but he pushed the pain away. He managed to get to the window and hefted his gun. He was seeing double but he fired a burst at a group of aliens. They withdrew, sheltering behind a wall. He looked around. There were dozens of alien bodies, as well as four burning tanks. The Marine guns fell silent. \"Looks like they're pulling back to re-group again,\" said Imlay. \"Everyone, re-load, do a shell count, check your firing positions.\" Nantz saw that Imlay had a shoulder wound and Harris had a tourniquet around his thigh. Santos had a bleeding gash on her cheek. Adukwu, himself with a bandage around his hand, was treating an arm injury on Lockett. \"How long was I out?\" said Nantz. \"Maybe ten minutes since that tank hit the Bushmaster,\" said Santos. \"We managed to get all those ones, and the tank, but then these guys showed up. Dozens of 'em. We made it in here.\" \"Current situation is: surrounded, running low on ammo, everyone hurt somehow or other,\" said Imlay. \"Good to have you back, Staff Sergeant, you had us worried there. Sorry the news isn't better.\" \"Sounds like you've made the best of a bad situation,\" said Nantz. \"What time does the counter-attack start?\" said Adukwu. Nantz checked his watch. \"Not for a while yet,\" he said. \"We're on our own.\" \"Us, and a couple of hundred ETs,\" said Harris. Lockett was looking out the window. \"More like a couple of thousand,\" he said. \"Coming from all directions.\" Nantz looked where Lockett was pointing. \"Damn, it must be the whole alien army,\" he said. \"I guess they're a bit pissed at us,\" said Harris. \"Which is understandable.\" \"Lock and load,\" said Nantz. It became a nightmare of firing and re-loading, taking down the aliens as they came forward. Without the Longlegs, the alien soldiers had only one tactic: advance. It made them easy targets. But there were many of them. Very many. The chain gun gave out. The pile of empty clips in the centre of the room began to grow. Finally, the alien line wavered – and fell back. But there were more of them coming. There was the sound of tanks approaching. \"I'm out,\" said Santos, fitting a bayonet to her rifle. \"Me too,\" said Lockett. \"Half a clip,\" said Adukwu. \"Same,\" said Harris. \"And no more grenades.\" Imlay was checking the clip of his pistol. Nantz realised that his rifle was empty. He drew his .45. \"Their next push, we won't be able to hold them,\" he said. He looked around at the squad: battered and exhausted, but ready to fight to the end. \"It has been an honor,\" he said. \"The honor, Staff Sergeant,\" said Lockett, \"has been ours.\" Nantz put his hand into the middle of the group. The others put their hands on his. \"Hoo-rah!\" said Imlay. \"And here they come,\" said Harris. They took up their positions again. The aliens were storming towards the little building now, ready to take vengeance. The two tanks moved into position, aiming. And then, out of nowhere, two RPGs slammed into the tanks. A fusillade of heavy-calibre bullets slammed into the alien soldiers. A Blackhawk chopper swung low, hovering in front of the building. Its Gatlings fired, tearing through the alien ranks. On the 50-cal in the doorway, a gunner traversed and fired. He looked back at them. \"Yo!\" he shouted. \"We heard there were some punk Marines needed their asses saved!\" \"Drive-by!\" said Imlay. \"Damn, that guy really is an asshole.\" The Blackhawk swivelled, turning its guns on another troop of aliens. The Marines saw that it was Moped in the pilot's seat. The chopper touched down, and a half-dozen of General Mama's soldiers jumped out and made for the building. Shooter was in the lead. She was carrying a large satchel: in it were extra clips and grenades. \"Present from the General,\" she said. \"Hey, do you know why the aliens with the spider legs suddenly fell over?\" \"Mike in the Morning,\" said Santos. Shooter looked quizzical, but shrugged. The Marines re-loaded. The alien attack had broken but there were pockets of them still fighting. The Blackhawk was circling, attacking, firing at whatever targets available. The Marines and the South Central soldiers began the mopping-up, driving the aliens back towards the beach, where the Air Force was hammering the defences. Only a few of the SAM sites were operating, and their firing was wild; without co-ordination, most were merely silent. A flight of F-15s screeched overhead, zooming towards the alien beachhead. They were followed by a wave of A-10s. From the beach, there was the sound of Tomahawk missiles from the Navy ships exploding. Moped landed, got out, and ran over to the group. \"I'm heading towards the fight,\" he said. \"You guys want a lift?\" The South Central soldiers began to pile into the chopper. Nantz looked at his squad, and at Adukwu applying fresh field dressings to wounds and injuries. He shook his head. \"We'll get patched up first,\" he said. \"And then ... we'll see.\" Colonel Ritchie climbed the stairs that led to the roof of the radio station of Santa Monica Community College. Nantz, Imlay, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and Santos were there, sitting in deck chairs that someone had located, watching the operations on the beach, and the lines of captive aliens. They were drinking beers: Lockett had found them in a refrigerator in the college cafeteria: they were even cold, with the emergency power running. Ritchie looked at them with a slight frown. \"Yeah, I know, drinking while on duty, and in a combat zone, is a serious infraction of Marine regulations,\" said Nantz to the colonel. \"We saved you one, sir,\" said Santos, handing him a chilled bottle. \"Well, I guess I can overlook it, just this once,\" said the Colonel, as he popped the cap. He surveyed the area. \"Looks like we've won,\" he said. \"Here, at least. You know, the intelligence boys want to de-brief you, see if this radio thing can be turned into a weapon of some sort. And the politicians and the generals want to meet you, give you some medals, take some photos, that sort of thing.\" \"Yes to the first, no to the second,\" said Nantz. \"But if they want to give us some sort of financial bonus, we wouldn't stop them,\" said Santos. Ritchie laughed. \"I'll see what I can do,\" he said. Nantz allowed himself a smile. He looked out at the city. The war, he knew, was far from finished. But the Battle of Los Angeles was over. And it had been won. END ","Summary":" Battle: Los Angeles Mission: Santa Monica The way back is a hard road.

If you have not watched the movie and would like to, DON'T READ THIS because it contains possible spoilers. HEY GUYS. This is pretty small, and I was just writing things out about it after I finished watching the movie. It's great, srsly. Really sad, though, of course - I hope you guys like this story. It was one of those times when you wished everything was over. When you wished you were sitting at home with your wife, comfortably settled on the living room couch, cooing over a soon-to-be-born baby to each other in content, instead of being thrown across bloody pavement as a bomb blasted 15 yards from where you stood, sending you back about another 29. That wasn't going to happen now, and everyone had to tell themselves that; learn the cold, hard reality that they were in a war. At least, not anytime soon. All you could do was pray and hide. Pray that you would live through this. Or, pray that soon you'd be found by one of the invaders and let them simply shoot you through the heart to end all the misery and despair. You had to watch your loved ones be killed by an explosion, burned alive; or watch them be dragged away and shot by one of the many creatures that started this whole mess in the first place. At the start, everyone was calm. The news had reported about oncoming meteors that were destined to strike far from the border of many oceans around the country. They claimed that the U.S marines were recruiting, and were simply going to be moving all humans living near the striking zones many safe miles away. But, at the time, everyone learned the horrifying truth. Saw it with their own eyes, as they stood at the beaches near the falling meteors. They were not just simple meteors. Not by a long shot. The U.S Marines Corps had been told, forewarned, about this approx. 30 minutes before the 'meteors' smashed into the oceans. Warned that these weren't just regular rocks from space. Pictures from satellites showed that the had a strange heat source to them. Not just on the outside, like normal - no, on the insides. Shapes were on the insides. But now, even if they were warned, it made no difference. The air smelled of heavy gun fire, as if fireworks had just been let loose all over the place, and the sharp copper scent of blood. Dead bodies lay scattered in all sorts of places; on the streets, between houses, in their cars. Bodies were burnt, bloodied and full of holes were rather large bullets, about the size of ones fist, were shot through their torsos and nearly blown-off limbs. Despite this, it was still humid, the air so thick you couldn't have cut through it was a butcher knife. Marines were now sent out in groups of varying numbers, from 17 to simply 8 members. Their mission for now was to find any surviving occupants in the area. Bring them to safety. All this had to be done in 1 hour. When that time was nearing it's end, they were told to quickly get out of the area and move to the F.O.B Police Station about a 2.1 miles up the main street. Bombs were planned to be dropped, killing whatever... mutants were left. But it wasn't easy, especially whenever you are disoriented by so many numbers of explosions that have happened in the past 7 minutes, how many dead, blown apart bodies you've seen as you wander around the streets, watching in horror as your comrade is shot through the eye, his insides being splattered on the wall behind the both of you, as he sinks to the ground; having been alive 4 seconds ago, and now, 2 seconds later, dead. The sky wasn't blue anymore. Instead, it was replaced with a dark red, bright oranges and black smoke filling the skies overhead. Helicopters could see everything, all the destruction, all the strange machines on rooftops, moving by themselves and holding out blurred arms - even from this height, it was apparent the blurred objects were guns, attached to their robotic arms; bright gunfire would explode from the end, and small ant-like bodies on the streets below would drop. Rapid gun shots could be heard, from M16's and M40A3 sniper rifles. And through all the distress and screaming, you can't help but think to yourself that not even 24 hours ago you were hugging your wife, your husband - telling them you loved them. Telling them you'd be home and safe. But now, you know that you're chances of surviving were little to none. Many would write letters to their loved ones, small, chicken-scratched notes written in the midst of combat. The only clear letters that could be made out would be 'I love you'. *The film, Battle: L.A , is set in modern day Los Angeles and follows a platoon of U.S. Marines during a global alien invasion, and are joined by an Airwoman and some Army infantry. The events of the film are inspired by the Battle of Los Angeles, a supposed World War II air raid of the city which turned out to be a false alarm caused by several unidentified objects.* Hope you all liked it.

It will involve the support of theEuropean countries and eventually Asia. Enjoy. Seven months after the initial invasion, the United States purged what was left of the Ravagers out of her borders. The alien species was either completely annihilated, or were picked up by some new transport ships which looked like large cylinders with four doors on each side. These 'drop pods,' as some soldiers called them, were only large enough to carry infantry and could not support the weight of their mechanized forces. Some military scientists in the Air Force were able to reverse engineer the downed drones that weren't too damaged after the destruction of their CAC. We were able to equip our V22 Osprey's with the advanced thrust vectoring engines of the drones. The transports were now much faster than any helicopter and could take off and land vertically much quicker and safer, making it an excellent transport for an intervention force in Europe. Canada and Mexico had also been able to purge their nations of the alien threat, they didn't seem to be hit as heavily and the climates in both countries proved too much to handle for the aliens. The U.S. formed a coalition force with them to relieve units that were fighting in France and Germany. All the countries west of Russia and east of Germany had been hit very hard and their military and populace was almost completely wiped out. Norway, Sweden, and Finland, had set up a perimeter of defense around their borders and were also able to purge the Ravagers out of their countries. They were now teaming up with Russia to push against the invaders and retake the Slavic countries. Our Invasion force was sent to England. We were going to use the island country as a staging platform for air assaults and naval attacks into France and Germany. The strategy was similar to that of World War Two, only the weapons changed and we were fighting to preserve humanity. I, myself, was attached to the 1st Squad, of the 1st platoon of the 1st Company. It basically goes on from there as the 1st. So, we were going in first. Of course we weren't ordered into this position, we volunteered, along with what remains of a platoon from Los Angeles. Together, all men and women combined, we made up a squadron of fourteen. We received a couple of other people who volunteered to fight with us, enlarging the squad eighteen. One of which was my friend from Alaska, Chris Soto. Standing at around six foot two with brown hair and tanned skin, Chris wasn't the kind of person you expected from Alaska. He however, was a seasoned fighter against the Ravagers, fighting them with the Canadian army and Alaskan National Guard. So, together, we were ready to help the Europeans out of the shithole that the aliens had brought upon them. We weren't a specific branch of the military anymore, were soldiers belonging to a coalition, the sibling rivalry between Marines, Army, and Navy, were still there, but we had all fought and now knew that there was no time to screw around. This was a time where we would redefine human history as not a species that would fight each other for their own personal gain. Now we fight to preserve humanity, preserve Earth, and preserve the freedoms that we posses as humans. \"McGrew, your teams securing the buildings on the left side of the street, Nantz, your securing the right.\" The new Staff Sergeant and I listened intently to Lieutenant Lawrence as we were flying over the port city of Le Havre towards Rouen. \"The Ravagers Convoy is coming down this road approximately an hour after we drop, we need to secure the area quick and make sure they don't get the armor to Le Havre. Understood?\" As the Canadian finished his statement, we acknowledged with a \"yes sir.\" \"Good, Gunny's team and my team will plant explosives along the road and then set up triple A on the roofs. Expect them to come with all the air they got. The Drop Pods need to be taken out quickly or our Flank will collapse.\" \"Lieutenant, ETA five minutes till touch down.\" The radio transmission from the pilot of the Osprey Mk2 was heard throughout the cabin. Everyone got set for an immediate exit from the VTOL. We were landing about a click and a half from the road the convoy was going to take. We would move from run quickly to the position, which would give us about forty five minutes to clear the area and setup the weapons. Each team had four or five people. Staff Sergeant Nantz and I had teams consisting of five members. Nantz had his group from LA, and I had some of the group from New York. In my fire team was myself, PFC Matt Greenholtz, LCpl Robin Alexander, Cpl Sean Collier, and PFC Chris Soto. Matt, Robin, and Sean carried M4 Carbines, a short barreled weapon that was very accurate and great for close quarters. Chris carried an M240 LMG and also carried the teams AT4 Anti Tank missile. I carried an M14 EBR selective fire rifle. I was designated as a marksman for this mission. \"Drop in thirty seconds people!\" We all stood up and got ready to exit the transport. \"Remember, keep down and watch out for enemies in the building, Intel wasn't great but they said this area was clear of hostiles.\" I shouted to everyone on board. I felt the VTOL shake as it began its descent. Ten seconds later, the doors opened and we all rushed out, fanning out to secure the area as the Osprey took off again. We then moved off towards our target. We could see the area, it was next to a large Cathedral that was on the right side of a river. We began our run while keeping an eye out for enemies in the area. The entire city was charred and bombed out. Most buildings looked like they had been blown apart by tanks or RPG's. The few sky scrapers in the city were tumbled over or had huge black holes in the side of them. The only building that didn't seem to be extremely damaged was the Cathedral, Ironically enough. The glow of the sun setting over the city set off an eerie image. \"Shit, and I though LA was bad,\" Commented one of the soldiers in Nantz team. \"Quiet Imlay, keep your head on a swivel, were almost at POI.\" The black man next to him by the name of Harris tapped him on the shoulder as he spoke. We walked the last forty yards to the street we were supposed to be at. \"Nantz! McGrew! Clear those buildings!\" We each brought our teams to our respective side of the street and began clearing houses. \"Sean, Chris, Clear that house,\" I said pointing to a small two story house that had not been completely blown apart. \"Matt, Cover outside, Robin were clearing that house.\" I said pointing to the lot a little further down; the next two consecutive ones had been turned to rubble so we didn't need to clear it. We each moved into our respective buildings. I walked up the door where Robin stacked up behind me. \"On your go,\" she whispered in my ears. I moved in front of the door, kicked it as hard as I could, taking it off its hinges. I then swung to my left and got behind a wall. Robin proceeded to enter into the building, sweeping the area for any sign of life. I followed her in and gave the order to check a room that looked like a living room. She covered me while I swept into the room, my M14 set for single fire. I heard a yell from outside and a couple of gunshots. I turned my head for a second and when I looked back, a Ravager was standing up from behind a couch at the far end of the room. I heard it make some gurgling sounds before it raised its arm to fire at me. I fired three rounds into the aliens torso, tearing it apart and knocking it down. At that moment I heard more gurgling and looked to my left to see another alien come into the room from the kitchen. It started firing at me and I dropped to the floor. Robin came into the room and sprayed the alien with a ten round burst before it dropped dead on the ground. Matt came rushing in and moved to help clear the rest of the house while Robin helped me up. \"Rob, we've had a run in with a single hostile but we neutralized it. Moving to the building adjacent to yours,\" I heard Sean say over the radio. \"Got it Sean, were engaging hostiles in this house proceed with the next building,\" I responded to my friend while simultaneously telling robin to move and help Matt clear the room. I pulled out my .45 and put a round into each of the alien's chest to make sure they were dead. These things were a pain to kill and I didn't want to take any chances. I began to move to where my friends moved off to when I heard some more gunfire, I hugged the wall instinctively and peeked around the corner to see Matt and robin pinned down behind a kitchen counter, engaged in a firefight with three aliens. I aimed down my sights and switched my rifle to a full auto setting. I braced myself for the recoil and sprayed the aliens with thirty caliber bullets, tearing them apart. I emptied the remaining seventeen bullets in my clip before reloading and moving up to finish them off. One launched a grenade at me and it blew a chunk out of the wall, sending shrapnel and insulation everywhere. I dropped to the floor and pulled out my pistol once again. I turned around the cabinet and fired on the last standing alien, dropping him to the ground as his chest combusted in flames, signaling that I hit his water apparatus. \"Building clear,\" I said over the radio, \"lets get those mines and AA online.\" The rest of the squad acknowledged and began setting up for the ambush. We only had twenty minutes until the sun went down completely, and thiry until the convoy was supposed to arrive. We had done this job before several times in New York and Boston, purging the remaining enemies out of the U.S., we had become experts at ambushing them, and it seemed that their communication and logistics were terrible, they never seemed to adapt to the ambushes. \"Rob, help me out over her, I need to set up this SAM launcher,\" my thoughts were interrupted by my friend Frankie Gordon, I went to help out and prepared for the battle to come. A/N: okay, I finally got the sequel up, I hope you don't mind if I use the OC's from the last story. Please tell me whether you liked the setting and plot so far and if there is anything that I am doing wrong. ","Summary":" A/N: This is the sequel to Summer Invasion.

(Notes: VOCG = Verbal Order of Commanding General. An action to be taken NOW with the paperwork to catch up when it could be done. Eight and Eye (Eight and I streets) is the site of the Marine Barracks, Washington DC, the official residence of the Commandant of the Marine Corps and is used traditionally as a synonym for Marine Headquarters.) Just before the darkness claimed him Michael Nantz thought he should have known it. It was just the way his luck ran. He had survived everything that the aliens had thrown at him; from the moment they had first stormed ashore in LA to the last stand the remnants of the invaders mounted when they were backed into a final corner. They had been cut down to a, well, not man, to a creature he supposed. After the lack of mercy they had shown to the people of LA the Marines and soldiers had been anything but inclined to extend the rules of warfare to the invaders. And after the events of the day up till then what else could he expect but more shocks and more surprises. After all, what he had already experienced today was beyond anything he could have ever imagined. He had his retirement postponed to meet and fight alien invaders. His confrontation with Jason Lockett had finally allowed him to make peace with the loss of his squad in Iraq. And most amazing of all, after a life of being alone he had met a woman that had moved something inside him he thought would never be touched. A woman whose last name he didn't even know and whom he had known for only a few hours. The surprises didn't stop once they were back on the ground in LA. At the Landing Zone they had been met by the senior Marine officer on the West Coast. After he had shaken their hands he had said he had an announcement. \"Due to the confused state of affairs many normal policies are being suspended. Obviously Sergeant Nantz you are well aware that all retirements have been cancelled. So have discharges. All reservists and National Guards have been federalized and activated. But also promotion boards and other review boards are being suspended. A revised policy gives authority to commanders in the field for actions once centralized at Eighth and Eye. Therefore, VOCG to be made official when time permits, I am promoting you from Staff Sergeant to Gunnery Sergeant.\" The crusty general smiled as Nantz's team cheered. \"I am also awarding you the Navy Cross. And the rest of your Marines are being cited for the Silver Star. That includes you Technical Sergeant Santos. I'm sure the Air Force won't object.\" As proud as he was of his promotion and award it was as nothing compared to the warmth he felt about the sincere congratulations from his team members. It had been a long lonely time for him but now he basked once more in comradeship and the truth of the words attributed to Henry the Fifth. It was shortly after that when they lost Santos. Fortunately the feisty Tech Sergeant wasn't lost to hostile action. That is unless you considered the Air Force hostile. A group of electronic techs had recognized her and dragged her into their group to help with intelligence surveillance. Though she was reluctant to leave the people she had shared so much with so quickly he had convinced her that her expertise was needed elsewhere. Before they moved out he saw Santos throw back her head and laugh. Turning, she trotted over to them, still chuckling. \"Whatever it is tell us,\" said Lockett. \"We can use a good laugh.\" \"Just got word from Seattle. When it was figured out that the invaders were homing in on radio transmission the forces up there spoofed them. They attached remote control radios to balloons and released them using the sea winds to blow them towards where electronic emissions showed the command and control center was. When the enemy committed its drones to destroy the attackers a group of AH-64 Apache attack helicopters flying nap of the earth from the other direction struck; bombarding the control center with a rain of TOW and Hellfire missiles.\" Nantz nodded. \"It appears that the aliens have been planning this for a long time. But they seem rigid. Perhaps no one ever told them of the old axiom 'No plan survives contact with the enemy'.\" \"That's what we got from higher up,\" the Air Force Sergeant agreed. \"Their battle plan seems inflexible. One of the colonels mentioned that they depend too much on us doing how they planned we would react. It went great at first but they don't seem to be able to handle improvised or off-the-wall actions.\" With that Santos had waved a cheery goodbye and rejoined her fellow techs. Inflexible or not the enemy put up a fierce resistance. But now they were on the defensive. Reports continued to come in of one coastal city after another where human forces had gained the upper hand and were driving the invaders back to the sea. By evening of the third day the American troops had splintered the enemy into isolated pockets and were mopping them up one by one. The platoon he was leading now, the few originals plus reinforcements from other units that had suffered as badly as they had and been broken up, had been probing an area reported to be infested with a few last hold-outs. Probing cautiously. There was a time for headlong charges, like the one that had got them to the evacuation zone, but this wasn't one of those times. They had been using short rushes from one covered position to another. It just happened that he looked up just in time to see an alien on a rooftop aiming its weapon down at the middle of the platoon. Long ago in Iraq there it had been an ambusher with an RPG. Then he had been too late and the explosion had taken the lives of the men he was responsible for. This time he wouldn't be late. He had shouted a warning and fired while leaping into the open to draw the creature's attention. He walked his fire into the vulnerable spot and once more blessed Michele for have the courage to dissect the alien corpse to find its weak spot. The creature staggered. Nantz continued to fire, driving it back with 5.56 millimeter hits. Its weapon pointed aimlessly the alien continued to fire even as it toppled off its perch. He nodded. That was what he would have done in its position, gone down fighting to the end. The shout from the side made him look up. He ducked. The falling concrete blocks from the nearby building bombarded him. One hit his shoulder and his weapon fell from a numb hand. Then his helmet took one, then two and finally a third wallop and he went to his knees. Only vaguely did he hear the cries of alarm as the platoon members rushed to his side. Hands caught him as he fell. \"Hang in there Gunny,\" his first squad leader, now Sergeant Jason Lockett directed. The young NCO snapped out orders. \"You three, secure the area. You two, rig a litter. Radio, find us an evac site and get a dust-off in here. The rest of you watch out. This fight isn't over yet. Stay sharp.\" Nantz wanted to smile. If he was down Locket had grown up and become a first class Marine capable of taking charge. He wanted to tell the young man how proud he was of him. But the dark haze dragged him down even as he felt the stretcher bearers lift him and start to move him. He didn't want to leave his Marines, he didn't want to leave the fight but this time he had no choice as he lost consciousness. But it was all worth it. When he awoke he was back at the FOB. And Michele was holding his hand. He smiled up at her. \"Hey.\" \"Hey,\" she replied and leaned over to brush her lips over his forehead. Damn. Who said even worn out old sergeants don't have it all turn out right sometimes? (The End) (By the way, yes, the title of this is a bit of a play on the affectionate insult other branches make of calling Marines \"Jar Heads\".) (And, should anyone not instantly recognize the words Nantz was thinking of from Henry the V; here they are once again in their immortal glory. \"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, This day shall gentle his condition; And gentlemen in England now-a-bed Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here, And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.\" You can find the entire speech By Kenneth Branagh in his production of Shakespeare's play on You Tube; I promise it will give you goose bumps.)

Because we all are, you, me, that dumbass with a blue Mohawk sitting in front of me. Everyone's unique in their own way, even if that way's insignificant. I always wondered, since psychologists can detect patterns in my behavior and emotions, I mustn't be unique in that aspect, and since every single talent I might have has an even more talented individual showing me how its done, that mustn't be it either… My looks aren't very impressive on any aspect, I'm not very tall, not enough for it to be noticed and even if I was, I wouldn't be alone. I'm no midget either and that too isn't a very unique feature… So what? Is it the way all these things come together that makes you who you are? Or is it how your memories affect the whole? If so, does it mean peoples stuck with Alzheimer are not really themselves anymore? I really wouldn't know, but I doubt it… So as I look at the Mohawk guy, sitting at the back of the city bus, I can't help but wonder, what makes him so different? His haircut? His upbringing? Or is it something deeper, something most would call his soul? \"The fuck do you want?\" His voice isn't very friendly either, mine is soft and calm, my voice is my signature. \"Thinking about human soul, wondering what makes us who we really are…\" His eyebrows rise suspiciously at that. A closer look reveals he's got tattoos on his neck and hands, the rest being covered by a red sweater, although I bet he has more. \"You some kind of a fuckin' poet?\" \"Nah,\" I laugh, \"I'm just a bike messenger who tries to get deep.\" His smile reveals rows of rotten tooth. \"So, what makes you you? \"Not a fucking clue.\" He chuckles and put his headphones back on. Seems like conversation is over. I'm almost at my stop anyway. 000000000000000 Montreal August 16, 2011 11:32pm Xavier's Appartment Well, well, eleven o'clock, empty fridge not eaten a single thing all day… Pizza! My messenger bag crashes into the couch, soon follower by my gloves and jacket. My work clothes – along with my PDA- are the most valuable things I own, most of them Nikes, except the long underwear, which is some weird brand, UnderArmor or something… Anyway, I got no computer, except my PDA, no car, no cellphone, and my bike was hand made from parts abandoned near the university. Economy, yes, but mostly I'm just too lazy to go shopping for stuff. I snatch my PDA from its charging clutch and log to the Dominos Pizza's website. It's in my Bookmarks, so it doesn't take very long… Hmm… Hawaiian pizza or BBQ chicken? It's been a while since I ate Hawaiian, but my stomach is screaming for BBQ, yet I'm getting a bit tired of chicken… To hell with it! I order both and two litters of DrPepper; if I'm gonna spend, might as well have the whole package, huh? Money's not really hard to come by in my line of work, at least, not for me, I know many couriers are having problems making ends meet, but that's because they spend it on expensive cell phone contracts, high speed internet and satellite TV. I got basic cable TV playing on a refurbished computer monitor, use the company's cell phone and am leeching my WiFi connection off the Cyber-coffee across the street. No problem, except my couch is actually a car seat I took from a junkyard and the apartment is actually a bleached white studio with view on a brick wall. Well, there's also the fact none of them has an army retirement pension… While going to the bathroom, I pass by my former platoon's group picture, framed and hung on the wall, and take a second to salute it, smiling at the inscription. \"That took balls, son! –Lt. Jonas 'Hamlet' Lovell \" Before I became bike messenger, I served two tours in the Canadian Forces, once in Afghanistan and once in Congo. Didn't see much action, but saw both my best friend and my brother blown by IEDs before catching a shrapnel in the balls which sent me straight back home with a juicy pension check from the queen and the most horrifying pain I ever felt… At least the docs managed to put everything back in place. Still, fucking hell, I'm twenty-three and I'm practically retired! Of course, they must have felt bad because now I can't have kids, but truth is, I don't think I would have been a good father anyway… I enter the bathroom and immediately switch the shower on. Water drips on the washed up green tiles in a weak stream at first, then grow steadily stronger until finally attaining the pressure of a cheap squirt gun. I carefully fold my clothes –a quirk I gained in the army- and step in the hot water. I'd like to say it feels good, but it doesn't; the water is either too hot or too cold and it has so little pressure I'd be better off showering in rain. I have dandruff problems, so I need to use a shampoo that costs more than my bike. The thick liquid forms a pond in my hand and I quickly apply it to my hair. I don't need much since I always kept the same haircut since the army. I'm barely done rinsing when someone rings from downstairs. Pizza already? Damn, they're fast! With no time to dry myself, I slip on my dirty clothes and jog over to the intercom. The buzzing sound it emits spooks me for a second, but then I realize It's because I pushed the open button instead of talk. Guess I'll have to wait for the guy to come up here… Might as well grab the cash in the meantime. I keep it in a locked footlocker with CPL. X. Frankfort printed in bold white letters. The thing is filled with mementos and stuff the army let me keep; a gas mask, boots, dog tags, a Browning HP, two boxes of 9mm bullets, a shrapnel fragment, a diving knife and two hundred dollars in bills of twenty… The army didn't let me keep that, I just use the locker as a safe. Someone knocks at the door, five times. I close the trunk and lock it before hurrying to the door. I fumble with that damned lock for a second but I didn't even lock it to begin with. Idiot. The heavy door opens to… Oh bloody fuck. \"Sir?\" I choke, looking at a Canadian Forces First Lieutenant, \"What…\" He's wearing full combat BDU, but he's completely clean and his rifle still has that new gun smell, so I guess I didn't miss too much.. \"What can I do for you, sir?\" Just with my tone, he can guess I used to be in the military, so his attitude changes from 'all business badass' to just another grunt. \"Army?\" \"Sort of. Arrowhead.\" That's classified stuff, but I don't think anyone will mind. \"Can you still fight?\" What a fucking weird ass question. \"Yes.\" \"Do you have weapons here?\" \"Just my browning…\" \"Go get it.\" Oh fuck… If things are bad enough a civilian needs a gun, then we're royally screwed! I walk over to the chest and quickly snatch the pistol and both boxes of ammo. I didn't load any round in the clip before, so I do it now, while the LT is talking. \"You know about the things that landed on the Labrador's coast?\" Saw something about that on the news, didn't really have time to listen for the details. All I know is that it's an unidentified enemy and they got their ass kicked so hard no one saw a single sign of activity from them ever since the initial drop. Seems all their fancy tech didn't prepare them for a close encounter with Joint Task Force Two. \"Yes.\" The 9mm Parabellum bullet slides in the clip with a click. \"Shit just got real. We have ten minutes before Tangos are all over us. You can head to the evac near the stadium or help CSOR and your Arrowhead pals hold the line to the south. Your move.\" The clip full, I shove it in the Browning's grip and rack the slide back. \"Got it, LT, any JTF2 deployment on this one?\" He laughs and run off to go knock to the next door. Stupid question, I guess. A quick look in the corridor reveals there's at least twenty grunts in the building knocking on doors and giving evac instructions. I walk past them and out of the building, pistol, bullets and knife in my messenger bag. Outside, peoples are rushing to their cars or packing their stuff despite the soldiers telling them not to. A man drives away without bothering to wait for his family… Chaos, just like Kinshasa or Kandahar. Peoples think that kind of behavior –stealing, killing, looting- wouldn't happen in a 'civilized' society. They're so fucking wrong. In the middle of all that, I unlock my bike, zip up my jacket and ride south. ","Summary":" You ever wondered what actually made you unique?

I'm hesitant to make fun of stuff I haven't actually seen, but thanks to YouTube and some playthroughs...god, my eyes! Just For Fun Throughout this entire invasion, no-one's asked why the aliens have invaded Earth. Some people had said it's because of our water, that they want to use it as a fuel source. To those people, I call them idiots. If aliens want water, why not land on Europa or Mars and extract it without fear of indigenous reprisal. And of course that's assuming that there's nowhere else between this world and Planet X where water can be found in some form or another. And that's assuming that the energy spent getting here in such numbers will make such an operation viable. And that's assuming...well, you get the idea. And if the aliens really are here because of water...well, I have to ask as to how they came to be so technologically advanced if they're willing to invade a planet because of water . But I digress. It doesn't matter why the aliens have come here. This is the real world, where plot devices don't have to be provided for us like an interested audience. No...our job is to go through Los Angeles (which always seems to go to hell in films... Terminator, Blade Runner... ) doing...well, I'm not sure. You see, when you're being briefed via comic-style animation, you tend to drift off. Yes, I'm serious- comics . Man, at this point in time, I don't know which species is more idiotic. But anyway, we're trudging through, just our squad, fighting...walking phlegm? Wait a minute...we're under attack by phlegm? Was Spock right all along, that's its life, but not as we know it? Except...we do know it? Heck, I don't know. All I know is that for some reason, we have only four types of weapon to deal with the walking phlegm that looks even less detailed than the more heavily armoured aliens visions have seen. You know, the ones with weapons grafted onto them. Man, imagine what the kids must look like... So on it goes. Trudging, firefight, cutscene, then back to trudging. And more trudging. Then a firefight, and...well, you get the idea. So maybe in my court martial you'll understand why I started shooting the scenery for kicks, to watch pretty explosions. Waste of ammo, destruction of property, negligence, etc. But the entire routine was just so boring . Heck, after fighting walking phlegm for hours on end, shooting at anything apart from aliens became more entertaining. But maybe there lies the key. Maybe I've sussed out why the aliens are invading. Maybe it's because they're just like us... ...because maybe, they like blowing things up for the sake of it.

Will take place in the alternating points of view of Sloane O'Reilly and Corporal Lee Imlay. I own nothing but my OC and her suggested romance. If you have any input on the military-based plot, please don't refrain from reviewing! I need all assistance I can get and all knowledge that you may have about the US Marine Corps (oorah!). One–Sloane The sky had gone grey and black with the plumes of smoke and smell of gunpowder. Most all the officers in the station were dead, and to think I'd stopped in to say hello to Chris's dad and grab a doughnut or two with him and his buddies. But there they lay, collapsed in pools of blood on the floor, gunshot wounds piercing each and every one of them. They were still warm, but the discoloration was beginning to take place, as a greyish tinge had taken to their skin. The Hispanic father and son were curled up with two girls, one smaller than the son, the other in her preteen stages, and another woman. I stood in my corner, staring at them. What unity did they have, when all I had was falling apart? Dad was dead. We'd received the call from Afghanistan a few nights prior to the meteor shower, or whatever it was, and now that the meteors had hit, chances were Mom had died too. Mom, Jacob, my best friend Crystal...chances were, most of my friends and family were probably dead. And it was only a matter of time before I was to join them. There was no winning here, when it came to this strange extraterrestrial race. \"M-Miss?\" stammered the Hispanic man, offering out his hand to me. \"P-please stay with us.\" I looked down to the eyes of his son, then those of the two girls. They were pleading and innocent. What had they lost to this war? I obliged, taking the man's hand and huddling up with them. In an instant, the small boy had wrapped himself about my waist, the tears running from his eyes down my shirt. And my hand made its way to his back, patting it lightly. \"Shh, sweetie, it's gonna be okay, I promise,\" I whispered, kissing the top of his head. Had his mother died in recent events? \"Hector, por favor,\" his father muttered, and the small boy retreated back. \"I'm sorry, Miss, he...my wife...his mother was killed in the gunfire this morning.\" I nodded. \"I'm so s-sorry, sir,\" I mumbled back, running a hand through my hair. \"My dad passed away in Afghanistan about a week ago. He was in the Marines. Y'know, they're supposed to be coming in a little bit, huh? They're supposed to come save us. They're gonna come get us and it'll all be okay, okay?\" Hector looked up at me with hope in his little eyes. I tried to smile at him, but for the hot moisture running from my own eyes and down my cheeks. Hector's dad in turn patted my back. \"Uh, there, there, Miss.\" I put on my best smile. \"It'll be okay?\" \"Yeah, you're right.\" BANG! What sounded like whispers came from wherever the crash was, and we huddled up closer. There were shuffles, and they were closing in on us. I tightened my grip around Hector and the little girls. This is it. I'm about to die. I'm about to see Dad, and probably Mom, probably Jacob, probably Crystal. And you know what? I think I'm ready for it. I think it's right this time . I looked up into the face of Death. \"U.S. MARINES!\" shouted Death, aiming his machine gun into my face. I threw my hands up on instinct, and I was no longer staring at the inside of the barrel. There were quite a few of them, the Marines, and they were all clad with weapons and the typical camo I saw in so many of the candid pictures Dad was always taking. After a long, frozen moment, the woman stood up. \"How many of you are there?\" Death questioned, his enormous cleft chin blocking most of my view on his words. \"S-six, three kids.\" Death looked to the rest of his men, and nodded. One of them grabbed my elbow, and I snuck him a questioning look. For one of Death's minions, he could have been an angel.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I own...well, not much. Just Sloane. There's gonna be some AU here, because Lenihan lives. The virgin's cool. Author's Note: This one's a bit longer than the last one, hope y'all like. If my writing style changes, it's because I'm trying to get the characters to have a bit more of a personal touch on the chapters. Imlay might seem a little less educated than Sloane. Please review and I hope you enjoy :) Two–Lee I jerked the redheaded girl up by the arm. \"C'mon now,\" I muttered, more to myself than her, but she quickened her pace anyhow, leaping to her feet then bending down to lace up her shoes again. There was only so much time we had, and those damn bastards were moving probably twice as fast as we were. She looked up at me, her eyes wide open and clear like a kid's, but her face looked a lot older. Twenty-something older. \"You need no help or somethin'?\" I asked, but she shook her head real quick. \"No, I got it,\" she shot back, looking back up. Lord, but she was good-lookin'. Red hair and everything. Be good for the virgin to get some action 'fore he almost died again. \"Hey, you heard of Bryan O'Reilly?\" I looked around, before I saw she was talkin' to me. \"Yeah, you, uh, uh, Eye-Black.\" \"It's Imlay. Lee Imlay. And no, I guess I ain't. Your war hero uncle or somethin'?\" We was both movin' now, along with the rest of the boys. Stavrou shot me a quick eyebrow thing, with a big ol' grin on his face, and kept the pace up ahead of us. The girl shook her head fast, her hair swingin' around her shoulders. I fiddled with a string on my pack and handed it to her. \"Here. You oughta tie up your hair, so it don't get in the way. We got a heli comin' for you guys, all the hurt ones and the civilians.\" She took it and did her hair up in this nice little ponytail. \"Thanks. And no, Bryan O'Reilly was my dad. Just wonderin' if maybe you'd fought with him.\" She paused, looking down. \"Died a week or two back.\" I nodded all slow-like and ran a hand through my hair, but we kept going, the both of us turning at every sound that came from the surroundings. Finally we got outside, but it looked like the helicopter was already leavin'. Nantz near caught up, carryin' the little girl, but they didn't have enough room. Leni sat down next to Nantz's feet, rubbing his head in pain. Since the bastard-ass aliens caught up with him he started feeling the sufferin' of it all. After a second or two, the heli took off. The bitches. A couple of our guys waved at us, didn't even let the kids on, and then some crazy-ass blasting came out of nowhere. Blasted the heli to bits. They had the goddamn skies now. We all got our shit assembled back into the cop station. \"Shit,\" she was mumbling, folding up into the fetal position against a wall. Her eyes were dripping like crazy. I didn't really know what to do, so I kinda patted her on the knee. She looked up, biting her lip. \"Isn't this going to be just a regular walk in the park.\" Her voice was all sarcastic and whatnot and her eyes looked blank, lost. From then on it seemed more like she started to talk to herself than me: \"Wonder if that's how Dad died. In a blaze of goddamn glory, just like Dad would want to go. That goddamn bastard...\" The random string of words continued into a mutter that I couldn't make out anymore. I nudged her with my elbow, nodding my head towards the heart of the station. \"Uh...think we should get goin' again?\" She looked up at me, a big old glare on her pretty little face. \"You should be hurrying up with the rest of your Marines. They probably need you right about now. Don't worry about me, I'll be goddamn fine .\" She untied and then tied her shoes again, starting to look through the drawers on the desk next to her. \"Aha.\" She found a small safe in one of 'em, and picked one of them bobby pins out of her hair. Then she started workin' at the lock on it, and I stood there like a dumbass watching. \"Get outta here, Imlay, I'm trying to help your cause!\" I nodded again, like a dumbass, and got my ass out of there. What an angry ginger would want from a city cop's friggin' safe when crazy-ass aliens were invading Earth, well, that was beyond me, but, hell, did I listen to her. I found Nantz, Martinez, Ad-Adukwu or whatever the hell it was, the Air Force chick (stupid Air Force...when the hell were they gonna start bombing?), and a couple of civilians in this one room, all standing around an alien. It was lying on the floor, and it was hurt. Not dead, but hurt. They kept peeling back its skin by layers and stabbing, but the goddamn thing wouldn't die. \"C'mon!\" Nantz hollered, jamming his bayonet hard into what looked like the chest, in the middle, and the thing finally spazzed out and seemed to die. He smiled huge and looked at the chick, the Air Force chick. \"The right of the heart. We have to hit 'em in the right of where the heart would be.\" We all kinda nodded at him and got up. Time to get moving again. Nantz stood up and started marchin' on next to me. \"What the hell'd you do with that civilian girl anways, Imlay?\" \"Idonno, boss, she started breakin' into some cop's safe and kicked me out. She was in such a bad mood I...uh, thought I should...uh...leave.\" Then of course he gave me a look. You're such an idiot, Imlay, takin' orders from a civilian. A chick civilian. A ginger-ass chick civilian. Who was ginger and everything. And then Nantz decided he was gonna laugh at me, all smiley and whatever. Today was a really, really weird day. And it was only noon. \"Smart man, Imlay. Very smart.\" \"Uh-uh-uh w-what do you mean, Staff Sergeant Nantz?\" sputtered out Leni, rubbin' all crazy at that spot on his head, and Nantz went and smacked a hand down on Leni's shoulder. \"Just a tip, Lenihan. The woman's always right. Especially when she has a gun,\" he added, lookin' between the Air Force Chick and the ginger chick. Who both had guns now. Ginger was all smiley now, too, and waving her little pistol around as we moved. \"I'm going to trust that you know how to use that, civilian?\" She nodded, her smile spreading over the rest of her face. God, but she was good-lookin'. \"Daddy was a Marine, he taught me how to man every piece of weaponry before he died, Staff Sergeant. I would never handle any equipment I didn't know how to program, sir.\" That little bitch. She knew her way around shit. \"Well, welcome to the war, Miss...?\" She looked at me, battin' those goddamn eyelashes of hers. \"O'Reilly,\" I said, almost robotically. \"Right?\" \"Sloane O'Reilly,\" she corrected, tapping me on the nose with her gun. I flinched and she, of course, laughed. Not no stupid girly giggle, but hell, she laughed. \"Lucky I didn't pull the trigger there, Imlay .\" Ugh.

Là, une révélation : Jérémy Renner, qui n'est pas mon genre, est tout bonnement éblouissant dans le rôle de Will James, le chef temporaire de « Bravo Company ». Chef quasiment azimuté et totalement suicidaire ! Bref, une fiction est née dans mon esprit lorsque j'ai visionné le film. Attention : Ames sensibles s'abtenir ! Mention de violence, d'injures, de grossièretés et de sexe ! Synopsis du film : « Bravo Company » est un groupe de trois démineurs, constitué de Thompson, de Sanborn et d'Eldrige. Ces trois G.I sont chargés en Irak de désamorcer les bombes et pièges à l'encontre des civils et des soldats. Thompson, suite à une indécision d'Eldrige, va mourir lors d'une manœuvre de désamorçage. Eldrige sera traumatisé par la mort de son supérieur qu'il considère de sa faute. Will James, spécialiste des mines et explosifs, vient remplacer temporairement Thompson. Disclaimer : Les personnages ne m'appartiennent pas et sont la propriété exclusive Bigelow. Je ne retire aucun bénéfice financier de cette fiction ! « Terrain miné » : Sanborn, totalement soul et chancelant, fut ramené par ses deux camarades dans son bâtiment. Marmonnant des phrases sans queue, ni tête, le sergent artificier parvint à escalader les trois marches qui le séparaient de son lit et s'écroula sur le plancher. Ronflant allégrement. Will, soulagé du poids lourd qu'était son sergent, ne chercha pas à relever l'endormi : Il était lui aussi bien imbibé d'alcool et cela constituait un véritable miracle que le militaire pusse tenir debout. Sur ses deux jambes. L'esprit embrumé par les vapeurs du whiskey, Will tituba jusqu'à la sortie et se soutenant au chambranle branlante de la porte, il s'y adossa, avec toute la dignité possible. « -Vous ne le ramassez pas, James ? S'enquit Eldrige, dont l'euphorie de l'alcool ne l'avait pas encore abandonné. Il va se faire « allumer » par les autres s'ils le retrouvent ainsi ! » Un gloussement, manquant de conviction, échappa à Will qui haussa des épaules, se fichant complètement du sort de son sergent. « -M'en fous ! Fit-il, charitable, en levant un regard au ciel. N'avait pas qu'à se souler ! Mince, vous m'avez nettoyé toute ma réserve de whiskey ! » Farfouillant dans sa poche, il extirpa une cigarette et un briquet et l'allumant, la fuma tranquillement. Les yeux vitreux et les neurones déconnectés. Owen s'assit aux côtés de son supérieur et posant une main sous son menton, se mit en devoir de contempler les étoiles et les cieux noirs d'Irak. « -C'est moi ou j'ai l'impression que les étoiles m'observent ? Demanda Eldrige, un soupçon de panique dans la voix. Elles doivent m'espionner… Oui, chef, elles nous espionnent ! » Will jeta un regard inquisiteur sur les traits apeurés et souls de son artificier et grimaçant une moue de dégoût, il donna un grand coup dans l'avant-bras gauche d'Owen. « -Voilà, pourquoi je n'aime pas boire avec des enfants ! Regretta James, d'un ton philosophe et dramatique. Calme, petit ! Calme. C'est dans ta tête ! » Owen, offusqué d'être traité « d'enfant », lui rendit un coup qui faillit basculer Will, dont l'équilibre était bancal, à terre. Sur le sable chaud d'Irak. « -Je ne suis pas un gamin. Protesta Eldrige, les yeux brillants. Puis suis pas parano ! C'est dans ma tête, l'homme au téléphone ? Dans ma tête, si Thompson est mort ? Si je n'avais pas « merdé » ce jour-là ! » … Voyant que le volume de la voix d'Owen allait crescendo, attirant les regards des autres soldats, Will soupira d'exaspération et se résolut de trainer son artificier dans sa baraque d'officier. « -Damn ! Fit-il, en s'apercevant des joues humides d'Owen. Tais-toi ! Tu me soules avec tes remords à la « con » ! » Owen, qui sanglotait à grand bruit, fixa des yeux incrédules sur Will et furieux du peu d'empathie de son supérieur, bondit sur lui. Il le plaqua au sol et le frappa de ses poings. « -Espèce d' « enfoiré » ! Cria-t-il, en pleurant et en cognant. Vous n'êtes qu'une ordure ! Un taré qui se fout de la vie de ses hommes ! « Salaud »! Je vous raconte mes états d'âme, ce que je ressens et vous me dites de la « boucler » ? » Se protégeant le visage, Will se promit, désabusé, qu'il ne soulerait plus avec de tels gamins, incapables de supporter l'alcool. « -Si tu ne supportes pas de vivre avec des remords, fallait pas t'engager ! » Cracha-t-il, avec un venin du à l'ivresse et tutoyant son soldat. Ce fut l'explosion : Un déluge d'insulte et de coup s'abattit sur Will qui, au lieu d'apaiser la situation, vociférait des injures. Provoquant la fureur et déchainant la rage d'Owen à son égard. Une sensation familière, agréable et grisante, envahit le cerveau de Will et chassa le reste de lucidité, qu'il devait y avoir, dans son esprit. « -T'avais qu'à pas hésiter ! Hurla James, un rire naissant dans sa gorge. Alors, viens pas « chialer » que c'est de ta faute que Thompson a été tué ! Gros naze ! » Le rire, hystérique, éclata au visage, hébété et soudain terrifié, d'Owen qui se recula. Mais Will ne le lui permit pas : L'agrippant au poignet, il l'amena à lui, près, très près, et le plaquant au sol, maintint les bras du jeune Owen dans un étau d'acier. Le réduisant à l'impuissance et à son pouvoir. Un sourire sur ses lèvres, Will rivait son regard, narquois et amusé, à celui d'Eldrige qui, déglutissant, frissonna d'appréhension. Son cœur s'accélérant subitement. … Will resta un long moment à contempler Eldrige, de ses yeux hypnotiques et s'inclinant, il s'empara des lèvres du jeune homme. Lèvres qu'il écarta, de sa langue humide, chaude, insistante et intruse. Owen se débattit frénétiquement mais le poids du corps de Will le clouait au sol. Il tenta d'échapper à l'invasion de sa bouche, en tournant la tête de côté. Peine perdue. Il se retint de gémir quand des doigts, frais et doux, défaisant la ceinture de son treillis, se glissèrent et se refermèrent sur son membre assoupi. Will le masturba, lentement, suavement et sensuellement et arrachant des soupirs et des petits glapissements d'Owen, continuait l'exploration de la bouche de ce dernier. Taquinant de sa langue, le palais si sensible du jeune homme et ses lèvres que James mordillait. Faisant frémir et trembler le corps d'Owen. Eldrige finit par répondre aux sollicitations de Will et sa langue s'enroula autour de celle de son supérieur. Le jeune artificier émit un gémissement au creux de l'oreille de James dont le désir se raviva. Enlevant le T-Shirt de son amant, Will dévoila le torse, glabre et musclé, d'Eldrige qui soutint son regard fasciné, les joues rouges néanmoins. De son pouce et de son index, il pinça et effleura les mamelons et les portant entre ses lèvres, les suçota. Owen, submergé par des flots de sensations merveilleuses, haleta et ferma les yeux, se mordant la lèvre inférieure. Il sentit que son pantalon lui était ôté et anticipant le plaisir à venir, s'y prépara mentalement. Mais empressé, il se frotta, fiévreusement, contre le membre, dur et gonflé, de Will qui poussa un son inarticulé. Amenant un sourire de victoire au jeune Owen. Will lui donna un sourire coquin et tendre avant de lui prodiguer un baiser torride. Owen, noyé et grisé de sensations vertigineuses et insupportablement exquises, murmura une phrase : « -Je t'aime, James. » Will stoppa net ses gestes, le cerveau digérant, difficilement, ce qu'il venait d'entendre. Il scruta le visage déconcerté et empreint d'incompréhension d'Owen qui s'était figé, dans l'expectative. « -Will ? » Fit Eldrige, incertain et hésitant. Il le vit se redresser et ramasser le T-Shirt. « -Dégage, Owen ! Ordonna Will, d'un ton dur et autoritaire. Allez, ouste ! Disparais ! » Perdu, ne comprenant pas, Eldrige prit son T-Shirt, se rhabilla et fuit de chez son supérieur. « -« Son of bitch ! » Pesta-t-il, en regagnant ses quartiers. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 2] Le sergent-chef Will James a chassé Eldrige de son lit lorsque ce dernier lui fait un aveu sur ses sentiments. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 2 : Une escouade de G.I, en état d'alerte, sur le qui-vive, déployée, maintenait la zone de périmètre infranchissable à n'importe quel civil. Le soleil de Bagdad cognait dur sur les véhicules et les soldats qui, en dépit de leur kevlar et de leurs lunettes de soleil, subissaient les réverbérations des rayons sur le sable. Des habitants du quartier, à leurs fenêtres, curieux, observaient les militaires américains sécuriser la zone où se trouvait, enfoui, une bombe piégée. Will, debout, les traits impassibles et imperturbables, se laissait enfiler son « Humvee » par le sergent Sanborn et par l'artificier Eldrige. Le jeune soldat, la mine occupée, semblait avoir oublié sa déconvenue de la veille avec son sergent-chef. Saisissant le casque de métal, lui mettant son arme dans son étui, il évitait le regard de Will qui le fixait des yeux, impavides. Tentant désespérément de cacher ses joues rouges et son sentiment d'humiliation et de gêne sous le regard perspicace de James. Ajustant la visière et le casque sur le crâne de son sergent-chef, Eldrige finit par rencontrer le regard clair et direct de Will et ses doigts effleurant, par inadvertance, la peau douce et chaude des joues de son supérieur, le jeune artificier tressaillit. Baissant vivement les yeux et se mordillant la lèvre inférieure, l'humectant. Se haïssant d'être si réceptif à ce contact et de sa faiblesse à l'égard d'un homme qui se fichait bien de lui. La sueur transparut sur le front d'Eldrige dont la respiration se fit plus courte et plus saccadée quand l'artificier perçut la lueur narquoise dans les yeux, assombris par le désir, de Will. L'air sembla, soudain, se raréfier autour des deux hommes et Owen, confus et contrarié, se sentit trahi par une partie de son anatomie venant de se réveiller. Will eut juste un demi-sourire, montrant qu'il n'ignorait rien de ce qui se passait en Owen qui le détesta, au plus haut point, à cet instant-là. « -Ce soir, petit. Dit James, bien bas et sûr de lui. Je te ferai crier comme jamais. » Eldrige, récupérant ses esprits, murmura : « -Dans tes rêves, sale « enfoiré ». » Il ne récolta qu'un rire, cynique et à moitié étouffé par le casque, de la part de son sergent-chef qui cheminait, lentement, vers l'explosif. …. Sanborn, son fusil mitraillette à l'épaule et un œil collé au viseur de la lunette, surveillait les toits des immeubles et gardait le contact radio avec James. Celui-ci, allongé sur le sable, concentré, examinait un EEI dont le reste était enfoui sous des gravats. Délicatement, minutieusement, il déblaya le sable autour de la tête de la bombe et avec des gestes précis et lents, entreprit d'enlever l'explosif. Le souffle suspendu et court. Eldrige, à l'abri derrière un parapet de brique, chargé de le couvrir et de lui apporter le matériel nécessaire, suivait l'opération. Fasciné par la dextérité et le sang-froid de cet homme étrange et totalement « shooté » à l'adrénaline. Pointant le viseur sur le sergent-chef, il perçut son expression de profonde satisfaction et de jouissance à côtoyer le danger et la mort. Partagé entre l'horreur et la compassion, il songea que la femme de Will était sacrément loyale et amoureuse pour rester avec un homme dont le seul et unique amour était la guerre. Inconsciemment, Eldrige commença à presser la gâchette de son arme et immobile, il contempla l'homme qui pouvait, un jour, les faire tous tuer. L'arme s'enclencha et Will, toujours dans la ligne de mire d'Owen, extirpa, précautionneusement, l'engin explosif. Puis se relevant, soupirant, arborant un immense sourire, il signala à Sanborn et aux autres G.I que tout péril était écarté. Owen relâcha son doigt de la gâchette et réalisant qu'il avait été bien près de commettre un acte irréparable, se réprimanda mentalement. Il vit Will qui s'avançait dans sa direction et faillit s'étrangler quand le sergent-chef chuchota, à son passage, dans un souffle : « -Vise la bombe la prochaine fois. Ton acte passera pour une erreur de ma part. » Dérouté, perdu, Owen demeura figé, un long moment, à ruminer ces conseils. Ce fut le regard suspicieux de Sanborn qui l'arracha de son désarroi et qui le fit rejoindre leur véhicule. … S'appuyant de ses deux paumes sur le rebord des lavabos, Owen s'observa dans le miroir de la salle de bain collective du camp Victory et déboussolé, se retourna et se laissa glisser au sol. Les yeux clos et l'esprit empli de sentiments contradictoires et orageux. Des pas sur le sol dallé de la salle d'eau tirèrent Eldrige de ses pensées chaotiques et tourmentées. Will, portant toujours son uniforme de combat, tout comme Owen, le jaugeait de son air impassible et subtilement railleur. Le jeune artificier, énervé par cet air si confiant et si imperturbable, se jeta sur lui et commença à le rouer de coups. Désirant lui enlever cette expression si supérieure et si assurée… La haine le submergea entièrement, faisant oublier au jeune soldat grade, sanction et cour martiale… Will esquiva l'attaque suivante et maitrisant Owen, le collant contre le mur, déclara, railleur et moqueur : « -Que se passe-t-il, artificier ? Vous n'avez pas digéré le fait que j'aime toujours ma femme et mon fils ? Ou que vous ne soyez qu'un coup pour moi ? Allons, Eldrige, tu sais très bien qu'il n'y a que ça entre soldats. » Furieux et plein de rage, Owen profita, d'un brusque relâchement de Will, pour se dégager et lui cracher à la figure. Will, sans se départir de son cynisme et de son calme, agrippa Owen et le projetant dans une cabine de douche et tirant les rideaux, le plaqua, ventre au mur. L'uniforme sentant bon le sable et le soleil de Bagdad et l'odeur de la poudre et de sueur mêlée embrasèrent le désir de Will qui, mordillant la nuque d'Owen, humait ce parfum typique et propre d'un G.I revenant d'un combat. Le sergent-chef, dont des images de batailles et de désamorçage amplifièrent l'adrénaline et les sensations, détacha la ceinture d'Eldrige qui, muet et docile, se laissait faire. Aimant le côté brutal et animal de leur relation. La main de Will se glissa sous le treillis, atteignit le caleçon et descendit plus bas. Ses doigts exercèrent une pression experte sur le membre d'Owen qui, gémissant, se cambra. « -Je veux t'entendre crier et gémir, Owen. » Susurra James, en accentuant ses caresses le long de la verge de son artificier qui, les yeux clos, se mordait le poignet pour étouffer ses cris. Mais Eldrige, avec un sursaut de lucidité, refusa : « -On pourrait venir et nous surprendre… Oh, dieu ! » Will, fier de lui, abaissa le pantalon et le sous-vêtement d'Owen et le prépara, sensuellement et délicatement. Faisant soupirer et haleter son artificier. Un râle rauque et puissant échappa de la gorge d'Eldrige quand James le pénétra, avec force et hardiesse. Les vas et vient du membre dur et long de Will, en Owen, eurent raison de la résolution du jeune artificier qui se mit à crier et à hurler de plaisir. « -Crie ! Gémis bien fort, petit ! Encouragea Will, qui continua à le pilonner comme un fou. Tout le monde saura que tu es à moi ! » Saisissant la verge, douloureusement gonflée d'Eldrige, il effectua des massages lents qui rendirent fou de frustration Owen. « -Plus vite, Will ! Supplia-t-il, entre deux gémissements. Oui…Comme ça…Oh, seigneur ! Je vais mourir…Will ! » Dans un hurlement sauvage et bestial, les deux hommes se libérèrent et s'écroulèrent à terre. Haletant, le souffle court. Cherchant à retrouver leur respiration. Heureux et la chair repu. Will, le premier, se leva et ébouriffant les mèches blondes d'Eldrige, s'en alla : « -Je t'avais dit que je te ferai crier comme jamais. Promesse tenue, petit. » Owen, après le départ de son sergent-chef, prostré sur lui-même, éclata en sanglot. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 3] Owen a bien failli céder à une pulsion inconsciente à l'encontre de son sergent-chef Will James. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 3 : La poussière dorée et soulevée, par les nombreux déplacements de blindés américains, n'empêchait en rien Owen, assis sur les marches de ses quartiers, de profiter d'une merveilleuse scène : Will, en tenue légère de G.I, sa casquette sur la tête et lunettes teintées de soleil, entamait une partie de soccer avec un petit Irakien, âgé de dix ans. Celui-ci, vendeur agréé, par le Camps Victory, de dvd pour adultes, gardait les buts et tentait de stopper tous les tirs de James. Son visage d'enfant retrouvait l'insouciance de l'enfance et rayonnait de plaisir de jouer contre le sergent-chef Will. Will, plus détendu que d'habitude, s'était départi de son attitude froide et compassée de militaire et dévoilait un côté insoupçonné de sa personnalité. Une personnalité chaleureuse, capable d'émotions humaines et de s'attacher à quelqu'un. Morose et curieux, Eldrige, une main sous le menton, essayait de percer l'énigme « Will ». « -Tu devrais grandir, Owen. Fit Sanborn qui le rejoignit sur les marches. Will a besoin d'une personne forte, solide et capable de lui tenir tête. Et de lui apporter la stabilité dont il désire. » Owen, les joues cramoisies et l'air d'un gamin pris en faute, sursauta à l'énoncé du conseil de son sergent Sanborn. Ce dernier observait, songeur et fasciné, James qui riait avec la gamin. « -Une personne comme toi. Murmura Eldrige, désabusé. D'ailleurs, pourquoi tu me dis ça ? » Sanborn regarda droit dans les yeux d'Owen, mal à l'aise, et déclara avant de s'en aller : « -Ce n'est pas avec moi qu'il couche. Grandis avant que Will n'aille voir ailleurs. Tu es le seul homme avec lequel il trompe sa femme. » Déconcerté et soulagé d'un poids malgré tout, Owen contempla James et dépité par son indifférence, il se leva, se dirigeant vers la baraque de son supérieur. ….. Le casque. Son regard s'attacha immédiatement au casque de l' « Humvee », hypnotisé. Posé, en évidence, sur la table de chevet du sergent-chef, le fameux casque du démineur. Owen devina la fascination profonde de Will pour et objet et une jalousie, attisée par le fait de savoir que Will en était dépendant, l'envahit. Le jeune artificier déduisit les sensations que devaient lui procurer le casque au sergent-chef et une impulsion, subite et meurtrière, lui donna l'envie irraisonnée de flanquer ce casque contre le mur. Mais il maitrisa ce désir et prenant, précautionneusement le casque, il s'en coiffa. Inspirant un grand coup, il ferma les yeux et des odeurs l'assaillirent, ainsi que des souvenirs d'intervention. Odeur de sueur et de parfum de Will, mais aussi du sable chaud d'Irak et de fer. Un sentiment étrange, exaltant et non exempt de nuances malsaines s'emparèrent d'Eldrige qui se retourna, entendant un bruit de pas derrière lui. Le regard de Will et celui d'Eldrige s'affrontèrent un instant avant que le sergent-chef, reconnaissant la lueur, trop familière, dans les yeux de son artificier, s'élança sur lui : « -Enlève ça tout de suite, Owen. C'est un ordre ! Tu ne porteras jamais l' « Humvee » ! » Le basculant sur le lit, il arracha le casque, sans ménagement, et le jeta à terre. Owen, frustré et encore en proie à l'ivresse procurée par les sensations, se rebiffa et injuria Will : « -Espèce de « salaud » ! Tu n'es qu'un « putain » d'enfoiré égoïste ! Tu veux garder cette euphorie pour toi ! « Son of bitch » ! » Will subit, en silence, les insultes d'Eldrige et s'éloignant du jeune homme, il explosa dans un déchainement de violence : Il envoya valdinguer ce qui se trouvait sur son bureau et le casque s'écraser contre le mur. « -Tu veux être comme moi ? Un drogué à l'adrénaline et aux combats ! C'est ça que tu veux ? Petit « merdeux » ! Tu n'es pas content de ne rien obtenir de moi et tu veux mourir ! Suicide-toi si l'envie t'en prend ! Mais ailleurs qu'ici et pas en mission ! Allez, tire-toi, sale môme ! Hors de ma vue ! » Owen bondit du lit et s'enfuit, les larmes aux yeux. Sous le regard implacable et écoeuré de Will. … La nuit, froide et glaciale, environnait le camp. Owen, tourmenté par les paroles de Will, le torse nu et en bas de pyjama, essayait de chercher le réconfort dans la contemplation du ciel étoilé. Un sourire se dessina sur ses lèvres quand l'apaisement vint enfin. Mais des bribes de conversations et de rires égrillards tirèrent le jeune artificier de ses songes. Owen vit un couple enlacé et se diriger, d'un pas titubant et chancelant, dans la direction des quartiers de Will. Pris d'un pressentiment, il tendit l'oreille et distingua la voix d'une femme. Son cœur se serra, comme déchiré par une souffrance atroce. « -Sergent, vous êtes soul. Minauda la jeune militaire. Ce n'est pas raisonnable. Que vont dire les autres ? » Un rire moqueur et parfaitement cynique répondit à la jeune femme qui gloussa. Le couple disparut dans la baraque de Will, laissant un Owen au bord du désarroi et plein d'amertume. Scrutant l'obscurité, le jeune artificier vit une silhouette familière ouvrir la fenêtre et un visage avec un large sourire s'encadrer dans l'espace ouvert. « -Ca te dit une partie à trois, petit ? Lança Will, totalement soul et sarcastique. C'est mieux que de jouer les voyeurs ! Ou, si tu préfères, tu peux mater ! » Owen se mordit l'intérieur de la joue et se reculant dans la pénombre bienfaisante de sa chambre, il étouffa ses sanglots dans son oreiller. ….. Sanborn réprima un soupir de lassitude et d'agacement lorsqu'il sentit la tension entre ses deux équipiers dans la voiture. Owen, droit et l'expression lointaine, ignorait la présence de Will et remua, à peine, les lèvres pour saluer son sergent qui prit le volant. Will, des cernes sous les yeux et les traits tirés, se remettait de sa folle nuit de la veille. « -Voiture piégée près d'une mosquée. Informa Sanborn qui retint un désir d'hurler son irrtation et de cogner les deux hommes. Prêts ? » Un sourire réjoui s'afficha sur le visage de Will qui s'écria : « - Let's rock and roll! » Son cri de guerre et son expression fétiche. De bonne humeur, le sergent-chef tambourina sur la porte du véhicule. Cette gaité, excessive, eut le don de « taper » sur le système de Sanborn qui, discrètement, surveillait Eldrige toujours muet. Owen l'inquiétait par son attitude froide et impassible. Cela allait réduire l'efficacité de l'unité. Percevant les doutes de Sanborn à son égard, Eldrige lui adressa un clin d'œil qui détendit Sanborn. …. Will, concentré et la sueur sur le front, dénouait des fils avec des doigts agiles et experts. Des G.I, sur le qui-vive, sécurisaient le périmètre et surveillaient les alentours, s'assurant qu'aucun civil n'avait de comportement suspect. Sanborn, à couvert, gardait le contact radio avec le sergent-chef James et Eldrige, à l'affut, couvrait les arrières de Will. « -Damned ! Fit Will, en apercevant la complexité du dispositif. Artificier, j'ai besoin d'un coupe-boulon ! » Owen, quittant son abri, se rendit auprès de Sanborn et fouillant dans la mallette d'outil, il s'empara, prestement, de l'objet demandé. Il courut rejoindre Will mais parvenu à la hauteur de Sanborn, il se reçut une rafale de mitraillette. Il s'écroula, sans un cri, sur le sol. De suite, les G.I, localisant la provenance du tir, ripostèrent et fauchèrent le sniper qui chuta d'un toit. « -Que se passe-t-il, Sanborn ? » S'inquiéta Will, en entendant les déflagrations d'armes. Sanborn, faisant appel à toute sa discipline de soldat, alla à la rescousse de son camarade, vérifia son pouls et attrapant la mallette des mains de l'inconscient, l'apporta à Will. Il fit signe aux autres soldats de ne rien dire sur l'état d'Owen mais le médecin militaire se connecta à la fréquence radio de Sanborn pour l'informer de l'urgence : « -Sergent, il faut l'évacuer tout de suite ! Il perd trop de sang ! » Sanborn jura entre ses dents et dut répondre aux questions de Will : « -Eldrige a été touché par une rafale de mitraillette ! J'appelle un hélicoptère pour l'évacuer en urgence ! On s'occupe de lui, Will ! Alors, concentre-toi sur la bombe ! » Un silence de mauvais augure conforta le sergent Sanborn dans ses certitudes. « -Te fiche pas de moi, Sanborn ! Hurla James, hystérique, dans sa radio. Son état ? Comment est-il ? Mon « cul » qu'on s'occupe de lui ! Tu sais très bien qu'un hélicoptère n'interviendra pas avant que la bombe ne soit désamorcée ! Donne l'ordre de l'évacuer rapidement sinon, il vous faudra un autre démineur, ok ? » Sanborn, énervé et maudissant le médecin, appela le camp et demanda une évacuation d'urgence pour Owen qui recevait les premiers soins. « -Négatif, sergent Sanborn. Refusa l'opérateur, chargé de la communication radio avec les unités en manœuvre. Vous connaissez le protocole. » Avant que le sergent ne pût protester, une autre voix se fit entendre : « -Ecoute, fils de p… ! Tu vas envoyer, illico, un hélico ou je laisse tout en plan : Bombe et voiture piégée, ok ? Alors, magne-toi ! » ….. La réponse vint, après plusieurs secondes de mutisme : « -Bien, sergent-chef James. Mais vous en répondrez devant la cour martiale. » Un rire moqueur salua la menace et Will coupa le contact. Il se remit à sa tache et avec le coupe-boulon, entreprit de casser un cadenas. Le cadenas céda. Un sourire de victoire se fit sur les lèvres du sergent –chef qui souleva le couvercle avec beaucoup de prudence. Quand un petit déclic se fit entendre, annonçant un déclenchement de minuteur. « -Evacuez la zone, vite ! Prévint Will, en adressant de grands gestes aux autres soldats. Vite ! C'était un dispositif-leurre ! » Tous s'éloignèrent de la zone létale et Will se mit à courir, à grandes enjambées et gênés par le poids de l' « Humvee ». La même exaltation grisante et pernicieuse s'infiltra dans son corps et son cerveau et une lueur, proche de la folie et de l'extase absolue, assombrit ses yeux bleus. « -Dépêche-toi, Will ! Exhorta Sanborn, qui suivait la progression de son équipier. Allez, dépêche ! » L'explosion se déclencha, provoquant un vacarme infernal et un nuage de poussière impressionnant. Son souffle, puissant, envoya planer Will à quelques mètres de la zone sécuritaire et le jeune soldat s'effondra sous une pluie de gravats. La visière de son casque s'éclaboussa de sang. « -Will ! » Hurla Sanborn, en se débarrassant du sable qui lui masquait la vue. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 4] Eldrige a été fauché par une rafale de mitraillette et Will, enseveli sous une pluie de gravats. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 4 : Tous les G.I, immobiles et le souffle suspendu, fixaient le lieu où le sergent-chef James avait disparu sous un déluge de débris. Le temps s'était figé net. Même le médecin, qui s'occupait des pansements d'Owen, scrutait les monceaux de décombre. En attente. Une main gantée et blanchie par la poussière surgit d'entre les gravats et les repoussa. Sanborn put respirer, soulagé et courant vers son sergent-chef, il s'agenouilla à même le sol. De ses deux mains fébriles et efficaces, il dégagea un passage par lequel, Will se libéra. Toussotant, enlevant son casque et essuyant le sang qui maculait son front et sa tempe droite, le sergent-chef James s'affala sur le lit de débris et ses yeux bleus tournés vers le ciel, inspira, à plein poumon, un air frais et salvateur. « -Tu m'as fichu une sacrée trouille, « enfoiré »! Fit Sanborn, en donnant un grand coup amical sur l'épaule de James. Foutu veinard ! Tu as la peau dure ! » Will lui rendit son accolade par une virile « étreinte » et chancelant, encore peu stable sur ses jambes, il se redressa. Son attention exclusivement centrée sur Owen et le médecin qui avait repris les soins. Le sable se soulevant sous un brusque vent et le bruit des pales d'un hélicoptère ne l'arrachèrent pas de sa préoccupation principale : L'état de son artificier Eldrige. Sanborn, sans un mot, suivit Will qui, d'une démarche maladroite, se dirigeait vers leur camarade de combat. ….. Aussitôt l'hélicoptère atterri, des soldats, avec le brassard de secouriste et le matériel d'urgence, sautèrent de l'appareil et portant un brancard, s'approchèrent d'Owen toujours inconscient. Will, soigné par le médecin de leur unité, observait le va et vient des secouristes qui s'affairaient autour du blessé. « -Allez, petit ! Encouragea l'un deux, en préparant un culot de sang pour une transfusion. Tiens bon ! Je t'interdis de nous lâcher comme cela ! » Owen, livide et la respiration difficile, ne réagit pas aux exhortations de l'infirmier. Celui-ci échangea un regard avec l'un de ses collègues. Un regard lourd de signification. Will, remarquant cela, quitta son médecin qui protesta et marchant d'un pas assuré et décidé, rejoignit le groupe de secouriste. « -« Merde » ! Jura Sanborn, entre ses dents. Qu'est-ce que tu fous, Will ? » Il s'empressa de lui emboiter le pas, pressentant ce qui allait venir. Ses craintes se confirmèrent lorsque l'évacuation d'Owen fut stoppée par Will. Provoquant l'indignation et des cris de colère de la part des brancardiers. « -Laissez-nous passer ! Ordonna le chef des infirmiers, sèchement. Toutes les secondes comptent ! Alors, dégagez ! » Nullement intimidé et indifférent à la fureur des infirmiers, Will jeta un vif regard sur le visage d'Eldrige et lança, d'un ton nonchalant et cynique : « -De toute manière, il n'était pas à sa place, le marmot ! Son désir a été exaucé : Il voulait « clamser » ! Qu'il crève ! Comme ça, il ne nous fera plus « chier », Sanborn et moi, avec ses états d'âme à la « con » ! » Sanborn faillit explose de rage, en entendant ces mots. Empoignant Will par le col de son uniforme, les yeux injectés de sang, il l'amena à lui et martela : « -« Salopard » ! Je ne sais pas ce qui ne va pas dans ta tête ! Mais tu es infect et ignoble, là ! Je vais t'en coller une si tu continues… » ….. Un cri, d'abord faible, coupa la parole de Sanborn qui, abasourdi, se tut et se détourna de Will pour voir l'auteur de ce son. Les infirmiers, stupéfaits, virent leur patient rouvrir les yeux et reprendre conscience. « -Enfant de « salaud » ! Hurla Eldrige, tentant de se redresser sur son brancard. « Enfoiré » ! Tu ne te débarrasseras pas de moi ! Tu m'entends, Will ! Et d'abord, mon prénom est Owen ! Owen ! Non, « petit » ou autre chose ! Va te faire foutre, fils de … » Les efforts produits pour crier ses insultes et sa fureur épuisèrent le blessé qui s'écroula sur son brancard mais fusillant obstinément Will. Ce dernier, impassible, rejoignit Owen et l'exhorta : « -Finis ton discours, sale môme ! Allez, clame-nous tes plaintes et ta rengaine sur tes remords ! Fais-nous pleurer, petit ! » Owen, réunissant ses ultimes forces, agrippa Will par le col et l'attirant à lui, un filet de sang coulant sur son menton, murmura : « -Tu ne m'auras pas, Will ! Ca ne marchera plus, tes provocations à deux « balles » ! Je serai toujours à tes côtés ! Je te suivrai partout, en mission : Tu seras muté dans une autre unité ? Je serai muté auprès de toi. C'est fini. Tu ne te débarrasseras pas de moi, Will James. Je meurs, je te hante. Tu es un enfoiré, un crétin, un fou ! Un malade mais je ne te quitterai pas. Tu m'as pour l'éternité. » Un rire quasi hystérique échappant de la gorge d'Eldrige décida, finalement, les infirmiers à le hisser à bord de l'hélicoptère et à l'évacuer d'urgence. L'affrontement, surréaliste, entre Will et Owen avait déconcerté les autres G.I qui, perplexes, se posaient des questions muettes sur l'étrange relation unissant le démineur à son artificier. « -Il a fini par grandir. » Songea Sanborn, en secouant la tête. Récupérant ses esprits, il donna des ordres brefs par radio et les soldats, grimpant dans leurs véhicules, entreprirent de regagner le camp. ….. Will, pensif, observait le visage d'Owen qui le défiait du regard. Adossé à la paroi de l'hélicoptère, il n'avait pas prononcé un seul mot depuis le décollage. Son regard s'adoucit quand, presque farouchement, le jeune blessé s'empara de sa main et l'étreignit, avec force. Les infirmiers feignirent de ne pas voir le geste et l'attitude des deux militaires. S'occupant de maintenir la stabilité des constantes d'Eldrige. Une lueur de joie irradia les jolis yeux de l'artificier lorsqu'un sourire, tendre, voltigea sur les lèvres de Will. Une seconde. Mais une magnifique seconde. « -Je n'ai pas couché avec la fille de l'autre nuit. Avoua Will, dans un chuchotement et en rivant son regard à celui d'Owen. Je n'ai pas pu. Owen. » Un bonheur immense détendit les traits d'Eldrige dont une de ses joues s'humidifia d'une larme… Epuisé, Will reposa sa tête sur la paroi d'acier de l'engin volant et les yeux clos, s'endormit. L'image de sa femme et de son fils s'imposèrent dans son esprit avant que le sergent-chef ne céda au sommeil. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 5] Owen a fini par ne plus se laisser faire par Will. Celui-ci a finalement un geste de tendresse pour son artificier et amant. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 5 : Le soleil des Etats-Unis tapait dur aussi. Will, adossé contre le mur de l'hôpital militaire, vêtu en civil, fumait. Son expression, pensive et lointaine, se perdait dans le paysage urbain et paisible de la ville où avait été rapatrié et soigné Owen. La sonnerie de son portable sonna et le jeune homme décrocha, reconnaissant le numéro de la personne qui appelait. « -Will, quand reviens-tu ? Demanda une jeune femme, prenant l'initiative de la conversation. Tu es en permission depuis hier. Pourquoi ne rentres-tu pas à la maison ? » Will garda le silence une seconde et sortant une photo de sa poche, celle d'Owen et lui, dans la chambre du jeune convalescent, il finit par répondre : « -Je ne sais pas encore. J'ai affaire dans le coin. Dans deux ou trois jours, peut-être. » Sa femme demeura sans un mot, interdite et dit, au bout d'un certain temps : « -Tu ne veux pas voir ton fils, Will ? » Les doigts du jeune sergent-chef froissèrent, avec force la photo d'Owen, à la question. Posant sa tête contre le mur, les yeux clos, une lassitude sur ses traits, il soupira : « -Embrasse-le pour moi. A bientôt, chérie. Je vous aime tous les deux. » Avant de raccrocher et de se laisser glisser sur le sol. Un mal de crâne le menaçant. Une ombre lui apporta la fraicheur et cacha le soleil dont la luminosité commença à insupporter le militaire démobilisé. « -Que comptes-tu faire au sujet d'Owen, Will ? » Interrogea Sanborn, en s'installant à ses côtés. Will acheva sa cigarette, impassible et écrasa le mégot sur le trottoir, s'attirant le regard outré et désapprobateur d'une infirmière. Il inspira profondément et glissant une main sous son menton, il murmura : « -Je ne sais pas. Je lui ai promis de le venir chercher à sa sortie de l'hôpital et de passer deux ou trois jours chez lui. Puis il m'a invité à diner chez ses parents. » Sanborn perçut, nettement, le malaise et les réticences de Will à l'idée de rencontrer les parents d'Owen. Il se fit la réflexion que le petit allait trop vite. Will risquait de s'enfuir. «-J'ai accepté. » Fit le jeune sergent-chef, d'un ton dénué d'émotion. Il se releva et d'un pas vif, sortit de l'enceinte de l'hôpital. Sanborn le regarda s'éloigner, un demi-sourire sur ses lèvres, épaté et bluffé par l'audace d'Owen. … Les halos des lampadaires trouaient l'obscurité, de leur lumière fantomatique, et renforçaient l'atmosphère paisible et solitaire des rues du lotissement où s'amassaient maisons, gazons et garages. Will, le torse nu, une bière à la main, scrutait les environs de ses yeux exercés à repérer l'ennemi invisible. Il ne distingua qu'un vélo d'enfant abandonné sur une pelouse et un chat d'un voisin. Une expression, proche de l'ennui et de l'amertume, s'empara, fugitivement, de ses traits. Compagny « Bravo » avait terminé sa rotation en Irak et le sergent-chef avait été rendu à la vie civile. « -Tu ne parviens pas à dormir ? Demanda Owen, qui se leva du lit pour le rejoindre. Moi qui croyais t'avoir épuisé pour plusieurs jours… » Il enlaça son amant par la taille et plus grand d'une tête que Will, il nicha son visage sur l'épaule chaude du jeune brun. Il savoura son odeur, aimant le parfum que dégageait son amant après l'amour : Mélange de sueur et de savon. « -Non, je ne m'habitue pas à ce silence. Avoua Will, qui, doucement, caressa les cheveux d'Owen. C'est trop tranquille, ici. » Le jeune sergent-chef frissonna, sous les doigts du jeune blond qui, sournoisement, frôlait la peau de son ventre pour descendre plus bas. Il se mordit la lèvre tellement les sensations étaient exquises et affolantes. « -Pardon de ne pas habiter le Bronx. Répliqua Owen, un brin sarcastique. Je ne suis qu'un gosse élevé dans une banlieue chic. » Disant cela, il parcourut, de sa langue, la peau offerte et douce du dos de Will qui ferma les yeux, le désir embrasant ses sens. Les doigts du jeune blond, coquins et traitres, se saisirent de la verge endormie et la réveilla par de petits et brefs effleurements. Will grogna de frustration et guida la main de son amant, imprimant un rythme soutenu et rapide. La sueur parut sur son front et la langue, avide et curieuse, d'Owen la recueillit avec délice. Poussant Owen sur le lit, Will promena un regard, lent et sensuel, et un sourire, prédateur, se fit sur ses lèvres. Il s'allongea sur le jeune blond et tendrement, s'enfonça en lui. Owen gémit, commençant à perdre la tête pendant que Will, haletant, au-dessus de lui, effectuait des mouvements profonds et rapides à la fois. Alternant douceur et passion. La respiration de son amant acheva le peu de lucidité qui restait chez Owen qui se mit à crier, ses doigts se cramponnant au drap du lit. « -Will ! Plus vite ! Haleta-t-il, en croisant ses jambes autour de la taille de son sergent-chef. Oh, god ! C'est si bon…Je vais mourir ! » Il sentit à l'immobilisme de Will que ce dernier allait atteindre le plaisir ultime. Il attrapa Will par la nuque et l'approchant de lui, pria : « -Reste avec moi ! Je veux partir avec toi, Will ! » Le jeune brun, une lueur de tendresse traversant ses prunelles bleues, accéda à la supplique de son artificier. Il accrocha son regard à celui d'Owen et se fixant, de leurs pupilles dilatées, les deux hommes jouirent ensemble dans un seul cri. « -Je t'aime, Will. » Chuchota Owen, ému et des larmes sur ses joues. Will ne répondit pas, se contentant d'étreindre le corps du jeune blond contre le sien et écoutant le sang pulser à ses oreilles. Percevant le doute et la peine muette d'Owen, il murmura : « -Je t'aime aussi, Owen. » ….. Apaisé, Owen lui rendit son étreinte. Will, sentant que le jeune blond s'assoupissait, déposa un baiser sur sa tempe. Il le contempla dormir un moment et se levant, il alla au salon. Il s'affala sur le fauteuil de cuir, hésita une minute et saisissant son portable, passa un appel. « -Will ? Répondit une jeune femme, avec la voix ensommeillée. Tu as vu l'heure ? Tu ne dors… » Mais Will coupa sa protestation, en disant : « -Je te demande pardon. Je n'ai jamais su t'aimer comme il fallait et je t'ai fait souffrir. Mais j'ai compris à quel point tu comptes dans ma vie. Je sais comment t'aimer maintenant : Une personne m'a ouvert les yeux. Je vais réparer mes erreurs auprès de toi et de notre fils. » Des sanglots, bouleversés, succédèrent à la déclaration de Will dont les remords et la culpabilité, accumulés depuis sa mobilisation en Irak, le submergèrent. « -Rentre à la maison, Will. Fit la jeune femme, la voix tremblante. Nous t'attendons, chéri. » Will souffla avant de raccrocher : « -Oui, je te le promets. » … La maison familiale, où Owen avait grandi, n'était pas exactement une villa classique : Entourée d'un haut portail, comprenant parc et fontaine d'eau, la demeure d'enfance, du jeune artificier, tenait plus d'un château avec plusieurs chambres et escaliers intérieurs. Will ne sentit point déplacé, malgré sa tenue décontractée : Jean, polo et blouson. Assis sur un canapé, dans un luxueux salon, il soutenait l'examen circonspect et prudent des parents d'Owen. Celui-ci, conscient de l'attitude de sa mère et de son père, gardait sa main dans celle de son sergent-chef. « -Ainsi, c'est à vous que nous devons le retour de notre fils. Commença Mr Eldrige, sans animosité. Owen m'a raconté comment vous avez insisté pour qu'on vienne l'évacuer. C'est noble et courageux de votre part. Je vous en remercie. » Il eut un sourire chaleureux et sincère de gratitude pour le sauveur de son fils. La franchise, le sourire et la simplicité adoucirent les traits sévères et racés du père d'Owen et allégèrent l'ambiance de la pièce. La mère, posée et réservée, adressa un gracieux sourire à Will qui le lui rendit, intimidé par l'élégance et la bienveillance de celle-ci. « -Le parrain de mon fils devrait pouvoir vous épargner la cours martiale. Affirma le père, avec assurance et confiance. D'ailleurs, il vient dîner avec nous. » Voyant l'effarement et la panique, sous-jacentes, de son petit-ami, Owen eut un regard désapprobateur à l'adresse de son père. « -Papa ! Pourquoi l'as-tu invité ? Reprocha le jeune blond, un peu sèchement. Ce devait être un repas de famille ! » Le père se vit épargné une réponse par l'arrivée d'un homme qui lança : « -Parce que ton père croit toujours que tu es un gamin incapable de jugeote, à tort ! Je ne cesse de le lui répéter ! » Owen, heureux de voir son parrain, se leva et l'étreignit dans ses bras, un grand et magnifique sourire sur ses lèvres : « -Jethro, je suis content que tu aies trouvé le temps de venir ! Le NCIS n'a donc pas besoin de tes compétences d'enquêteur ? » Jethro lâcha son filleul et dévisageant le sergent-chef Will, il lui serra la main pendant qu'Owen faisait les présentations. Ses yeux bleus, vifs et aigues, notèrent le malaise imperceptible de Will et parurent lire au plus profond de ce dernier qui, cependant, ne détourna pas le regard. Will sut qu'il avait gagné le respect et l'admiration de ce Jethro Gibbs, lorsque celui-ci fit, laconique : « -Appelez-moi Jethro, Will. » …. Owen profita que son amant fut accaparé par ses parents, après le repas, pour montrer des photos de lui avec Will à son parrain. Il les fit défiler sur l'écran tactile de son mobile, les commentant et ne se lassant pas de raconter des anecdotes sur son sergent-chef. Jethro observait les photos de Will, analysant les attitudes et les poses du démineur. Pensif devant une photo, il interrompit Owen : « -Rien ne t'interpelle, Owen ? » Déconcerté, le jeune interrogé plissa le front et de l'incompréhension marqua ses jolis traits. Remarquant la perplexité de son filleul, Gibbs, avec sa franchise habituelle et son tact, déclara : « -Il réfléchit pour deux : Pour toi et pour lui. Puis, même s'il sourit, il ne me parait pas présent. » Pris par les doutes, Owen scruta les photos et dut admettre que son parrain avait su déceler une nuance d'amertume et de lassitude dans les sourires et les regards de Will. Sur toutes les photos, Will avait un geste protecteur pour le jeune blond, insouciant devant l'objectif. Ses expressions étaient, comme l'avait démontré son parrain, empreintes d'un soupçon d'absence. Owen, glacé par l'évidence, réalisa que son amant n'était pas totalement présent lors de ces instants de complicité et de tendresse. « -Il est à toi, Owen. Rassura Jethro, en voyant le désarroi de son filleul. Il ne peut qu'être à toi. Il a besoin de toi, sois en sûr. Maintenant, il s'agit de lui donner l'envie d'être avec toi. Il va falloir faire preuve, entièrement, de maturité et d'assumer ton choix. » Consterné et désorienté par les conseils de son parrain, Owen était parvenu à une seule et unique certitude : Leur couple n'était qu'une illusion. A suivre. Reviews ?[Chapter 6] Jethro a su voir le mal être de Will et donne des conseils à son filleul désemparé. Voici la suite ! Bonne lecture ! Partie 6 : Une ombre, silencieuse, portant un sac à dos, descendit le magnifique et imposant escalier de marbre et sans un bruit, avec d'infinies précautions, ouvrit la porte d'entrée. Elle allait se glisser à l'extérieur de la maison quand elle se figea sur le seuil, dans l'expectative : « -Rassurez-vous, je ne vous empêcherai pas de partir. Fit Jethro, en se détachant du recoin sombre où il s'était dissimulé. Chacun est libre d'agir comme il le veut. Vous avez fait votre choix ? » Envahi par la culpabilité, baissant la tête, Will opina doucement et après une longue hésitation, osa affronter le regard neutre et direct du parrain d'Owen. « -Je suis désolé d'agir ainsi. Avoua-t-il, amer. Mais c'est mieux pour lui. Je pense qu'il comprendra un jour. » Disant cela, il salua, d'un bref signe, Jethro dont l'expression de ses traits s'était adoucie devant le désarroi évident du sergent-chef. Sans un regard en arrière, Will quitta la propriété des Eldrige. ….. Owen ressentit un grand froid et se réveilla : Il jeta un œil absent et ensommeillé sur le parc éclairé par la Lune et son cœur s'arrêta de battre une minute. Hébété, incrédule et l'affolement le gagnant, le jeune homme constata la place vide à ses côtés et l'absence des vêtements de Will. La gorge serrée, refusant la conclusion logique de tous ces faits, il se leva, enfila un pyjama et courut vers le hall d'entrée. Là, il aperçut son parrain au bas de l'escalier et pâlit, en lisant la réponse à ses questions, dans les yeux clairs et graves de Jethro. « -Il est parti, c'est cela ? Supposa Owen, dans un souffle. Il est parti auprès de sa famille ? » La souffrance le fit chanceler et s'accrocher à la rambarde. Rencontrant le regard plein de sollicitude de son parrain, Owen se maitrisa et dévalant les marches de l'escalier, il se lança vers la sortie. Mais Jethro lui barra le chemin, tentant de le raisonner : « -Laisse-le, Owen. Parfois, il faut savoir accepter le risque de perdre pour pouvoir avoir une relation plus saine. Tu dois le laisser retourner vers sa femme et son fils. Il a fait son choix. » Plié en deux, les larmes coulant sur ses joues, Owen fixait, éperdument, le parquet du hall pendant que son parrain, compatissant, le soutenait. « -Non ! Refusa-t-il, en ravalant ses sanglots et en étouffant sa peine. Non ! Je ne veux pas le laisser disparaître comme ça ! Il me doit des explications ! lâche-moi, Jethro ! Je l'ai prévenu ! Je le suivrai où qu'il aille ! » Se dégageant de l'étreinte de son parrain, le jeune militaire prit le chemin du garage familial. La mine décidée, une lueur dure et farouche dans ses yeux, il s'empara d'un casque, s'en coiffa et enfourchant une moto, il démarra à toute vitesse. « -Tu ne te débarrasseras pas de moi, Will James ! Dit-il, une moue déterminée sur ses lèvres. « Son of bitch » ! » La moto franchit le portail, emportant Owen sur les routes. Jethro, immobile et pensif, eut un fin demi-sourire avant de regagner sa chambre. ….. Le soleil, à son zénith, chauffait le bitume des rues et le pavé des trottoirs. Des enfants jouaient au ballon et leurs cris mettaient de l'animation dans ce bout de quartier où les adultes semblaient être absents. Will, les yeux plissés, fumant une cigarette, les observait depuis un petit moment. Des souvenirs affluèrent à son esprit et le jeune homme ne put s'empêcher d'établir des comparaisons entre les ruelles désertes et brûlée par un soleil de Bagdad et la fraicheur relative du terrain de jeu des enfants. Assis sur le bitume, près de sa voiture, garée devant l'allée de sa maison, le sergent-chef songea à l'odeur de poudre, d'explosif et revoyant les bombes qu'il avait désamorcé, il tira une autre bouffée, plus longue, de sa cigarette. Inhalant profondément, les yeux clos, la fumée et en savourant le goût. S'efforçant de revivre les sensations d'ivresse due à l'adrénaline et à l'excitation des combats, en Irak. « -Enfoiré ! » Hurla une voix familière, furieuse. Un poing rageur s'écrasa sur les lèvres de Will qui, surpris, eut juste le temps d'ouvrir les yeux avant de s'étaler sur le goudron. « -Je t'avais dit que je te suivrai partout, Will ! Rappela Owen, en agrippant son sergent-chef par le col. « Fils de p…. » , j'ai parcouru la moitié de l'état pour te retrouver ! Alors, j'ai droit à des explications sur ta fuite de cette nuit! » Will repoussa son amant et se libéra de son étreinte, sans un mot. Il se releva, affrontant la fureur d'Owen qui, les poings crispés, attendait des réponses. Vif, il décocha un direct magistral au jeune blond qui s'écrasa à terre et explosa : « -J'ai accepté tes sentiments pour ton bien, sale gamin immature ! Tu as failli te faire tuer à cause de ton manque de professionnalisme ! Si tu ne parviens pas à surmonter tes chagrins, le terrain, c'est terminé ! Démissionne ! Tu nous rendras service, à moi et aux autres G.I ! » Un éclair dur traversa les yeux bleus d'Owen qui, s'approchant de Will, riposta par un coup dans le ventre et le coinçant sur le sol, entreprit, avec froideur et détermination, d'asséner des coups sur la figure du sergent-chef. Le sang gicla. « -Tu te crois le centre du monde, Will ? Articula le jeune blond, en suspendant ses coups. Je ne pensais pas forcément à toi, lors de notre dernière mission ! Alors, arrête de vouloir me protéger ou de réfléchir à ma place ! Et ne remets jamais en cause mon efficacité sur le terrain, je te l'interdis ! » Will, presqu'assommé, essuyait le sang qui s'écoulait de son nez et de ses lèvres. Scrutant intensément son artificier. Le dévisageant. Puis extirpant un papier de la poche de son pantalon, le jeune sergent-chef le tendit à Owen qui, inconsciemment, effleurait un hématome entourant l'œil de Will. « -Voici la raison. » Fit Will, simplement. … Le papier était une lettre de l'armée. Un ordre de mobilisation. L'armée renvoyait Will en Irak pour intégrer la « company » Alpha. Une mission d'une durée de 365 jours. Les deux hommes échangèrent un long regard, muets tous deux et enfermés dans leur bulle. «-Je n'ai rien à t'offrir, Owen. Finit par murmurer Will, tout bas. Rien, à part le sang, le danger et la mort. Ma vie, c'est cela : le péril et les mines. Je ne sais pas pourquoi je suis comme ça mais la vie civile, pour moi, c'est râpé ! » Il eut un rire nerveux, désabusé. Il sentit le regard interrogateur de son amant sur l'origine de l'hématome et caressant son œil, il parla : « -L'oeuvre de ma femme quand j'ai rompu avec elle. Elle a cru que je lui revenais après notre conversation au téléphone. C'est de ma faute. Je me suis mal exprimé : En fait, je regrettais de l'avoir fait souffrir et de l'avoir gardée près de moi, par égoïsme. J'ai compris que je l'aimais comme une amie et une confidente, grâce à toi. Je lui ai dit tout cela et elle m'a donné une droite. Sacrée caractère ! » Un soulagement et un ravissement illuminèrent les traits d'Owen qui, hardiment, se glissa entre les bras de Will. Ce dernier le serra, tendrement, contre lui et l'embrassa sur ses mèches blondes. « -J'irai avec toi, en Irak. Décida Owen, en rivant ses jolis yeux bleus à ceux de son sergent-chef. Tu es tel que tu es, Will. Je suis prêt à te partager avec la guerre. S'il n'y a que le péril pour te rendre heureux, je ne te demanderai jamais de choisir entre moi et tes missions. » Will éprouva une douce sérénité, en entendant les paroles de son amant. … La « company » Alpha se déploya rapidement, prenant possession des lieux après qu'une unité de soldats les eut sécurisés. Des civils irakiens se pressaient aux fenêtres et ce, malgré le danger du cadavre piégé et bourré d'explosifs. Owen acheva de faire enfiler l' « Humvee » au sergent-chef Will qui, le regard concentré, ne bougeait pas. « -Je serai prudent, Owen. » Promit Will, en percevant l'inquiétude de son artificier. Owen lui adressa un sourire courageux et cédant à une impulsion subite et irrépressible, il releva la visière du casque du jeune brun. Il se jeta sur les lèvres de son amant et l'embrassa, farouchement et passionnément, avant de le libérer. Les autres G.I, interloqués par le baiser, n'émirent aucun commentaire. « -Let's rock and roll ! » S'exclama Will, en abandonnant l'étreinte chaleureuse et pleine d'amour de son petit-ami, mais un sourire radieux sur ses lèvres. Il se dirigea, à pas lent, vers son objectif et s'enfonça dans la zone létale, silhouette solitaire, suivie, des yeux, par Owen vigilent et sur le qui-vive. Mitraillette à la main. Fin. Reviews ?

Là, une révélation : Jérémy Renner,"},{"Movie":"Prom Night","Title":"Disturbed","Author":"EternalMoonwalker95","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11663458","Passage":"[Chapter 1] So, this is my first time writing fanfiction on this site. Usually, I read but today, I decided to venture into the unknown... please don't be harsh and mean. That's all I ask. So, this fic is for Prom Night, which, imo, is an awesome movie. It is an alternate ending, I guess. Hopefully, you guys enjoy it! Donna Keppel stared at the clock. It was one minute to 4 but the second hand seemed to be stuck, simply ticking back and forth, back and forth. Eventually, it moved forward and Donna watched as it became 4 o'clock. Grabbing her bag, she looked around to make sure that no one else was up. Then again, she doubted it. After all, it was 4am and she was the only person up at that time. What she was doing, she no longer had any idea. However, something about it seemed...right. Maybe she was as disturbed as everyone else thought. After the incident years ago, she'd tried her hardest to cope and push the memories from her mind. Yet, she still found herself waking up in the middle of the night, sweat covering her forehead and out of breath. For a while, she'd struggled with the dreams following the incident. She'd woken up in the nights, panting and crying as she relived her parents' murders. But, she'd also had other dreams. Dreams which she hadn't ever told anyone about, not even the psychiatrist. After all, what kind of sick person would be attracted to the man who'd murdered her entire family? It had been easier to push the dreams and feelings away and bury them back in her subconscious, where they belonged. But, unfortunately, they had surfaced recently and she'd found herself unable to push them away. Or, maybe she didn't want to. In fact, every time she closed her eyes, she saw her naked body intertwined with Richard Fenton's. Her moans of pleasure sounded so real as he slammed his naked body against hers, grunting like an animal. The feelings that came with the dreams were all too real as well. Numerous nights, she'd woken up, panting and wet for the man who'd killed her parents. Maybe she was as messed up as everyone thought. And, she realized, maybe it was time for her to accept that. It seemed easier for her to just give in now rather than fight it. After all, her fighting it had cost so many people their lives. As she reflected, she wished that she had given into Richard Fenton earlier. It would have saved so many lives and, she no longer denied it, would have satisfied her lust for him. Because, as much as she had denied it, she had been attracted to the older man. When he'd touched her and pressed up against her, she'd wanted more than anything to moan in pleasure. But, she couldn't because society would have never accepted her feelings of lust and desire for the man who'd murdered her parents. She smiled to herself. She was even more messed up than people thought. Quietly, she opened the door and slipped out into the darkness. Looking around, she made sure that there was no one watching her as she made her way over to the van parked down the block. When she reached the van, she paused and, after taking a deep breath, opened the door and climbed into the van. \"I thought you weren't going to come,\" a deep, masculine voice said from beside her. She gave a small chuckle before replying, \"I'm done fighting you. I'm yours and you're mine.\" \"Perfect,\" Richard Fenton said before he leaned over and kissed her. She moaned into the kiss, more than content with her decision. \"Ready?\" he asked when they broke apart. Smiling, she nodded. She was definitely more disturbed than everyone else would have guessed. He turned the key and the two quietly disappeared into the night, leaving behind the life they'd both known. Wow...so that was not at all how I planned for this story to go. I started writing and it took on a life of its own. I guess I got carried away. Hopefully, you guys like it. Feel free to comment and give feedback. Just don't be nasty or rude. PS- this story was very out of character for me. I do not, for a moment, suggest falling in love with the man who murdered your parents...absolutely not.

Why she went home to her aunt and uncle, did she have any siblings, how was her prom, what about her teachers in high school, who was her favorite? For all that she could be very friendly and open, anything that reminded her of the truth made her face close off because it was impossible for her to forget. The moment her mind went back to everything she'd been through in the last few years, she could not control herself, and the best thing was to walk away. It didn't make befriending innocent, kind people in college easy, not by a mile, but her friends died because of her, her boyfriend died because of her, her family had died because they loved her too much, even when faced with– With Fenton's ferocious psychosis. Her mere existence had made Fenton obsessed with her, she thought, and being around her had gotten people killed. No, making friends after she went off to college was plenty difficult. She was across the country, as far away as she had managed to go, and no one had ever heard of the Prom Night Horrors, as the papers back home had shamelessly put it, they didn't know how one seemingly nice teacher turned into a serial killer, and because of one of his unwilling, sweet student. \"Wait, your teacher did what?\" – the first person she felt she could trust asked in disbelief – \"To your family?!\" She explained as best as she could, as best not to poke her dark memories too much, she told her all about finding her brother in his own room, about watching her mother get killed, about the way she locked eyes with her fearless mother, who confronted Fenton and gave nothing away. She wept when she got to the prom night, about the path of blood and destruction Fenton left behind in his quest to get to Donna, about the broken bodies he left for the police to uncover, for their families to bury. All because of her. Much to Donna's shock, the story spread like wildfire. Her friend, or so she'd considered her, had told one person, who told another and so on, and soon enough, she was the cursed girl, no one should come close to her, no one should be her friend, her roommate, and definitely no guy should even ask her out, someone might grab them and slit their throats in the middle of the night. Thankfully, Fenton had prepared her for betrayal and how to deal with it, so she stuck to her guns, she took her medicine when things got too stressful, she told her aunt and uncle things were fine, she was fine, her classes were going great! Life was great! It wasn't that difficult anymore to pretend she could live her life with people whispering about her, fearing even passing by her on campus, much less speaking to her more than necessary, and neither her uncle or aunt noticed anything in her voice, or at least they never mentioned it. Once college was over, with her being a good student despite the lack of friends, or boyfriends, she had to sit down back home and decided what she actually wanted to do with her life. Eventually, she went to talk to Det. Winn, the one person who had stood by her though he was the one person who had no obligation to be by her. \"Things aren't easy, huh?\" – he asked after a few minutes of talk over an actually good cup of coffee at a café near the police station. His keen eyes missed nothing when on the job, and clearly, they were just as powerful outside of it. \"No, they're not\" – she confessed for the first time. \"Kids can be rutheless, especially when they're stupid, and most kids are dumb\" \"A person is smart, people are not\" \"Learn that at your fancy school?\" \"It wasn't that fancy, and I learned it first hand\" – Winn made it easy to be honest for once, because he didn't pity her, he just nodded sympathetically. \"I can't say I'm shocked that this happened, it was a big story\" \"I... Told someone, they... Told\" – his eyes hardened for a moment. \"That definitely sucks, kid, but are you hanging in there?\" \"I'm trying\" – she attempted a smile and he chuckled. \"You are the single strongest person I have ever met, Donna, I don't think I would still be standing if I'd gone through even a tenth of what you have\" \"No, I'm not... I'm not strong\" \"Yes you are\" – he made to touch her, but quick memories of Fenton made her retrieve her hand instinctively. Winn did not react, though his eyes softened – \"Do not doubt it, kid, you are so strong, you're strong enough to survive, to live on, and you are definitely strong enough to handle anything life throws at you, so embrace it, don't bow your head, just take it in and spit it back out\" \"Have you ever thought of becoming a motivational speaker?\" \"Maybe, how do you like me so far?\" – he smiled almost boyishly, despite being maybe the most masculine man she had ever known, and she grinned back. In the end, despite her aunt and uncle's protests, Donna signed up to become a police officer. Winn supported her decision and even helped her with her tests and everything, even when other officers joked around and asked about their close relationship, which Winn was ever so quick and aggressive to refute. Donna silently wondered how they could be so callous, they were in her home town, they had to know about Fenton, they had to know that the mere thought of Winn ever– Of her and Winn– She cried herself to sleep a lot those days, but come the next day, she was all the more determined to prove everyone wrong, to prove that Winn may assist her with his kindness, but she was going to make it on her own, she was going to beat the odds and the questioning looks and do what she had to do in order to achieve her goals. \"So, cop, huh?\" – a guy she dated right after she passed her exams and started working asked – \"What made you wanna do that? You don't look like the type, your parents cops too or something?\" \"I...\" – the face of her 'friend' in college came to her, and she wondered if she could trust this man. She was an adult, they were in her home town but he wasn't from the area, he didn't know, so should she? Would his whispers and fear bother her as much as it did once? – \"I... Something happened when I was in college, and I met Det. Winn, he kind of inspired me to become a cop like him, I guess\" \"Oh. That's cool, I guess. I hope it wasn't anything bad, though\" \"What?\" \"You know, you said– Like, how did you meet this guy\" \"He... There was this thing, with one of my teachers, he– He was a little weird, and Det. Winn helped with that\" \"Huh. Good guy then, huh?\" – she sighed and smiled. \"The best\" He asked nothing more on the subject, he didn't question her lack of parents (he'd been raised by his grandfather and she didn't ask about his family background too much either), and they ended up dating for a few months until he had to move away for work. \"You upset the kid went off?\" – Winn asked gently when he found out. \"No, it's fine. He was great, really, but. I mean, he wasn't– It wasn't really...\" \"Love?\" – he said softly, and she nodded, unable to say anything – \"Donna...\" \"Please don't\" No more was said on it. He clearly remembered seeing her holding Bobby's bloodied body, he'd seen her devastation at his death, and no amount of pep talks and therapy could help her move on from her first love, and Winn got it. Donna liked him all the more for it. Eventually, Donna became a full fledged Detective, and Winn took the chance to grab her for a partner. She was happy for the opportunity to learn from such a seasoned man, and the hours they spent pouring over files and chasing down criminals was a total rush, and she could forget that he'd once cracked down on Fenton for what he did to her, to her family, her friends, and now she could help him take down other such monsters. One day, she hoped it wouldn't hurt to see a man like Fenton getting away because there was no evidence, or the law wasn't enough to put him away before he did something serious, to see a victim cry and beg for help that she could not give, according to the law, to see the aftermath of a love crime. A few years into the police force, she'd hardened her heart to blood and death, but some days, she had to curl into a ball and shut her eyes really tight to forget, forget, forget. \"It'll be okay, kid\" – Winn had told her after her parents filed the restraining order against Fenton, back when no one could've imagined he'd be capable of such violence – \"You'll see, some day, it'll all be just a memory\" Back then, she'd believed him. Years later, she didn't know if she could, but she tried. She could only try, because they were all memories, and the only way out was forward. I don't think the execution was that great, but I do like the background, this would've been a good thriller, if done right. Oh well.

When he asks her to kill an old friend she thinks that she won't be able to do it, but soon he's saying things that start to make sense in Donna's mind. Crossover – The Dark Knight/Prom Night. \"Wake up Donna.\" He whispered the words at first but when she still didn't stir he spoke them louder. \"Come on Donna. Wake up! Rise and shi iii ne.\" She twitched and suddenly her eyes started to flutter open. He covered his mouth, resisting the urge to giggle. A quiet groan came from her lips as she looked groggily around. However he noticed that her eyes quickly come to rest on the ropes that tied her arms to the wooden chair that she was sitting on. She started to panic, struggling against the restraints. Only when he laughed did she notice that there was someone else in the room. The panic that flitted through her eyes was wonderful but it was too quick for him to relish in it. He'd have to work on prolonging that panic. \"Who are you?\" she whispered fearfully. He could tell that she was taking in his face covered in black, white and red greasepaint, as well as his green streaked hair. \"You don't know who I am?\" he asked. She shook her head. He thought about it. \"Well, I guess you haven't had much chance to be watching the news recently, have you. You've been a bit preoccupied.\" Donna looked confused. \"What do you mean?\" \"Have you got a short term memory or something? Fenton?\" She flinched at the name. \"Aha, so you do remember.\" \"How do you know about him?\" she asked. \"And why the hell are you dressed like a clown?\" He ignored her questions. \"I found you in a newspaper. A very interesting story, I must say.\" He took a step towards her. \"You see, I'm not from – uh - around here. I'm from a little place called Gotham. You might have heard of it.\" She shook her head but he continued anyway. \"It's great there but there's this stupid bat that just stops spoiling my fun. I figured if I came over here then he wouldn't be able to stop me.\" \"Bat?\" she asked, obviously not having heard of Batman. \"Yes,\" he muttered distractedly. \"But who are you?\" she asked. \"I'm the Joker,\" he replied simply, almost as if it was obvious. He ran a hand through his green hair. \"You like?\" \"You're a freak,\" she muttered, rolling her eyes. He took his knife from his pocket and took a threatening step towards her. \"What was tha- t ?\" he hissed. \"Nothing.\" He grabbed onto her face and pressed the knife against her cheek. \"I'm not a freak,\" he said quietly into her ear. \"If anything you're the freak. Your mother and father were killed because of you. Oh, and we can't forget about your friends and boyfriend.\" She tried to move away from him but he grabbed her face with both hands. \"Get it into your head Donna. You're. A. Freak.\" With each word he tapped the knife against her cheek. She whimpered and he watched the fear in her eyes grow. \"Come on. Repeat after me. You're. A. Freak.\" \"You're a freak,\" she repeated insolently. He slapped her around the face with the hand that was not holding the knife. \"Don't be cheeky.\" She gasped in pain and he smiled. \"Say it. Properly.\" \"I'm a freak,\" she muttered. \"Good.\" He let go of her face and twirled the knife absentmindedly. \"So. I'm guessing you're psychologically disturbed. A young girl just crying out for attention.\" She shook her head but he ignored her. \"You just want to get revenge on the world that's been so cruel to you. Am I right?\" She shook her head again but this time she's not so certain. He leant down in front of her with the knife still clutched in his hand. \"I'm gonna give you an opportunity.\" \"An opportunity for what?\" she asked hesitantly. \"To cause some chaos. To bring a bit of madness back into the world.\" \"No,\" she muttered. \"I've had enough madness to last me a lifetime.\" \"Really?\" He tapped the knife against the arm of the chair making her flinch. \"Cos' my theory is that once you experience a bit of madness you just want more and more. It gets to the point where you can't get enough of it. You long for that small sense of madness that makes your heart race and the blood rush through your veins.\" He looked down at her face, noting the wide eyes and flushed skin. \"Like now.\" He smiled widely and rested his gloved hands on her legs. \"You're scared but you like it. I can tell.\" She started to shake her head but he grabbed her roughly. \" Don't ,\" he warned, sick of her shaking her head at him. \"Don't lie to yourself Donna.\" For a moment he thought about what to do but eventually he came to a decision. With two swift movements he cut the rope that tied her to the chair. \"What are you doing?\" she asked as she moved her wrists to get the blood flowing again. \"I'm letting you go,\" he replied simply, turning away from her. \"Why?\" \"Because I've got someone I want you to meet and it just won't be the same if you're all tied up.\" \"I don't want to meet anyone,\" she replied, standing up and stretching out her legs. He smiled. \"Oh, I think you'll want to meet him.\" He walked over to a door nearby and pulled it open. From the room came Ronnie, his face bloodied and bruised and his hands tied behind his back. Donna let out a gasp, her hand covering her mouth in horror. \"Ronnie?\" she asked, taking a tentative step towards him. He didn't have time to say anything before the Joker reached forwards and threw him to the floor. \"Ronnie... Ron,\" the Joker said. \"The only survivor of that brutal night.\" He looked over at her and grinned manically. \"Oh. Apart from one, of course.\" Suddenly his arm flicked out and she let out a yelp as a knife clattered to the floor in front of her. \"Kill him.\" Her eyebrows drew together in confusion. \"What do you mean?\" He sighed irritably. \"I mean grab the knife,\" he pointed to it, \"and stab it into Ron over there. Take out a bit of that... anger.\" For some reason she laughed. \"You're crazy. I'm not gonna kill him. He's the only one apart from me who survived.\" Suddenly the Joker was behind her, his mouth in her ear. \"Exactly.\" She tried to move away but he wrapped his arms tightly around her waist, drawing her to him. \"Why should he get to survive, hmm? What makes him so special?\" \"What makes me so special?\" she replied softly. He chuckled darkly in her ear. \"You were special to Fenton. He wanted to keep you alive. But Ronnie.\" He shook his head. \"He was insignificant. He still is insignificant. No one cares about poor little Ron.\" \"But why should I kill him?\" Ronnie was shaking his head desperately at her but she ignored him, wanting answers, wanting to know why. \"It's simple isn't it? Whose Ron lost? No one.\" \"I lost Lisa!\" Ronnie shouted out suddenly. \"I lost my friends too.\" The Joker laughed. (He seemed to do that a lot.) \"It's not the same though is it Ron? Donna lost everyone. Her family, her boyfriend, her friends. I hardly think the loss of a girlfriend can be a comparison.\" His gloved hand stroked her cheek gently. \"He doesn't know how you feel does he Donna. He doesn't know how much it hurts.\" For once she had to agree with him. Ronnie didn't understand. How could he? \"You're right,\" she said quietly, shocking not only Ronnie or the Joker but herself as well. She hadn't meant to say it out loud. \"Of course I'm right Donna. Why don't you show Ron how much it hurts? Show him what you go through everyday of your life.\" He let go of her, pushing her gently in the direction of Ronnie. She leant down and picked up the knife, weighing it in her hands. It was reasonably light and strangely felt comforting in her hands. All the while she stared at the knife she was purposely avoiding Ronnie's gaze. \"Don't do this Donna, please.\" Ronnie continued saying it over and over again and it was starting to get on her nerves. \"Shut up Ronnie,\" she all but shouted at him. The Joker chuckled darkly from next to her but she ignored him, still staring at the knife in her hands. \"But Donna,\" Ronnie continued. \"You can't do this. If your family knew what you were thinking about doing then they'd be angry wouldn't they. They wouldn't want you even thinking about it.\" She took in a harsh breath, her eyes moving to Ronnie's face. A rush of anger ran through her.\"What the hell would you know about my family? You never met them. They're dead.\" She stood up. \"Or don't you remember.\" \"Donna-\" She cut him off. \"My family are dead Ronnie and they're never coming back. What the fuck do you know, about anything?\" Slowly she started walking towards Ronnie who was still kneeling on the floor, his hands tied behind his back. She circled him, watching as his eyes desperately tried to follow her movements. She didn't know what had overcome her. This Joker man had awakened something inside her that had lain dormant ever since Richard Fenton had been killed. She wanted revenge for everything that he'd done. Sure, she couldn't kill him twice, so maybe she'd have to think of other ways to let out all the anger and rage inside of her. Ronnie seemed like a good plan. \"Do it,\" the Joker said and those single words sent Donna into a sudden frenzy. She thrust the knife forwards into Ronnie's chest, almost relishing in the noise that it made as it went through his flesh and muscle. He gave a scream but it didn't make her want to stop. Instead she carried on, stabbing him over and over. She was reminded of the time when she'd watched her mother being stabbed by Fenton but this time it felt different. She was the one who held the knife. She was the one who had the power of choosing who lived and who died. For once she was in control and she couldn't help but relish in the rush of power that spread through her. Reasonably quickly she ran out of space to stab the knife into Ronnie and so she gave up, her feet collapsing from underneath her. Blood surrounded her and her clothes and hands were covered in it. The smell was strong and made her nose wrinkle slightly in disgust yet she couldn't be bothered to move. A hand gripped her shoulder and she turned quickly, planning to cut whoever touched her but she soon found it was the Joker. He grabbed the knife from her hands and threw it to the side, before kneeling down in front of her, his hands roughly gripping her shoulders. \"Well done,\" he replied simply, grinning madly at her. She should have felt awful but Donna did the only thing that felt right at that time. She started laughing, wild whooping sounds that sent chills of pleasure through her. Soon the Joker joined in with her and together they rolled around the floor, blood covering their clothes as they laughed at the world. She felt amazing, she felt powerful, but most of all she was on top of the world and she never wanted to come down. A/N: It's not that I have anything in particular against Ronnie. It just kind of worked with my state of mind at the moment. Haha. I'm not sure whether this will stay as a one-shot or not. It depends on reviews etc. I hope you guys like it.

Richard takes Donna to the river to end it all. Richard's P.O.V \"This is it.\" My body tingled with anticipation as I held the gun tightly in my hands. \"I'm coming, Donna.\" I moved cautiously towards the school, the loud music inside causing me to cringe internally. I just needed to get her out of the school. Then it would be the end, for both of us. As if in a dream I opened the doors and stepped inside. The music grew louder but a smile filled my face. The doors slammed closed behind me. Sudden silence filled the air as the music stopped. Several shots rang out. A few seconds later the screaming started. Donna's P.O.V His arms were wrapped tightly around my wrists, his hand in my hair, as he dragged me across the ground. My legs were in front of me, trailing uselessly behind my body. My body felt far too heavy to move away from him. I couldn't feel my legs or arms. He'd injected me with something but I didn't know what. His eyes never left mine as he dragged my limp body through the woods, despite the fact he was obviously struggling. Eventually he released me, although I knew we had not reached our destination. \" I'm going to end it all, for both of us. We'll go to the river.\" I lay there, as he caught his breath. Looking down at the flowing black dress that I was wearing, I noted how torn it had become from being dragged across the dirty field. Drops of blood covered my arms. I couldn't remember whose it was. It was meant to be the best night of my life so far. My prom night. \" Come with me, please. Just come with me and I won't kill your friends.\" Tears started trickling down my face. \"Don't cry,\" he pleaded. \"Please don't cry.\" I let out a sob, tears falling down my face despite his pleading. \" You could have stopped me. I wouldn't have had to kill any of them if you'd just come with me voluntarily.\" Suddenly he was straddling me, his legs on either side of my body, his body pressing against mine. I was reminded of how he'd shot Lisa twice in the chest. \"I told you not to cry.\" In my minds eye I could see Claire's face as Richard shot her in the face. My sobs grew louder. His arms moved upwards, pressing against my wrists so I couldn't lift my hands upwards. As if I could anyway. Leaning forwards he pressed his face close to mine. I managed to turn my head to the side, not wanting the proximity. \"Don't Donna,\" he whispered harshly, his breath warm against my cheek. \"Don't turn away from me. Come on. Look at me.\" Hesitantly I turned my head, staring him straight in the eyes. Reflected in his eyes I could see Bobby and Michael's lifeless bodies after they'd been shot multiple times. \"I love you. I will always love you. You need to understand that.\" He stroked a rough hand across my cheek, wiping off my tears, before letting out a small sigh and pressing his lips softly against mine. Ronnie had been shot once through his eye socket and once in the back of the neck. I resisted the urge to gag. \"We need to go. They might find us.\" He stepped over me and grabbed my wrists once again. As we moved further into the woods the ground gradually became rougher and every now and again my feet would catch on a rock. I never made a sound, not even when I started to bleed. Soon I could hear the sound of the river in the distance. \"We're almost there,\" he whispered, leaning down towards my face. He was excited. It was at this point that he saw the blood. \"Donna!\" He reached forwards and cradled my body in his hands. His fingers wiped some of the blood off. \"It's okay. I'll carry you the rest of the way.\" He started to move faster, his feet taking long strides towards our destination. Before too long I could see the river in the distance. It was at this point that I started to feel a tingling sensation in my arm. I tried to move it but it was still not possible. I needed to buy some time. The first thing I noticed was how calm the river was. The water moved lazily, in no hurry to reach its destination. The second thing I noticed was how deep it was. It would be so easy to lose yourself in its depths. As he placed me on the river bank I found that my legs were tingling. The drug must have been wearing off. I expected him to place me in the river straight away but instead he lay down next to me, placing his hand in mine. I knew that I needed to distract him somehow. My lips managed to move and I forced myself to speak. \"What did you give me?\" It came out slurred but I knew he heard me because he flinched slightly. He didn't look at me as he spoke. \"Just a drug. Nothing you'd know about. It will wear off in an hour or so.\" I resisted the urge to scoff. \"Why did you kill them?\" \"Don't ask questions you already know the answers to,\" he snapped angrily at me. I couldn't help myself. I started to cry again. \"Stop it,\" he pleaded, rolling over to face me. \"Please, Donna.\" \"You killed my friends,\" I sobbed. Their faces flashed before my eyes, tainted with the sight of blood. My leg moved involuntarily. \"You should have done as I said.\" \"You had a gun. I was scared!\" I slowly pulled my arm out from under my body as I gained control over my sobs. \"I was as well. I understand how you felt. If I'd messed up we wouldn't be here right now.\" \"I hate you,\" I whispered harshly. \"No!\" He stood up and grabbed me roughly so that I was standing beside him. He didn't realise that he'd made a mistake in doing so. I could feel his fingers digging into my flesh as he shook my gently. I could move my body again. I used the little strength I had and pushed him harshly away from him. The action took him by surprise and despite my lack of strength he fell to the ground. I started to run. Several times I stumbled but I soon fell into a rhythm. After a minute or so I heard his footsteps behind me. \"Donna, stop!\" Suddenly a bang sounded from behind me. I came to a sudden halt and turned. \"What are you going to do?\" His voice was breathless as he stepped towards me, gun in hand. \"I don't want to hurt you. We're going to finish this together, but not like this.\" \"I don't want to die, Richard.\" The use of his name calmed him. The gun relaxed in his hand. \"Why not? You know how shit this world is. Your parents are dead. Your friends are dead. You don't have anyone else. Only me.\" \"Then why can't we be together? We'll go away. Set up a new life.\" I had no intention of ever being with him. \"Don't be stupid, Donna.\" I flinched at the anger in his words. \"I killed people. I'm a murderer, a stalker, mentally insane. We can't run from them. They'll always find this. We need to finish this.\" He stepped forwards and this time I didn't try to run. There was no point. He grabbed me around the waist and started pulling me along. The sun was starting to set as we reached the river. \"The perfect setting,\" he muttered as we stood at the river bank. He let go of my waist and placed the gun on the ground. \"I know you won't run.\" Reaching down he grabbed some stones from the floor and placed them in his pocket. \"This needs to work perfectly.\" I simply stood there, watching as he weighed himself down. When he was done he reached out his hand for me to take. I ignored it and so after a few painful seconds he stepped forwards and took hold of my hand himself. There was one thing I needed to know before the end. \"Was it planned?\" At first I thought he wasn't going to answer, but after a few moments he spoke up. \"After I escaped prison it wasn't that hard to find where you were. I didn't know it was your prom until I got here. I'm glad it was though.\" He looked down at my torn dress. \"I didn't have a chance to tell you this before but you look beautiful.\" I ignored the compliment. \"Why did you have to kill my friends?\" He became angry. \"You wouldn't come with me.\" \"You shot them because I wouldn't go with the man who killed my parents and ruined my life!\" \"I had no choice! What else was I to do?\" I couldn't think of anything else too say. I was too tired to argue with him. He smiled, knowing that the time had come. He gripped my hand tightly and pulled me along. \"This is it, Donna. The end.\" I tried to struggle against his grip but I was too weak. \"Just you and me.\" The water reached the top of my thighs as we moved further into the river. \"Together forever.\" My dress floated around my body and soon my feet could no longer touch the ground. Richard stared into my eyes as he slowly started to sink down. I wanted to let go of his hand but I couldn't. My body sank along with his. His head disappeared into the water first. I could still see his eyes staring at me through the distorted haze of water. I shivered. Taking one last breath of air I looked up at the bright red sunset before my head was submerged under water. The water was crystal clear and as we sank into its depths I stared at Richard. After all, he was the last person I would ever see. Bubbles rose above us as Richard mouthed three words at me. \"I love you.\" I was unsure of what else to do so I nodded, just once. There was something different in his eyes after my acceptance, even though I had not shared the thought. I watched as his face contorted into an expression of pain as his lungs desperately tried to take in oxygen. His body thrashed frantically several times before his body gave one last shudder and stilled. I let go of his limp hand and watched as he sank deeper and deeper into the water, until after a few seconds I could no longer see him. A pain started in my chest and I knew the same thing was happening to me. I realised that I still had a chance. I started swimming, my arms and legs thrashing desperately, causing the water to swirl dangerously around me. I clenched my eyes shut the pain in my chest worsened. I could see the bright orange sunset above me and I raised my arm, giving one last desperate push for freedom. A breeze touched my hand as it broke the surface of the water. A smile filled my face as I gave one last attempt to escape. But it was too late. Bubbles rose as the last of the air left my lungs. Even as my body tried to propel itself upwards, seeking for air, my body thrashed frantically before stilling. My body went limp and I was gone.

Lisa, and Claire had been my best friends since 2nd grade, and to be honest, I couldn't ask for a better group. The very day we got our schedules in the mail we all met up at my house to compare, and make sure that we would all be together. \"Oh my gosh, guys!\" Lisa and I stared at Claire who had just hopped off my bed giggling. Claire was an emotional person, she could easily go from being a happy go lucky gal, to a complete Debby downer. So her over execration of emotion was no surprise. \"What?\" Lisa asked. Claire sat back down on the bed and smiled. \"Check to see who we got for biology.\" Lisa and I looked down at our schedules. \"Mr. Fenton. So what?\" I asked. I've heard that he was a good teacher, but I didn't think anything special about him. \"He's so hot!\" Claire shouted. I shook my head. \"No, ugh Claire he looks like Charles Manson's long lost son with that shaggy hair and long beard.

Peoples' shadows were walking sluggishly on the winding sidewalk. The sun had set a couple of hours ago and my parents were working late, so my only option was to walk home. I hated to walk at night alone, especially in New York. I could either walk around Central Park next to the road and streetlights, or I could cut right through the center and get home quickly. I choose the quicker route hoping it would be the better option. Little did I know this was not the case. Soft whispers escaped peoples' mouths. Unnoticeably I started picking up my pace as I fixed my eyes on my apartment, about 100 yards in front of me. I heard someone walking behind me picking up their pace too, almost as if they were following me. Where they? No. They couldn't be. As soon as I get to my apartment, I would be fine. \"My mom will be home,\" I think. Questions filled my head, and I got more skittish as I heard, again, the sound of the thudding feet behind me. I turned my head and saw a tall dark shadow slide quickly behind a tree. I started sprinting along the path, leaping forward swiftly as I try to escape the horrible nightmare. My legs stretch out as far as they could possibly manage. The adrenalin engulfed my body. I turned my head around –still sprinting- and saw a tall dark figure reaching out to me. Caught up in the moment, I didn't realize that I was still running. \"I'm goanna die, I'm goanna die.\" I started thinking. My foot snagged on one of the roots and I roughly tumbled down to the ground. Everything goes… black. I feel the car speed down the bumpy road. The smell of a cigarette swirls around my nostrils. Good it was just a dream. There is no scary guy chasing me. Debating weather to open my eyes to see if my positive hypothesis was right, I peak one eye open before I could convince my self otherwise. I notice my lower body was bound in rope and my mouth covered in tape. I opened up my other eye and turned my head towards the drivers seat. A man was driving the truck. He had a hat on so I couldn't examine his face. He turned his head to me and I quickly shut my eyes hoping he hadn't seen me. \"Good morning, beautiful day out today, huh? The man talked in a deep eerie voice that oddly sounded familiar. The sun was shinning high in the sky so it had to be at least 12 o'clock. That's means –if we have been driving since night- it has been sixteen hours. My head hurt badly too. Maybe he drugged me… \"Mmm, mmmm.\" I struggled to say 'who' but it didn't come out right. I opened up my eyes, and he reached over the seat and ripped of the tape. \"OWWWWW!\" I screamed. \"Shhhhhhhhhhh\" he softly spoke in his dark scary voice. After a minute of silence I manage to choke up \"Who, Who, are you?\" I stuttered. \"Where are you taking me?\" I suddenly wished I hadn't said anything. \"You know who I am, silly! I am Nathanial King.\" He said \"and I am taking you, to…to, Paradise, and that's a promise. I don't break promises my sweetie.\" Promise. The sound of his words rang loudly in my ear. I was kidnapped. Suddenly the shock kicked in. I was stunned in my uncomfortable position, with rope bound tightly around my body. Sitting there with wide stunned eyes. I had recognized his voice after all. He was my gym teacher, Mr. King. He had always scared me. My friends had made jokes about him hitting on me. I never thought that was true though. \"Is,\" I stuttered, \"is this a joke?\" I fumbled nervously over the words. \"Is what a joke?\" he asked darkly. \"You taking me?\" I shot back. \"NO!\" he yelled. My heart raced and I jumped back in my seat at the sudden distemper. \"NO THIS IS NOT A JOKE! WE ARE IN LOVE! YOU KNOW THIS! I LOVE YOU AND YOU LOVE ME! WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD A CONNECTION!\" He yelled furiously. \"Um… Mr. King, I don't love you…\" I suddenly felt weak, waiting for the change in temper. I felt like an abused animal getting beaten by its owner. \"Call me Nathanial.\" He said brightly. I felt like I was in a horror movie. He was schizophrenic, split personality. I was shocked. \"You do love me. It just takes time for you to admit it, that's all. Ya, that's all. That's all, that's all .\" He whispered the words creepily, his hands started to shake. The car drove back and forth through the two-lane road. A red truck suddenly popped out from the turn. I screamed and tried to grab the wheel but quickly remembered the rope tied around me. \"I LOVE YOU, YOU WERE RI...\" I screamed hoping we would swerve back to the other lane. But it was to late. The car smashed directly into the other one. I jolted forward and hit my head on the dashboard. Our truck rolled off the road from the impact. And that was all I remember. \"Sweetie, sweetie?\" my mom shook me gingerly. I could hear the sadness in her nagging voice. I opened up my eyes carefully and felt the sudden pain in my head. I remembered the accident right away. \"Oh, oh my gosh!\" my mom rejoiced, \"She's awake!\" My mom looked saddened and knelt down by the hospital bed. She put her head on the bed and started balling. \"I thought you, were dead!\" she cried. She grabbed my hand and rubbed it soothingly. My dad ran into the room. He must have heard my mom cry. He stopped suddenly when he saw I was awake. He stood their shocked, and wide eyed. Deer in the head lights much, dad, I thought. I wonder how long I had been unconscious. \"Ma, ma, mom\" I fumbled hoarsely over the words. \"Yes dear\" my mom whimpered. \"How long have I been asleep?\" My throat hurt my voice got scratchier by each word. \"4 days\" she whispered. My dad regained consesness and fumbled over to the bedside. He knelt down next to my mom and wrapped his arm around her. \"The doctors said you might die! They said there was a 75% chance that you would! You hit your head so hard, they said if you lived you might have brain damage!\" She cried. After she was done her speech, we talked. We talked that whole day, about everything. Mr. King, the accident, and the night I was taken, how devastated my parent were when I didn't come home. Literally, that was the longest day most emotional day of my life. I don't think I ever realized how much my parents loved me. The scariest part of the whole story though, is that Mr. King is still on the loose. He snuck out of the car unharmed, and now he is wanted. That means he still hasn't completed the mission of taking me to paradise, and remember he doesn't break promises. ","Summary":" Wanted The night was foggy as I scurried through the city.

I love Donna Keppel. His left eye twitched as he stared at the page but his eyes seemed drawn to that single piece of paper. After all he had been working on various masterpieces all night. He grabbed another colour and started to scribble the words again. The red and black pen clashed wonderfully on the paper and so he picked up another pen, adding a dark blue onto the paper. Now that his masterpiece was complete he picked it up and stuck it onto the wall. There was no space left so he was forced to stick it over a photograph of Donna that he had previously put up. The wall was filled with photographs and drawings of Donna, as well as letters and poems that he had written for her. He was a man obsessed with a young girl who had captured his heart. She didn't even know how much she meant to him and that broke his heart. Yet still he continued to fantasize about her, thinking of how one day they would be together. He had faith and faith was a powerful thing. A/N: Found this on my computer and thought I'd post it.

Turning into a small closet she quietly shut the door and waited. Silence. Then footsteps. Slow patient footsteps getting closer and closer by the second. She felt as if her heart was going to beat out of her chest and she was so terrified that she could hardly breathe. Why does this always happen to her? What did she ever do wrong to deserve this? The footsteps were far too close for her liking and came to a stop just outside the door. She could see the shadows of the legs coming through under the door. They turned toward the door and tried turning the knob. The pounding in her ears made it impossible to hear and it felt as if her heart stopped. This was it. The door didn't open. She saw the footsteps turn to walk away and she sunk down to the floor unable to control her emotions. She cradled her head in her hands and prayed to wake up from this nightmare. Suddenly the door burst open and the silhouette of a man shown in the doorway. Her heart sunk. He stepped forward and his face became visible. Short buzz-cut hair on top of a pale gaunt face. Dark sunken circles lay underneath deep black cold merciless eyes staring straight at her. His mouth curved into a menacing smile. \"You can never hide from me, Donna.\" Shaking her head she started to cry and mutter under her breath, \"No, no, this isn't real. This isn't real. I'm safe. He's dead. He's dead. This is just a nightmare.\" \"No, this is the beginning. The beginning of our life together forever.\" He raised the knife and lunged for her and the all that could be heard was a terrified scream echoing off the empty hallway walls. Donna woke up screaming, tears rolling down her cheeks. Looking around at her room, she could still see him standing above her, knife in hand, smiling ominously. The nightmare started differently every time but always ended with him standing over her. Every time she woke up screaming. The dreams hadn't gone away since that dreadful night but they had lessened. But that didn't mean that she was any more used to them than before. She was terrified to go to sleep every night, afraid of seeing his face and the faces of the loved ones that he killed. Killed to get to her. She sat up and waited for her aunt and uncle to come into the room. Her heart was still beating erratically and she tried to make herself calm down. Raising her hand she wiped her forehead, ridding the remaining sweat that had gathered there during her nightmare. She hadn't had a dream in a week and her therapist, Dr. Crowe, said that she was very slowly but surely starting to recover from her trauma. She knew that she would be having these dreams for many years to come but she also knew that with time, a great deal of time, the nightmares would lessen to only a few times a year. The last 5 months have been hard, dealing with the grief and loss of her loved ones. Not to mention the news and publicity that the murders garnered. All the headlines came rushing back to her. 'Local Prom Teens Slain', 'Prom Night of Terror.' She, her family, and Ronnie had been hounded by the press constantly since the murders. Donna flashed back to that horrible night. 5 months ago, Prom Night Donna was outside in the front lawn as the Bridgeport police took care of the crime scene. She stood, dried tear stains on her cheeks, holding her arms around her body in an effort to warm herself. She was freezing. She felt so cold. Her Aunt Karen stood behind her holding her close. She couldn't feel her arms around her. She was vaguely aware of what was going on around her. After the incident in her room Detective Winn led them out of the house to let the police do their job. She had watched as they brought the gurney with his dead body out of the house and loaded it into the ambulance. The man who had stalked her and caused her so much pain and suffering was finally dead. She wouldn't have to live in fear anymore. But she knew that that wasn't true. She would always be afraid. There would be a constant reminder of the horror in her memories and dreams. Bobby's words to her flooded into her brain and her eyes immediately filled with tears. \"There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.\" She was stupid to believe him. He was dead. Killed not one foot away from her and she didn't hear a thing. Three of her friends are dead. Her mother, father, and little brother all dead by the same man who was obsessed with her. All of this death was her fault. She was the reason for all of the people that she loved being dead. Ronnie had shown up shortly after they were escorted outside and he told her about Lisa. They cried and held each other for what seemed like forever. They were all that was left of their once great group of friends. He stayed with her for a half hour then left to go home. Detective Winn walked over toward them and nodded softly. He put his hand on Donna's shoulder and told her that everything was going to be okay now and that he would take care of everything. \"Where are we going to stay for the night?\" her uncle Jack asked. \"We can get a room for you at a hotel or if you have somewhere that you think you could stay for a few nights you could go there. You can go gather some of your necessities and we will drop you off there.\" Present Time Her aunt and uncle rushed into the room and immediately pulled her into their arms. She didn't know what she would do it she didn't have them and Ronnie. They were the only reason that she was hanging on. \"Sweetie, are you okay? Did you have another nightmare? I knew we should have moved after all this.\" \"No, no, it's okay. I'm fine. I'll be fine. I'm just sorry that I woke you guys up again. You aren't getting any more sleep than I am.\" \"And that's the way that it should be. We are always here for you no matter what. I don't care if it's at 3 in the morning.\" Donna smiled weakly and nodded her head. \"Now try and relax. Try to rest. We have a big day ahead of us today. Are you sure you want to go ahead and start school? They would understand if you needed a little more time.\" \"Yeah, I'm sure. I'm ready to get back to normal. I know it won't be easy but I need to start sometime.\" 'And it's what all my friends would want me to do. Enjoy my life as much as I can,' she thought. The thing was she just always figured she'd have all of them to enjoy it with. Fin .

I grabbed the remote from my bedsidentable and clicked the power button, making the television screen gonblank. Inglanced around my dark room. The only light was the light from thenstreetlights outside. Bobby was lying on my bed, his chest rising andnfalling from each breath he took. I glanced toward the window, andnslowly walked over. I rested my hands on either side of the glass,nand looked at the street below. My eyes slowly fell over DetectivenNash's car, lighted by the bright headlights of the police car. Henlooked like he was sleeping; his head was resting on the dashboard,nhis hands still on the wheel. Inmoved away from the window and walked into the bathroom. I lookednmyself over in the mirror. My hair was tangled and clothes rufflednfrom sleeping. I looked back up and raised my arm to open thencabinet. I grabbed my depression pills and filled the square cup onnthe sink with water. I slowly gulped down the pills, feeling the coolnwater seep down my throat. Anlittle voice in the back of my head was bugging me., I suddenly hadnthe strange feeling that someone was watching me. I looked back atnBobby on the bed; he was still asleep. Inshook off the feeling and placed the cup back on the counter. I shutnthe cabinet, looked up, and screamed. Standing right behind me wasnthe man who had murdered my family and friends: Richard Fenton. Indidn't even have time to think before he smashed my head forwardninto the mirror. Inscreamed and quickly sat up in the bed. \"Shh,nbabe what's wrong?\" Bobby asked, sitting up and rubbing his eyesnas he tried to sooth me. \"You'll wake your aunt and uncle.\" Inlooked at him, the bathroom, then back to him. I finally got my voicenback, and spoke. \"Nothing,nI just had a bad dream. He was back, in the house I mean, and he w….nhe was in the bathroom. It was only a dream though; he couldn'tnhave escaped from that hotel. It was armed at all exits. I'mnprobably just over reacting,\" I said to him, leaning against hisnchest as he rubbed soothing circles on my tense back. \"You'rennot over reacting. You just went through another horrible experience,nand your brain needed time to comprehend it. That resulted into annightmare. Your fine though, I promise,\" he said quietly into mynear. AllnI could do was shake my head. After a couple minutes, I broke thencomfortable silence between us. \"Donyou think everyone's okay? I just feel horrible about Claire,\" Insaid on the verge of tears. \"I'mnsure everyone's fine. It's not your fault Claire was murdered; itnwas that maniac's. At least she's in a better place now.\" AllnI could do was nod. A couple more minutes passed before I stood upnand said, \"I have to use the bathroom.\" Bobby nodded his head andngot up as well. \"I'llngo use the one across the hall, seeing how two people can't use onenbathroom,\" he said with a wink. I let out a small laugh, stillnfrightened from my nightmare. Bobbynlet my hand slip and started to walk toward the door. My hand feltnlonely without his grip. I heard a small sound and glanced at thentelevision. It was still on, seeing how my dream state couldn'tnhave turned it off. I grabbed the remote from my bedside table, andnclicked the power button, once again causing the television screen tongo blank. Across the hall, I heard Bobby shut the bathroom door. Inlet my eyes fall from the hall and over to the window again. I walkednover and quietly put my hands on either side of the window, and letnmy eyes fall onto the street. Detective Nash was sleeping, just likenhe had been in my dream, with his head once again on the dashboard,nand his hands on the steering wheel. This was starting to creep menout, and the hairs on the back of my neck rose. Inwalked over to the bathroom, and this time closed the door half way,nso I could still see outside. I looked at the mirror, and it was likenI was in my dream again; my hair was tangled and my clothes rufflednfrom sleeping. Inopened the cabinet silently and grabbed my depression pills. I tooknthe square glass from the sink, filled it up with water, and gulpednthe pills, and once again felt the cool water slide down my throat. Ansecond feeling was coming over me, a stronger feeling than in myndream. A feeling of someone in the room with me, but I knew thatnBobby was still in the bathroom across the hall. I hadn't heard thendoor open. I looked back at the open cabinet. 'Okay, the time ofntruth,' I said to myself silently as I put my hand on the edge ofnthe cabinet door. I braced myself as I slammed the cabinet door shut,nand looked through the mirror. Inbreathed a sigh of relief when I saw that no one was standing there.nMy shoulders instantly relaxed as I heard my bedroom door open, shut,nand lock itself. I was utterly confused. I hadn't heard thenbathroom door across the hall open, or was I just hallucinating? \"Bobby?\"nI called, but I didn't get an answer. I slowly shut off thenbathroom light and went to go lay on my bed. I turned on my bedsidenlamp, and went to throw back the covers when a streak of red caughtnmy eye. I looked at the end of my bed and screamed at the sight:nThere was a bloody handprint on my bed cover. I slowly backed awaynuntil I hit the half open closet door. \"Whatncould have caused that to be there?\" I asked myself. I instantlynglanced down at my hands, seeing how clean they were. Bobby hadn'tntouched my bed when he had walked out of the bedroom either. Slowlynrealization hit me, and I screamed. Intried to run to get out of the room, knowing that he wasnhere. Before I could make it halfway across the room, someone grabbednme from behind. I tried to scream harder, but Fenton put his hand onnmy mouth, muffling my frantic calls. \"Shh,\"nhe said, causing me to stop screaming. The smell of blood hit mynnostrils, and I looked down to see a knife sticking out of the handnthat wasn't over my mouth. It was covered in blood, most likelynClaire's blood. I tried to scream again, but Fenton pushed hardernon my mouth with his hand. \"Shh!\"nhe said again. I didn't hear anyone outside of my door. Silentntears were now starting to stream down my face as I tried to figurenout an explanation for my house being so silent, but only one came tonmind, and I didn't want to think about that. \"Arenyou going to come with me now, quietly?\" Fenton asked. Of course Inwas never actually going to, but for my family and Bobby's sake, Inhad too fake it. So I nodded my head. \"Good,\"nI heard him say, and he quietly opened my closet door. All was quietnand dark in my bedroom. It was too quiet. I should be hearing mynaunt, uncle, and Bobby's footsteps running toward my bedroom, but Indidn't. Realizationnhit me as I figured that could be the only explanation for them notncoming. They were all dead, but I knew I could not give into Fenton,nand that I had to get away. I had to do it for my family and Bobby.nMore silent tears dripped down my cheeks as he pushed me out in frontnof him. But Fenton hadn't made two steps when I bit hard into hisnhand. \"Ouch!\"nhe yelled, and his grip let me go. Inbolted for the door, but he stuck out his foot and I tripped. Instruggled to get away from him, kicking my feet through the air, andnclinging to the carpet, trying to get away. Fenton flipped me overnand stood directly over me, his knife held over my heart. My eyesnwidened as I realized what he was about to do: he was threatening me. Inthen heard the happiest sound of my life: footsteps outside my door. Fentonnlooked scared for a moment, and then he snapped out of his revere. Henstarted to pull me up, but someone kicked in the door, causing it tonfly on its hinges. I twisted my head around to see Detective Winnnholding out his gun. Bobby and my aunt and uncle were standing behindnhim, all looking terrified. \"Freeze!\"nDetective Winn shouted, putting his finger on the trigger of his gun.nFenton made a movement to pull me up, but the gun was fired, and Insaw Fenton freeze. The smell of blood once again filled my nose asnDetective Winn shot three more times. Fenton was wide eyed now, andnhe slowly started to fall forward, knife still aimed at my heart. Inrolled over just in time, and he hit the floor face first, the knifenflying out of his hand. DetectivenWinn walked over to him, gun now in his belt. He nudged him over andnthe glassy eyes of the man that had been after me for years were nownlifeless. I ran toward Bobby and he caught me in his arms. I criednmore into his chest, happy to see him alive. I don't know what Inwould have done without him. \"Shh,nhe's gone now. He won't be bothering us anymore,\" Bobby saidnquietly into my ear. DetectivenWinn walked over and said, \"Well have the officers outside to comenget him. At least it's all over now; that was some wild goose chasenhe gave us,\" he then walked out of the room without another word. \"Comenon, lets get out of here,\" Bobby said, tugging me with him. Inslowly followed him out of the room, taking one last glance atnFenton. It was over, he was now dead forever. I finally had my lifenback. Thisngave me the happiest feeling of my life. I hadn't been this happynsince before my family had been murdered. I was so happy that Inlooked up, and caught Bobby in a kiss; he kissed back, and it was allnover. So,nwhat do you think?

It's just that I keep finding new things that I can write about. There's so much to explore with this movie. Anyway here's an insight into Donna's thoughts and feelings on Richard Fenton, as well as what happens after 'Prom Night.' 'I hate Richard Fenton and I'm glad that he's dead.' I'm not ashamed to say these words because it's the truth. He killed everyone that I loved. My mother, father, brother, friends, boyfriend. To put it simply he took everything and ruined my life. He thought that he loved me but worst of all he thought that I loved him. How delusional could he have gotten? Nothing I did indicated that I liked him, let alone loved him, and yet he killed my family because he thought it would mean that we'd be together. Then, when I finally thought that I'd gotten rid of him he comes back, on my prom night of all days. He kills my friends with no thought. It's like they're just mere distractions to him. When I saw him in that hotel room it felt as if all my worst nightmares were coming together in that one moment. Just seeing his face made me shiver with fear. I did what I had to do when he found me. I hid and I ran as far away from him as possible. When I found Detective Winn I thought that I was finally safe. I thought that it was all over. They'd find Richard and lock him up. Maybe they'd even give him the death sentence. Of course he had to shatter that facade as well. However when I arrived home with Bobby I felt safer knowing that there was a police officer outside the house. His name was Nate and he seemed nice. I didn't know that he was going to die. My heart broke when I found Bobby with his throat cut. Those footsteps coming towards my room scared me so much that I did something stupid. I shut myself in a cupboard with Richard Fenton. Of course I didn't know that he was in there. I thought that he was the one walking towards my room but I found out that it was Detective Winn. For the third time that night I felt safe as I saw the Detectives face. However Richard had to ruin that as well by being in the cupboard with me and covering my mouth, stopping me from shouting out to the Detective. I felt so scared as he whispered for me to be quiet. I hated the proximity of him and the fact that in his hand he held a bloodied knife that had obviously been used to kill Bobby and my other friends. I wasn't going to willingly go with Richard however, not after everything that he'd done to my friends. So I bit him and ran out of the room, trying to escape and warn the Detective who'd walked out of the room. When he grabbed me I thought that it was all over. I thought that he was going to stab me. He was that angry. However he never got the opportunity. As the gun shots rang through the room and Richard collapsed to the floor dead I knew that it was all over. I could finally forget about this terrible experience. It turns out that things aren't as easy as that. After Richard was killed my life became harder then I'd ever expected. Four teenagers had been killed. Two hotel staff members had been killed. One police officer had been killed. And all in one night by one man. The press had a field day. Richard Fenton had already been in the newspapers before and people recognised the name. However they also recognised my name. I became famous for having survived his 'rampage.' I hated seeing my name in the papers because I felt that they should be concentrating on the families of the people that were killed. For a while the press even started to hang around outside my house, trying to get an interview or a picture of me, but within a few days the police got involved and managed to stop them coming near the house. I was glad for that. I hated the attention. The only thing that I now have reason to be grateful for is that I still have my Aunt and Uncle. They've been such a big help to me and have shown so much support. If they'd been killed then I know that I would have simply given up because I'd have no reason to carry on. After all of the bad things that have happened to me I know that I have to try and be positive. It's hard but then again I never expected it to be easy. Some days aren't good. Some days I just cry for hours. On these days I don't talk to anybody, I don't eat and sometimes I don't move. However these days are becoming far and few between. Now I try and get on with life and make the most of it because I know that's what my family and friends would have wanted. Richard's gone now. I can finally live my life in peace without the constant worry of him coming to get him. I'll never forgive him for what he's done, even if he is dead. What he did was wrong and I know that he deserved to die. There's not a doubt in my mind. But now I'm moving on with my life and I know that things can only get better.

He constantly turns his head looking around, lingering on the thin stream of light from under the door. He has a slight twitch: sliding his jaw from side to side, to show he is agitated. There is a spotlight on the man. I shouldn't be here I shouldn't. Shouldn't. Should not. I need to be listened to, be understood. Should I be here? No, should not be here. This isn't the right place. I panicked, got frightened, but not here no this isn't right. I JUST NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME! Listen to me. She listens to me. She'd listen to me. She knows I shouldn't be here. She would if they'd just let me call her. WHY WON'T YOU LET ME CALL HER? She's probably worried sick. Doubtless they've told her the story doubtless they've told her their story. My Scarlett. Oh God I hope she's all right. LET ME CALL SCARLETT YOU SICK EVIL-I need my pills I need them I need my pills I need to calm down. Doubtless they don't have my pills doubtless they didn't think of that when they dragged me here. I shouldn't be here I shouldn't SHOULDN'T BE HERE SHOULD NOT! The lights come down quickly then back up. The man is in the same position. I've taken some pills and I'm all right now. Yes, fine now. I just worry about her, I worry about what she's doing, if she's OK. I'm talking about Scarlett, by the way, my wife. I think we've been married, err, three years now? Yes, yes, that's right, and together a year before the ceremony. She's everything I could ever wish for, you see. She's beautiful, really quite hilarious, a sweet girl. She calms me, too. I haven't needed my pills as much since we got together. Sometimes I get a bit sad, a bit upset sometimes, so I take a pill. Don't worry though I'm fine. Scarlett really helps me, soothes me. I don't have any 'embarrassing episodes' anymore. I think I can safely say I'm healed. Well, almost, there was that one little blip that landed me in here- LET ME OUT I JUST NEED TO TELL MY WIFE I'M HERE! I wish they'd see reason. How am I going to sort this out if they won't let me call my wife? It's my fault, really. I shouldn't have been so stupid; security is always tight on sets. I didn't say my Scarlett is an actress! She's very good, but more popular over in America. She spends most of her time over there, but I don't mind not seeing her as often as I would like. She's doing what she loves; I can't fault her for that. I can't fault her for that. Pause. I just miss her so much. Light goes down slowly, and then back up with the man again in the same position. The walls of the room are covered in writing and scribbles. The man seems quite angry. The Idiot Doctor took my pen off me. He says graffiti is a crime and we do not tolerate it here at Oakside. I only wanted to make it more homely. I didn't say that, though. He took my pen off me. He took my pen off me. DOES HE HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM? LET ME OUT! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM? No. No they don't. Pause. I didn't tell my parents about Scarlett. They'd look down their noses at us if I did. I love her you know I do. I want to see her so…badly. It's been so long. WHATEVER YOUR GAME IS! They'd think I'd gone mad if they saw us together; me and an actress. \"No future with one of those people, a dead end!\" Well, I suppose they wouldn't find out. Not a word. In four years. Not after the worst episode. The worst episode, HA! They call that the worst one, when it was that bitch's fault anyway? Pathetic. Do these Doctor's know anything? Pause. If she didn't want me to she shouldn't have made all those signs. If that…that whore hadn't made me think what I thought…if she hadn't pressed charges…I…LET ME CALL MY WIFE! PLEASE! Please… The lights come down slowly, and come up on the man standing to the side of the cell door, twitching almost constantly and flicking his head from the door to around the room. When he speaks, he speaks in a whisper. I know why I'm here now. It's so obvious, I can't believe I didn't think of it before they haven't given me my pills for weeks and not let me speak to my wife and I know why I'm here I know it. Conspiracy. My wife is so beautiful so attractive in every way shape and form and she is in circles and circles are always a bad place to be for attractive wives especially for their husbands conspiracy I tell you conspiracy.

Shouldn't be here though prison not asylum not Oakside where's my pen where's my wife WHERE ARE MY PILLS I NEED MY PILLS MY PILLS OR I'LL…I'll…Oh God… The lights go down, and then come back up on the man completely focused on drawing on the walls. He is beaming and jiggling his leg up on down as he sits on a chair facing the wall. They gave me my pen back. They gave me my pills, my pen, not my wife but still that will do for now. Paper too, but that doesn't matter right now does it? Don't need paper, I don't need paper, thank you very much, Oakside Mental Asylum, I'll just use your walls! He cackles wildly and starts on a cleaner portion of the wall. Throughout this next speech he continues to draw on the walls without pause. I wonder if Scarlett's finished filming, I tell you she's a wonderful actress. In fact, the paper will come in useful, I can write out her filmography. 'Girl with a pearl earring', 'The Other Boleyn Girl', lots of things. I'll write out her full name, actually. Scarlett Johansson spelt J-O-H-A-N-S-S-O-N. She kept her maiden name when we married, for the fans, you know. She's so good. I'm so lucky to have her. My beautiful wife. My beautiful, beautiful wife. I used to be so lonely, so broken after what the other girl did to me, but now I've found her I feel complete. The ache has subsided and even the voices have quietened. But I can feel them gnawing away at me in here, away from her. They'll kill me, they've told me so themselves. If I can get to Scarlett in time, I think I shall be saved. So I will. I'll get to her any way I can, even if I have to kill more than my fair share of security guards. I'll do what I can, because I love her. I love her.

Her beauty had been the first thing that had stood out to him, but he soon found out that her personality was as beautiful as she was. It seemed impossible that someone of such beauty could have such a kind and loving personality but here was the proof, sitting in front of him. Last night he had taken her from her bedroom. She had screamed, struggling against him but she was weak, far too weak, to even try and escape his grip. Once locked in the trunk of his car he couldn't even hear her screams over the loud music that he played. Had he meant to scare her? He was not sure, but it was too late for regrets now. She was currently sat in a chair in front of him, with her delicate arms tied behind her back and a piece of fabric over her mouth. If she'd cooperated with him then he would've had no need to restrain her, but the moment he had taken her from the car she had lashed out at him and tried to escape. Her attempts were futile however, just as they were when he was at her house. Once again he reached forward, wanting to touch the beauty before him. Even though she had been crying and her face was filled with fear, he still found her heartbreakingly beautiful. \"Donna. I want to talk to you. If I take the gag off I want you to promise me that you won't scream. Do you promise?\" he asked her softly. She nodded so he reached forward and removed the fabric from over her mouth. As if she had not been able to breathe she took in deep breaths. \"What do you want?\" she asked breathily, as soon as she was able to talk. He cocked his head to one side, smiling slightly at her confusion. \"Is it not obvious my love? I want you.\" \"Me?\" \"Of course.\" Could she truly not see the love that he felt for her? He thought that it was glaringly obvious. \"I love you Donna, and have done ever since I first met you.\" A loud laugh came from her rose coloured lips and he flinched back slightly, shocked. \"You love me? You barely know me,\" she said. \"Donna, no!\" He was shocked. \"What does it matter how much we know about each other? I love you. That's all that matters.\" \"But I don't love you.\" The words ripped into his very soul, but he did not let it show. He'd known that this might happen. Of course she would try and deny it. Love was a confusing feeling. \"Of course you love me my beauty. Think about it.\" \"There's nothing to think about. I hate you. It's simple as that.\" Her words were calm and uncaring. He leant forwards until he was directly in front of her and she could not move away from him. \"Do not say things that you will regret my love. When the end comes you will love me more then anyone else you have ever known before.\" \"The end?\" He was glad to hear the fear that crept into her voice. \"Yes Donna, the end.\" Before she could say anything else, he picked up the piece of fabric from the floor and placed it back over her mouth. If she continued to talk then she would just start to anger him, and he did not want to feel angry towards her. \"I'm going to pick you up and place you in the car next to me Donna,\" he explained as he reached forward and took her in his arms. It was awkward because of her arms being tied behind her back, but he still found it incredibly comforting to have her in his arms. She fitted perfectly and her familiar scent of vanilla surrounded him, making him sigh in pleasure. Carefully placing her in the passenger seat of the black Nissan he closed the door behind her before getting into the drivers seat. \"Are you excited? I'm excited. Nervous, sure, but mainly excited. We'll be together at last.\" He patted her knee lightly at these last words, but she flinched away from him and he frowned. \"Stop being silly Donna,\" he scolded. He started up the car and pulled out of the garage, into the empty road outside. \"I know the perfect place. It's so romantic there. You'll love it. We'll stop so you can look around beforehand.\" He continued talking to her like this, as they drove down the motorway that he had just turned onto, at over seventy miles an hour. It wasn't long until they reached the docks. \"Final destination,\" he said, laughing at his joke. However as he looked over at Donna he stopped mid-laugh. Tears were streaming down her face and her whole body was shaking with fear. \"Oh, sweetie,\" he whispered as he wrapped his arms around her in an embrace. \"Don't be scared. It'll all be over soon and you won't have to worry about anything ever again.\" As he let go of her he looked across the water and took in the beautiful scenery before him. The lights from the dock were glittering and shimmering off the sea below them. In the distance he could see the skyscrapers of New York City. The glow and buzz of the city made him smile, as he realised that he would never have to see it again. He preferred the peace and quiet of the countryside, instead of the rush and bustle of living in a town. \"This is it Donna. Till death do us part. Just you and me, together forever. There's no need to be scared. What awaits us is better then anything that this pathetic world could have granted us. \" He turned around to face her and was pleased to see that she had stopped shaking, although she still looked scared. \"One last kiss before the end,\" he said. Slowly he pulled the fabric down her face, so that her lips were uncovered. Before she had the chance to speak or stop him he pressed his lips against hers. She did not kiss him back but she did not pull away either, for which he was grateful. \"I love you Donna never forget that,\" he said, before pressing down on the accelerator. The car shot forwards at an incredible speed. Somewhere at the back of his mind he was aware of Donna screaming, but all he could concentrate on was how exhilarating this experience was. Suddenly the world was tilting, and as he looked forwards he saw that they had gone over the edge and were now plunging towards the water. As they hit he could not hear the splash, but he knew there must have been one. Donna was desperately struggling against the rope that bound her as they started sinking, but he knew that she had no chance of escaping. He had checked that the ropes were tied as tightly as possible. He gasped as the cold water started seeping into the car, as they sank deeper and deeper into the lake. Within a minute or so he was up to his waist in water and his body was starting to go numb from the temperature of the water. He would never have expected the water to be this cold, especially in the middle of February. Donna was thrashing about desperately and he would have told her to stop if the water level had not suddenly reached his head. He coughed and spluttered as he inhaled a large amount of water. Looking over at Donna he saw that she too was now breathing in water instead of air. He watched, fascinated, as the water reached up past there heads and they sank deeper and deeper into the water. If it was possible Donna looked even more beautiful underwater. Her skin had a luminous glow about it and her blonde hair was floating around her head like a halo. She looked like an angel. Together they gradually started to struggle for oxygen and they both thrashed about, their bodies desperate for oxygen, but it was too late. He watched as she thrashed about, one last time, before all of a sudden going still. Her mouth was open and her arms were limp and he couldn't help but think that she looked more beautiful then he could ever imagine. Before the darkness could take over he sent up one last prayer, \"I love you Donna, forever and always.\" Then the darkness overwhelmed him and he could think no more.

A mali estremi, estremi rimedi Chapter One The irony was he'd planned to tell her in Rome. Tell her that he knew about all the lies, the cheating and the affair. That he knew about the lover in Prague. That he knew about the little nest egg she'd started squirreling away in a Swiss bank account the year their son was born. That he knew. All of it. He knew it sounded cruel. And maybe it was. But he didn't see it that way. Not with his motivations anyway. He could never be as cold hearted as her. Not even if he wanted to. They'd been planning the trip for over a year, back before the tapestry of lies and deceits had started unraveling around him. Back before he'd had even so much as a hint that his marriage – in spirit, if not in name – was effectively over. For him it had been a visit home, a chance to unwind and breathe that singular Roman air. A chance to show his son the place of his birth, to have breakfast in the family villa built into the cliffs overlooking the sea in Sorrento, to show his son the secret coves he'd discovered as a child. To have his wife and son at his side as he took a much needed vacation, his first since his promotion three years ago. Only she'd gone and ruined that. Slowly. Methodically. And deliberately. He'd seen it as the last family vacation his son would ever have – with the three of them together - and wanted to make it memorable. In spite of the hurt he wanted to create something that would last. Something his son could look back on with a smile rather than tears and frustration. A happy time. He planned to tell her at the end of the trip. Somewhere public, somewhere she couldn't make a scene. Maybe a nice restaurant or one those fashion boutiques by the waterfront she was so fond of, while Susanna – their nanny - took Stefan to the park. Somewhere she'd be forced to behave, to keep that glacial, simpering smile plastered across her face, pretending that everything was fine as he handed her the papers. She'd always cared so much about appearances, about society and the opinions of others that he knew he'd be safe from the fall out. Too bad she'd never taken his into account. He couldn't, in good conscience, deny that watching her force down the urge to rage and scream would have been satisfying. He wasn't without faults of his own, after all. But mostly, he just wanted it over. Done . He'd planned to make it easy – a clean break. He was going to let her have the house, the brand new car he'd bought her last Christmas when he figured they still stood a chance at making things work - even the time share in the South of France. On top of it, he was only going to fight for partial custody – with this son spending equal time between them. His lawyer had suggested seeking full custody, reminding him that with his connections and the evidence of Claire's affair, it would be all too easy; but he'd refused. With his job that wasn't fair. Not to Stefan. Not to any of them. Besides, if his wife had one redeeming quality, it was the deep, abiding love she had for their son. She might have been an awful wife and a terrible human being, but for all that, she was at heart a great mother. And at the end of the day, fantasies of revenge aside, the level of cruelty necessary to strip mother from son was simply not in his nature. The English have a saying for best laid plans. So do the Italians. It is said God openly mocks them. A/N #1: Thank you for reading. Please let me know what you think!

A mali estremi, estremi rimedi Chapter Two They say India was a black hole. If it was, Rome was worse. He barely made it out of the city alive. The only reason he got as far as he did before the Carabinieri caught up with him – holed up in a back alley behind a dumpster with nothing more than a bloody two-by-four and the clothes on his back - was because of Susanna. She'd picked him up, dragging him away from the writhing pile his son and wife had disappeared under, pinching and slapping at his face when he reeled, sending them pitching dangerously down a narrow incline, a grassy knoll under a bridge and- It'd happened so fast. There'd been no time. No time to run. No time to hide. No time to- They'd been walking down one of the more affluent streets. Stefan had been in his arms, limp and ready for his afternoon nap. He'd been rocking from side to side, even-keeled and content, killing time as his son snuggled into the curve of his shoulder. Claire had been window shopping. Or at least that was what she'd called popping in and out of every other shop along the strip - high heels click-clacking sharply - burbling and overall rather pleased with herself as she emerged with yet another flashy little bag and a triumphant expression. \"Just a few more minutes,\" she promised, kissing him on the cheek in a whirl of sweet smelling perfume and airy chiffon, the mound of bags at his feet only growing in size with every passing moment. But he'd barely batted an eye. By Claire's standards she was only just getting started. Susanna had just sighed, long-suffering and bored, fiddling with the stroller from her perch on the park bench as she looked off towards the city center, steel-grey curls rippling in the brisk, sea-borne breeze. He noticed the smoke the same moment the screaming started. He lost Susanna twenty minutes later to a mob that came screaming down a side street. Twelve seconds. That was all it took. All it took to erase over a million years of evolution. To turn a sweet, mild-tempered old lady into an animal - a predator – a thing. It had twisted her, twisted all of them, turning human features animalistic and drawn, reducing them to basic drives and instincts. But it was more than that, it was driven - targeted . But there hadn't been anytime, no time to stop, observe, learn - understand . All he could do was run. He managed to pull them into an abandoned car park, mossy cobblestones littered with briefcases and shoes - like whoever had been wearing them had run right out of them. But by then she was already twitching, fingers clenching, spasming and screeching as the virus – because it had to be a virus – took hold. There'd been nothing he could do. Nothing. Oh god, Stefan. His boy. He was gone. Gone like his mother. Gone like- She chased after him with the snap-snap of ivory-coated veneers, hands outstretched and bloody. She was wearing the watch they'd gotten her last Christmas. The one Stefan had been fascinated with from the start. Holding it solemnly in his pudgy hands from his seat on the soft carpet, as careful and delicate as any four year old could be as he watched the diamonds catch the light. Susanna had laughed, telling him that each one was a captured star. And that every time one of them twinkled, that meant that somewhere, a wish was coming true. She'd cried the day they'd given her that watch. Sobbing into trembling hands, telling them – between happy tears and overwhelmed flappings of her wrist – that it was the best thing she'd ever owned. He remembered dodged around a pillar, tripping and stumbling as he slammed into a parked car, a railing, nearly falling over a lone Stiletto heel. He pelted through the cause-way, lost, panicking, the screams of the undead ringing in his ears like an unearthly chorus, amplified by the acoustics in the underground garage. He exploded out the nearest door – the one labelled uscita - and into a narrow alleyway. There was a fire escape to his left, rickety and sharp enough that it practically screamed tetanus , but he threw himself at it regardless. Sweaty hands swiping at the rungs as he took the raised ladder with a rebounding leap, pulling himself up as the thing that'd once been his son's caretaker, a close friend, slammed through the door behind him, growling. The sound of her teeth grazing across exposed metal – only millimeters shy of where his ankle had been a second ago - made his teeth ache in sympathy. A/N #1: Thank you for reading.

A mali estremi, estremi rimedi Chapter Three He managed to get a call through to the office in Cardiff before the lines went down. He'd been lucky. Lucky that the fire escape had led to the roof. Lucky there'd been a pile of construction equipment stacked by the locked hatch that led back down into the building. Lucky that the two-by-four he'd swung had connected with the side of Susanna's head as she snarled, clutching and snapping at the ledge as she tried to force unruly joints and stiffening sinews to clear the rest of the ladder. Lucky the distance between his roof and the next had been easily jumped, lucky that he was flagged down three buildings later by a man with a butcher's knife and a bloody apron. \"Peter!\" He didn't recognise his voice as he yelled into the receiver, practically able to feel his battery draining – percent by percent - as he stuck a finger in his free ear, trying vainly to hear through the static as the sound of distant explosions rolled. A swan song to history as Rome tore itself apart around him. \"It isn't the blood!\" There was a crackle, the sound of heavy breathing, a pause, then- \"What the sodding hell…Pierre? Jesus Christ! Is that you?\" \"It's not the blood,\" he yelled again, flinching back as an explosion rocked the building next to him. \"That's not how it spreads, at least not directly. Not by ingestion. It's blood to blood contact or a direct attack. Tell Dr. Spellman to focus on–\" The rest of whatever he said was lost as the butcher, a large man who was more than three times his size, paced around the deli counter, knife gleaming in the low light as the power flickered. Everyone was speaking rapid fire Italian – too fast for his second generation understanding to pick up in full – as the people – customers – milled around, shoring up the barricade that blocked off the front entryway from the main street. He took a breath, unsteady and shallow. \"How bad?\" he asked, knowing that Peter's penchant for voicing hard truths would serve him well. He needed the facts, not conjecture, not hope. He needed reality served cold. He needed it bitter, raw and unappetizing so he could better pick out its flaws. \"Bad,\" Peter returned, toneless as static hissed, low but steady in the very echoes of the connection. \"We are waiting on the samples, it hasn't spread far here yet, but-\" \"Don't let anyone leave,\" he interrupted, speaking into his open palm as he covered the receiver with his hand, trying vainly to muffle the sound as a small child started wailing in its mother's arms – safely tucked away behind the display counter. \"They're drawn by sound. Stimulus. It doesn't take much. Bullets only slow them down. You can't risk-\" \"Pierre? Jesus, what the hell is happening over there? Tell me you're not still in Rome? The embassy told us you'd made the last flight before they were overrun? Where are you? It's been all over the telly, the military there is pulling back. They've lost containment. The Pope-\" He blinked, staring blankly at the opposing wall. He looked at the clock and realized almost thirteen hours had passed. How? A tension headache throbbed between his temples, a sound accompaniment to the tinny ringing in his ears, constant and grating. His body ached, skin littered with cuts and bruises, jumper and hair prickling with glass shards and loose gravel. He was losing time. \"No one leaves,\" he repeated, rasping the vowels, clinging to the point doggedly. \"We are going to need everyone on this. Is Ruth in yet? Mori?\" \"Yes, yes, they're fine, they're here. They have a theory but we're still waiting on those blasted samples. There is a military unit en-route, we've locked and shuttered the front gates. We're ready.\" He gnawed on the blunt of his fist, holding himself back. His head tipped back, thunking hard against the window pane as the cover of his cellphone creaked dangerously. Someone was tugging at his elbow, trying to get him to move, shoving him out of the way as they grabbed at one the chairs set against the wall behind him, dragging it across the tile to get in the way of the people trying to secure a length of chain around the doors. He wanted to scream. No you aren't. No one was. No one ever could be. \"Pierre, no- listen , where are you?\" He shook his head, \"forget about me. There is a key taped to the underside of the window ledge by the heater. Take it and unlock the cabinet in the corner. There's a folder in there, red, labeled: \"Emergency Protocols,\" worst cases scenario directives.\" He could practically hear his friend's hackles go up. \"I don't know what the bloody hell you're going on about, but I'm getting you out of there, right now. Stay put, Pierre, I mean it,\" Peter snapped, frustrated now, clearly on the move as the sound of muffled conversation rose and fell in the background. A voice he thought could have been Mori's sounded out, questioning, but Peter just grunted out a negative. Muttering about extraction points and border restrictions, going on to have a good rant about the deplorable lack of communication that existed between different country's militaries before he managed to pull himself together enough to respond. He grimaced, head pounding. \"Don't bother. I'm not high enough in priority and I don't know how the hell anyone could get to me, anyway. You said the Italian military was pulling back,\" he reminded, willing the man to just drop it. It would be easier this way. Better. \"Those soggy bastards can kiss my arse for all I care,\" Peter returned breezily, flipping papers. \"Someone is coming to get you, all four of you, if Susanna's still with you. Just stay hidden and for god's sake, keep your cell on.\" He shook his head. It didn't matter. Once they were done ripping through the people trapped in the streets. The people running, screaming, hiding – changing. They'd find them. It was only a matter of time. \"Just me,\" he murmured, disassociated and calm, marveling at the way his voice refused to shake. \"I-…What?\" Peter demanded. A manic sort of grin threatened to make tracks across his face as he soaked it in. The man was all shaky silence and awkward beats. Considering the circumstances, considering the fact that his arse was numb and his skin and clothes were smeared with his son's blood, it really shouldn't have amused him as much as it did. But then, when was human emotion ever truly logical? \"Just me,\" he repeated, hiccupping, unable to tell if it was a chuckle or a sob threatening to strangle him from the inside out. \"They're gone, Peter. I lost them. They took them. She didn't-I couldn't-\" He broke off when the connection hissed, reminding him all at once how thin his lifeline truly was. He was wasting time - wasting their time. It was up to them now. If anyone could solve this it was them – his team. \"I have to go,\" he murmured, eyes focusing for what felt like the first time in hours. Taking in the scene around him as a group of people huddled around the prone figure of an elderly man – worn leather jacket and cloth cap - clutching at his right arm. Heart attack. \"I have to help.\" If he'd been paying attention he might have heard the hushed exclamation, the stuttering expressions of regret and sympathy hastily mumbled over the static-drowned line. As it was, the only thing he heard before the line went dead was Peter's reassurance that someone was coming, that Mori and Ruth and the director's brand new secretary were all on the line with the UN and not to worry. They'd handle everything. They'd seen him when he got back and- \"Stay safe, my friend, good lzzzphtz -\" The screen blinked – signal lost – before going dark. He figured the man had meant 'good luck.' But knowing Peter with his east-side Cardiff brogue and general love of curse words for all occasions, it could have honestly been anything under the sun. Either way, he supposed it got the job done. But before he shook the thoughts away, rolling up his sleeves and stowing his phone safely in his pocket – parting the crowd around the elderly man with a handful of words, checking the heart rate as his frantic daughter babbled about his medication - he couldn't help but think that it'd been good to hear the man's voice. To be able to close his eyes and picture his life the way it should have been. The lab. His office. B-wing. Their home. The little orchard down the street. The farmers market every Wednesday and Saturday in the village square. The smell of frying chips and East-Atlantic cod. His lips twitched, wan and acrid with regret. There was nothing quite like the comfort of familiar things. Half an hour later, someone in search of a toilet dropped a crowbar in the back room. He froze, pausing between chest compressions as the echoes sent shockwaves rippling through the unnaturally still air. There was a beat of silence. A purring chirp. A snarl. A growl. The sound of running feet. And suddenly he was running again A/N #1: Thank you for reading. Please let me know what you think!

A mali estremi, estremi rimedi Chapter Four They dropped him off two miles from the facility, on the very edge of the Cardiff moors. They handed him a gun he didn't know how to use and told him to fire only if it was his last resort. They told him to hurry, but not to run - to ghost across the landscape, not own it. No sudden moves. No noise. Stay low. And, hey , he might just make it there alive, after all. When the helicopter landed and his feet hit the ground – muted in the long grass - he stumbled, wobbly and weak with exhaustion and the long flight. It wasn't a promising start, he'd admit that. Feeling light headed, he clung to the side of the chopper for balance, trying his best to shake it off. And judging by the snickers that issued as the company readied themselves to leave, his would-be saviors were in agreement. He shouldered the pack they'd given him and was about to push off when the head of the unit, an unnamed Captain who'd spent the majority of the flight glaring daggers at him, grabbed him by the collar. He forced himself to still, not baulk, when the action jerked him forward. He closed his eyes, breathing out, letting the red-haired man get right into his face, all stale breath and unlit nicotine. He forced himself to take a calming breath, and then another. They all had demons they needed to excise. Especially now. He wouldn't deny the man responsible for saving him, his. When it all came down to it, he understood. He was the bureaucratic face to all the messed up priorities and paperwork. He was the reason why good men had died. Why they were here, transporting someone they didn't know with credentials they likely couldn't even begin to pronounce, and not at home with their families - safe. He could be the foil the man needed for his anger. He could take it. He deserved it. For living. For surviving when so many others had not. \"You'd better be worth it,\" the Captain snarled, dirty fist curling around his bloody collar, keeping him close as bright blue eyes bored unflinchingly into his. \"I lost half my unit pulling you out of that shit hole.\" \"Why?\" he croaked, clearing his throat, rusty and soft as he put to voice what had been bugging him ever since he'd heard the sound of regulation combats grating across worn cobblestone. It had all happened in a rush - he'd been resting, catching his breath, trying to stay ahead of the worst of the mobs when he heard hushed, accented English echoing down the street. There had been the beep-beep of a GPS before his name had sounded out – not ten meters from where he'd been hiding, soaking wet and crouched behind a dumpster. \"Why did you even come in the first place?\" \"You were given priority status,\" the Captain replied, tone softening, if only slightly as the winded incomprehension he was feeling must have shown on his face. \"None of your superiors made it. Right now you are the highest ranking member in your organization, and our best chance.\" \"To put it simply, Doctor, the world needs you,\" the man added, giving him a quick once over before snatching the Beretta hanging limply in his free hand. \"Now more than ever.\" But instead of changing his mind, the solider reached down and unsnapped his thigh holster. He couldn't help but watch, strangely fascinated by the click-click-pop and the whip-lash of black vinyl as it skimmed off the Captain's pant leg and into the open air. He forgot to protest. Forgot to force the words past his lips when the man moved him bodily, kneeling in front of him as he fastened it around his own leg. Fussing and yanking, gently but with purpose, just like he'd done while dressing his son any number of times before. It was only when the man was satisfied that he shoved the gun firmly into the holster. Blunt fingers smoothing the snaps into place before stepping back - signalling for the pilot to start the engine. The hand that fell on his shoulder was anything but grounding as the helicopter blades began to spin. It weighed. Pulling at him in ways he didn't have the reserves to fall back on. It felt like lead weights to the soul. Like the last breath before drowning. \"We did our job. Now you do yours. Solve this thing.\" He wondered if that was supposed to make him feel better or worse. He managed a slow walk until the building came into view. That's when he started running. His backpack shifted, slamming awkwardly, half empty between his shoulder blades as panic welled inexplicably in his breast. Sending lancing tendrils of fear and hope coursing through his blood stream as safety loomed in the form of streamlined curves and yards of pristine, bullet-proof glass. The three of them met him at the gate. Breaking protocol, exposing themselves, but he couldn't find it in him to care a wit, to be anything other than grateful, relieved as he watched smiles stretch themselves across familiar faces. It was enough to make him forget about his bloody clothes – stiff and reeking with filth and sweat – enough to make him forget about the hurt and the loss, about how he hadn't slept in over twenty-four hours, how he could still hear Stefan's whimpering cries, the rattling snarl as Claire had stumbled out of the boutique, her favourite cream-colored top a mess of red skid marks as she threw herself through the glass door and out onto the street. Because they pulled him in regardless, keeping him close – safe – as a symphony of relieved sounds and happy cries echoed into the sunset-still. For however long it lasted, he was here. Home.

A mali estremi, estremi rimedi Chapter Five They treated him with kid gloves at first. At least until they realized that a misplaced word or gesture wouldn't break him. Still, they did their best not to pry. Not to overload him with things he was used to handling before lunch on any standard day. It would have been heartwarming if it hadn't been so god damned annoying. He put up with it for a few days, until he finally snapped and assigned Ruth and Mori a double shift manning the generators downstairs – grunt work that the janitorial staff had been seeing to in his absence. He lost a remarkable amount of sympathy after that. And frankly that was the way he liked it. He'd considered the matter closed and pitched himself head first into the data they'd managed to collect so far. Peter had just watched him with worried eyes. It became something of a habit as the days passed, losing himself in his work only to find the older man watching him – worried and inexplicably muted – whenever he came up for air. The ornery man's silence was almost as off-putting as the sound of distant gun-fire and far off explosions. Almost. He found him in the break room three days later, head bowed, a dead cell phone sitting on the table in front of him. Ruth had said he hadn't reported to his shift. That he'd ignored her intercom calls and her gentle knocks on his assigned quarters. That he hadn't been eating, that there'd been no word from his family – his mother, father and twin sister in over two days. That she didn't know what to do anymore and if he could just go check, check to make sure he was alright. Talk to him, maybe. He'd given it until after lunch before he decided to seek him out. He made a point not to check up on him through the CTV feeds until he absolutely had to – convinced that they all needed at least a modicum of privacy – time to process and grieve in their own way. But the learning curve with this infection was beyond steep. And he needed Mori in on this. He stood in the doorway for a handful of beats, wondering if he should acknowledge himself or let the man dictate the terms. He buried his hands in his pockets, feeling strangely unsure for the first time since he'd met him. It had been close to five years since he'd had him face to face and sweating in a brown linen suit, starting off by asking him - with the frank sort of boldness unique to uncaffeinated people everywhere - why they should consider him for the position when there were close to twenty equally qualified applicants quietly working themselves up in the waiting room. Oddly enough, he figured that along with all the other pivotal milestones in his adult life, his first car, job, the day of his wedding, the birth of his son, the man's answer would be one of the things he remembered until the day he died. Mori was familiar territory. He knew him. He'd hired him, groomed him. Hell, they'd even had the occasional beer together after work. They had common interests, followed the same teams, hated crowds and had a secret love for the brew from a particularly shitty bar – a shanty-style dock-side on the lower east quarter that they'd made a pact not to tell anyone about. It was the kind of kitchen that considered grease to be an essential food group and still wrapped their fish and chips with old newspaper. In other words, heaven on a particularly shitty day. But this? This felt out of his depth. It wasn't until the clock chimed half past that the man stirred, blinking owlishly as the muted afternoon sun filtered through the blinds. He had to force himself not to flinch when dark eyes, worrisomely blank and hollowed suddenly turned to face him. \"They're gone,\" Mori bit out, eyes haunted, twin pools of grief and regret. \"Gone. Everyone-…everything, gone,\" the man croaked, chair grating across spotless tiles, as he rose unsteadily – all wobbly legs and joints that didn't seem to want to work right. The thin line of his lips twitched as the man stumbled awkwardly, sending the cell phone spinning – clattering off the table with a cringe-worthy shatter. But Mori barely even twitched. Instead there was confusion written across his young face, a strange sort of childish incomprehension as he swung his head back and forth. The man was pale and sweating, breathing hard as clammy fingers slap-slapped against the side of his chair. Desperate for purchase before something about the man's behavior finally clicked and suddenly he was surging forward. Running on nothing but stale coffee, adrenaline and no sleep, it was pure instinct that allowed him to recognize the signs and reel him in just before the man's legs gave out underneath him. Top-heavy, they collapsed on the couch – winded as Mori's full weight settled across him - half straddling the other as he pulled the younger man close, coddling and completely unapologetic as the full weight of the last few days seemed to settle on him all at once. \"I know,\" he murmured, chin drifting through fine brown hair, greedy now as he tucked him into the curve of his shoulder. \"I know.\" He wasn't sure what it meant when Mori let him, pressing deeper into his hold as strong arms wrapped around his forearms, digging in, seeking the comfort he freely offered, as the younger man shuddered against him. And ironically, that was when he decided to break. He didn't quite understand it. The way the human mind processed complex emotions, things like grief and survivors guilt. It was cathartic, he supposed, the gentle weight, the trust, the hands that clutched and held rather than ripped and tore. The human body was primed to seek out companionship, solace, to strengthen familiar bonds in order to form more cohesive pack structures. It was a survival mechanism. Something they – he – should have been far above given the current state of human evolution and yet- He tried his best to hold them back when a sheen of angry tears blurred across his vision. He tipped his head, blinking fast, staring up at the ceiling as Mori shook with silent sobs. Trying his best to hold his ground in a losing battle he wasn't sure he'd ever be ready to surrender to. All he knew was that when he cried into the man's hair, breathing in the impossibly base and honest scent of him - surrounded in sterile whites and stainless steel appliances as the warmth of the other man seeped through his jumper - he wondered if anything would ever be okay again. They fell asleep like that, unashamed but perhaps a bit self-conscious as they unwound themselves from around each other when they started awake sometime in the night. Over-warm and crusty with the vestiges of salt-track tears and spilled coffee as the blanket that'd been left over them crumpled gently into their laps. He made an art form out of nearly choking on all the words he couldn't bring himself to say as they went their separate ways - wrung out, yet not unaffected. It made him wonder, later, under the cover of darkness, if the man felt the same sort of emptiness when he settled into his cot – restless and unsatisfied as the hours ticked past and he eventually fell asleep – lulled by the occasional draught of the man's scent, caught in the folds of his tear-stained jumper.

A mali estremi, estremi rimedi Chapter Six The day they lost B-wing dawned brilliant and sunny, with Mother Nature thumbing her nose at Wales' penchant for dreary perpetual overcast, to deliver a masterpiece of patch-work clouds and warm rays. He'd been soaking it in, like a big cat basking in a sun-beam when the vial of infected blood Doctor Spellman had been working with, shattered in his hands. He'd always been proud of his malleability. That he was prone to bend rather than break. He was adaptable. Capable. Even-keeled. But even he couldn't say that the loss of over eighty of their own – of his people – his employees didn't rattle him. He'd been forced to compartmentalize. To save those he could by walling off every niggling inch of human emotion that was screaming at him to take the gun he'd taken to wearing – just in case - and save who he could, for however long he could. He clicked the lock in place himself. Wrapping the thick iron links around and around those stupidly flimsy metal handles like they were the only thing separating them from hell itself. He forced himself to go slow, controlling each and every movement as the sound of distant screams and echoing footfalls rippled down the empty hall. They were people he'd known. People he'd liked, hired, worked with and trusted. It was penance, he decided. He made the decision. Now he had to live with the consequences. They walked on egg-shells for the next three days. He felt bitter and apathetic in turn. He wasn't sleeping. Barely eating. He just stared at the same data over and over again, fingers sinking deep between coarse dark strands as he let his thoughts free-fall, too exhausted to keep them in check. He sighed, head dropping into his hands as sentences from blacked-out military missives and chemical equations rippled through the air above his head - fanning out as he allowed his frustration to get the better of him. Nothing was connecting. Nothing made sense. This wasn't like anything he'd ever seen before. It was new, frightening, merciless – ground-breaking. It was natural in design, not man-made; none of the markers were there to indicate otherwise. When it had spread – making its way city to city, port to port - the media had reported it as a rare strain of rabies. The irony was they weren't completely wrong. There were similarities. But then the structure of the virus itself was all wrong. It was like someone had re-written the book on viral infections and not told anyone about it. It all came down to the fact that the infection didn't work the way a virus was supposed to. The exposure to infected rate was too fast, almost unbelievable if he hadn't seen it with his own eyes. Under the microscope it was even more complex. It was beautiful in the same way as it was horrific. It was a hodgepodge of the new and the old, the exciting and the frightening, and none of them had the first clue what to do about it. Still, every virus, every contagion had a weak spot. A chink in its armor. A weakness they could inevitably exploit. They just had to find it. The question of whether it would be too late by the time they did, remained unanswered. That was about as far as they'd gotten when two lone figures stumbled off the lawn and into the parking lot. He and Mori had watched from his office window as they wove between parked cars and fox-holes - supporting each other – before the man collapsed against the curb. Leaving the woman to limp towards the front gate – shell-shocked and hollowed eyed. His breath caught in his throat as he watched the man's hands spider out, sinking into the cracks in the concrete, as if by sheer will he could pull himself the rest of the way. The woman was staring into the camera like she could see right through it, dark eyes pleading – desperate as she lifted her hand to the control panel and- The sound of the buzzer ringing through the empty halls sounded almost as foreign as the clink-clink of his key ring as he took the stairs at a loping sprint, skipping steps as the sound echoed and the undead in the wing next to them grew restless. \"You're not serious.\" He hadn't thought twice about volunteering to help Gerry and Segen find their way to cold-storage – Vault 139 – a place he avoided like, no pun intended, the plague on his best day. It was his duty after all, his responsibility. \"B-wing's a maze; they'll never make it back alone.\" It would be fitting even, he'd thought. Feeling strangely detached as he strapped the makeshift protectors over his forearm, barely aware of the way Ruth had moved in close, still talking. \"We don't even know if his theory is correct,\" she insisted, worried, polished and erudite to a fault as the clean scent of her washed over him. If their positions were reversed, he knew he would probably be doing the same thing – only insisting he go in her place, that she was too valuable. Only there must have been something on his face that forced her to curb the rest of it, because she bit her tongue, sullen and sincere as he smoothed a length of duct tape under his fingers. \"All I know is I'm not asking one of you to take him there,\" he returned, obsequious - objective as he hefted the crowbar experimentally. Making sure the pads didn't hinder his range of movement. After all what was one more death? At least his would mean something. He wasn't sure what it said about him when he realized – feet pounding down the sky bridge, running faster than he had in Rome, faster than he could ever remember moving in his entire god damned life – that he'd never been so sure he wanted to live than he did in that precise moment. Living wasn't just a habit. He wanted it. Somewhere along the line he figured he must have forgotten what that felt like. He wasn't sure who moved first when Gerry started to make his way back from the vault. If Mori turned to him or if he reached forward and pulled him in. It didn't matter. The embrace was effortless. It was real and honest. It was joy, relief, triumph and a hundred other emotions he didn't have it in him to voice. It was humanity dusting off the ashes. It was renewal. A second chance. But most of all, it was the knowledge that he never wanted to let go. He'd always considered sexuality to be a fluid concept rather than a fixed point. So when he woke up one morning a few months after they'd started air-dropping the vaccine and found Mori on his front step – looking like he'd spent the better part of the night pacing back and forth in his flat across town – he didn't think twice about it when the man took a stuttering breath, crowded him into the door jamb and kissed him deeply. It was all too-dry lips, no tongue and desperation. But it was the kind of kiss that evolved over time. That improved and layered as both parties took the time to learn the other. It was strong hands smoothing down his temple, blunt fingertips scratching across its scalp. It was open mouths and spit-slick lips. It was good, grounding and wholesome in every way he'd forgotten true intimacy could be. The man kissed like this was the last thing he was ever going to do and he wanted to do it right – passionately, fully and with no regrets. And after a moment of stunned incomprehension, he found himself kissing back. Gentle at first then bolder, fiercer than he could ever remember being with another person. He held nothing back as they slammed against the wall, making an incomprehensible sound deep in his throat when thin cotton boxers slid sinfully easy across three day old jeans. He caught sight of them in the glass panes of the heavy oak door, a tangling mess of sleep-puffed hair, jerking hips and comparable shoulder widths that tried their best to overwhelm, but ended up complimenting each other instead. Arousal spiked, heavy and building in the pit of his belly as Mori puffed into the curve of his neck, nipping and rasping – stubble to stubble – as he muffled a curse into his skin. \"Jesus, Pierre, I-\" He swallowed the rest of the words before they had chance to form. Focusing instead on the feeling, the moment, on accepting everything the man had to give - was willing to give – before settling in to see about taking the rest. He hiked the younger man up against him, sending framed photos - he and Claire in France, their second honeymoon, Claire posing, smiling, her long blonde hair billowing out behind her in the seaside breeze – clattering across the hardwood as a sweaty palm wrenched down his shorts and- Like the new world taking shape around them, he figured that if anything, at least it was a start.

So not wanting to make him mad I did. For a few minutes I felt ok when the hot water ran over my body. That last until I got out and saw the dress he got me it was a short low-cut black dress that was skin-tight. I walked out feeling scared of what he wanted to do with me. He was waiting for me. \"My my Kitty you look lovely.\"He said as he grabbed my hand and pulled me into the dining room. He sat me at the table and walked into what must have been the kitchen. Because when he came back he had two plates of food. One had steak and potatoes on it and the other had Ribs and a salad. \"My dear you pick which one you want.\" He said to me. I could not speak so I just pointed at the plate of steak. He set it in front of me and said \"Dig in.\" I only ate three bits all- night. Throughout dinner he asked me questions like \"Are you feeling well, do you like it here?\" I would answer \"I'm fine, yes it's very nice.\" But what I wanted to say was \"I feel sick, and no I hate it here let me go home.\" After dinner he took me to the living room. Were there was candles and two glasses of wine. After he had me sit down he put in a movie and grabbed the wine glasses. \"I don't drink\" I said with a quiet voice. \"Well why don't you start now.\" He said as he put the glass to my lips and tilted it back.

The first chapter of the OC story, THE ART OF WAR! It is now a collab with the beautiful, amazing DanaIsis! So, if you've seen our other stories (IF NOT GO READ THEM AFTER THIS), then you'll know I have never written anything quite like this before. It is as new to me as a computer would be to a T-Rex. So I hope I don't disappoint you. I'm sorta nervous… Well, here goes nothing! Chapter 1 The N Crew Smoke and dust filled the hot air, so much so that it was making it hard to see past the end of her nose. Somewhere far away she heard an explosion, as another one of their Helos was shot down. Elena Santos made an effort to keep the image of her burning comrades out of her mind. The only survivor. She thought to herself as she whisked around, moving her head from side to side with every step. How the hell can I be the only fucking survivor! Domino had more protection on than me! I know, God had mercy on them. He took them away before they could endure any more pain. Obviously he's got it in for me! She turned herself around so that she was walking sideways with her back against the concrete wall of the building beside her. As she looked around she saw deserted cars, some overturned, and worst of all, more bodies. Bodies of women, children, and men, just scattered across the ground like poppy seeds. She looked across the road to see a woman lying on the ground and underneath her was a baby boy, his hands still wrapped in his mother's shirt. Santos stopped for a moment and took in the sad sight. She let out a small sigh. Suddenly, she heard movement. She crouched down and raised her M16 to her eye, and switched off the safety that she had turned on during the silence. She didn't move. Trying to hear where the noise was coming from. She heard a rock slide to her right and turned as fast as she could. Between her and the noise was a line of cars, making it impossible to see what the noise was. She saw a flicker of green flash out from behind the car and immediately fired. As soon as she did they fired back, probably about eight of them. She dove behind an overturned station wagon, and leant against it, breathing heavily. Suddenly the fire stopped. She realized that they were both shooting blind. She stayed like that for about two minutes before she cautiously reached for a small piece of concrete that was lying by her feet. She picked up the palm sized piece and threw it out into the open. It made a loud skidding sound and she waited for the guns to begin firing. They did not. All of a sudden, she heard the distinct sound of a rifle being cocked. This confused her. Aren't their weapons like, highly superior to ours? Why would it have to cock a rifle? She thought about what she heard harder, and then decided to take one of the biggest risks she thought she would ever take. Slowly, she took off the helmet she had been wearing so her long brown hair could be seen, and raised her hands above her head. God, If I die doing this, I swear to mother you're gonna get an earful when I get there! She then rose from her crouching position on the ground so the she was standing up straight. She heard guns being hurriedly cocked and squeezed her eyes, waiting for the buzzing of bullets that would end her life. \"HOLD YOUR FIRE!\" A stern voice yelled, and Elena slowly opened her eyes to see a group of Marines running her way, crouching with their heads down. As they rounded the station wagon, she turned around and leant back against the underside of the car. She let out a breath as they joined her. A few of them sat down but the oldest, biggest man squatted down, resting on his haunches. He had shaved brown hair, dark green eyes and a deep scar on the left side of his face. She put the helmet back on her head and fastened the strap. \"Wow, am I glad to see you!\" She said with a tired smirk on her face. The rest of the platoon nodded, and smiled at her before some of them turned so that they could guard the team as they took a minor rest. \"I'm Officer Xavier Scott. Call me Six,\" said one of the youngest looking of the group. He had a blonde crew-cut, dark blue-grey eyes and a cheeky grin. She also saw that he had a bandage wrapped around his left thigh that had a crimson patch in the middle of it. He saw her looking. \"Don't worry, I ran into a juttin' out piece of concrete and it cut my leg. It's just a scratch!\" she smiled and he smiled back, his eyes sparkling. She shook his gloved hand, turned her head to the man seated next to him and beside her. \"Gunnery Sergeant Logan McCullers—I go by Charge,\" he said, shaking her hand. His hair was a slightly longer chocolate brown, matted to his tanned face with sweat, and dark blue eyes. His tall build made her look like a rabbit compared to him, and that was strange for her since she was never the smallest of a group before. She smiled at him and he returned it. She looked to her other side and smiled at the young man kneeling there. \"My name's Corporal David Thomas Trippett. Please call me Tripp. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,\" he said in a thick English accent. Elena was slightly surprised, but still shook his hand. His brown hair was cut extremely short, and his eyes were an emerald green. The rest of the team sounded off their name, and finally Santos turned back to the large man, still sitting on his haunches. \"Major Nick Ambrose. Don't ask how I got my scar 'cause it would not be pretty. We're the 40th ID, minus some, plus English marine, marine, and other,\" he said in his deep voice, pointing at Tripp, then Charge, and then Santos. A laugh circulated through the small group. \"What do you go by?\" Santos watched as all attention was turned to her. They all had sweat and dirt plastered on their faces, and she suddenly realized that she probably looked the same. Charge had soot all over him, making his pale skin look like a spotted Dalmatian, and Tripp had a graze down his shoulder like he had just slid on his arm. She looked around at the group. \"Technical Sergeant Elena Santos, Air Force, 61st wing, Intel & Surveillance, Re-Con Division,\" she said. They all gave her quizzical looks before she explained. \"Our Helo was blown out of the sky about twenty minutes ago. I was the only one that got out alive.\" She looked at the ground sadly for a moment, but then continued, ignoring the sympathetic looks the team were giving her. \"We were tracking enemy transmissions when they ambushed us, like they knew our freakin' address,\" She finished, more mad than sad at this point. Tripp patted her shoulder. Out of nowhere, they heard a series of gunshots coming from around the corner, about three hundred meters away. The troop shot up, as well as Santos, grabbing their weapons and pulling them to their eyes. They heard people yelling as more shots were fired. The Major took his right hand and made the forward gesture, telling them to move back around to the other side of the car, the side away from the chaos. They nodded and did as they were instructed. As they made their way around the car, Elena was set to go out behind the youngest soldier, one whose name she had learned was Robert \"Tank\" McGrew. As he scuttled out around the car, he dropped his two way radio. It slid a little way out, and Tank stopped to grab it. They all yelled at him to not bother but he went after it anyway. Elena looked to her right; her rifle cocked, and saw movement on a nearby roof. \"Tank Move!\" she yelled right as a round of ammo was blown in their direction. She ran out and pushed him behind the car beside them, on the other side of the road. \"Where the hell did that even come from?\" hollered Charge, pointing his gun all around them. They were all looking around like Meer cats, with their guns raised, shooting in every direction. \"Santos, Tank! Are you alright?\" Tripp bellowed whilst firing at a nearby post box. \"We're Fine! THEY'RE UP ON THE ROOF!\" Santos shouted. The entire unit turned their attention to the roofs of the buildings beside them. They all saw the movement at the same time, on the building to their left. The moment the first of their shot were fired, they were mowed with these flaming bullets, the same kind that had flown at Tank and were forced to hide behind the cars, popping up and firing before diving back under cover. As Santos popped back down, she heard a loud groan from behind her. She turned and saw that Tank had yet to rise from the ground. She suddenly had a horrible revelation, and grabbed his shoulder, turning him over. His face was fine, although covered with dirt. He was fine until you saw his chest. A giant burning hole was blown right into the right side of his chest - like a giant crater. She gasped and called over to the others. \"Tank's been hit!\" many cries were heard from the other car, but the bullets were preventing them from getting over to her. She looked down again at the hole and felt as though she was about to be sick. She had seen people burning, head wounds so bad that their brains were leaking out, she had seen a Helo be crumpled into a ball and then explode in a fiery mess whilst her friends and team mates had been inside, yet she had never felt like she was going to hurl up her breakfast like she was at this moment, watching over a bullet wound that was literally burning away at the boys flesh like acid. As fast as the assault began, it stopped. Everything was suddenly silent. After about thirty seconds, Charge scuttled over to the car that Santos was pressed against. \"Do you know anything about first aid?\" Santos asked, leaning over to him. He nodded his head quickly and pulled a kit from his bag. He grabbed a bottle of water and gently poured it onto Tanks chest. Tank screamed, and started flailing his arms and legs around. Santos grabbed his arms and pinned him to the ground, and Tripp did the same to his legs. Charge grabbed a patch from the kit and pressed it to the wound, and it immediately became a sickening blood red, mixed with a slight off yellow color. He took it off and replaced it pressing it down tightly, but the wound didn't stop bleeding, he repeated this several times, each time the same as the last. Then, his body went limp; he stopped flailing, and his eyes got a distant look in them. Charge began trying to do CPR on him, but no matter how many times he did it, it wouldn't work. Tripp gently took his shoulders and pried him away from the deceased marine, a few tears finding their way down his face. Santos gave him a sympathetic look and slowly closed Tank's eyes. \"We have to go,\" said the Major, standing guard with his back to them. Charge rose to his feet, anger boiling in his veins. As he stormed over to the Major, he turned around. Charge fronted up to the Major. \"We can't just LEAVE him here!\" he practically shouted in his face. They all turned to him. \"We have to! Now stand down marine,\" the Major shouted back. Charge put his head down and took a step back. The major nodded. \"Look, I don't like this either, but we only have two options: take him with us, slow us down and make us an easy target, or leave him here, and get away as safely and efficiently as possible. Does everyone understand?\" He said, speaking to the entire unit of soldiers. They all nodded and a mumbled \"Yes Sir\" came from a few of them. \"Alright, now it's time to move,\" He said, leading the team away from their young colleague. They quickly returned to formation, with Santos standing at the back. They listened for any signs of the alien attackers returning, but heard none. As they neared the corner, they heard shouting coming from a nearby house. They all ran to the corner, Six and the Major slowly showed themselves. A loud whistle was heard and they all ran to the duplex in which the other marines were positioned. As she ran inside, she noticed the bewildered looks that were being given to her. \"What's your unit?\" The man with the tag that said Nantz said. Nantz , she thought for a moment. Wait, Staff Sergeant Nantz was the one who got his men killed in his last tour in Afghanistan! This is gonna be interesting. A slight smirk brushed her lips whilst she was trying to control her breathing. \"40th ID,\" answered one of the older men. \"Where's the rest of your unit?\" Asked the Latino man that appeared in charge, who she later found out was named Martinez. \"Everyone else is either dead or missing. I picked up airforce here!\" he managed to say in between huffs of breath. He gestured towards Santos when he spoke about her. \"Tech Sergeant Elena Santos, Air Force, 61st Wing, Intel Surveillance, Re-Con Division,\" When she spoke she found that she was rather short of breathe herself. He asked what the hell she was doing out here, and she explained with the same little speech she had given the rest of the unit beforehand. Nantz asked if she was ready to use her weapon and she had to fight to suppress a laugh. \"With all due respect staff sergeant, I didn't get this far off of my good looks. I'm ready for payback,\" She said looking directly into his eyes, feeling her heart race at the thoughts of killing the bastard who took out her team. Oh God! She thought. Did Hayley get out? Hayley Santos is Santos's little sister, who goes to the high school in town. Santos took a second to think of the positive. Of course she got out. The school would have evacuated them first. She nodded quietly to herself as the now connected platoon made their way out of the house, apparently towards a police station. When they got there, she was told that when the bird arrived she would need to help their insertion. She nodded her head in understanding as she stooped down between Tripp and Six. \"When do you think the bird is gonna land?\" She asked, resting her hands on each of their shoulders. \"Soon I hope!\" Six said, the look of brightness quickly fading from his face. \"You know, if I get to tell anyone back in Peterborough that I was huddled in a police station during my R&R;, hiding and protecting civilians against Extra Terrestrials they are all gonna think I've gone round the bend,\" Tripp said, to no-one in particular. Santos, Six and Charge who had seated himself next to them had just had to laugh. Tripp joined in to and soon enough the whole group seated outside where laughing along with them. We have begun the descent into madness. Hey, It's better than hell! The Asian male from the other team, pulled out his radio and listened intently for a second. He shouted that the bird was on its way in and they all immediately silenced. Santos and Tripp jumped up, along with the Major and a few others whose names she had not yet found out. One of them took a smoke bomb out of his vest and pegged it into the middle of the parking lot, marking the place for the Chopper to land. They all saw the bird land and started helping the injured marines inside. After Santos had helped carry the man with the burns to his face to the chopper, she ran back towards the station. Her back was turned to the bird as it took off, but she turned when she heard a loud whistling sound. Just as she turned she saw a flaming rocket fly towards the Helo. As it connected, she shielded her eyes. Scrap metal flew every which way, and the shockwave was so powerful that it bowled her and a few others that were still too close straight over. As she rose from the ground she saw the entire machine was up in flames. When it was about to fall to earth she figured that she would be in exactly the position of the blade when it landed. She scrambled to her feet and made a run for cover. She dived back under the awning of the Police Station just in time, being pulled in by Charge as she dove. She was right; the propeller had hit squarely where she had been lying. She took a gasping breath and Charge and Tripp patted her on the back. Santos took charge and led the civilians, along with Tripp, the Major, and Six back into the police station, and into a room near the back of the building. She saw a body and asked for the boys to move it that the kids wouldn't have to see it. When she was crouched down, guarding the window she vaguely heard thumping coming from behind her. She swung around and looked back. All that was behind her was a doorway that she suspected led to the holding cells. Tripp and Six ran back in, again with their rifles cocked. \"Wh… What is that?\" asked one of the civilians by the name of Michelle. Santos shook her head in an effort to tell them to be quiet as she slowly shifted over to the door. Tripp flanked her as Six took up her prier position guarding the window, taking out of his pocket a Harmonica, and started playing a happy tune to cheer up the kids. Santos rolled her eyes and Tripp snorted, before again becoming serious and making their way down the dark corridor. She heard the banging again coming from the far end of the hallway. They tried every door handle until they reached the end, but they were all locked. The last one Tripp tried, however, was not. He slowly twisted the handle clockwise and swung the door open all the way. Inside, like Santos had suspected, was a room filled with holding cells. Tripp gestured for Santos to take the right side and him to take the left. As she rounded the corner, a medium sized stone hurtled towards her head. She dove back around the corner and landed with a grunt. Tripp came running from the other side of the room and helped her up. He cocked his rifle and was about to swing around the corner when Santos put her hand on it and told him to lower it. She dropped her gun and walked around the corner. \"What the hell are you…?\" He started as she moved, before she grabbed his arm and pulled him around to. \"US Air Force!\" Santos shouted down the row of cells. She looked at him expectantly and nodded. He rolled his eyes. \"Fine. British Royal Marines,\" he said. They heard the sound of a rock being dropped and Santos smiled. \"I'm back here! For Christ's sake let me out!\" A female voice yelled from down the row. Santos ran to where she was and looked inside. Taupe colored fingers were white knuckled as they gripped around the metal bars. The owner was a girl who looked to be no more than nineteen years of age Her long, wavy black hair covered her face and her brown almond shaped eyes looked warily—a mix of both fear and anxiety. The white ribbed tank top that read: PINK! had a few speck of dirt on it, her distressed shorts in the similar fashion as her yellow and white polka dotted bikini peeked through the fabric. Her cowboy boot clad feet brought her to a stand from the crouched up position she was in a few seconds ago. Santos and Tripp smiled at her and she smiled back. Tripp got to work on opening the door—it was jammed, and Santos searched across the room for anyone else. Not seeing anyone else she quickly returned to Tripp and started to help him. They finally managed to get the door off of its hinges and pull it away. The girl ran out and hugged both Santos and Tripp. \"Thank you so much! I thought I was gonna die in that cell! I'm Ariel, Ariel Ines Mrazo. I was coming home from the beach this morning and was arrested for speeding. My friend Maddy was supposed to pick me up, but then I started hearing shooting and explosions and crashing noises! Oh god! I'm pretty sure that's the first time I've had a panic attack!\" she went on as they led her out of the room, to the other civilians. \"I'm sorry I ramble when I'm nervous.\" \"Hey, at least you don't have to pay the ticket now!\" Tripp said, trying to lighten the mood. Ariel laughed and nodded. Santos rolled her eyes and retook her position by the window. The smoke in the room was beginning to be overpowering, and the medic came in to check the children and the civilians, and Ariel sat down beside the young boy. \"Hey. What's your name?\" she asked, leaning in close to him. \"I'm Hector. You?\" he replied in a quiet voice. Ariel smiled and she struck up a conversation with him and one of the children, Kirsten. Santos smiled slightly, before more thoughts of her little sister popped into her mind. God, If I had one more chance to see her , She thought. I would have made sure to have told her I love her. I don't remember the last time I told her somethin' sappy like that! Without her noticing, Tripp and Charge had taken places beside her. Tripp wrapped his arm around her shoulder and she gave them both a weak smile. She noticed the way Charge was looking at Ariel, and gave a little sigh. \"Better make the most of your rest, soldiers! We'll have to move soon.\" They heard Martinez yell from somewhere down the hall. An audible groan was heard throughout the station. Of course we will! She thought. 'Cause isn't that chapter 9 in The Art of War? Man, I wish I'd read that book! Hi! So I hope you like this chapter! It took me a while but I totally enjoyed writing it! I hope you like what I did with your characters! And yes, I know that some of them were not used, but we will get around to them in either the next chapter or the one after that! Now, Let me tell ya'll how this is gonna work. I am gonna write every uneven numbered chapter (1, 3, 5 and so on) and the fantabulous DanaIsis is gonna write every even chapter (2, 4, 6 and so on). DanaIsis is gonna BETA all of mine, and if she wants I will for hers to! Does everyone understand? Great! PS: DanaIsis, I am so super duper sorry about the mix up. You know what I am talkin' about! When I originally posted it was like 1am and I was to lazy to proof read. I must have clicked the wrong file when I uploaded it. I'm a moron. :( ANYWAY! READ AND REVIEW MY FRIENDS! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! :D[Chapter 3] The Art of War Disclaimer: Battle: Los Angeles isn't mine—it won't ever be. AN: So here is the first chapter from me. *dodges thrown objects* I'm so terribly sorry for this late update! It's not like me, but I had other personal things to attend to so that was my only priority. Anywho I hope you all enjoy my input along with the awesome New-Classic22 who allowed me to write this with her. you'll notice the jump back in time, and that's only because I like to start out with character development before I jump into battle—no pun intended—when I'm writing a story. So we've done it where we'll each have a set of OCs that will meet up fairly soon and then the story will flow quite nicely from there. Now this chapter is pre-attack, and the attack/action scenes won't come until the fourth chapter unless New-Classic22 decides to write it in chapter three. Anyway… Here it goes… Chapter 2: A Storm Is Coming The D Crew 90 Minutes before the attack… The Ink Spots \" I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire \" played on the overhead of the photography shop \"Take A Shot\". The owner, David Benjamin \"Benny\" Hernandez, quietly worked in the back room, developing photos for a friend. As he hung up each photo individually on the drying line in the dark room the Hispanic man's brown skin was tinged red in the lighting. The photography shop was David's way of getting away from military life. The photos he was developing weren't his own but a friend; Irn Papadakos. Irn was a regular customer and friend of David. The eighteen year old was only five years David's junior as he was currently a student at UCLA studying as a photography major and being that Irn hadn't had his own developing room or money to rent one out, Benny offered to help the kid out by doing it for him for free—in return Irn helped run the shop on days when Benny was busy—which was a lot. David took a look at the photos as they hung on the line. He stood back, crossing his arms across his chest as he admired the kid's work. Boys got real talent… he thought to himself as he looked over each and every shot. Yeah, real talent. \"No, no, no, no, no! Oh c'mon you cannot do this to me!\" the twenty-nine year old woman said as she slapped her palms against the steering wheel. \"I'm gonna kill Mikey…\" she seethed in anger. Mickey was her older brother who she had allowed to borrow her car, and she had just received it back from him yesterday. Her gas tank was full, but the engine light was flickering on and off. This was something she couldn't fix. She reached into her purse, rummaging through her compact mirror, hospital doctor's ID, and even an old Marine base ID she kept, until her fingers grasped what she was searching for—her cell phone. She dialed the numbers to AAA, and waited impatiently for someone to answer. Finally she heard a greeting on the receiving end and she expressed her issue. The operator told her she should expect them in about thirty to forty-five minutes. She wasn't up for waiting that long, but she had to grin and bear it. She tossed the phone back into the purse and looked around her to see what she was around. The sign in the building in front of her read \"Take A Shot\"; clever for a photography store. She threw on a smile and pressed on; she wasn't going to let her brother's antics get to her today. Allison exited the Impala and headed towards the store. She walked in and noticed the old style of the shop—it even had oldies music playing overhead, that voice was Otis Redding if she remembered correctly. \"Excuse me, how can I help you?\" Benny said upon noticing the dark haired women at the front desk, she had short black hair, and looked to be older than him, but not by much. Her attire showed a sort of professionalism—perhaps she was a doctor or a lawyer—for she wore a black cardigan, a green camisole, and black dress pants, she was much better dressed than his black shirt and blue jeans. \"Yeah,\" the woman spoke. \"My car broke down just outside and I called a tow truck—I was just wondering if it would be alright if I waited in here? The guy said he'd be here in 'bout half an hour…is that okay?\" David furrowed his brows in humor. \"Of course you can wait in here if that's the case—I'm David by the way.\" He held out a hand towards her with a smile on his face. \"This is my shop.\" \"Oh great, thanks a lot. I'm Allison,\" she said accepting the friendly gesture. \"It's a pretty cool place you got here.\" She took in the old style décor and nodded in approval. \"Well I'm just gonna look around until the guy gets here—maybe I'll end up buying something,\" she laughed. \"Hey no problem, if you need anything I'll be over here,\" he pointed over by the register. \"Cool thanks,\" Allison said as she smiled and wandered off to the lenses section while David went about his business. \"Hey Benny,\" came a young masculine voice as someone else walked in the shop. The boy was average height and slim. He had a girl with him of similar age; curly red hair, and green eye, she looked familiar to him. David looked towards the door to see it belonged to Irn who was telling something to the friend he walked in with. \"Oh hey Irn, perfect timing ya know,\" he said nodding towards Irn as he walked up to him. \"C'mon your photos should be dry by now.\" David said as they continued towards the back room. Irn's friend, Robin, looked over some of the photography belonging to David as she waited for them to return. For some reason she felt as if she had definitely seen him before. She would be sure to ask when they got back. At first Robin thought maybe David was a guy Irn liked, but she could tell he wasn't his type at all. No Irn usually went for the artsy types, and although David was a photographer she could tell he was very masculine, straight, and not artsy at all—just liked to take photos. David and Irn were flipping through the photos as they made their way back towards the front. \"Hey who's your friend?\" David asked as Irn looked over how each photo came out. \"Oh that's Robin, she's an artist too—mostly paintings. She's actually saving up to buy herself a gallery to showcase 'em—you should talk to her 'bout that,\" Irn said as they finally reached the front desk where Robin had made her presence known. \"Hi, I'm David so Irn tells me you're into art—you know I get the notion I've seen you before somewhere…\" David started. Robin nodded in agreement. \"Yeah—I think we have met before, but briefly, you look so familiar—wait, a couple months back I went to an art showcasing—I think you may have been there,\" Robin stated, everything coming back to her finally. \"Yeah, I did go to one a while back—you had a few pieces dealing with landscapes and such yeah? Not to mention your hair is hard to forget,\" David joked to her. \"Oh yeah, that was me—small world huh?\" Robin replied as she laughed and smiled at the memory. 30 Minutes before the attack… Allison was still waiting on the tow truck to arrive. She continued to walk around, browsing, until she came across a sticker in the window that read \" Semper Fidelis \" So he is or was a Marine, eh? Allison thought to herself. Her family was also Marines, so it only made sense for her to join when she was eighteen too. She was twenty-nine now, but her older brother was still enlisted whereas she was not. She walked over to the front desk where David was standing. \"So…'first of foot'…\" she started at him. \"'And right of line' he finished the marine slogan with a smirk on his face as he looked up from what he was doing to see Allison smirking at him as well. \"Are you…?\" He asked carefully. She laughed, \"No, I was a doctor when I was enlisted, so when I got out I became a doctor at a hospital—decided to keep it in the family,\" she giggled. \"How 'bout yourself?\" \"Oh I'm just on leave at the moment, but I'll be back in real soon I'm sure,\" he said to her. \"So how long wer—\" the ringing of the phone cut him off, the phone in his office was going off. \"Could you excuse me a minute?\" Allison nodded as David headed to his office. \"Take A Shot—how can I help ya?\" he answered on the phone. \"Hey, hey Benny Boy!\" Johnny, David thought to himself. He knew that voice anywhere. \"Hey Fig,\" David said suppressing a laugh. \"Oh ya know same 'ol, same 'ol. But Josh and I are on our way to pick up our weapons—ya tuned 'em up right?\" \"Yep, they're nice and tuned—say how far are you guys?\" David asked. In the basement of his photography shop, David also had a provision room where he kept some things like food, weapons, and things like that. And occasionally he would tune up his weapons for his Marine buddies and even a few of the local cops around here. \"We're 'bout ten minutes from the shop, that cool?\" Johnny said on the phone. \"Yeah, just come in through the back alright—don't need you guys scarin' off me customers with ya jarhead gear on,\" he laughed. \"Alright man, see ya soon then.\" And with that they hung up the phone. David made his way back out towards the front to see Irn rummaging through a bag he brought with him. \"Hey man you diggin' for buried treasure in there?\" David joked to his friend. Irn rolled his eyes and nodded. \"In a sense—yes,\" he said finally grasping something and pulling it out. \"Check it out, what do ya think?\" Irn pulled out an old style Rolleiflex 2.8F TLR. \"That is very nice Irn, where'd you pick this up?\" David said as Irn passed him the camera as he took out his cleaning kit and brushed it off for him a bit. \"My dad sent it to me—said he found it in this thrift store and knew I had to have it,\" he said as he watched David examine it. \"so you think it's any good? Will it work fine?\" \"Shoot—a beaut like this? Of course she'll work just perfectly,\" he said really admiring the camera. \"Here,\" he said handing it back to him. \"You take real good care of this alright?\" \"Oh I will,\" Irn said placing the camera back in its case, and then back in his bag. \"Robin I think I can take some really nice photos of your artwork with this,\" he said as she stood beside him. \"Yeah? Well we'll have to see, maybe with some decent photos of them I can send it to that that school I wanna go to for my semester abroad,\" she replied with a raise of her brow. David smiled at the two friends. He glanced at the clock and decided he ought to head downstairs to meet up with Fig and Josh. \"Hey Irn you mind holding down the fort for a minute? I've gotta head down to the basement for a bit,\" he asked him. \"Sure, no problem,\" he replied. \"Thanks,\" he said as he once again made a trip towards the back and to the basement. 15 Minutes before the attack… \"Hey Robin,\" Irn called out to his friend who sat next to him behind the desk. \"David's music is nice, but I'm not feeling it at the moment—would you mind grabbing my ipod from the car?\" he asked her pleadingly. \"Oh I know what ya mean, I will gladly do that,\" she said grabbing the keys from his hand and heading towards the front and out the door. She walked over to the dark green '71 Plymouth Road Runner, opened the door and unhooked Irn's ipod from the new stereo and exited the car. She headed back towards the shop, slowing down her pace as she watched the officer putting a ticket on the silver Nissan Pathfinder. The truck was parked directly in front of the store and no doubt in a fire zone. She figured it belonged to someone inside and rushed back in to let them know they were getting a ticket. \"Hey of anyone owns a silver truck…you're getting a ticket,\" she said loud enough for the couple of customers in the shop could hear her. \"Oh crap that's me!\" Allison exclaimed as she grabbed her purse and rushed outside. \"Hey, hey wait a minute this is not my fault!\" she said as she began defending her situation. \"Miss you're in a fire zone, didn't you see that fire hydrant right there?\" the officer asked her. \"Look Officer…Kashiwara, I can completely explain what happened here. My car just stalled and stopped on me—I honestly have no idea why, but I already have a tow truck on its way—\" She looked ahead and low and behold just a few blocks away was a AAA tow truck. \"See! It's right there, so no need to write me a ticket right?\" Officer Kashiwara looked at her with amusement and placed his ticket pad back in his pocket. \"Well if you're towing yourself outta here I guess not then,\" he said. \"But it's still in a tight spot, here, put it in neutral and we'll push it closer to the parking lot so the guy can get it hooked on alright, he suggested. \"Yeah, thanks a lot,\" she said breathing a sigh of relief. The last thing she needed was a ticket on her car—she already had three others all because of her brother. She went to put the car in neutral and the officer began pushing the car with her help. \"This looks really good Benny, thanks,\" Johnny said as he looked over his prized M4 Carbine. It looked brand new and even the sticker that read \"Marine's HooRah\" on it was nice looking. \"Yeah, it looks real good—thanks man,\" he said bumping his fist and giving him a man-hug. \"And Josh here's your M16A4—all nicely tuned up for ya as well,\" David said handing the assault rifle to him. \"Nice work man,\" Josh said to him. \"So when ya comin' back to us? Ya know the guys miss ya over there,\" he said with a hint of sarcasm in his tone of voice. \"Like I keep saying guys soon alright,\" David laughed as the three joked down in the basement. All of a sudden each was thrown off of their balance and fell to the ground as the floor shook beneath them. \"What the hell was that?\" Josh said steadying himself. \"That was not an earthqu—\" the floor once again shook and they stumbled a second time. \"Let's go check this out,\" David said hurrying upstairs to see what was going on. When they were up there, it seemed everyone was standing outside already. The three walked to join them only to see the drone like machines hovering in the sky a couple of blocks away. Buildings were already on fire, and people were running like chickens with their heads cut off—it was like a warzone. \"Well Benny boy…I guess you're coming back to us a bit sooner than ya thought.\" AN: There ya have it, chapter two written by moi. Lemme know your thoughts in a review or pm. Also any \"hate\" mail that was sent to New-Classic22 because of late updates is just ridiculous…Patience is a virtue—We have a lives outside of fanfic, and higher priorities (family issues, college life, etc.) as I'm sure you all do as well. So please don't send her things like that—it's unnecessary. By: DanaIsis[Chapter 4] It's in this silence; this total silence after a storm, where totally sane men and women lose their minds. They know that there's another storm coming, but they try to relish in the silence as long as they can, clinging to it. In this silence, they spend time pondering the men who didn't make it that far, their lost comrades. Their friends. This is what the lone group of soldiers was doing now. In the probably millisecond of silence in process, every warm body sitting in that bus had their heads lowered. Some were praying for the immortal souls of their lost brothers, others were crying for the lives of their love ones whose current status was unknown to them. Elena Santos in particular; she couldn't get the image of her 16 year old sister, her 27 year old Navy brother, and her sweet, kind-hearted mother from her mind, terrified of the possibility that they may have been taken. \"I'm sorry Hayley…\" She whispered into her gloves, cringing and rocking forward slightly. The tears in her eyes were stinging the tiny cuts down her cheeks, and she rested her forehead against the cool glass. She looked out at the ravaged buildings passing her by, and her eyes widened as a particular specific building came into view. Santos sat up a bit straighter, and raised her gun as she saw movement in one of the windows. \"My side, 12 o'clock! Santa Monica High School…\" She uttered the last part as almost a whisper to herself, looking around, feeling sick to her stomach. Teenagers strayed everywhere; burnt and decaying. She couldn't stand the thought that maybe one of them was her baby sister. The little girl she'd helped to raise, who she'd taught to ride a bike, and shoot a gun. The smart mouthed Sophomore who could fight like an Ox but still look as delicate as a daisy. Santos craned her neck to observe faces, just to be certain, although in some cases that was near impossible for the charred skin. \"They didn't get them out…\" Santos heard Ariana murmur from her seat beside Tripp. He simply nodded and kept his eyes trained on the building, just like every other armed soldier in the bus. Then, the silence was ended. The firing was confusing, since instead of there being a line of attacking enemy artillery and the defensive attempts of all in the bus, there was a third line of fire coming from a makeshift structure on the baseball pitch, under a bleacher. Maybe two guns, one being wielded by a practiced hand and the other by an amateur, no doubt at all in anyone's mind. Tripp easily removed the head of a hostile force, Charge hitting square in one of the bastards' heart, and eventually, the only ones left were those in the bus. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, aside from the few who had acknowledged the strange firing anomaly. The two who chose to acknowledge it happened to be Santos and Staff Sargent Nantz. Nantz jumped from the bus, closely followed by the Air force officer, and they both advanced on the bleachers with weapons raised. However, when they heard the loud sob and the gentle cooing of another, they knew that there was no need to be suspicious. They entered the structure, hearing the cocking of a gun, and Nantz shouted out in his usual gruff voice \"US Marines…\" and Santos heard the sound that made her heart stop. \"We need some help!\" I strong yet oddly vulnerable voice shouted. She and Nantz dropped their weapons and Santos embraced the girl, not even needing to check who it was before she wrapped her in her arms. \"Lena!\" The girl cried, hugging her tightly before letting go and moving back to the boy and girl she had been sitting between. Santos smiled with relief, before dropping to her knees to look at the two kids she'd seen in their house Oh So Often in such a different situation. The boy on the ground had a hole burning into his abdomen and was groaning in agony, while the girl was shaking and holding an automatic rifle as though it was a king cobra. ","Summary":" Hey! So I think that Battle: Los Angeles in a really under appreciated movie. I thought it was amaz"},{"Movie":"Prom Night","Title":"Dearest Donna","Author":"dog-tooth","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6126454","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: This is just an idea that came to me one night when trying to get to sleep. In the film they say that Donna received letters from Richard when he was in prison, so this is my take on what these letters might have said. December 2 nd Dearest Donna, It has only been a few weeks since I have been so cruelly taken away from you and already my heart feels as if it is broken. I understand why I'm in prison, of course I do. I killed your family. However what I did was not wrong because I did it for the right reasons. I did it for you Donna. The reason I did I was so that we could finally be together. Your family was getting in the way and I knew that if they were not around, swaying your decisions, then we would be able to carry on our lives together. In time I know that you will come to forgive me. What is it that scares you so much about me? Is it the fact that I'm older then you? Because if it is then you don't need to worry. Age is no matter, my sweet. It's what we feel for each other that counts above all else. Our love is stronger then any mere boundaries of age. As I write this letter to you, I am thinking of our life that could have been. I just hope that there's still the chance for it to happen. You and I could do great things, I just know it. I mean, we would have been happy together Donna, you have to understand that. I could give you the world. Money, love, attention, safety, you'd have it all. Anything you asked for, I would be willing to give to you. In this prison, I have nothing to do but think, and my thoughts are only of you. What else would I have to think about? I have no family to speak of. I have no friends, inside or outside this prison. There is only you. I must finish this letter off now my love, but I will write to you soon. I hope that you reply to this. I need to know that you're okay. I love you. Yours forever and always, Richard. X December 9 th Dearest Donna, I have had no reply from you to my last letter, and I'm starting to worry. I need to know how you are. I'm scared for you Donna. It must be hard to cope with not only the loss of your family, but the loss of me as well. I killed your family so that we could be together, and then I am taken away from you as well. I just hope that you are managing to cope without me. Life hasn't become any easier for me. Prison life is harder then you might think. Although I'd hardly call it a prison. Everyone in here seems to be crazy and I'm confused as to why I've been placed in here. The love I have for you is not something that could be deemed crazy. I just love you so dearly Donna. Without you, I would probably rot away in this prison, but the thought of being reunited with you again makes me want to carry on living, just for you. Sometimes, late at night, I think about touching you, and it feels so good. I can imagine my fingers tracing your skin and holding you close to my body. I want to kiss you. I want to feel your lips against mine. I want to taste you on my tongue. Oh, Donna. If only you knew how much I longed for you, not only mentally but physically. One day, we'll be together again Donna, just you wait. Yours forever and always, Richard. X December 20 th Dearest Donna, It's been two months since I've last seen you and you're not replying to any of my letters. I'm not sure what to think. Is it your family? Are they stopping you from reading them? Maybe you're not even receiving them... Or is it just the fact that you do not want to reply to me? I hope that this is not the reason Donna, because otherwise I would have no reason to live. I know that you feel something for me. I mean, you must. I've seen it in your eyes when you're looking at me. I think that you are simply scared. You can't have ever experienced love like this before and it must be a scary thing. Be brave Donna, be brave for me. Yours and forever, Richard. X December 25 th Donna, Merry Christmas my love. Was there any point in writing that Donna? I need to know. Please reply to me. Your lack of replies leaves an empty, cavernous hole in my chest. I need you Donna, please. I'm begging you. Please. Richard. X January 2nd Donna, Why aren't you replying Donna? I need you to reply! It's a new year. A new start. I want to start the New Year with you Donna. It's bad enough that I'm stuck in this hell hole of a prison, but not to spend it with you, only makes it even worse. You're not even replying to my letters. Why not? Are you that heartless, that you can't even send me a letter to say that you are okay? Do you not care about me? I think about you more then ever. I think about you touching me, and I enjoy it so much, but I know that it would be better in real life. When I meet you again for the first time in over two months, that's the first thing I'm going to do. Touch you. Maybe not in a sexual way at first. At first I'll just touch you, just to know that you're still alive, but the first night that we spend together I'll touch you in places that you've never been touched before. I'll make you feel so loved, Donna. The things you and I could do. Write to me soon Donna, or I will start to lose the will to live. Forever yours, Richard. X January 11 th Donna, If you don't reply to me within a week then I'm going to have to take matters into my own hands, and check that you are alright. People will get hurt Donna, so I suggest that you take the time out of your petty little life of yours to reply to my letters. Your only love, Richard. January 18 th Donna, The date is here, yet I still have no reply from you. Therefore you know that I have no choice but to see myself how you are. I can't say too much in this letter, for fear that you're not even receiving this, but I'm going to be seeing you soon Donna, don't worry. We'll be reunited. Richard. January 19 th Donna... I refuse to believe what I've been told by the guards here at the prison. They say that I must stop writing to you. The reason why: because you say that the letters I am sending you are unwanted and uncalled for. Really Donna? I don't understand. Please, make me understand. The letters that I sent you were not threatening in any way. I never threatened you. I only told you the truth. I only revealed the feelings that I have for you. What's wrong with that? Oh, Donna. Where did it all go wrong? What happened? I tried to escape, just to see you. I got an extra couple of months added to my sentence, just so that I could see you. They caught me. I don't know how, but somehow they knew that I was trying to escape and managed to stop me. Maybe what the guards say is true. Maybe you don't want to talk to me. It's okay. I won't write to you anymore, but one day we will meet again Donna, don't you worry. One day you'll have to face me and on that day you'll realise that we are meant to be together. I'll be seeing you real soon Donna. I have months to prepare and this time I'll be ready. I promise you that I will be seeing you again, and Donna, I don't break my promises. Ever. Forever waiting, Richard. X What do you think? I'm still thinking of adding to it and improving. Reviews would be most welcome. :) Thanks for reading. A/N: 11.07.10. Just to let you know that I've made some changes to January 19th, but also added an extra letter on January 18 th . EDIT: I'm thinking of perhaps writing some diary entries that Richard might have written as well. Does anyone think that this is a good idea? Let me know :)[Chapter 2] A/N: These diary entries are set before the letters. Therefore most of the entries will also be set before the events that unfold in the movie. Diary entries Tuesday 15 th September Something amazing has happened. It's so great that I feel the need to write it down, just so I know that it's real. I met a girl in one of my first science lessons today. She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Her name's Donna Keppel. She has the brightest blue eyes I've ever seen and beautiful blonde hair. The only problem is that she's only thirteen. It's too young, I know it is, but already I love her so much. I'm unsure of what to do. It doesn't help that I'm here teacher. Right now it seems that all these strong feelings I have towards her are useless. What's the point in loving her the way I do if I can't show these feelings towards her? The only thing that I can do right now is to bide my time. Maybe these emotions will pass. In a way I hope that they don't. They're such strong feelings and I like the fact that I feel them for her. Love is such an amazing thing. You probably think I'm stupid, don't you? Normal people don't fall in love with someone after only knowing them for a few hours. Then again maybe I'm not normal. I don't really care. The feelings that I have for Donna are real, I know that. I just need to wait to see if they'll stay. Tuesday 22 nd September It's been a week and the feelings that I feel for Donna haven't changed. In fact, if anything, they've become stronger. I've had three lessons with her so far and each time I see her my heart skips a beat. She always looks so angelic as she sits at her desk. In the brief time that I've known her, I've managed to work out that she's very clever. It also seems that she is very good at Science, which is good to know. It means that at least we have something in common. I think that she's starting to notice the way I look at her. However I'm not too sure whether she likes me or not. When she catches me staring at her she always blushes and looks away embarrassed. This embarrassment that she feels when she knows I'm looking at her could mean anything. It could mean that she's pleased that I like to look at her but it could mean that she doesn't like it. There doesn't seem to be a way to show how she feels. Nonetheless I don't think she's suspicious of me. I say that as if I am doing something wrong. I'm not though. I only look at her. Nothing is wrong with that. Thursday 24 th September It seems that Donna is starting to notice how much attention I am paying to her. However she doesn't seem to be taking it too well. I try to talk to her as much as possible but whenever she sees me coming near her she looks uncomfortable and turns her head away. Maybe it's just because she's confused about why I keep paying so much attention to her. I wish I could just tell her how I feel. I can't though because it would just freak her out, of course it would. I don't want to scare her away but I just don't know what to do. I can't keep all of these feelings bottled up anymore. Sometimes it feels like I'm just going to explode with all the love that I feel for her. I just wish things weren't so complicated and that Donna was older. If she was older then it would mean that I would be able to tell her my feelings and she could maybe tell me how she felt about me. However I feel as if she is too young to be able to know what she feels. Plus if I tell her how I feel and she tells someone else then surely I won't be able to see Donna anymore. I wouldn't be able to cope if that ever happened. Saturday 26 th September It's so wrong but it feels so right. I had to see her, I just had to. It's a Saturday today, meaning that I couldn't see Donna. I needed to see if she was okay, so I decided to go and see her. I'd already memorised her address, so today I went round to her house and waited outside in my car. When I saw her leaving the house I just felt so happy. I've found out that when I'm not around her I feel miserable, so the elated feeling that came when seeing her felt so good. Therefore when she got in the car with her mother I had to follow her. It was interesting to see what Donna did when she was out of school. I found out several things about her, just by watching her from a distance. I found that she likes to read. This I worked out by watching her go into the library and come back out with a bag full of books. She also seems to like Chinese food as she went into a Chinese restaurant food for lunch. I have to admit that although it felt wrong to be following her, it also felt incredibly good. I love knowing what Donna is up too because it makes me feel even closer to her. Maybe I'll be able to see her each day. Then I'll always be happy and I'll never feel lonely. Monday 28 th September Today I was sitting at my desk whilst Donna and the rest of the class worked from the textbooks and I started randomly doodling. When I looked down and saw what I had drawn I realised that I'd unconsciously been drawing Donna. That pretty much sums up how I feel about Donna. Even unconsciously I think about her. The love runs that deep. I've decided to keep the drawing I did of her, along with a school photograph of her that I took from the computer. I just need to see her face everyday. Tuesday 29 th September I can't stop thinking about Donna. Every time I think of her, my chest hurts from the vast amount of love that I feel towards her. I want her to know how I feel, more then anything but its too hard. It would just make everything complicated. I sat outside her house after school for several hours, just watching her move about the house. She doesn't leave her room much so it's always hard for me to see her. However the brief glimpses that I get of her are enough to keep me happy, at least for now. I know a lot about her family now as well. She has a mother, father and a younger brother. From what I've seen of the interactions that go on between them, she seems to get on relatively well with them, although she has the occasional argument with her brother. Her family seems nice but I know that they'll get in the way if I ever choose to tell Donna how I feel. I have the feeling that Donna wouldn't hesitate in telling her mother if she was worried about something. This worries me, but I can't dwell on it too much. At the moment it's just better to think about the present, not the future. Friday 2 nd October I now have so many wonderful pictures of Donna. When I got paid yesterday, the first thing I bought was a camera. I knew that I needed to capture all of the moments in Donna's life. The pictures that I took yesterday and today are now plastered across my walls. Therefore I can now see her every time that I walk around the house. It's a lovely feeling to think that she's always looking at me. I've also started writing schedules of what Donna does each day. I figured that the pictures could be added alongside the writing. It will be like a journal of Donna. Already I've filled a whole notepad with various things about her. I write down different fantasies I have about her. Some of them are just about being able to hold her in my arms but some are more personal. I've even written several poems about her. My life is consumed by her. If I'm not at home writing things about her, then I'm at school teaching her or I'm outside her house watching over her. You'd think it would bother me but it doesn't, not one bit. The love I feel consumes me and I feel as if without Donna there's nothing else to live for. She's my world. Tuesday 6 th October I nearly messed it all up. Yesterday, when I was sitting outside Donna's house, I saw Donna looking out through her window. Although I ducked I knew that she saw me. I was stupid because I didn't drive away. Instead I sat there like an idiot. After a few minutes the front door opened and her father came marching out. Immediately I drove away but I knew that he saw me. Today, at school, the headmaster asked to see me regarding Donna. He told me that both her father and Donna had seen me outside the house and wondered what I was doing there. I lied of course and said that my cousin lived nearby and I was just waiting for them. However, apparently her father had seen me several times outside their house. The lies came naturally but I knew that the headmaster didn't believe me. However, seeing as I hadn't really done anything wrong he couldn't do anything so he just told me that he was going to keep an eye on me. Although I'm pleased that he didn't sack me I'm upset that I can't wait outside Donna's house anymore. Already I've filled up lots of journals with pictures and information on Donna and to not be able to add to it just makes me upset. I'm thinking about just telling Donna how I feel. Maybe she'll understand. You see, I think she's starting to develop feelings for me. Sometimes she looks at me and there's such a kindness in her eyes. I know that it's reserved for me only. Friday 9 th October It's over. It's all over. I might as well be dead. What's the fucking point in anything anymore? Why am I even alive? I hate them! I hate them. Why didn't they just kill me as well? That would have been easier. Oh, Donna. I need you. I love you. Donna! Please, take me back... I'm sorry... Saturday 10 th October I still feel as bad as I did yesterday, maybe even worse, but I have to write this down. I have to write down what happened because I need to try and understand it. A few days ago I told Donna how I felt about her. I expected her to be happy about it but she wasn't. She started crying. I don't know why she started crying. I think that she was scared and it was too much. I tried to calm her down by touching her arm but she started screaming. One of the teachers came in and Donna told them what I'd said. It broke my heart when she told the teacher how I felt about her. The words I spoke to her were personal, meant for her ears only, but she told someone else. I wanted to hurt someone so badly then but I didn't want to scare Donna so I just stood there as the teacher went to get the headmaster. Almost instantly they decided to fire me. I thought this was bad enough but then Donna told them about how she thought she'd seen me taking a picture of her when I was outside her house. They asked to see my camera. I refused but they said they'd call the police if I didn't hand it over. They saw the hundreds of pictures that I had taken of Donna and then they called the police. I'm due in court next week. My lawyer says that I won't be put in Prison but apparently they're getting some kind of order out on me so that I can't see Donna. I'm hoping that the court won't let that happen. I wouldn't be able to stand it if I could never see Donna again. I love her so much. I love her more then life itself. Why can't they see that? Why can't she see that? I hate everything about life itself right now. I just want to lash out at everyone. Everyday I'm just so angry. The next week is going to be hell. I hate waiting and my patience is wearing thin. Soon I won't be able to cope anymore. Friday 16 th October The Courts have decided I'm not allowed to see Donna. Therefore I've decided that I have no choice. This is their fault. I'm going to have to make Donna realise how she feels about it. She's going to have to find out the hard way. You see I've worked it out. It's her family, yeah, her family. They're the ones stopping her from realising her feelings for me. Without her family she'll have no one. Without her family, she'll be able to realise that I'm all she has. I'm the only one who's ever going to love her. With them out of the picture Donna and I can be together at long last. Nothing can keep us apart. Soon, all she'll have is me and then we'll be together forever. Me and my precious Donna. A/N: This is dedicated to 'Witch isit,' 'Arabellatrixcutie' who reviewed. However a special thanks goes to 'Blackspade003' for reviewing and saying that it would be a good idea to write this. :) I hope you guys like it.[Chapter 3] Love kills 22 nd October Tomorrow is going to be an important day for me. Well, not only me but Donna as well. Tomorrow is the day that I'm going to be with Donna forever. It will be just me and her, just like I promised. You see I've made a plan. Well, I wouldn't quite call it a plan, more of an idea. The idea is that I'm going to kill Donna's family. Why you ask? So that we can be together. Isn't it obvious? Her family's holding her back and keeping her away from me. Without her family Donna will realise that the love they felt for her was nothing compared to the love that I feel for her. No one will ever love Donna as much as I love her. No one. Through realising this Donna will find out that she'll have to be with me and then she'll realise that she loves me. 23 rd October I sat in my car outside Donna's house, waiting. I wanted to check that everybody was in. My eyes scanned the driveway and I saw that there was a car parked there, meaning that at least one person was definitely at home. However I didn't know whether it meant everyone was there. For all I knew her father could be somewhere else. Because of this fact, I waited for a few minutes and stared up at the house. After a while I saw Donna's mother pass by the window upstairs, followed by her father who was going in the opposite direction. I took this as confirmation that everybody was home and stepped out of the comforting warmth of my car. The cold air meant that I could see my breath escalate out my mouth and I watched it spiral up into the black sky, until it eventually disappeared from sight. I took another deep breath before I walked confidently up the driveway and towards the house. Without hesitation I rang the doorbell and waited for the door to open. Whilst I waited I reached into my pocket and took out a large kitchen knife, holding it tightly in my hands. Eventually the door opened up, revealing Donna's father standing in the doorway. He gasped and took a step backwards as he saw me. \"Hello,\" I said quietly before running forwards and moving the knife towards his chest. He moved his hands upwards, trying to stop the knife from killing him in one go. Therefore instead of stabbing him in the chest I ended up leaving a large cut on his hand. At that moment I was going too fast towards him to stop so I crashed into him and we both went hurtling forwards before falling to the floor. Once again I tried to stab him but he rolled over and managed to stand up. I stood up as well and faced him. His back was towards the sofa and I knew that this was the perfect opportunity. Running towards him for the second time I launched myself at him, this time with the intention of going for his neck. As we both toppled over the seat, I slashed at his neck with one swift movement causing blood to gush from his throat. For a while I lay on the floor with Donna's dad, watching as the blood poured from his neck. Eventually I watched as his body went limp and his eyes became lifeless. He was dead. By this point I was breathing hard and was wondering why nobody had come downstairs to see what all the commotion was about. I noticed that the television was on but it wasn't loud enough to cover up all the sound that we'd been making, even if it was on the rugby channel. Before I stood up I paused to wipe the bloodied knife on Donna's father's shirt. Once satisfied that it was clean I walked towards the stairs. However before I could get there I noticed several pictures of Donna on a shelf. I smiled at them and picked one of them up. She had such a beautiful smile. I'd missed her so much. With a small sigh I put down the picture and made my way stealthily up the stairs. I had a job to do. From two sides of the upstairs hallway I could hear different sounds. From one side there came the sound of a television playing but from the other side came the sound of classical musical. This was obviously why they hadn't heard anything that had happened downstairs. Before I could make the decision on where to go first I saw that the door to the room in front of me was open. This had to be Donna's room. I walked forwards and stuck my head cautiously inside, my breath coming out of me in a big sigh as I realised that Donna wasn't there. Where the hell was she? I decided to not dwell on this, instead choosing to take this opportunity to have a brief look around Donna's room. Slowly I looked around, trying to soak up as much of the room as possible. The walls were a light blue, whilst the carpet was cream coloured. She had a large, double bed with blue and white striped covers. Also in the room was a white wardrobe and a small chest of drawers. Everything else in the room was personal items that belonged to Donna such as jewellery and pictures of her friends and family. As I looked around the place where Donna spent most of her life when she was at home, I couldn't help but feel even closer to her. It'd been over two weeks since I'd last seen her and already I missed her like crazy. My life had been so depressing and lacklustre without being able to see her. Walking over to her drawer, I was about to open it when I heard the sound of somebody talking. Cautiously I went back over to the door and looked down the corridor. I saw Donna's little brother lying on his bed, watching some kind of film on the television. Obviously he was talking to himself. I decided that I better not waste any more time, so I held the knife even more tightly in my hand and walked slowly over to the boy's bedroom. Once I was inside I tapped the boy on his shoulder and watched the fear fill his eyes as he looked up at me. He wasn't scared for how long however. Within a few seconds I had slit his throat with one easy slash to the neck. It was strange how he died even quicker then his father. A quiet, yet audible gasp of terror came from behind me and I turned quickly, seeing Donna's mother standing in the hallway. I hadn't noticed that the classical music had stopped. \"Hello,\" I said, repeating what I'd first said to her husband. \"My son,\" she sobbed, fear making her voice shake. \"What have you done to my son?\" All of a sudden her feet collapsed from underneath her and she fell to the floor. I took this as my opportunity to move towards her. Harshly I grabbed onto her hair, dragging her towards her bedroom. She was screaming but I didn't care. Nobody would hear it, not in a house where everybody was dead. Once in her bedroom I slammed the door behind me and threw her onto her bed. She'd stopped screaming by this point but she was still crying, her eyes fixed to the knife that I held in my hand. She must have realised that it was covered in her son's blood. \"Where's Donna?\" I asked her, waving the knife slightly in the air. Her eyes watched my every movement but she didn't answer me. \"Where is she?\" I shouted, advancing towards her. Just as I was in front of her, she suddenly jumped upwards and pushed me, causing me to stumble. She then ran towards the door and opened it up before running out into the corridor. I ran quickly after her, just in time to see her run into Donna's room and slam the door behind her. Luckily she wasn't so strong, so with a couple of kicks to the door I managed to get into the room. She stumbled and fell to the floor from the force. I leant down and grabbed her roughly by the throat. I'd had enough of this. \"She belongs to me,\" I said, staring at her tear stained face. \"Where is she?\" She didn't say anything. \"I know you know! You're her mother. Now, tell me where she is.\" Her eyes glazed over for a second and she stared off into space. \"She's at a sleepover,\" she eventually replied, her eyes coming back to focus on mine. She must've seen something in my eyes because she spoke again. \"Please, don't,\" she begged, but I'd had enough. I moved the knife forwards and stabbed her repeatedly in the chest until I was certain that she was dead. Blood was pouring from the wounds on her body and I quickly moved away, not wanting to get even more blood on my clothes. Standing up I took one last look around the room before running back downstairs. What was I meant to do now? If Donna's mother had indeed been correct about Donna being at a sleepover then how he was meant to find her? She could be anywhere. I sighed and sat down on the sofa, kicking Donna's father out of the way so I could rest my feet on the floor. My head was pounding and the strong, coppery smell of blood was starting to make me feel slightly sick. I rested my head in my hands as I contemplated what I was to do. This hadn't worked out the way I had wanted it too. In fact it was a complete shambles. I'd expected Donna to be at home so that I could take her away. However, with her being at a sleepover I would be forced to wait until she came back. Looking around I realised that it would mean I'd be staying overnight in a house with three dead people. However as I sat there with my head in my hands I heard the faint sound of sirens in the distance. They were getting louder and louder with each passing second. I stood up quickly and was about to walk over to the door when I saw someone run past me. They were in such a rush that they didn't see me as I was partially covered by the wall. As I got a brief look at the face of the person I swear that for a moment my heart stopped. It was Donna. Quickly regaining my senses I ran out of the door after her, slamming the door behind me. \"Donna!\" I cried, grabbing her by the shoulders and turning her around to face me. She screamed at my touch but her scream grew even louder when she saw my face. \"Shh,\" I whispered harshly to her. I didn't want the neighbours to hear her and think that something was wrong. Then I realised that something was wrong. For a brief moment I'd forgotten that I'd killed her family. \"Oh Donna,\" I whispered, more kindly this time. \"I'm so sorry, but it had to be done.\" She struggled in my arms but I simply held her tightly against me. \"Why did you kill them?\" she sobbed, pressing her hands against my chest in an attempt to move away from me. \"I love you Donna. I wanted us to be together. In time you'll learn to love me, I know you will.\" She started to scream at me once again. \"I don't love you. I love my family and you killed them!\" I was about to speak when once again I heard the sirens. However they were much louder this time. \"We have to leave Donna.\" \"No!\" she screamed, pummelling my chest with her hands. It made no difference to me and I could barely feel it. Instead I ignored her and grabbed her roughly by the arm before pulling her down the driveway and towards my car. Before we could get there a police car appeared at the end of the road, its sirens blazing. As I looked towards the end of the road I saw another police car appear. I cursed under my breath. \"Did you call the police?\" I asked her. She shook her head but I wasn't sure that I believed her. As I reached into my pocket to retrieve my knife I found that it wasn't there. I cursed again as I realised I'd left it inside the house. \"Come on!\" I shouted at her, dragging her back towards the house. However as I tried to open the door I found that it was locked. \"Where's the key?\" I asked Donna desperately. \"I don't know,\" she replied hesitantly. \"Where is it?\" I shouted at her, shaking her roughly. \"I don't know,\" she replied again, tears coming to her eyes. \"Damn! What the hell are we meant to do now?\" I hissed angrily, more to myself then to Donna. \"Sir, let go of the girl.\" I turned sharply towards the voice. Two police officers were standing in the driveway, pointing guns at me. I ignored them and didn't let go of her. \"Just leave us okay. Nothing's happening here.\" The police officer spoke again. \"Just let go of her, okay. Nobody has to get hurt.\" \"No one's going to get hurt. Just leave us alone.\" \"You're Richard Fenton right?\" The other police officer asked, looking suspiciously at me. I didn't answer him but he must've taken this as confirmation as they started to walk towards us. \"You're breaking the terms of your order Mr Fenton.\" Desperately I grabbed onto Donna to try and stop the Police officers from advancing forwards. It didn't work however and they both grabbed me and started to pull me away from Donna. \"Stop it!\" I shouted, as they pushed me to the ground. \"Donna!\" The police officers were saying something to me but all I could hear were Donna's sobs. Whilst I was on the floor my arms were forced behind my back and handcuffs were placed over my wrists. I started shouting louder as they pulled me up and started to drag me over to the police car. \"Donna!\" I shouted. \"Don't let them do this. Don't let them take me away from you. I love you!\" She stared at me for a moment, her eyes blank and emotionless, but then she turned away from me and walked back towards the house. In that brief moment I felt my chest constrict in pain. How could she just turn away from me? I loved her. As I was pushed into the back of the police car I continued to stare at Donna as she talked to another police officer. She was so beautiful that she took my breath away but she didn't seem to realise this. Maybe she was simply ignorant. Either way I knew that I wouldn't be seeing Donna for a long time. Once the police officers realised what was inside the house then I'd be locked up. However I didn't care. The reason being that I knew I'd be able to escape. I was desperate to be with Donna and nothing could stop me. At that moment Donna looked over at me and I smiled, showing my teeth. I watched as she frowned before I clearly mouthed six words at her, causing her to shiver. \"I'll be seeing you soon Donna.\" The door to the police car was closed and the police officer got in the front, starting the car up. I stared and smiled at Donna until the car disappeared round the corner and I could see her beautiful face no longer. My smile didn't falter once, not even when I was arrested for killing Donna's family. You see, I love Donna no matter what, so to me it made no difference that I was away from her for a while. After all it wouldn't be long till we'd be reunited. What's that saying that people have? Oh, I remember. Third time's the charm, right Donna? A/N: Okay, so here it is.

Segen watched as Gerry clambered out of the boat as the snow continued to fall. She ignored the chill in favor of smiling as he went to embrace his children, his wife - his family. Her smile was only half-false, though. She was momentarily distracted by a sharp pain in her chest. It made the falseness in her smile come out a bit more, but she was happy for Gerry. She was. He'd saved her life. He'd gotten to come back to his family. But the pang in her chest distracted her from the ache in her left wrist, where her hand had once been. It didn't hurt as bad anymore, but the ache that was left over from the sudden and unexpected amputation would probably never fade - not really , because you just don't get over something like that. And she knew this. She understood it all too well. But what she didn't understand was the irregular, erratic throbbing in her chest. It was like her heart was hurting, hurting more than she actually was. She wondered if it had been from the injection, from the sickness she'd been given, in order to survive in the world full of those gone-rabid shells that used to house human beings. She figured it wasn't that, though. Because the pain she was feeling was somewhat familiar. Familiar enough that she pushed it to the back of her mind and focused on what was going on outside of her existence. Gerry pulled away from his kids, a smile on his face as Segen clambered out of the boot and steadied herself in the shallow water. The sand crunched under her boots as she stood up straight, cracking her neck as she twisted it from side to side as the man who had saved her from becoming one of those - those things - turned his head to look at her. Segen didn't think that he knew how lucky he was at that moment. Maybe he had some idea, but he had his family - his daughters, his wife - in his arms and they weren't dead. She had lost people - friends. Long-dead family. And he was so lucky . \"Karin, girls, little man,\" he said, not leaving them - only smiling at the Israeli soldier as they looked up at her. The younger looking one's eyes shot up towards her head, and Segen had to resist the urge to frown back down at her. Segen didn't like children that much. No - that wasn't the right way to say it. Children - it didn't matter how old they were - made her . . . made her feel uncomfortable . They didn't know any better. They didn't have any idea what the real world was like. They didn't know shit . And that - that was what she didn't like about children. They weren't supposed to know anything. They got in the way, they didn't know what was what - she knew this. And that was why she had to keep herself from frowning. \"Who's this, Gerry?\" The woman, who the Israeli soldier presumed to be his wife, Karin, looked exhausted - as exhausted as she felt. She probably was, from all the worrying she must have done while waiting for her husband to come back to her. \"This woman, she's from Israel,\" Gerry answered. \"She's a soldier. 'Name's Segen.\" \"You're a soldier?\" Karin asked. She seemed dubious. But she was used to that. \"You're name is Segen ?\" the smallest one asked. \"You're a soldier?\" the older girl wondered. She tried her best not to sigh at their naïvety, despite everything that had happened since - since whenever this whole disaster had happened . The boy kept quiet. He just continued to watch her, holding the older girl's hand. This didn't slip Gerry's notice, but Karin and the younger sister were somewhat oblivious. Segen just smiled as best she could and nodded. \"I'm Karin,\" the woman said, remembering manners that usually would have been forgotten at a time like this - with rabid humans (zombies. She had to remember to call them zombies , since there was no cure, and they weren't really people anymore) running around and biting people who weren't terminally ill. Immediately, she wiped her mind of any thought relating to what the W.H.O doctors had done to her - had injected her with. Thinking about it wouldn't do anyone any good. \"And this is Tommy,\" the small Hispanic boy just continued to look at her at the mention of his name. \"These two are Constance and Rachel. It's . . . nice to meet you, Segen.\" Karin had pointed out each of the children with slight movements of her chin, indicating which name belonged to whom. Segen nodded. Her smile eventually faded as the family, once again, embraced. She felt awkward, watching this. It felt private. It felt like her presence was unnecessary. She'd done her part, she'd gotten rescued. She'd gotten out of there. She was sick, but she wasn't one of those things (zombies). She turned to leave, to get back on the boat (because she really didn't picture herself staying on an aircraft carrier or with Gerry's family, even if she had tried to save him a few times, but she was, essentially, useless, and no help to anyone with just one hand, even if it was her right hand, and she was right handed), because she wanted to get out of there. But the little one, Constance - the smallest of the three children - spoke up before she could leave. No need to keep the soldiers who held a backpack of supplies for her waiting. \"Is Se - Se - is that your real name? Are you gonna leave now? Because if you saved Daddy then you can stay with us back on that ship.\" Karin looked like she didn't really care what happened to the soldier, and that was fine. Gerry opened his mouth to answer, but the Israeli could do it herself. She was useless to them , as a fighter, as a soldier - but she still had her voice. Her vocal cords hadn't been cut out of her throat. Segen shook her head, the expression on her face growing grim. There was no trace of happiness in it, unlike the looks of the family reunited. She was not a part of this family. She couldn't be. She was useless ; who would want a soldier with one hand ? A limp, a twitch, a stomach bug - those were things you could have that wouldn't make you completely useless. You could deal with this. A woman with one hand? Worthless. \"I will be heading off on my own,\" Segen answered the girl, ignoring the beginnings of Gerry's protests. She silenced him with a look - no, a glare was more like it. \"You won't see me again.\" \"Why? You can still fight - they'd let you stay, wouldn't they, Daddy?\" The older girl - Rachel - looked to her father. She looked shaken, pale. Just like her mother. The boy was solemn - quiet. He looked like the Israeli had - when she had lost everyone. She knew that look. She could only imagine what pain he was feeling, yet she did her best not to. She didn't know this boy. It was not her place to guess the amount of pain that he was in over losing his family - or whomever he had lost - though it looked like he'd been taken in by Gerry's family. \"I have a backpack, of supplies,\" Segen jerked her head in the direction of the boat, which was still waiting on them - she was sure they were all going back, but maybe they could drop her off somewhere nearby. Maybe. \"If I can be dropped off somewhere away from the ports, I will be fine.\" Probably not, but she could make her own. \"No, we can take you back to the carrier,\" a soldier, from behind the family, called to her. Her eyes went to him. \"You need a few more things, before you go. 'Sides, don't you want a bunk for the night?\" Segen didn't know what to say. Honestly, she didn't want to say anything. She'd never spoken so much around people she knew so little about. It irked her, but Gerry had saved her. Saved her from becoming one of those things (zombies), saved her from being left behind, had helped her with amputated hand - if it weren't for him, she would have been dead. Dead and gone, most likely one of those things. \"C'mon, since you're only staying for a while, I'm sure Thierry will let you stay a night and give you some more things - you won't survive long with just that little pack.\" Gerry gave her a half-smile. The idea was tempting, but Segen could take care of herself, now that she was infected with something else, something from the W.H.O doctors - now that she was camouflaged. But they were having none of her reasons - reasons that, in the soldier's and family's eyes, seemed like excuses. Hardly . Segen shook her head, helpless, apparently, as it seemed that her fate, for the time being, was decided. Americans, she thought, with a sigh as the family headed towards the boat, hearing another not far off - probably for the soldiers. Were these people always so insistent?[Chapter 2] Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it. Gerry had somehow managed to get Segen a bunk, no matter how much she had protested that someone else needed it more than her. The man Gerry use to work for - Thierry, she thought was his name, the man of the United Nations - had declared that after going through all she had gone through - being bitten, losing her hand, being infected with a terminal illness in order not to get attacked by those soulless shells wandering ( zombies ) about in the world outside the aircraft carrier - had cleared a space for her. He'd had doctors attend to her left wrist, but there was nothing more they could do for her, other than to provide her with painkillers for when she chose to depart. The bunk she'd been given was among that of a large, somewhat whiny family and another, smaller, quieter one that took what was given without complaint. Gerry and his family were to also depart in the morning, to a safe zone at Freeport, Nova Scotia. He had been treated for his illness - for the pathogen he had infected himself with - but she had done the \"dumb thing\", as one of them would probably forever call it. She had declined the rather persistent offer of being offered a treatable pathogen. Instead, she had requested something permanent (one that would not spread), something that would kill her slowly - only because she knew she wouldn't be able to stay in one of those safe zones, if any at all truly existed (and if they did, she didn't trust them to stay safe for longer than a month or so). The W.H.O doctors had berated her for her apparent stupidity, but when her mind hadn't been changed by nearly ten minutes of attempted (and failed) persuasion, they had provided her with something that would give her time, and not kill her right away, despite their grumblings that she had just requested a death wish. Segen had reminded them as kindly as she was able to that everybody met death eventually; you could only avoid its meeting you for so long. And when she had told them that she didn't plan on staying in a safe zone if one truly existed. The female doctor had told her that the safe zones would, indeed, be safe, hence the name. But the Israeli soldier had known better. The doctor hadn't let her choose the disease, of course. She had merely stated that she would be giving her a sample (a sample that would kill her, if not for a while) of a disease that one would get from infected genes, from the parents. They had told her that this was needed, but after seeing that it was no use, they'd told her everything she needed to know (she had memorized them, memorized the information, memorized the name, memorized everything they had told her about it) about it and had infected her with it. But, in order to, they'd had a sample of an infected (dead) patient's DNA in the lab (why not? Seeing as how they had everything else in the labs; Gerry had gone back and had gotten the doctors samples the terminal, untreatable diseases that would, in time, kill her) injected into her bloodstream. And this sample had been in two doses, unlike Gerry's, just so they were sure she was infected. They had told her that they wished her a quick death - in the highest respects - and if she lived long enough to suffer from the symptoms of the later stages of the genetic disease (which was technically not genetic in her case, seeing as how she had been perfectly healthy beforehand), that she die sooner rather than later, instead of being actually killed by the disease itself. The whining and bickering between the two families eventually tore Segen out of her thoughts, distracting her from the fact that she had signed her death warrant, willingly so. The larger family - the family of five - and the smaller family - the family of three - were getting louder now, and Segen's head was beginning to hurt. She knew where her backpack was - in the main hub, where all the computers and men and women and military operatives kept going through to to speak to their superiors. She also knew that if she asked for it, she might be able to get a boat or helicopter to drop her off somewhere uninhabited by humans (preferably; she wasn't about to take any chances). Fat chance, she knew, but she wanted to try. Someone else was welcome to have the bottom bunk, surrounded by the cause of headaches - these people really didn't realize that they just needed some rest, but she was too tired to tell them to be quiet, to allow her some sleep (after they had stared oh-so politely at the place her left hand used to be before she had climbed on her bunk after showering and cleaning up a bit). Having managed to grab a few hours (at least), Segen swung her legs over the side of her bunk and reached for her boots at the end of her bunk. She had been given a bigger backpack - one that she was used to carrying ammo in - but it was lighter, considering that in it were provisions and not weapons and ammunition - and, along with that, some food, a spare shirt, set of pants, socks, coat, matches, a lighter, a satellite phone (just in case, Gerry had told the people in charge), a knife, and had kindly reloaded her gun. Yanking on her boots and lacing them slowly, methodically - carefully - she listened as the wives kept bickering between one another, while the husbands did their best (their best was very poor, in the Israeli woman's opinion) to make sure their children got to sleep instead of interjecting in their mothers' bickering whenever possible. Her old clothes had been discarded as well, and she now wore clothes, clean of debris, sand, dirt, blood, and anything else that would prove to be unclean (really, it wasn't such a big deal to her; she was fine with what she'd had on her back when she had been helped onto the aircraft carrier). She was wearing a long-sleeved black shirt over a black tank top. The material was thin, but it was tightly woven, and tough, so it wouldn't tear easily. It was also quite warm, which was nice, since the colder months were growing closer and closer. Her pants were similar to the ones she had left Jerusalem left, if not in the colors of the navy's camouflage. Her boots were like any other kind any military would give out to their soldiers. They were a bit worn, but new. Which was a nice change, but one that wasn't necessary. She grabbed the grey jacket (one with no collar, and no hood, which dipped down to reveal the material of her shirt) and tugged it on, straightening it down her front while (finally) grabbing the black hat (the girl, Rachel, had called it a beanie, for some reason, which was an odd nickname for a ht) and, tugging it on her head and over her ears, she shook her head to rid herself of the oncoming headache that would soon follow her departure from the carrier, if they even let her off. Standing up, avoiding hitting her head on the bunk above her, she exited the bunk room she'd been assigned to. The family hadn't even noticed her leaving, and she hoped Gerry wouldn't find her and stop her from leaving - she hoped no one would. She didn't need to be a liability here. She could take care of herself, even though she was now ill, now that her death was ensured, one way or another - but it hadn't quite sunk in yet. And she was grateful for that, she thought, as she made her way down the halls (she hoped she was going the right way), speaking to no one as the crowds in the hall became thicker and thicker, letting her know that she was getting closer to her destination. Bursting into the room, which, of course, was alive with activity, with people on phones and talking to one another and receiving and giving orders, Segen spotted her backpack, and next to it, the heavy-knit coat, the one much like the one she was wearing, except it had a zipper ( and buttons, and was also insulated, thank goodness) and a high collar, to keep the chill off her neck. Her hat, she realized, would keep her ears from falling off in the coming months. Hurrying over to her things, Segen quickly yanked on her coat, already feeling slightly overheated in the carrier, zipped it, secured it by buttoning it up to her chin, and slung the backpack (which, in reality, wasn't nearly as heavy as the pack she'd had to carry with her in Israel) over her shoulder, getting her (rather useless) arm through the left strap, getting comfortable with the weight while her eyes searched for the U.N Deputy Secretary-General in the crowd around her. Spotting him, she began to make her way towards him, with the idea in mind to ask him if she could be left on shore somewhere, alone, and for no one to worry about her or follow her or anything like that. Segen just wanted to get out - she had convinced herself that she was ready to survive on her own, because in her mind, there was no such thing as safe zones. That was because there was really no such thing as safe anymore. It pained her to know that she was one of the only people who seemed to think that, because if everyone thought they were really safe, they were wrong. Dead wrong.[Chapter 3] Apologies for the grammatical/spelling/punctuation mistakes/errors in future and past chapters; when I'm on a roll I tend to write fast, and tend not to be thorough whilst looking for mistakes. Thanks for reading, now, without further adieu, here is the next chapter. But, a note for the present and future: I will do my best to make it realistic, but be warned: 1) that might not go as planned 2.5) nothing ever goes as planned with my stories, so prepare yourself, and, lastly: 3) this is going to be a disaster . 'Kay, I know I said 'w/out adieu' earlier, but I'll say it now (again) for the last time in this A/N. Without further adieu (for real this time, I swear), here is chapter three. Segen stood on the rocky shore, watching the helicopter grow smaller and smaller with a small frown, heading back towards the USS Argus , until it disappeared from sight, towards the rising sun. Recalling the past couple of hours, she grimaced, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. She hadn't been on solid ground for more than a couple of minutes, and she was already growing tired—and it had nothing to do with her sickness. Thierry, of course, had (at first) refused to let the Israeli go anywhere—he had never really specified a real reason as to why she couldn't go off and away by herself, but eventually, she had convinced him to drop her off somewhere, as long as she got off the carrier alone (she could take care of herself) and somewhere (again, preferably) uninhabited. The man had probably had good intentions in trying to keep her on the carrier (Gerry had , after all, personally requested a bunk for her, and therefore, he had probably expected her to stay longer, even though she had made it clear that she would be leaving after a very short amount of time), but eventually a man—Captain Mullenaro, if she remembered correctly, which she was sure she did—had told her he would be happy to have her off the carrier if A) she felt that she would be useful on her own and B) she was so willing to give up that bunk for someone else (though she could hardly see someone actually wanting her bunk, considering the bunkmates the person would have to endure, but she supposed that wasn't her problem). But, even that couldn't convince the Secretary-General completely—until she had voiced the fact that she would be fine because she knew how to live on her own (in truth, she just knew how to survive ; you couldn't truly live the way she had chosen to) and she would be as careful as humanly possible. At the time, she wondered if Gerry had told them about what she'd had done to herself. Probably, she had thought, because the looks both men had given her told her that they disapproved of this as much as Gerry would have if he had been there. Luckily, though, the United States' navy captain had managed to get a helicopter ready for her, and she had left with only one favor to ask of him: that he should tell Gerry thanks for saving her life and that she had gone off (prepared). After all, this had been the sole reason for her signing her own death warrant. With her backpack slung over her shoulder, Segen turned away from the silence of the ocean and towards the wilderness in front of her. When she inhaled, the air was cold, sharp—like a knife. But it felt good in her lungs; it made her feel a little bit better about leaving the illusion of safety behind, it made it easier to push away the nagging doubts and worries she'd managed to keep hidden from everyone she'd come in contact with since this whole ( zombie! ) ordeal had begun. Her decision, she thought, as she began to walk (slowly; she was in no hurry, with no real destination in mind—but her goal was to avoid any and all contact with humans, living and dead, and the larger cities, too), her boots crunching loudly in the silence that the helicopter had left her in, might have been a foolish one. She had appeared to be confident—she'd had to, in order to be left alone, in order not become a burden to them—to Gerry, to his family, to anyone —and wasn't that the right thing—the noble thin—to do? Wasn't it better if someone able (with two hands) had her bunk, her place in the mess hall, her place on the ship? Wasn't it better if she, the useless of the bunch— the one without a hand —be out of the way? Wasn't it better if the one who had chosen to stay by themselves kept to their word and actually stayed by themselves? Wasn't it better? Wasn't it? She hardly knew. She kept her eyes on her feet, and then ahead of her, watching where she stepped. Her ears were trained on the emptiness of the area around her—a rocky shore, with pebbles and sharp rocks serving as a substitute, a colored sky slowly filling with the rising sun (which, she hoped, would do something for the early-morning chill), sparse vegetation (at least for a little while longer), and ahead of her she could see the beginnings of thin and eventually thickening woodland. She'd never been to Canada before; she was use to the heat, to the scorching of the desert—she'd only ever been in Israel, in Jerusalem. The Israeli woman stumbled a bit, regaining her balance quickly as a sudden pang of homesickness took over—the same pang she got when she had been sent into the capital of her country, but this— this feeling —was intensified tenfold. It made her, for a moment, feel like she was going to wretch. When her stomach heaved, when she could taste bile in the back of her throat, she sank to her knees, suddenly shaky, suddenly losing all the confidence she'd possessed, the confidence that she'd been borrowing from Gerry, from the W.H.O doctors. And this time, she really was sick. Segen knew she probably should have stayed on the carrier. She probably could have been to some use; she was, after all, still a soldier—but she couldn't see what good a handicapped one (a missing hand was a major handicap) would do. Her illness (she knew she'd been stupid, so stupid ) would have passed an excuse to keep her aboard, to make sure someone made use of her onboard the ship, where she could live out her life in peace , until the symptoms began to show, until she lost her mind and body to the genetics she'd had herself injected with in the hopes that she would be able to survive— on her own —in Canada , of all places. Not far from where Gerry was going to go with his family, not far at all from the \"safe zone\"(but she was on the main continent, and not the small island they had been dumped on when Gerry had been presumed dead)—and that made her wiper her mouth, and spit out the remnants of the ailment of homesickness into the weeds sticking out of the rocky ground of the shore (she would not call it sand; sand was what made the desert familiar, what made it home, and this wasn't home ; therefore, this would not be called sand, not by her mouth, not in her mind). However, the soldier did not get up and to her feet right away. The weight of her choices, the weight of her feelings—those troublesome, cumbersome, sickening feelings—were finally crashing down on her, and she only needed a moment—just a moment, to get her bearings, to get her head on straight, to push these accursed things—these emotions that would soon have her a crumbling mess if she didn't quickly rebuild her composure, her confidence, no matter how little of it she really had. Gulping in large amounts of clear, clean, cold air, Segen allowed herself a moment—just a moment—to remember her home, her village, the dead bodies she'd left behind in favor of joining her country's military, opting to be of some use to someone instead of staying where she had grown up with the dead—the dead had been the only ones left, and, remembering that, she allowed herself to feel the guilt (but for only this moment)—and she allowed herself to feel regret, to feel hopelessness, to feel stupid, so stupid —to feel a variety of things she hadn't allowed herself to feel for—well, quite some time. Now that the emotions were out and all over the place, weighing on her chest, running through her veins—constantly reminding her of her choices and mistakes and fears and the failures she'd been trying to push to the back of her mind in order to survive with a clear head—she struggled to get herself back under control. It took a few long, silent moments, but eventually, the feelings subsided, but they would be back. She knew they would be—they always came back, but this was the first time in years that she had allowed herself that moment, that small, necessary moment, to be a human being once again with ability to feel , to think, to breathe —and that reminded her that she was of some use , if only to herself. She was still human. She wasn't one of those shells (she couldn't call them zombies, though; they had been someone before, just like she was now, someone who'd lived, but had died inside, and now were being controlled by the disease that made their minds—their individuality —dissipate in seconds) wandering around, trying to infect every healthy person they could. She was fearful that they still might attack her—they might, they just might, because Gerry just might have been lucky for all she knew—and she could probably still get infected, even with the disease running through her body, slowly settling in, waiting for its time to pounce and corrode her body till there was nothing left to show the world that she was human . Segen immediately stopped thinking about that. She could dwell on that later—for now, though, she needed to get moving, she needed to make some progress. After all, she couldn't— would not —sleep in the woodland if she could help it. One of those things (zombies) might happen upon her sleeping form, and decide that her sickly body (even though she felt find, for the most part) was worthy of being infected with its own disease. Or, worse—another human, (or group of humans) might come across her, and she knew that, in the apocalyptic state that the world was in, there was, truthfully, no one she could fully trust. They might pretend to help her, to take her in—and rob her. They might do worse than take her supplies and leave her for dead—it had been the same before everyone had been secured inside the capital of Israel. One of the soldiers in the helicopter had advised her to find something on wheels—like a bike, or something of the like—something quiet yet quick to travel on, so she would not attract attention to herself. He had also advised her that 1) when she ran out of water from the water bottles she had been so graciously given before her departure, she would find a container to fill water up in and boil to kill any germs and bacteria, 2) that she eat none of the plants; there was no telling what and what wasn't poisonous, and 3) she should avoid large towns and cities as much as possible. She needed to go to rest stops and gas stations if she needed anything, and she needed to keep away from long lines of traffic jams, in case there were people (living) lying in wait, ready to jump someone (that sort of thing had already happened, apparently, and she wasn't surprised) or crowds of zombies ( there , she had called them that—but it still felt wrong ). Segen realized, as she slowly got to her feet, steadying herself before she continued to put one foot in front of the other, that she didn't really have a plan, other than to survive. But, she decided, as her boots stopped crunching on the rocks (how could anyone call this a beach?) and were not padding softly on the grass and choked weeds and branches underfoot, as the woodland grew closer, she would need to find someplace to sleep for the night, because she was not about to sleep in a tree or on the ground. She didn't have a map, but she figured that any direction (aside from the one behind her, which went towards the sea) was good, so she continued to go straight, straightening her back and quickening her pace to a reasonable stride. Segen could only hope that she was the only person (living—but dead was fine too, if she were truly alone, even if she was camouflaged) for miles around as she neared the trees, the naked branches reaching out for her, as if daring her to step within their ranks and find her way. This was going to be difficult—surviving. But it had been her choice. It was her only choice.[Chapter 4] The 'T' rating of this fic will go up, but not anytime soon, methinks - for violence and language and such. By the time she had found a road that looked like it had been a once-popular highway, the sun had already disappeared high into the sky and behind a massive wall of dark, ominous clouds that looked awfully similar to those that she'd seen carry thunder (and on rare occasion, rain, because last night it had rained, and it felt amazing on her skin, after spending her entire childhood in the desert). From where she stood, her body hidden in the safety of the silence of the trees, from (and the trees beyond it) the long stretch of pavement, she could see that it appeared to be desolate now—lonely and unused, as if it had been that way for ages (though it hadn't been more than just a few days since Canada had seen its first case of—of its citizens being—uh, zombified ; it shouldn't have bothered her that much, that term, that implication—but it did, in the worst of ways). There was no sign of life that she could see or hear or even smell in the air—aside from the swaying of tree branches behind her and just beyond the road—and for that, she was somewhat relieved. She wasn't quite ready to go through a crowd of the infected ( zombies —really! Why was it so difficult to say it, let alone think it?) or to encounter anyone, who was actually alive . Those things weren't on the top of her to-do list. First off, she wanted to find something with wheels. A bike, like what had been advised of her to find—or something that would get her around faster (though she still had no destination in mind; she knew that she just needed to get a move on before something—or some thing —found her. Her backpack wasn't too heavy, but by now she could feel the strain deep within her shoulder blades. It was nothing she couldn't handle, but at the same time, she knew she would eventually need a break— eventually . But she had a ways to go before she could consider taking a break, because she hadn't found anything worth stopping for; in the woodland, while she had been trying to spot dead branches and twisted roots underneath dead leaves and other natural debris, she had run into a few mossy, poorly-put-together shacks that looked to have been built decades ago, back before anyone knew to use something other than rotting, dampened wood from the damp, tough trees that made up the woodland she had been trekking through since the sun had climbed its way above the horizon and into the sky. She had searched the remains of the shacks, but had found nothing but mold, more moss, broken chips of—of metal, maybe , because it looked a lot like shrapnel, but she couldn't name it (maybe it had come from a destroyed utensil of some sort)—so she had kept moving, as quietly and as quickly as she possibly could, but that had amounted to more stumbling through the dense, somewhat-dead foliage and over hidden rocks that were jutting out of the ground, only when they had been revealed by her tripping and stepping over them. But she had yet to fall flat on her face and earn herself a bloody nose, so that had to count for something. Segen hadn't encountered any signs of civilization—from before or after the outbreak, besides those crumbling, ancient buildings (she'd seen better imitations of homes outside of Jerusalem; the ones in small, isolated villages, from the middle of the desert—the ones that somehow lasted throughout the years and didn't end up unused and forgotten, like the ones she had looked through had) and though she wasn't quite hungry or thirsty yet (although she was a bit chilly), it was probably best that she find more food before she start eating what she had in her pack. Segen climbed up the steep, small slope that led from the abrupt start of the trees and on the edge of the road, a slight, crisp breeze greeting her as she stood up straight, once again hoisting her pack up her shoulders, but it just sank down with its weight again. She really wanted a bike— anything would do the trick. Turning her head to the left, and then to the right, she realized that both ways ran straight and looked the same. The stretch of highway that she'd found was empty, barren, and lonely; it went straight, and what she couldn't see disappeared into the forests around her. She wondered if it would lead her anywhere, or if making a decision about which way she should go in the first place was even worth the energy and effort. Neither direction looked promising; she was sure that neither would leave to a safe haven—sticky and unwanted situations awaited her, but maybe at different lengths. One might bring her trouble faster than the other would—but the question was which one would delay the trouble she was trying to avoid the longest. Which one? Segen sighed. She was going to have to eat soon, if not in the next few minutes. But stopping out here wasn't an option, because she had no idea what else, or who else, was lurking about in the woodland and on the road with her. There was no telling what—or who—she might come across of bump into. She wanted as little human contact as she could possibly get. Briefly, she wondered if it would be a good idea to just cross the road and continue through the untamed and (for the most part) untouched wilderness. But, in all honesty, she was getting quite sick of all the greens and the browns and the dead foliage that littered the ground everywhere she went. Already she missed the desert, her old home, Jerusalem, the familiar sands and the sounds of her people—because here— here , there was nothing, and that was best, but she couldn't help but feel lonely . Very, very lonely. It wasn't that she was unused to feeling that way—it was just that she disliked feeling like she did now. The near-intact silence wasn't too heavy for her to deal with, but she wasn't used to it, not like how it was now—and she knew that if she found a town, or a city, or even one house , she might encounter one of those things (zombies) and then it wouldn't be so quiet. It would make those horrific, pitiful noises as she would try to skirt past it (or them ; there was never just one) without bothering it too much. After all, her not-so-yet-still-genetic disease wasn't supposed to kick in for… well, a long while. The W.H.O doctors had predicted when she might start showing symptoms, but they might not even show up till she was much, much older (she didn't think she'd survive that long anyway—having one hand wasn't really useful in a world such as this) and she still didn't know if Gerry had only gotten extremely lucky or if her disease was actually supposed to repel those walking corpses. Segen had been doubtful from the moment they'd injected her with it, but it had been her only way of preserving some hope that she might be able to survive on her own without being a hindrance to anyone else—and that included was left of the living (along with Gerry and those aboard the USS Argus ). She was more likely to be killed if she proved to be a hindrance to those who could not afford to deal with useless things like her. Closing her eyes briefly, while shoving down the first, fleeting little feelings of panic that had begun to swell within her body— because she had no clue as to where she should or shouldn't be going —and stomping on them, almost literally, she decide that she might as well go right, because there was no way she could know exactly what lay ahead of her (or on either side; she didn't really want to know what was waiting for her in the trees that seemed a lot darker and a lot more mysterious than she remembered, but then again, that could have been because of the lack of sunlight, and she was used to the scorching of the sun on her skin, even in months were it was supposed to be cold in places like these)—so, without hesitation, she turned and took about three steps in the direction she had chosen when she halted, a realization crashing down on her—one that she was lucky to have remembered at that particular moment. It was probably best to simply follow the road, rather than be travel on it . In case she saw someone (or something) come along before she heard them (motorized means of transportations were, no matter what, loud in a silence like this, and if she were walking in the middle of the road, she wouldn't be able to get to cover without being seen first. But, if she kept close to the road, if she stayed out of sight , and her ears open and took in every sound around her—yet she kept her eyes on the road, then she might be able to find something before something—or some one —found her. Segen quickly glanced around, to make sure that her sudden realization was safe to act on—because if she ducked into cover now and someone had seen her, then there really was no point in it—her eyes scouring the terrain, but seeing no irregular movement (that appeared humanoid in the slightest) and hearing no motors or engines or anything of the like that indicated that she was not, in fact, alone, she quickly ran down the small slope of gravel, her footfalls becoming soft as her boots met the high, choking weeds that would provide good cover for her in case she had to drop to her belly (in case someone or something did come along), and she began walking, just behind the tree line. Her vision was not obscured; she heard nothing coming from the trees on her right, and there were no sounds to her left, but that didn't keep her from glancing frequently, in dysfunctional, rapid patterns from the trees, to her feet and what was in front of her, and to the road, over and over again, in different combinations as the seconds spent going through the foliage—thank goodness her attire wasn't bright enough to be seen through the trees, unless there was a hunter nearby who knew to look for abnormalities in the wild (she doubted she would come across anyone like that but it was still a possibility—and soon, before she knew it, the air was filled with fresh scent of rain, and the sky was completely filled with dark clouds that seemed to be promising her a storm. Segen sighed, took off her hat (beanie), and shoved it in her coat pocket as she crept on, while her eyes kept going from the woods, to what was in front of her (and at her feet), and the road, never once stopping, and occasionally, she would throw a near-paranoid glance over her shoulder, but she saw and heard nothing as the distant rumbling of thunder sent small vibrations through the ground. Soon, the seconds that dragged by turned into minutes, and those—ever so slowly—turned to hours. Her stomach was grumbling, her head was beginning to ache (she tended to get headaches when she didn't sleep well), and she was beginning to grow tired by the time she actually found a place that seemed like it was worth going through, though it looked completely abandoned—it looked emptier than some of the neighboring villages nearest her own, before she'd left it because she had been the only one left , and those , if Americans had seen and step foot in them, would have been called ghost towns—but she wasn't even sure if ghosts stayed behind to haunt the graves of so, so many. That was how empty this place seemed, and she hadn't set foot in it yet. Segen halted at the sign that she found, by the highway, and not far from that, she could see a few buildings, with faded red bricks and peeling paint. The doors sagged on their hinges, creaking in the breeze, and the shutters on the windows looked as if they would come detached from their respective places at any given moment. Broken glass littered the pavement, mostly around buildings making the tiny main square of the town she'd come across. Some windows and doorways looked to have been boarded up at one time; random pieces of cleanly cut wood hung from doornails, which were attached to some door and window panes, by hurriedly-hammered-in nails. The weeds around the open doors of the silent place seemed to be choking the structures, making it look like no one had lived here in decades. And, if what had happened hadn't happened, she could have been convinced that no one had live her in a long, long while. After a few seconds of evaluating what she could (and couldn't) see, she decided it was a place to stop. But, she didn't get out of the weeds, and she didn't take another step forward. The old, wooden sign read, in faded white letters: Welcome To the Town of Kingtan Population: 103 Founded: 1987 It wasn't what the sign read, however, that kept Segen from going any further without her eyes narrowing and her body tensing. Her mouth was set in a grim line, and her hand clamped into an able fist as she clenched her teeth and slowly slid the backpack off of her shoulders and onto the ground, her ears now solely focused on the tiny town not even twenty steps away, crouching she could easily access the contents of her the bag. She made sure the gun was in her back pocket, while she fished the knife out, hooking its sheath to one of her belt loops while holding the blade between her teeth as she carefully and slowly zipped up the bag. Straightening up as much as she dared, she took the knife out of her mouth, readying it in her hand, the familiar weight of the gun in her back pocket making her feel just a little bit better about what she was about to do. What stopped her from going any further wasn't the sight of the little town, or the lack of life, or the silence that seemed worse than the one she'd been dealing with out in the wilderness—no, what stopped her from going forward was the blood splattered on the sign, and the drops near her side of the road that seemed to lead across to the side of the road opposite hers, disappearing down the steep, short slope that would take whoever had bled out into the trees, and out of sight.[Chapter 5] The Israeli soldier knew it was going to rain even before she felt the first drop creep down the leaves above her head and onto the top of her head. It started as a light drizzle—she knew it might turn into a downpour, and while she would stay dry for the most part (she was actually hoping it would snow; she wouldn't be completely soaked if it did, but she knew she might have to wait anywhere from a couple of days to a few weeks. Then again, if she did find something with wheels, then that would be hazardous for her. Her knife was in her right hand, but just as she was about take the first, cautious step forward, out of cover and into the open, where anyone could see her, an idea came to her. Looking to her right, towards the trees, she quickly stuck her knife back in between her teeth as she crouched down and quickly located a pine cone. Crouching down till one knee sunk into the dampened, leaf-covered earth, she quickly pulled her hand behind her head and threw the pine cone as hard as she could. She watched as it sailed through the air. It landed quite a ways away from where she was, by the blood-spattered sign (it was days old, she knew—it had dried completely)—it landed in the middle of the road. Holding her breath, Segen waited for a response. Her eyes roamed her surroundings—she didn't forget to look behind her or to her sides—but her main focus was on the buildings (the doors on all of them hung open, and silence seemed to be pouring out of them, a desolate and lonely and empty and dead silence that she would trade for the one she'd used to tell herself she was safe for the last few hours—since she had found the highway. Seconds ticked by, but there was nothing—there was, literally no sound or movement in the small town—Kingtan, was it?—and it disturbed her more than seeing one of those things ( zombies , for goodness sake—it shouldn't have been that hard to think of them as that) meander out and see what the hell had caused the noise. Or maybe, she would have been even more disturbed than that if an actual and living human being actually stepped out to investigate. As she watched, and waited, and watched and watched and watched, she thought to what Gerry had had planned for what was left of the world. He probably had already revealed his plan to Thierry and his other superiors—and if he hadn't, he would have already because there was no way he'd waste any more time than one night to tell everyone what he and the W.H.O doctors had come up with—about spreading curable, temporary pathogens to create a camouflage for the humans to use against those disgusting, sad things (zombies). It made her think of her choice, of what she 'd had done to herself, of the fate she'd sealed herself, of the fact that she would die sooner than she would live to see this whole thing ( zombie apocalypse ), of the symptoms that could come about any damn day , of the foolish , stubborn decision she'd made in order to stop herself from becoming a hindrance to those who could not afford to have any on their aircraft carrier or even in their military ranks, of the illusion of safety that she could have chosen to adopt and could have pretended to believe— Immediately , she erased that all of those things from her mind (well, as best she could, anyway), and quickly glanced around her. Seeing nothing— not one thing, living or dead —she turned her attention back to the pine cone. She still had to be sure. Looking around her feet, she looked for something that was heavier than a pine cone, something that would create a bit more noise—and her eyes found exactly what she was looking for, a few centimeters away from her boot. She leaned and snatched a rusty, old can that she normally wouldn't had even bothered with, but the lid was still attached, and there were rocks embedded in the earth underneath the dead leaves under her feet. This could do the trick—it could draw something out, but it might not. It could be for nothing, but the soldier didn't care. She didn't care at all if anything popped out at her. There was no way she was going to make a mistake, here, coming across to her first supposedly-abandoned town. She managed to get a few pebbles and bits of gravel loose from the soil, and she carefully—and as quietly as she could, while glancing over her shoulders and to the sides, just to make sure nothing and no one was going to sneak up on her (because she really wasn't in the mood to deal with something or someone sneaking up on her—and she was more worried about some one sneaking up on her, since she supposedly was camouflaged to the zombies lurking about, though she had yet to even see one)—slid them into the can. She didn't have a rubber band or any kind of string to tie the lid of the can shut, but she supposed that merely pushing the lid into its container would do the trick, but not too deep, or else the noise she wanted to create would not be enough to draw anything (or any one ) out into the open, where she could see them (or it ) and assess the situation at hand (that is, if there was even a situation to evaluate in the first place). Making sure the lid was in place, and moving it as little as possible, Segen readied her right hand, the rocks sliding to the back of the dirty can as she did so, and drew her arm back. Focusing her remaining energy (she probably should have eaten hours ago—and by now her lapse in good judgment was noticeable—but creeping through the weeds without being detected by anything had been her main priority) in her arm, she took a deep breath, and flung the noisy object she'd created as hard and as far as she possibly could have. It landed a ways away from the pine cone. The impact that it made with the ground was noisy and had its desired effect; the noise was a loud clang, and as it rolled to a stop, near the open door to what she assumed had once been a convenience store, and she let out a breath she hadn't known she'd been holding. Again, but more carefully this time, her eyes went to the trees to her right, searching for any movement. She saw none. She twisted her body around, to see if anything or anyone was coming up behind her, but there was nothing . Lastly, she turned her eyes to the road, twisting her torso so it was now facing forwards once again, and, letting a sigh of relief escape her, she realized that there was little need to be as cautious as she was being—because, she had been right to assume the first time, that she was truly alone, in the middle of nowhere. But she couldn't tell if that was an accepted comfort, or an internal crisis. Maybe, it was both, and maybe, it was neither. Whatever it was to her, it was hollow, and colder than the breeze that sifted gently through the branches, scattering dead leaves across the highway and pavement that ran through the middle of Kingtan—and the rain that was now falling onto her tensed form. With her knife still in her teeth, the Israeli woman continued to wait, just on the safe side, just to see—just to see if anything bad popped out of any openings. Minutes ticked by, slowly (that might or might not have turned into ten minutes or more), until she finally made the decision to go on into the abandoned town—that might have seemed peaceful, once upon a time—and see what she could find. Straightening up, the soldier made sure she didn't let her guard down as she starting putting one foot in front of the other, slowly, carefully—as quietly she possibly could, which wasn't difficult, but she could not afford to take any chances when it came to preserving what she had and the fact that she had gone unseen (as far as she knew) since she had been left on that hideous excuse of a beach (rocks padded into gravelly sand shouldn't have counted as a beach ). Taking her knife out of her mouth and readying it— just in case —in her hand, with her other arm (wrist?) against her side. If someone had been watching her, she would have felt ridiculous, at the rate and with the way she was slowly moving toward the town square. But, the way she saw it was that she had no other choice —she had to be careful. It was either that, or death—and, in all honesty, the Israeli did not see her impending death as another option. It was fate. Fate, she knew, was not an option; it was just something that was there .[Chapter 6] When she emerged from the foliage, she felt an overwhelming sense to duck back into cover—away from any possibilities of prying eyes that might or might not want to do her any harm, because if anything popped out at her, it would mean to do her harm. There had been nothing when she had thrown the objects that she had in order to see if anything would respond to the sound. Any zombie lurking in the remains of the crumbling town—or nearby—would have heard and come stumbling as fast as possible to see what had woken them from their (hopefully) dormant state. If there had been anything (mostly dead on its feet), it would already be here. And she was the only one for miles around, most likely. It was a haunting thought. But that didn't mean she was completely safe, and she knew it—because there was no such thing as safe, despite what everyone else on the planet (including those who had seen it; her own people had known this, and somehow, their illusion of safety had lasted till they had begun to sing in Jerusalem—and then, like she had been afraid of had happened: it had shattered ) had seen in their lives and pasts, and would see in the future. It was sad, though. It was sad , to know that she was one of the few who knew there was no escaping anything forever. It was strange, to be one of the few who believed that nowhere, nobody, and nothing was a safe refuge. It was surreal, at times, but now, it just felt like she'd known something all along that the rest of the world should have known, too. Segen didn't let down her guard, even if the place she'd found was truly empty, aside from her own, dying self. Her eyes assessed her surroundings, and she carefully increased her pace's speed, creeping up to where she'd thrown the pine cone and halting, spinning in a full circle, her boots barely making a sound on the pavement and she looked and looked and looked till she stopped moving. She was now facing the convenience store. Her form was tense, the knife was ready to be plunged into anything that dared to even move —and, despite how still she was, her heart was thumping loudly—insistently—and that was the only sign that, on the inside, she was not calm and collective and fine with her situation. She was shrieking on the inside, and the only thing she could do now was to stay silent, pretend that she was fine, though she didn't know why she even bothered, because there was no one around that she had to fool—no one at all. Back home, she remembered distantly, as she began creeping towards the entrance a bit more quickly than she had crept into town, it had been necessary to keep calm. It had been necessary to pretend that you were keeping calm. It had never been her job to be one of the panicking masses of the civilians that suffered from different situations, different things—and she remembered that it had been like this long before any outbreak of that horrible disease. It had been her place to be the one to keep calm, to make sure panicking and confused civilians in Israel didn't develop into mobs (mobs were hard to deal with, especially angry ones—even when they hadn't been turned into shells of their former selves)—and now? Now, she wasn't even sure she had a place. In fact, she was sure that she didn't; she was probably as useful—and probably held the same place—as a ghost, a ghost with no place to haunt. Creeping up to the door frame, the soldier's eyes quickly examined what the convenience store had to offer, and wasn't all that disappointed when she saw that the shelves were literally empty. There was garbage, papers—useless things that were strewn about on the dirty, tiled floor. She wasn't surprised, though. People panicked—that's what people did, wasn't it? And it had been her job—back home, back in the familiar, scorching heat that she was so much more used to than the weather this far from Israel—it had been her job to make sure everyone moved in a timely and orderly fashion into safer (but not the kind of safe that appeared to be permanent; she had never seen anyone in her country promised that, not until a while ago, back when Israel had built the wall around the only, had-been safe place in the country) locations. But, she figured that there had been no authority here. People had taken what they had needed—wanted, fought over, fought for—and had left, leaving filth and litter and unnecessary things on the floor, things that wouldn't do anyone any good. There was more blood in here, she realized, on the floor, here and there; there were smeared, red handprints on some surfaces, while tiny puddles had collected in the small dents of the tied floor, and, for a moment, she wondered if what she had thrown hadn't been enough—but she had created such a loud sound. It had been so loud that she still felt the urge to clench her teeth and hold her breath at the clanging, rattling sound the can and bits of pebbles within it had made (honestly; everything seemed magnified in the silence— everything did). If any zombie were actually here, it would have ran out to bite whatever had made the noise by now. But it was silent, eerily so, and she suddenly felt the need to just forget about this place and move on to the next, but it occurred to her that this might be the only place that was actually empty . There was no way in hell that she would be going towards any of the bigger cities (she was not going to take any chances; nothing could change her mind about that ) or the larger towns that dotted Canada as they did Israel, and probably the United States as well, though she'd never been—but some countries were alike, in one way or another. Despite the erratic, uneven pounding of her heart, and the gut instinct to get the hell out of the vicinity, she began to creep down one of the isles. She had enough food to last her a while, if she chose to eat wisely; twice a day, in the morning, and in the evening, like she always did. She hadn't eaten yet, and to eat now, in the afternoon, with the rain coming down, and the thunder rumbling over head like some great, ferocious entity was an unappealing thought, though getting a few minutes of sleep didn't sound too bad. She did, however, need at least two or three more bottles of water, to last her until she found the next gas station, preferably in the middle of nowhere. She needed a few other things as well, things that the gracious people aboard the USS Argus had not thought to give her (a cloth for washing, gloves, perhaps mouthwash, and some other seemingly useless—yet human—items). The knife was still in her hand as her eyes quickly perused the places on the shelves that were not devoid of anything, but toys, and brushes, and small little trinkets that held no use to her were the only things that greeted her stony expression. But then she spotted it—a small, silver flashlight, still in a package, hidden in the nook at the end of the shelf. She hurried over to it, used the knife to open it as quickly, as carefully, and as quietly as she could (like she'd agreed on with herself earlier: she was taking no chances). When she was done, she stuffed the silver, cylinder-shaped object into her pocket after pushing the button on the butt of the mechanism and had, for a second, watched it light up. A flashlight wouldn't hurt anyone, especially if she was going into a dark place, with no telling what was waiting for her. Segen rounded the corner, and spotted the refrigerated section, and with a short, hollow burst of emotion emanating from somewhere deep within her, she rushed over to the doors, her eyes flying to few water bottles in the back of the shelves that hadn't been snatched by frantic, bloodstained hands. There were four, to her relief, as she quickly dropped her backpack to the floor, her eyes searching her surroundings— just in case —and, finding nothing, she opened the door to the cold-and-even-colder shelves, and stuck the remaining bottles into her backpack, first making sure that none of them had been opened (for fear of any type of contamination, of any kind) or that they were leaking (because she did not want her necessities soaked when it was already pouring down icy sheets of rain outside) before zipping her bag shut. Hoisting it over her left shoulder, with as much difficulty as expected, seeing as how she only had one hand, she straightened up, and turned, to look at the few other isles that were in the store. Though she was slightly chilled, she realized that it probably wouldn't be the best idea to venture outside once she'd found everything that the store had had to offer her. Catching a cold, while her immune system might already be affected, probably wasn't the best idea in the world, and, unless it stopped or lightened up to a bearable drizzle, then she was probably going to be stuck in this place longer than she thought was necessary (she had only planned to be here for only about twenty minutes, maybe less, due to its size and the fact that it probably had little to nothing to offer her). She went down another aisle, and was thankful to see that some deity (that might or might exist) had left her one large, narrow bottle of peppermint mouthwash—one that could fit in one of the many crisscrossing pockets on her pack easily. She knew that death was not an excuse to completely neglect her health, and she didn't have the luxury of brushing her teeth twice a day like she might have before all of this (she needed to keep moving, sleep in short, frequent doses as soon as she really got moving and found herself a set of wheels, and, though hygiene wasn't the most important thing in the world, she needed to keep some part of her clean; showering was going to be something of an issue, in the coming future). Next, she located not one, but three washcloths—and a bar of soap—she could use (if she happened upon a secluded spot near a stream or something of the sort). Her luck, for the most part, in the store, ended there. She'd managed to find a pair of thick, black gloves, which she was wearing now (her fingers were already warm from the insulation, much like the rest of her upper body, thanks to her coat). But, that was all, and the other items she'd thought might be useful someday soon were not in the store, and she doubted that they would be anywhere else in this town. Scouring the rest of the store, and even the back room (she hated back rooms with a passion, because there was always something hiding in the dark, always, always, always , but this time, there had been nothing—literally, nothing ), had proved fruitless, but, by the time she had finished and arrived at the front entrance, with her eyes searching the drenched outdoors for any other places she could search for anything that might prove useful, she cared little for her lack of findings. Her eyes found a car garage across the way. The garage door was open, and she suddenly ached to get out of the dimly lit store and to dash to the other side—too see if there was anything there she could use. She doubted it, though. Truthfully, she just didn't want to stay in this place any longer than she already had. Anyone could pass through here. Anyone—well, if they were armed, or physically stronger than her—could come, take her things, and leave her for dead (or worse: leave her in the worst mental and physical state imaginable, because death had to have begun looking like the easy way out to the ruthless, the cruel, and the desperate). Heaving out a sigh between barely-parted lips, which sounded loud in the renewed silence that the rain seemed to cast over the abandoned buildings, Segen threw back her head, and, for what felt like the first time in a very long while, she yawned, stretched her arms over her head, her knife still clenched in the only hand she had left. She glanced to her left, and sighed at the debris being swept about on the floor by the cool, damp breeze that came in through the front entrance of the shop. Glancing to her right, she took a long, hard look at the cashier's counter, and then something hit her, a small, but relevant realization. She had forgotten to check around, and behind, the cashier's station. How stupid. Quietly, while getting the right strap over its rightful shoulder, she walked over to the counter, and looked around it. There were some scattered boxes of menthol cigarettes, there were some postcards, there were a few bracelets woven out of cheap yarn and a few worthless charms that served as pointless gifts from visiting this place along a journey, but she decided that pocketing the cigarettes she'd found couldn't be the worst thing she'd ever done—and while she did just that (there were six little boxes, and they all fit nicely in the side pockets that she could reach with her right hand while her knife was clenched between her teeth) her eyes went over her shoulders and out the front entrance (there was a back one, too, one that had been barricaded by an empty ice cream freezer, somehow) and out the front windows and into the street, where the rain continued to fall in heavy sheets—and, like before, there was nothing and no one else around but her. She was not, by any means, a smoker. She'd only smoked a handful of times (you could count off the times she'd ever put anything in her system that hadn't been for an illness on one hand) but she figured that they might not be as useless as they appeared. While she might not use them, if she ran into someone who needed to trade something in order to let her by, she might have them to give. Maybe—but she doubted it strongly. Honestly, that just sounded like an excuse to bring something along with her that she really didn't, but she couldn't bring herself to care that she was pretty much making up excuses concerning what she should and shouldn't take with her. Cigarettes were a health hazard and were unnecessary, but, she didn't care. She honestly did not care . And, besides, it wasn't like they took up that much room anyway. Not really. Not enough to worry her, anyhow. The Israeli idly thought about all the blood around the store as she leaned over the counter to see if there was anything of use (there was so much blood, but the stench of rotting corpses, disease, and death—the smells that usually came with any sort of plague—were absent, and the lack of bodies alarmed her, and the absence of said bodies in the town, or as much as she dared to see, anyways, disturbed her even more), expecting nothing, but, for some reason, her last stroke of luck within the unnamed convenience store hit her just then: Leaning up against the counter, hidden from view from any customer that might be looking around the register for money or food or other supplies, was a shiny, black and gray bike. Her eyes widened in disbelief as she examined it carefully, quickly coming around the corner of the counter and expecting it with calculating, hard eyes. It seemed a tad bigger than what would fit her—a tad taller (it would be difficult getting off of it, but then again, she wasn't one to complain much when something good came her way, because not much good ever did come her way) than she was—but it would suit her well. The colors were bright in their own way, but not blatantly obvious; you couldn't easily spot it if she were riding through or behind trees, and that alone was a thought that comforted her. Taking the center of the handlebars with her hand, with her knife in her teeth, with a stump that had once been her left hand (well, it was actually the crook of her elbow) somehow loosely grasping the metal underneath the seat of the bicycle, she managed to haul it away (with surprising ease, despite the fact that its seat was level with her stomach) from the counter, and she carefully wheeled it around the counter and leant it up against the glass, next to the front door. The soldier decided that she would probably have to wait for the rain to lessen its tirade against the beaten and trampled earth, and with that, she—if not reluctantly—slid the backpack off her shoulders and onto the ground. She sank down to her knees with it, quietly— just in case —with her knife still in between her teeth, and felt the tension leak out of her shoulder blades, bit by bit, as she allowed herself to lean her back against the cold metal of the cashier's counter. Her hands flew to the main zipper. Suddenly reminded of the fact that she hadn't eaten all day, not since last night (she'd gone longer, but if she was going to survive for as long as she could, she'd have to keep up something that served as an excuse of strength) by her grumbling stomach, which seemed abnormally loud in the heavy, damp silence, her hands found a water bottle—one that she'd just taken from the store—and a protein bar, from the USS Argus . She had quite a few of those in her backpack. In fact, she was sure that most of her food consisted of protein bars, and not much else—and the fluids she had were all water, she was sure of it. Curious to see if she was right (there was no doubting that she was ), she dug into her back, sifting around till she found a water bottle that wasn't filled with water. The liquid was blue, but it wasn't very familiar to her. She took the bottle out of her bag (it was still cold), and examined it. There was a hand-written label that must have been taped on, by the looks of it, in a rush. She allowed her eyes to widen and a tiny smile to spread across her lips, but it only lasted a few seconds. The smudged, childlike, messy scrawl on the dirty white label read: Segen: Drink wisely. It's an energy drink—Gatorade, if you're wondering. She had an idea of who it was from; the small, Hispanic child—she hardly even remembered his name, but she supposed she should have—had had a bottle of this kind of liquid when he had been at supper, onboard the aircraft carrier. She'd never had this drink before, though she'd seen it in vending machines in the newer buildings in the larger cities of Israel. Uncapping it carefully, so she wouldn't spill it, she brought the drink to her lips and was surprised by the sugary, pleasant, although foreign, taste of the liquid as it ran over her tongue and down her throat. She unwrapped the protein bar, slowly, carefully—because she couldn't let anything go to waste, not even the menthols she'd taken, not even the seemingly-useless things she'd taken—and took a bite out of it. Soon, she knew, she would grow sick of its taste—its oddly foreign taste that was like nothing artificial she'd ever had before—but for now, she ate it, without any complaint, because the taste was new to her, and it was edible—she might have even called it good —but when at least half was left, she wrapped it back up, and she capped off the blue drink. She had drank little of it (a few sips at the most), wanting to preserve it, and instead had finished a bit less than half of the cold bottle of water she had first pulled out from the backpack. Making sure that nothing would spill, she put everything back where it belonged—safe, in her backpack, and allowed herself to relax, just a little. Her eyes wandered over to the front entrance of the convenience store. Her eyes would occasionally wander back to the dimly lit shelves and isles around her, the faint buzzing of the refrigerator section becoming a welcome noise in her ears, but mostly, she kept her eyes trained on the can, outside. It hadn't moved since it had stopped rolling, and she found that it was easy to keep herself awake, though she knew that sleep would be needed (preferably during the day; at night, there were too many opportunities for something to go horribly wrong, since there was less visibility out in the Canadian wilderness. A few, long seconds before the icy rain showed any signs of lessening its assault on the earth, the young woman decided to open up her bag—if not for a moment—and dig out the satellite phone, so she could inspect it—see how much battery power it had, and whose number it had programmed within its bulky form. She pressed the on button, and watched as a single contact made itself known with a soft beep on the screen. The name, of course, had been predictable, but she was still a bit surprised as it flashed across the screen in black, capital letters: GERRY Shaking her head, she turned it back off, to preserve battery, and stuffed it back in her pack, securing it once and for all. Of course the only number in there would be his—why was she even remotely surprised? Well, she wasn't, not really—but still. She hadn't planned on maintaining any contact whatsoever with him, or anyone from the carrier, unless, somehow, they met again sometime (though she doubted it). He'd had to have known her intentions, of never being seen again by anyone on that carrier—by anyone at all, preferably. But, it didn't matter. The batteries would either die (even if she never used it, they somehow always managed to burn off their energy, but only more slowly), the phone would break—or someone might rob her and take it (or she might lose it or ditch it once it became dead and useless). Hearing a difference in the force of the rain, the Israeli turned her head to look out into the street, and was, for one of the first times in a while, quite pleased with what she saw. The rain, while she'd had the satellite phone in her hands, had lessened, to a barely-there drizzle. It was more than bearable, and she knew that soon, it would stop completely—very soon, in fact, and at that, she almost smiled, as she slowly got to her feet, glad for the energy flowing through her body—and she took the bike with her remaining hand and tugged it out of the store, simultaneously hoisting her pack back on her shoulders, the weight of it already becoming familiar to her in the strangest of ways. Almost . Once she was under the overhand that the unnamed convenient store provided, with her surroundings visible to her once again, she somehow managed to shakily step onto the right pedal, quickly swinging her left leg and arm over the side so that she was now balanced, with her wrist resting on the handlebar. Before she could lose her balance, the young woman began to pedal forward, out into the open. She had ridden a bike before—a few times, but enough for her to know how to work this one, although it was foreign and large for her frame, and she knew she would have trouble with the fact that she only had one hand, but, she couldn't help but smile at the feeling of having her boot-clad feet off the pavement, after a few long hours of wandering next to a deserted, blood-spattered highway that had been quickly forgotten over the past few days. The feel of the cold rain was actually welcomed on her skin as she took one, quick look around at where she was, her eyes quickly scouring the vicinity for any change—in anything—but, seeing none, she began pedaling faster (but not too fast; there was no need to exhaust herself before she was even out of town) and soon, she'd left the broken glass, the debris, the sagging shutters and doors, the peeling paint, the emptiness of the entire place—the remains of a once inhabited town in favor of the flat, ongoing highway that seemed to stretch on and on with the occasionally twist (as far as she could see)—and, for the first time in and soon, she'd left the broken glass, the debris—the remains of a once inhabited town in favor of the flat, ongoing highway that seemed to stretch on and on with the occasionally twist (as far as she could see)—and, for the first time in years , the Israeli grinned as she felt the breeze turn into a cold, welcomed gust as she pedaled faster and faster, leaving behind the lonely remains of what had once been Kingtan, only looking back once, to make sure that there was anything following her— just in case . There was nothing, nothing that she could see—nothing in the town, nothing on the road behind it and her—so she faced forward, seeing as how there was no other direction to go (and she was the only one on this highway, apparently) and continued on, leaving it behind as easily as she was grinning now. The first few, seemingly short minutes on the bike were spent examining it, and keeping her eyes on the road (so she wouldn't veer off, crash, and ruin it). It seemed brand new—maybe only used once or twice; there wasn't even a speck of dirt on it—it seemed like it had just come. It was quieter than she was, or so it seemed, on foot. She messed with the gears a bit—she hated the feeling of running when she wasn't even going that fast—and eventually shifted them into higher gears, till she was comfortable with the speed she'd acquired and the ability to pedal. The seat wasn't uncomfortable; it was padded, but she knew her rear end would be sore, seeing as how she hadn't been on anything like this for an extremely long while (bicycles weren't a novelty in Israel because each and every one that the children of the villages managed to find in piles of forgotten junk and aging rubble from other villages and towns that had been razed to the ground were always rusty, bent, and broken), but it wasn't that big of a deal, not really, not when she had more important things to worry about, like keeping the backpack that seemed a bit lighter on the bike with her at all times, and the gun in her back pocket close— just in case —and making sure nothing happened to her food—and, of course, she had to make sure she avoided any and all chances of coming into contact with anything —living or dead, it didn't matter; all she cared about was being alone while Gerry tried to fix the rest of the world (she doubted that, even if his plan did succeed—the plan to infect people with a curable (her good mood dissipated at the thought) pathogen so they could take out the zombies without the fear of being bitten, the virus, just like every other disease (she'd seen it for herself while in the company of the W.H.O doctors), would never really go away. It would take ages in order to wipe out all the zombies (that wasn't even possible, she knew it, and she hoped that Gerry and the rest of his comrades knew that as well), and even if they established \"safe zones\" all around the world, people were still—probably—the biggest threat to her and everything else, whether anyone else realized it or not. Bitterness took hold of the Israeli as she pedaled on, and she pushed those thoughts out of her mind, and was about to focus her mind and her eyes solely on the road ahead of her when, from far, far behind her, she heard a faint, rumbling sound. Glancing behind her, she saw—far, far behind her, far behind the remains of Kingtan—there was a tiny speck, one that she could barely make out, but sound was unmistakable, and it made her head towards the right side of the road, a plan to ride though the woodland (if necessary) forming in her mind. Bitterness was slowly replaced with an exaggerated sense of exasperation, anticipation, and even fear. That—that noise, the noise she would know from miles away—and, damn, she was hoping she was wrong, seeing as how she'd only seen one once, but she knew what it was, and—and that — that was a motorcycle .[Chapter 7] The young Israeli woman couldn't be sure if the owner of the motorcycle had seen her yet, but, as a sense of dread begun to weigh her down—make everything seem heavier, heavier than everything on and inside of her already was —as she veered into the trees, and before she even knew what she was doing (besides muttering darkly under her breath in Hebrew, her words concerning the idiot who was probably attracting dozens of the living dead with the loudness of the engine), her means of transportation crashing through and over dead and fallen foliage. It was difficult, steering on untouched and uneven ground, trying to avoid trees and stumps and sharp rocks and roots that would send her flying. She continued to maneuver her way through the trees, aware that the sound of the motorcycle was getting louder and louder—so whoever was on the bike had seen her—and she could actually feel the panic rising within her gut, into her chest cavity, until she couldn't even feel her heart beating as she managed to shift gears to something easier, as she pedaled harder, as she seemed to suddenly go faster —her chest cavity was beginning to feel numb; that was how fast it was beating inside her chest —and she didn't look back, she couldn't look back, because if she did, she would surely crash the bike into a tree, or send herself flying, and she did not want that in the slightest, so she did her best to push the fact that motorcycle was getting closer , while not ignoring it, to the back of her mind, so she could just focus on pumping her legs in the same damned circular cycle over and over and over and over and over again, until it—the noise of the motorcycle, which had seemed ominous from what she had seen of it (well, everything dark seemed ominous—darkness was death , after all, to many things)—finally began to grow fainter, and she almost— almost —believed that it had either gone past where she had veered off the highway (the bumpiness of the trail-less terrain was unnatural and it was scaring her, because sooner or later she was going to fall off —but that didn't matter this second, because all she had to do was keep going) but, of course, what her ears heard next made her blood run cold for the first time in a long time—not with fear, no, that had been back in Jerusalem, when she had been bitten—no, her blood ran cold with dread , one that was probably going to cause her to panic and go even faster. Her ears heard the engine of the motorcycle stop , and the silence that followed it, and seemed to begin perusing her through the trees, she knew that anything even remotely related to luck had left her for the time being—and, how she wished that luck had struck her now instead of before, but there was no use thinking about that now, not when she had to focus on getting the hell away from the highway she'd been on for most of the day as fast as she possibly could . When the sound of the heavy silence reached her ears completely and settled through the trees, the panic, as predicted, started to flow easily through her veins, along with the dread, along with the small amount of fear that had managed to claw its way into her bloodstream—and she knew that adrenaline was also pumping its way through her system, making her go faster than she had ever gone before on any sort of land-appropriate means of transportation. She was going too fast, she knew this, but she didn't care because she had to keep moving —not because of the fact that she didn't want to be found, but now, she was certain the owner of the black motorcycle (it must have either been stolen or well kept; she'd seen it glint in the dull light of the late afternoon, though the sun still hid for long amounts of time behind scattered clumps of ominous thunderclouds that seemed to have satisfied their need to wreak havoc on the world beneath them) was now going to attempt to follow her . Segen chanced one, quick glance over her shoulder, and, to her horror, she saw a flash of color—it would have blended in with the trees if she had not been among them for the entire day, looking for anything that was out of place—a color that was a dark, sickly green that might have been mixed with brown, and she knew this color to be a color of a coat, a thick one, too—she'd seen it one soldiers before, not on the ones from home, on a few from the carrier, and that only made her go faster , but there was something in her belly, something cold and hollow, that told her she was probably going to either have find a road of some sort sooner rather than later, or ditch the bike—and she really did not want to get rid of this thing, this quiet, solid thing, that helped her cover more ground than her feet would. It could not compare to a helicopter, or a motorboat, or a car, or a motorcycle , but it was better than nothing—and luck, such as the kind she'd come across in the remains of Kingtan, was going to be harder and harder to come by, the farther she went from the beach she had been left on by her own doing, and she knew this —so she kept going, easily pushing herself faster. The adrenaline wouldn't fail her now, but it wouldn't last forever. The energy from the small amount of food and drink she'd had had definitely been vital to the escape of whoever was following her (at least, she hoped whoever it was, was only attempting to follow her) through the Canadian woodland, but she knew she would have to stop eventually, because the lack of sleep wasn't helping her, and she knew she'd be feeling the effects once she was out of harm's way ( if she was in harm's way—which, she hoped she wasn't, because the snapping of twigs far, far behind her had nearly ceased, and her head buzzed with the effort to do so many things at once)—and that —that was something she wasn't going to be looking forward to. She already wasn't. The Israeli woman suddenly found herself plummeting down a steep dip in the earthy, leaf-covered terrain, and all of the sudden she was going down an even steeper embankment. Her hand clutched at the right handlebar (she was sure the knuckles on that hand were whiter than the snow she was going to see sooner than she would have liked to (because, it was Canada that she was in, and it would snow before October ended—she'd nearly forgotten that winter started very, very early this far north) and her wrist was pressing into the rubber of the left handlebar. It took a hell of a lot more effort than she was used to using, to control the bike, to make sure she didn't crash into the trees that seemed to rush towards her—she had to make sure she kept her balance, no matter how bumpy and unsettling the terrain was. Naked branches, dead leaves that hadn't fallen to the ground yet, and pine needles scratched at her face as she flew by on the bike, the sounds of her pursuer fading, but that didn't make her slow down or halt where she was—she couldn't just stop merely because she couldn't hear a notable ways behind her. If she kept riding long enough, he might either A) grow tired, B) grow tired of chasing her , or C) keep chasing her—though she doubted the last option, because she was riding a bike , and since he (she didn't honestly know if it was a man who was following her through the trees, but she hadn't gotten any indication of who the owner of the black motorcycle might be) had left his own means of transportation behind, she was certain that he wouldn't catch up to her. Oh—and there was one more option. Option D) (she could never dismiss this one, though it had never occurred to her to use it in a situation) was that whoever was chasing her might actually get to her —and that— that was something she wanted to avoid at all costs. The soldier glanced around her, only tearing her eyes from what was in front of her for a second—to see if anyone was following her—but she saw no one—and the small amount of relief in her system felt good .. Segen could feel the adrenaline slowly drain from her system—very slowly—and she used what was left of it to pedal faster, harder—just in case, just in case — In the blink of an eye, before she thought to glance around at her surroundings, before she thought to double check if she was alone, something solid, and hard, smacked her in the side of—well, something had tackled the entire right side of her body, and since the hand that had been doing most of the balancing for her on the bike (and she had been doing so well, too) was her right, her left stub was left to flail helpless as she felt herself flying off the bike and through the air, the impact of the greater part of the left side of her back meeting the ground knocking what wind the thing that had tackled her hadn't out of her. In the few, precious seconds that was spent trying to regain her breath, with her backpack weighing her down, and her right side aching, her pursuer—now attacker , apparently—had her on her stomach, with her right arm twisted behind her back. The right side of her face was pressed down into the dead leaves, into the dirt, and she could taste the earth in her mouth, and a bit of blood (she'd probably bitten her tongue in her surprise), but she ignored this. Instead, she focused on filling her lungs back up with precious, clean air, while trying to calm her erratic heart down, so she didn't have a heart attack ( or something ) on the spot and miss her chance to see who in the hell had decided it had been a good idea to chase her through the trees and tackle her off her bicycle. Distantly, someplace else in her mind, she hoped that her bike was okay as her eyes slanted upwards to see who her attacker was. She got a look at his face—a good look, besides the awkward twisting of her neck that she had to suffer from in order to look at him properly. She hadn't really known to expect—she hadn't expected anything but a person, really, but she was surprised to be met with a grin and bright, burning eyes that belonged to a mere girl who couldn't have been more than sixteen—maybe even younger than that. She was struck speechless, for a moment, as the girl continued to grin at her, before she remembered that she had the ability to speak, and when she remembered, she did, but, forgetting she was in Canada, she snapped at the grinning, bright-eyed girl in Hebrew, because she found that she was so angry at this girl, at the world, at the fact that Option D) had actually happened, so she just snapped : \"What do you think you're doing ?\" The girl recoiled. She probably hadn't expected her to snap back, in Hebrew , of all languages, and frankly, she didn't care. She used the girl's moment of surprise to throw her off of her body. Segen quickly got to her feet as she watched the girl regain her balance, and she felt a stab of irritation in her chest when she saw that the girl's grin had only grown , and her eyes burned were only brighter . She had dirty, tangled, wavy hair, that probably—once—had been a beautiful gold color, but now, it was just as dirty as the rest of her. Her dark skin was stained with streaks of dried mood and even a few specks of blood. She was wearing a black leather jacket, a filthy once-had-been-white tank top underneath, and jeans, that were shredded at the knees, with ragged, blue-and-white tennis shoes. It seemed to the Israeli that this girl probably had spent the first day or so out in the wilderness, and had (probably, and recently) stolen the motorcycle. For someone who might or might not have eaten in the past few days, she had a considerable amount of muscle on her bones, which explained why she had been able to tackle the soldier so hard . Her head was still aching, and would probably bruise in a few places, but that didn't really matter—because she saw her knife in the girl's knife. So, not only was this stranger persistent and fast—but she was smart, too. The young woman was in a fighting stance, with her left wrist pressed to her side tightly, but then she remembered the weapon in her back pocket (it better not have fallen out when the girl had tackled her) and her right hand quickly flew to where she had stuck it, and relief flooded through her—an uneasy, uncertain one, but it was relief nevertheless—as her hand found the gun. She whipped it out in front of her, the safety clicked off with a flick of her thumb, and index finger was on the trigger—lightly. There was no need to spill her blood—after all, she'd underestimated this girl, and maybe— maybe this girl would leave her alone if she saw that she had a gun, and was not to be messed with. Maybe . The girl's grin—a hearty one that, sadly, did not meet her large, bright green eyes (which might have been a spectacular feat, if that had happened, if they weren't in precarious situation at the moment)—faded a bit, and then, in a split second, twisted into a frown. Her offensive stance quickly changed to that of one that might take off at any second, and the soldier was not going to allow that—not without finding out why she had tackled her in the first place. Slowly, she repeated herself in English—it was a strange thing, to forget in which tongue she should speak—with less vehemence and anger in her voice. \" What do you think you're doing, girl?\" The girl, again, took on a temporary look of surprise, before a small smile twisted her lips, and her thick, bushy brows relaxed, the lines in her forehead relaxing into a smoother surface. \"You speak English, then,\" she said, and the soldier could identify her accent as a southern American's (the drawl was unmistakable, even if she had only met a handful from the U.S on the carrier before she had attempted to get some sleep on the carrier)—and she had to wonder what she was doing all the way up in Canada. The girl's voice was rough—the sandpaper-over-rough-wood kind of rough, like she hadn't had water in some time, and she now held her hands up, but the surrender she seemed to be giving to the older of the two in the woodland seemed almost mocking. She said nothing, and instead, she gestured towards the knife in the girl's hand with her gun. There was a feeling in her gut that told her she might be speaking more than she'd like to this girl—this dirty, filthy, sneaky girl. \"Oh, you want this back?\" the girl snorted, and then the small smile on her thin lips twisted into a smirk—a smirk that the Israeli woman wasn't used to, and she didn't like it. It made her feel like this was some sort of joke, like she was missing something—something important, and she didn't know what. \"Why did you attack me?\" The girl made a 'pftttt' sound with her lips, and rolled her eyes, still holding her hands above her head. \"I didn't attack you, lady; all I did was throw myself on you, stopped you from running away, is all I did.\" She caught a glimpse of the girl's teeth—and nearly grimaced. They were yellowed, and rotten—and she had a feeling that the girl might not have been hiding out in the woods (if she had been, that is) for only a few days. It made her uneasy, how easily this girl's lips twisted into a smile, and how calm she was, and how nonchalant she appeared to be about this situation. She should have known that her luck had run out on her the instant she'd left Kingtan's remains. \"Why?\" The girl looked amused. \"Why not ?\" she asked, her eyes going from the knife, to Segen and then back to the knife again. It suddenly hit her. This girl—this lone, rotten-toothed, blonde, filthy girl, who'd somehow stolen a motorcycle, and had not been bitten yet (because she knew that the motorcycles—at least, the fast ones—were available in larger towns and cities)—this girl was wild . And being wild probably did a hell of a lot more good in a world like this than being—being useless to everyone but yourself. And wild things did not get along with Segen, generally. \"Lady, have you seen the death 'n the blood out there, scattered in the streets, chasin' you in your own home?\" her voice was hard, and bitter—but her toothy smirk was still plastered on her face. The young woman couldn't help but wonder what this girl had been like before she had become wild, because she had obviously not been born wild, or else, like most wild things, she would have just pounced and kill what she'd caught before the thing she'd pounced on could even blink. The soldier could feel her expression harden into something grim, and the girl seemed to notice. \"I know what's out there,\" she said, her voice low, and shaky—despite the stillness of the hand that was pointing the gun in the wild girl's direction, and she waved her left arm, almost comically, so she could see the stub that would probably be forever wrapped in bandages and cloths. The girl's eyes widened with incredulity, and then narrowed. \"You got bit , then, didn't'cha' , lady?\" her eyes glistened in the late afternoon light—with something that the soldier wasn't comfortable with. It was hardly even phrased as a question. It was a fact, but still, she nodded in reply. The girl sighed, and then shrugged, almost nonchalantly—as if they were having some sort of normal conversation that had nothing to do with the dead walking about and infecting the living with their disease. \"You know, when you talk like a normal person, you don't sound like yer' from someplace else.\" The Israeli woman felt her expression change into something similar to annoyed \"I'm from Israel,\" she spat, a little more forcefully than intended, \"and I speak Hebrew , and because you are American, does not mean you are 'normal' .\" The girl shrugged again. \"'Sides,\" the girl drawled, returning to the topic that needed addressing, because the older of the two did not enjoy being tackled, \"That pack of yers'—looks promisin'.\" Her eyes narrowed as the toothy smirk grew on her face. \"Tell ya' what, lady,\" the girl said, lowering her hands and placing them on her hips, the knife still in her hand (she was awfully calm for someone who had a gun pointed at them), \"you trade me sumthan' in that pack of yers', and I'll give you back your knife.\" Her first instinct was to say ' hell no ' and spit out at least a dozen different curses in Hebrew and in English, but she decided against it, knowing full well that she had, as of late, been making a lot of (probably) foolish decisions. Like actually considering the girls' deal. \"D'you even know how t'use a gun lady?\" the girl asked, while the soldier considered her the few options she had: shoot her, run, or let her walk away with the knife, but risk getting stabbed in the back. The solider, however, considered what the girl was saying. She really didn't look like a soldier, not without her uniform on—but it was insulting, to be holding a gun and still have her skills doubted by someone who probably hadn't figured out that noise—especially noise like that motorcycle engine—attracted those things, those zombies—but then again, she might have known that already, and just didn't care. After a few seconds of silence, her jaw clenched tightly. \"I was—I am a soldier. I served my country.\" She had no scathing remark ready for this girl. It was not in her skill set to come up with witty remarks or comebacks while facing a dangerous opponent—it, usually, was her place to shoot whatever was getting in her way (if she had the orders or the cause to, anyway). The girl's smirk turned into a grin. But the way her lips twisted—it didn't meet her eyes. Her eyes, however bright, seemed dull, and dead. There was something about them—something about this wild girl —that she didn't like. \"Take that as a yes'm,\" the girl said, exhaling loudly through her nose. \"You 'bout done choosin' whatcha gonna do?\" Segen slowly nodded. \"Food or water?\" She wasn't quite sure if she regretted offering one of her resources to this girl, to this wild thing —but, she felt that she might actually pity this girl, though she didn't really know a damn thing about her. She was willing to trade little else for her knife. The girl's eyes sparked, though, so she had little to no doubt in her mind that the girl wouldn't ask for anything else. \"What kind'a food?\" she asked, her grin vanishing into something a little less unsettling—a speculative, tiny smile that seemed to tell her that she knew something that she didn't—and she hated that feeling, hated it more than she hated the fact that she had let her guard down and had allowed this—this wild thing to attack her. \"Protien bars. I can give you half of one.\" The one she hadn't finished—she wondered if that was okay, offering less than what this girl needed in order to survive. Probably not, but the world wasn't exactly okay , but—what was right and what wasn't was forgotten, to a lot of people—at least, that's what she'd seen in the past few days, and she knew it was not much different in other countries, in other places, because they all had people, and among the people, there was death, and there was the virus, the disease, the incurable pathogen that she had done a lot to avoid. Distantly, she wondered how long this girl would last, till she was bitten. She might not have long, and, at the same time, Segen didn't care that much. \"A whole,\" the girl said immediately. \"I ain't eaten in a day. I won't go starvin' 'cause I gave ya' yer' little knife back.\" She could hear the sneer in the girl's voice as she spoke, though it didn't show in her face. \"'Sides, you've got a gun, don't'cha?\" \"Knives don't attract the dead,\" was all the woman said, as she slowly slid the backpack off her shoulders and onto the ground, sticking her gun in her back pocket once again in order to get the food the girl was asking for out. \"Who cut yer' hand off?\" the girl asked, suddenly, breaking the short, solid silence that had settled between them for only a few seconds as the young woman fished out an untouched protein bar and used her teeth to zip the backpack shut. Instead of answering the wild girl's question, she simply tossed the girl the food, and she suddenly found the knife come hurtling at her, and caught it before it could make contact with her body. \"Not much'uv'a talker, huh, lady.\" Again, she did not reply, as she put the knife pack in its sheath, and she stood up slowly—just in case the girl decided she wanted to tackle her again—and slid the backpack back onto her shoulders—and onto her left with some difficulty. \"Well, thanks 'fer the food,\" the girl chirruped, as if this was a normal occurrence between the two of them, even though she didn't even know the wild thing's name, and it knew not of hers (and she preferred to keep it like that). \"I guess'll see ya' in hell, then.\" Segen blinked. \"That's it?\" she asked, before she even thought to wonder if it was a good idea to continue speaking to this girl. \"That's all you wanted? Nothing more?\" The girl cocked an eyebrow. She seemed even more amused than before. Really, what was so funny? \"You wan' me to steal sumthan' else , lady?\" No, actually, she didn't necessarily want that—not at all . Segen's eyes narrowed, and the girl flashed her a toothy, yellowed grin—and this time, her eyes lit up, just a bit, and, the sight of her green orbs burning made the soldier feel a little more sorry for this girl. Throwing her head back, cackling, she chortled, \"Nah', killin' ya's not my job, lady—'s the walking dead who's gonna kill yer' before I does.\" Her eyebrows furrowed as the girl turned away. Briefly, she wondered why she didn't whip out her gun and shoot this girl in the head—or at least, shoot her in a less important extremity, for getting the jump on her, for tackling her for no reason —for this strange, abrupt, abnormal encounter. She should have killed her, right there, she realized—because she had no doubt in her mind that this wild girl was just as capable as taking a life as she was—but for some reason, she only watched her step over her bicycle (it looked intact, but she would have to study it before she rode it again, to make sure there was no major damage done—and, if there was damage done to it, she was sure that she might kill the blonde-haired girl for ruining her means of getting around Canada) and dashed off, leaving her alone, in the silence. Kindness didn't get you far when the world was in such a state—the soldier knew this too well, and yet, she had allowed the girl—who could have killed her had any moment, without hesitation, and probably without regret (and, when she thought about it, anyone who could have found her could easily rob her blind, and kill her, or worse, and have no remorse because now it was all about surviving in a world where there weren't really any laws or remnants of common sense left)—to walk away, unharmed, with her food—all because she'd wanted her knife back. But she knew that it would be more useful than a gun, in most cases. If she came in contact with a hostile zombie (she had yet to test out Gerry's— proven correct —theory about being camouflaged from the virus and its rampaging means of spreading itself), she would need to kill it quietly. A gun shot would attract more of them, and she couldn't afford that—couldn't afford certain death via being torn apart by the walking dead. And if she came across a person, a living person, she could kill them quietly, without alerting anyone else. Plus, a knife didn't have bullets—it couldn't run out of anything, so it wasn't in any way, shape, or form dispensable. The Israeli soldier sighed, and walked slowly towards her bike. She stared down at it for a few, quiet minutes, until she heard the rumbling of the motorcycle engine starting up, and slowly fade away—until, again, she was left in the silence, to stare at the black bicycle, and, once again, was left to wonder if going off by herself had really been a good idea. Sighing, thinking that it probably wasn't, she slowly—gingerly—leaned down, grabbed the bike like she had at the convenience store—with her left wrist underneath the metal under the seat and her right hand on its respective handlebar—and hoisted it upright, so the wheels were resting on the ground. Everything seemed in order—if not a little bit dirtier. After a few more long, silent seconds of expectation, she deemed it fit for use, and carefully climbed on top of it, pushing what had just happened to the back of her mind, in favor, of continuing in the direction she had been going, before she had been tackled off her bicycle. The highway, she decided, while muttering darkly in Hebrew under her breath, was no longer an option.[Chapter 8] Sorry if it seems like the beginning is a bit slow and uneventful, but there will be eventful stuff happening in the near future. Very near future - not so many chappies away, methinks. (Btw, this one is just a bit shorter than the usual length of this fic's chaaaaaaapies so therefore you are warned so please don't hate me or anything. Dang, I haven't done an author's note like this for this story yet! so here's your long unnecessary A/N because I felt like it and Imma shuddap now because you probably want to read now...) I have plans for the plot to this story! (hopefully I actually remember them...) On a side note: I don't think you people are aware of how happy you've made me with the response to this fic :) Thank you, thank you, thank you! Segen had ridden the bicycle through the night, through the trees, with difficulty, though, as the first signs of dawn, she'd come across a dirt road, but by then, she knew she would have to sleep for a few hours, because, when she had to choose between option (A) sleep in the woods and hope that she didn't get robbed again and option (B) keep going until she found somewhere to stop for a few hours, she would go with (B), because there was no telling who else might come across her in the woodland. The next person or persons she might come across were probably going to be worse than what the wild girl had pulled. While the filthy, southern American had merely tackled her and had held her knife away, and had given it back in exchange for a protein bar (which reminded her: she needed to eat sooner rather than later), someone else might do worse for a little less or little more than a mere protein bar. She'd stopped the bicycle in the middle of the road at least ten minutes ago, just after finding it. She'd put down the kickstand (because falling off the bike was not on the top of her to-do list—finding a place to sleep for a few hours at most, however, was ). As soon as she'd gotten her bike on the road, she'd had to stop, because something didn't sit right with her. Something had, in fact, had sat very wrong with her, so much in fact that, at the moment, she refused to go any further. There was a strange, ill-felt stillness in the air that the cold breeze sifting through the trees and through what small amount of hair the Israeli had on her head couldn't even shake. It wasn't as heavy as the silence that the rustling of the naked branches seemed to be drowning in, but it was still there . When she inhaled through her mouth, making a gasping sound that seemed too loud for being merely a noisy intake of breath, she tasted something different on her tongue. When she inhaled—a bit more deeply—through her nose, her eyes narrowed, and her head snapped to the left. She knew that smell . Well, it was more like she knew that stench , because, really—after everything that had happened over the last few days (and before that, when she was young), once you catch a whiff of it once, you could never mistake it for anything else, because her nose scrunched up, and she felt bile rise, for a second—a typical reflex that she was used to by now—in the back of her throat. She swallowed, uneasily, because she didn't have to wonder what the smell was coming from, and since it was so faint here—and so god damn quiet —she had a feeling that if she went left, she'd find the source of whatever was making that horrid smell ( stench .) Her eyes traveled to the tops of the trees—well, as best they could, since the trees flanked the dirt road she'd managed to find without popping a tire on a thorn or rock in the wrong spot in the wrong time (thank goodness )—to look for any signs of smoke, because she was sure that the stench (which, upon first inhaling it and seeing what it belonged to, had made her lose whatever food she'd managed to eat that day) belonged to that, which accompanied burning— or burnt —flesh . She couldn't help but shudder. She wasn't really sure if she was willing to explore a new sight that served as an abandoned (hopefully, by now) excuse of civilization (that really wasn't even that anymore, considering it felt like this part of the world hadn't been touched by another person besides herself in a very long while). But, if the place that held that horrid stench was , in fact, abandoned, then, if she covered her nose with a piece of cloth (or at least something of the like) she would be able to catch a few hours' worth of sleep—and that possibility nearly did make her lose whatever food that was left in her stomach come back up, because, at that instant, she decided that she was not going to sleep with the stench of rotting (burnt or burning?) flesh, fresh in her nostrils. No, she figured she might actually spend the night in the woods, and risk her life and her supplies, for a chance to get some rest. Eventually, though, she would need a find a place to rest. Besides, there was no telling what could be waiting for her if she chose to go left, towards the scent of death—a scent she wanted no part of, and, in fact, she wouldn't mind being as far away as possible from it (but that surely wasn't going to happen anytime soon, given the situation the world had been thrust into quite violently). It could be some sort of trap—a person (or persons) could be waiting to lure someone and then pounce, taking and doing whatever they liked, because, as far as the world was concerned, there wasn't really any lawful things left to do other than what was in there nature—and that was to survive this (zombie) apocalypse. There could be more of those things (zombies—hadn't she already gotten over her uneasy with using that term, or was she really that soft-hearted where it concerned billions—probably—of people that she'd never even met before in her life?) waiting, and she wasn't sure that she wanted to test out her disease quite yet. Or… Or there could be nothing there, only bodies, and blood, and that god-awful stench —and nothing useful at all. Segen shuddered, and swallowed thickly, her eyes turning towards the direction, which held no scent of death whatsoever (to her nostrils' relief), and frowned. Though something bad probably awaited her if she went right (because the stench of death never came with anything good, and she wasn't sure if she had the patience to sneak around like she had in Kingtan, because all she really wanted to do was sleep ), she had no idea what awaited her if she dared to go right. And she was certain—now—that nothing good would come of going in either direction. She wasn't sure if the bicycle she'd taken would last any longer, because she didn't know how sturdy these things were when it came to thorns and fallen twigs and rocks and roots and such, and she knew that tires did pop eventually. And she would prefer that her bike last longer—so the woodland ahead of her was certainly not an option. And this reminded her that when she had first been dropped off on this continent yesterday, around this time (at least, that was what she presumed , since the sky was light now)—when she had come across her first road after leaving the (horrible, rocky, chilly excuse of a) beach. She couldn't help the sigh that passed her lips in a rather loud huff, because she was certain that making this decision shouldn't have been this difficult. Most people, she assumed, would just go —go in a direction that suited them. Or, maybe they would have a map and know where the hell they were even going—and here she was, debating it within her head, with drooping eyelids and a slight pounding behind her eyes that told her she really needed to get some rest. How come this decision had to be so difficult ? ","Summary":" I own nuthin. Nuthin except what's obviously mine.

Hope you like it. but keep in mind this is an experimental fanfiction, it may not go anywhere. Introduction August, 30, 2061 It has been fifty years since the aliens first attacked earth, and were driven back, and during that time, they tried once more, thirteen years ago, now, human scientists have tracked them back to their home planet. It was ravaged and industrialized, leading the scientists to dub the aliens, the Ravagers. Now, using technology developed from studying the destroyed alien ships, the newly formed, United Earth Nations, has built a fleet of twenty-two ships, for interstellar travel. Seven carrier class ships were built in space, and readied for immediate launch, fifteen small 'frigates' were also created to act as escorts. Each of the seven UEN interstellar carriers could hold up to four thousand soldiers and whatever armor support, ammo supplies and air vehicles needed for a large Campagin. On August 30 2062, over thirty-three thousand UEN soldiers were loaded onto the ships, along with seven thousand five hundred naval personnel. Because, in the wake of the second attack, the human leaders saw it as an act of war upon the human race, and now it was time to strike back. The UEN first fleet launched toward the planet, it would be a nine month journey going at light speed, the soldiers and most of the naval personnel were put into a stasis using gasses, cryo and zero gee. The crew that wasn't put into stasis rotated with other crewmembers in and out of stasis throughout the journey. Chapter 1: Arrival \"Admiral Malcolm, report to the bridge, arriving at destination in two hours, beginning slow down procedure.\". Franklin Malcolm rolled out of his cot and stood, he groaned and made his way to the bridge, located four hatches up, the ship lurched as the onboard computer initiated the slowdown. \"Morning Admiral, all systems green, shall I wake the rest of the crew?\". Asked Captain Bourdeaux before Malcolm even looked up. \"Yes, wake the crew, and have all weapons ready to fire ASAP.\". \"Will do sir.\". Bordeaux tapped a few commands into his console, Malcolm floated over to his chair and strapped himself in, the bridge of the UES 'Atlantis' was located, like all UEN ships, in the forward rotational hub, which was deactivated at present, but had been active thirty seconds ago, a diagram appeared on the main screen, it showed the Atlantis slowly creating opposite inertia by generating micro black holes several kilometers off the stern, the rest of the ships were following suit. \"Weapons, what's the status?\". The young ensign turned in his chair. \"Sir, main Railgun is operational, and all four turrets are online, all ninety missile launch and loading tubes are hot.\". \"Good, ready to fire the instant we slow to interplanetary velocities, just in case.\". \"Yes sir!\". The bridge crew tensed, this would be one of the hardest parts of the voyage, if the Ravagers were waiting for them, then the would sustain losses, possibly crippling ones, but if they could sneak into the Ravager 'Alpha' system, then they still had the element of surprise for the assault on the planet. \"Computer, ETA to planet Alpha?\". \"Two hours, ten minutes.\". Replied the computer. \"Captain, Wake the troops, and get them combat ready!\". Yelled Malcolm \"Yes sir!\". Replied Bordeaux Stasis pod bay sixteen, aboard the UES Atlantis. UEN lance corporeal Neil Jackson was floating in a state of blissful darkness when a spike of light shattered it, his eyes cracked open and he blinked several times, a medical officer stood over him, Neil tried to inhale but found his lungs filled with a cold phlegm, he coughed vigorously until he could breath again, a small vacuum sucked away the spittle and phlegm, and a small locker opened to his left, inside was an Armored Combat EVA mark six suit. (AC-EVAmk6) He tried to move but realized he was wrapped in a cocoon of plastic like substance, he bit a hole in it and cool air rushed over his bare arms and legs as he tore it open, after a minute the plastic stuff was balled up by his feet, the medic officer kneeled down and pressed a button, his voice crackled over a speaker. \"Can you tell me your name?\". \"Neil Jackson.\". \"Good, age?\". \"Twenty-five.\". \"Serial number?\". \"6492-1948-395BK.\". \"Good, grab your suit and get dressed once the showers are finished.\". Before Neil could say anything the man had moved on, three nozzles popped out of the sides of his pod, and began coating him with a soapy substance, which tingled and bubbled into nothingness after a few seconds, his door hissed open and he grabbed the suit and gear. After donning his AC-EVAmk6, Neil fell into line with a group of other soldiers who were floating towards the armory. Several reports echoed through the ships speakers, a few were about men and women who died while being woken. Neil armed himself with a TP-558 assault rifle, a rifle that compressed a lot of thermal energy around the bullets and then fired them out using a small linear accelerator, standard issue for the Exeditionary Assault Fleet. He also grabbed a TP-G19 pistol, along with a combat load of grenades and ammo. He floated over and \"sat\" down in his pod again, there were hundreds of other soldiers doing the same thing, waiting for the call to move out. Bridge, UES Atlantis, \"Admiral, Ravager frigate configuration spotted!\". Called the sensor operator, she tapped a section of her screen and an image resolved into what looked like, and was, at least twelve dozen Ravager drones linked together to form a frigate sized machine. \"Weapons, fire our Railgun turrets as well as the main gun!\". The man on the console nodded and input the firing coordinates, the turrets and the main gun were aimed at the alien ship. With a crimson flash the main gun fired, the triple round burst struck and rippled the formation, and the turret fire prevented the drones from dispersing, a group of three HE tactical missiles weaved themselves into the middle of the formation and detonated, shattering the remaining coherency, the drones spun and smashed into each other, it was over in a matter of minutes, and the EAF moved on, only thirty minutes to the planet. \"All soldiers, report to your landing craft, repeat, all soldiers report to your landing craft!\". Lander bay Beta, UES Atlantis, Neil floated over a bar and pulled his way into his platoons landing craft, to him it looked like a cross between an APC, an Osprey and a bus. He pushed himself into the troop bay and strapped himself in, there were sixty nine other soldiers inside, and every one of them was armed to the teeth. Now they waited to launch. Bridge, Malcolm stood on the bridge, watching as the remains of three Ravager cruisers drifted away, he also watched the planet as the first five of thirty non-nuclear super bombs was launched towards the planet. Seconds later three small suns blossomed on the surface, thirty bombs had been shot down, each bomb was targeted at an area where there was major industrial emissions and power concentrations The EMP burst from the bombs should shut down the antiaircraft defenses that would most likely be in place for the ten minutes required for the landing craft to get to the planet and unload their troops. \"All Landers Except for squadrons five through seven launch immediately!\". He studied the biometric scans, the atmosphere was filled with chemicals, if a human breathed this stuff, they would die in just over three minutes, so every marine and naval officer wore a suit which had filters to generate breathable air. 2Lander 369-4 There was a loud clank and everyone was pressed back in their seats when the lander detached from it's mooring and launched, the planet loomed ahead, and the landers streamed from the UEN ships, five thousand troops were being kept behind for a relief force once the main group had taken key points in the largest city which thy guessed was the capital. The platoon commander cleared his throat. \"Okay, you all know the drill, get off this tub and secure the area, kill anything that isn't human, and clear the area for more landers, are we clear!\" there was a chorus of 'sir yes sir's and the soldiers loaded their weapons, sealed their helmets and checked to make sure the filters were working, the pilot activated a small timer, counting down from three minutes. \"Prepare to unload!\" called the pilot, and the lights turned red. Suddenly the ship was hit by something, it rocked violently and the pilot swore. \"Damn, some of their AA guns are operational!\". Neil gripped his rifle tighter, outside, thumps reverberated the hull, the counter ticked down to ten seconds and the ship leveled out. The light flipped to green, and everyone slapped their harness release buttons, stood and rushed out when the hatch dropped. Their lander had also carried a small, two-man armored jeep with a gatling turret, the first two soldiers jumped in, one aimed the turret, the other provided support. Several Ravagers appeared on the tops of wrecked structures and in the spaces between them, Neil sighted through his scope and squeezed the trigger. \"Contact left!\". He cried, his gun barked five times, and one alien threw up it's arms and fell, water spurting out of the chest punctures. The rest of the platoon began to fire, heated bullets and thermal lasers slashed through the air, one man in the jeep was hit twice, but the woman riding shotgun took over the turret, she played the barrel across the tops of buildings, the high velocity rounds tore Ravagers in half. Someone called out for support on the left flank, but when Neil turned, the private was vaporized by a small walker's thermal cluster rockets. Neil fired at the two Ravagers manning the walker like a turret, the first stumbled backwards as it's body was peppered with rounds, but the second took cover behind the walker. \"Gatling! Heavy contact, your six!\" Neil yelled over the radio, the woman jerked the joystick and the turret swiveled around, and fired, the rounds tore the machine in half, the alien was caught in the torrent of hot metal and died quickly. \"Secure the area, bravo squad, east buildings, delta, west, gamma, south, everyone else clear this area for more landers!\". Called the platoon commander, Major Summers. Neil jogged toward a cluster of cylindrical buildings with ten other marines, they spent the next two hours rooting through them and driving out Ravager resistance. When they were relatively sure that all the hostiles had been driven out or eliminated, they contacted a landed which had not been able to land, within three hours they had a small CP with adequate defenses and over one hundred and twenty men. \"How are our forces doing?\". Summers asked Major Wallace, who shrugged, they both stared at the flat screen table with red and green dots all over it. \"Out forces in the western areas are taking a heavy beating but are managing to push forward, CPs are popping up quickly, and the FOB will be set up once we take this open area in the east.\". Wallace pointed to a section of the city that was barren, a few metal buildings marked the edges but it was completely open, perfect for a few hundred, or even thousand marines and their vehicles and equipment. \"Good, in the meantime, I need to establish contact with whoever is in charge.\". \"That would be General Gehrig, his CP is this one.\". Wallace pointed to a slightly larger cluster of marines, Summers nodded, turned to the comm system and punched in a code. A few seconds passed. \"Get me general Gehrig.\". He Waited for a momen as the woman on the other end passed the headset over and the General, who requested a situation report. \"Yes sir, seventh platoon has taken LZ five-fifty, yes sir, will do, sir.\". He placed the headset on the table. \"We are to assist an assault on what our leaders think is a factory, a detatchment of twelfth platoon, foxtrot company, has run into heavy resistance, and if that building isn't taken, them we might have to deal with an enemy that could build machines on our doorstep.\". Wallace nodded and stepped back. \"I'll send a few squads.\". And he walked into the airlock, put his helmet on, and sealed it. Neil was sitting with his squad and members of another, when Major Wallace approached them, there were also about twelve other marines following him. \"I need you marines to mount up in those transports, Foxtrot company is in need of help assaulting a factory, move!\". They all piled into the HATATV-538 (Heavy All Terrain Assault Transport Vehicle), which was essentially an armored, topless and armed bus suspended two meters above the ground with treads on thick armored legs. They took off and practically floated over most rubble, several Ravagers were seen exchanging fire with Marines, and one of the younger marines, Dennis, leaned forward so he could be heard. \"How long do you think it'll be before their Drones get back in the sky?\". Another marine, a veteran of the invasion of shanghai, spoke up. \"Probably in a few hours, but don't go asking questions like that, it's bad luck.\". Dennis was about to respond with something witty when his head exploded. Everyone reacted instantly, sighting around and searching for the shooter, but what they found was that the vehicles had stumbled onto the battle for the factory sooner than expected, the foxtrot marines were pinned by a trio of mini cannon walkers and six dozen Ravager soldiers slowly moving towards the twenty marines that sat huddled behind cover. \"Let's move marines!\". Called Neil's captain, Max Vighn. The soldiers jumped off and moved through the rubble towards Foxtrot. A/N: That will be the end of chapter one, it bears prety much no resemblance to Battle LA in terms of plot or characters, the aliens are the same and so is their tech, please review and let me know what you think.[Chapter 2] Hello everyone!

May 30, 2063. Orbiting Ravager planet Alpha. It was inevitable but disappointing nonetheless, for a full hour after the initial nuking of the cities and deployment of ground forces the UEN fleet had remained in space unmolested by any Ravager forces, but now over a dozen Frigate class and three cruiser class configurations were advancing from the northern polar region, far away from any of the nuked cities. \"All hands to battle stations, move nonessential personnel into the escape pods and remove atmosphere from all empty compartments, have damage control teams and marines standing by!\". Admiral Malcolm gripped the railing around his chair as he shouted orders into the fleet-wide intercom and other crewmembers rushed to comply with those orders. \"Admiral, hostile fleet in weapons range of Linac cannon in two minutes!\". Malcolm nodded to the ensign who was manning the weapons console. \"Good, spool up the main gun and activate auto turrets! Prepare for incoming fire!\". A rumbling filled the ship as dozens of hatches along the outside of the hull slid back to reveal double-barreled rotating chain-guns, a schematic of the fleet showed the other ships doing the same. The weapons control ensign swiveled around to face the Admiral. \"Sir, fleet reports all ships combat ready, interceptors in the tubes, crew in the pods.\". \"Good, prepare all ships to fire Linac cannons and railgun turrets do not let those bastards get in close and split up!\". Fifty tense seconds passed without a word said as everyone's eyes were glued to the battle map as the Ravager ships approached the yellow extreme firing range line on the plot. The UEN fleet erupted with light the second the ravagers crossed the line, twenty-two white hot streaks shot forward followed by several dozen smaller, but no less deadly, railgun turret rounds, a few wispy smoke lines spiraled along the simmering trails left by the accelerated slugs. With devastating force the first few Linac rounds hit three Ravager ships, it only took two before the configurations spiraled out of control and dispersed into debits and smaller gunship formations that accelerated towards the human warships. Explosions lit up the alien fleet as more ships were torn apart by the human guns but even with the losses inflicted fourteen ships managed to get into weapons range flanked by over two hundred gunships left over from the other configurations. \"Launch interceptors!\". Shouted Admiral Malcolm and ninety-five single-ships detached from their docking bays on the inner hub of the UEN ships, fire and light lit up space as the Ravager configurations fired their missiles and the auto turrets blew them out of the sky, trails of tracer bullets snaked between human ships as their defenses targeted gunships and missiles, Malcolm staggered as a stray gunship managed to get a shot off into the midsection of the Atlantis before an interceptor gunned it down. Through the main view the bridge crew of the Atlantis watched as the Demetrius and Frontrunner ganged up on a Ravager frigate, their missiles and Linacs tore the configuration apart and their railgun turrets blasted any stragglers to dust, the victory was short lived as an alien cruiser closed with the Demetrius and opened fire, the missile clusters struck the frigates' dorsal engines disintegrating them and sending the UEN ship spinning away from the battle small puffs of thrust were visible as it corrected the spin and opened fire with it's railguns severely damaging the cruisers' port side. The Demetrius took more fire from gunships and the cruiser as eone by one it's turrets were destroyed and the Linac was disabled, auto-turrets only provided so much cover and could not protect against all incoming fire, escape pods and troop landers sped away from the mighty ship as it's spine cracked and detonated, secondary explosions mushroomed out from the inside and tore the ship apart and whatever sections were intact by then the Ravager cruiser blasted away. The officer at the sensor board began calling out reports. \"All signals from the Demetrius have ceased sir, the survivors are docking with the servicing ships in the fleet under cover of fighters, the Frontrunner has reengaged the hostile cruiser and is dealing crippling damage.\". \"Launching missiles from pod seven!\". Cried the weapons ensign. Ten ghostly trails lazily arced towards the flaming cruiser as it drifted in space while the Frontrunners' turrets hammered it. The missiles dove into the collapsing formation and detonated inside the cluster, shattering whatever cohesiveness that remained and scattered the gunships which were picked off by the rain of gunfire from the Frontrunner. \"Admiral! The Ravager fleet is pulling away and heading for the norther pole, new scans show one cluster of structures that could be a base of operations for their ships, shall we pursue?\". \"Negative, proceed as planned, launch the second attack wave along with their armor and air support, then pursue the Ravagers right back to where they're cowering.\". The second wave of troops along with additional LATAVs and HATAVs was dispatched with one hundred and fifty MSAC (Manned Space/Atmosphere Capable) gunships escorting them. Once the ground forces were away the fleet slowly but steadily changed course and followed the far away remains of the Ravager attack fleet back to their polar base. Surface/ Ravager city/ Foxtrot assault position. Their HATAV had been destroyed almost immediately and the Ravagers had closed in fast giving the UEN marines little time to react, Neil dove behind a hunk of stone as two of his platoon were riddled with thermal rounds, two groups of ten Ravagers closed in, obviously the had been fruit to flank Foxtrot but had caught the HATAV instead. One of the sergeants was dragging a Corporal to cover when a walkers' cluster rockets blew them both away, neil found himself in a shower of dirt and gore as he crawled backwards and pawed around for his weapon, his hand found something gun-like and he pulled it up, it was a thermal AR and he eagerly opened fire with three round bursts. The walker's pilots were taken down first before he moved on to the supporting infantry, water steamed and boiled as the superheated bullets peppered the aliens, with the pressure taken off of them scattered survivors from the HATAV emerged and began to massacre the aliens, the entire fight lasted for fifty seconds before it was over but sixteen of the twenty-five marines were dead. As the adrenaline wore off Neil noticed something on his gun, a human hand still clung tightly to the clip, holding back his breakfast Neil pried the fingers open and tossed the hand away before standing shakily. \"Sound off!\". He cried, stunned at how hoarse his voice was. \"Eight alive sir! Four wounded!\". Replied a private who jogged up to him clutching a bloody shoulder in one hand and a pistol in the other. \"Who's the ranking officer that survived soldier?\". \"You are sir, Sergeant Kinney was killed in the firefight.\". With a heavy sight Neil walked towards the cluster of survivors. \"Okay, I want the wounded to dig in in a nearby building and radio for assistance, those of us who can will continue our mission to assist foxtrot, move out on me marines!\". He turned and began to jog towards the, not to distant, battlefield with four battered marines following him. Foxtrot was in a bad position from what Neil could see through his AR scope, dozens of Ravager squads had been guarding the factory and they were heavily armed and had Foxtrot pinned from three sides with walkers and lots of gunfire, the surviving fifteen marines took blind shots over cover and threw grenades over their protection but it did little more than the occasional enemy casualty. Neil pressed his earpiece and raised the commander of foxtrot, Sergeant Winters. Gunfire and shouts filled the channel and Neil could barely make out the sergeants' voice. \"Hello? This is Sergeant Winters of Foxtrot, this better be our support of I'll kill the general myself!\". Wincing from the noise blasting into his ear Neil replied. \"This is Lance Corporal Jackson I am here with four marines to your west flank, we are all that's left of your support but I think we can cover you and your men so you can pull back to us.\". There was a pause and nearby shotgun blasts before the reply came through. \"once we regroup we need to find a way to take out that factory!\". \"Roger that, now prepare to bug out to the west!\". Neil closed the channel and turned to his troops. \"I want precision fire on those ravagers, if even one gets a good shot it could kill them all.\". \"Yes sir!\". The marines dispersed into the small building they were hiding in and prepared to engage the enemy, Neil settled down in a small rook that had taken a shot from some kind of tank, leaving a perfectly sized hole to shoot from. He deplaned the channel to Winters. \"Sergeant, Go Now!\". With that he shoulder his rifle, aimed down the scope and began to pick off Ravager soldiers from behind, his squad followed suit and it took the ravagers a full seven seconds to react and once they did Foxtrot rushed their confused flank, gunning down aliens and darting between rubble, once Ravager walker managed a lucky shot and sent two trailing marines sailing into rubble piles where they lay with their bones in unnatural positions and crimson streams pooling on the dusty metal and stone. The remaining thirteen soldiers rushed into the buildings and grouped together with Neil's team as the ravagers advanced on their position, marines took up posts and opened fire driving the aliens into cover, Neil found Winters and saluted, it was returned crisply. \"Thank you corporal, you saved us.\". \"No time for that sergeant, we need an airstrike or heavy support of any kind here, with that infantry force guarding the factory there is no way we'll punch through.\". Winters nodded and pressed his earpiece. \"This is Sergeant Winter of Foxtrot squad, we are in need of heavy support for a priority one assault on hostile drone factory, enemy infantry presence overwhelming, is anyone out there?\". Static dominated the line for several long seconds before a broken voice answered. \"This is Lion 2-7 to Foxtrot lead, we are inbound to target zone, one suppressor HATAV en route, ETA four minutes!\". Neil felt his hopes rise slightly the suppressor HATAVs were made specially for mowing down infantry and light vehicles, exactly what they needed. \"Incoming!\". Neil ducked down as a cluster missile struck the building and killed two marines, Winters and Neil ran to take up positions and join the fight, it was going to be a long four minutes. In orbit/ Northern pole. The Ravagers had lead the human fleet straight to their base, the surviving two cruisers and seven frigates hovered in the atmosphere thousands of feet above the icy surface, the UEN ships kept their distance as Admiral Malcolm formulated a plan. He was leaning over a battle plot screen with Captain Bordeaux. \"If we engage the Ravager fleet above the base we will most likely take losses and with the Demetrius gone we have less firepower but the attack would give our marines the chance to land and infiltrate the base, it could hold important data.\". Malcolm listened intently as Bordeaux presented her plan and once she was finished he cupped his chin in his hand. \"We can't afford to lose too many ships because it'll be twelve months before the support fleet arrives, but we can't ignore the obvious chance to gather solid intel.\". He was quiet for several seconds before pressing the fleet-wide intercom. \"All ships prepare for battle!\". He switched the channel to the cryogenic bays. \"Major Conrad, send two platoons to the surface base once the attack has begun, all data is being forwarded to you.\". Once the channel was closed Malcolm nodded to Bordeaux who returned to the helm and began to rapidly tap in strings of commands. In unison the fleet jumped forward and began moving towards the alien ships, they humans would be firing down on the Ravagers but the bases capabilities were unknown, so the fleet proceeded with caution into weapons range of the alien configurations. The familiar flashes of Linac and Railgun rounds being fired filled the screens and dozens of flaming slugs burned through the atmosphere and through the Ravager ships sending gunship fragments spinning into the distant ice, missiles arced up at the human ships and all but a few were gunned down before they felt the atmosphere, two of the ten stray missiles hit the Atlantis, throwing two crewmembers on the bridge from their straps and into the air where they waited to hit the next solid surface and float back to their posts. An audible thump echoed through the ship as the marine lander left it's clamps and headed down to the surface. The battle between the fleets heated up as the configurations rose back into space to get in close with the UEN warships, two frigates were sacrificed for this tactic to work and soon the human ships were exchanging fire wit ships that were barely two kilometers away, so close they could see the individual gunships that made up the huge clusters. Planet Alpha/ Norther pole base. Lieutenant Quinn O'Neil and his platoon of Marines emerged in full arctic combat gear into a freezing ice plain outside of the Ravager base, the seven massive cylindrical structures that made up the base were connected by pipes and scaffolds with one large doorway leading inside the tallest structure, Quinn waved his troops forward and the forty marines and their two LATAVs moved cautiously towards the base. At first glance it seemed like nothing had been in the structures for years but Quinn immediately spotted tracks in the snow leading deeper into the hallways, he orders the two LATAVs to guard the door and the rest of the marines moved in weapons up and safety's off, something Quinn had failed to notice however, was the small red-lensed device on the ceiling, somewhere inside the base a Ravager soldier watched the human soldiers move into it's structure and rushed off, rallying more and more troops to defend against the invaders. Ravager City/ Foxtrot holdout. The HATAV arrive just in time, the Ravagers and Foxtrot were seconds away from hand to hand fighting when the huge tank-like vehicle had smashed through a wall and opened fire with dual chain-guns and grenade launchers, demolishing the alien infantry and their walkers, with a cheat the surviving nine marines charged across the battle torn streets and arrived at the factory, Winters produced a small thumb-sized device and stuck it to the factory and pressing several buttons on the face. \"Let's get out of here!\". He shouted and the marines ran for the HATAV which was busy mowing down advancing Ravager reinforcements. The marines piled into the vehicle. \"Take us back to the main CP!\". Shouted Neil to the driver who nodded and gunned the engine speeding off. In orbit/ Norther pole. \"Admiral! Foxtrot has marked their objective!\". And ensign shouted over alarm klaxons and explosions, Malcolm gripped his armrests and leaned forward. \"Weapons, fire one missile tube at marker!\". \"Roger that admiral!\". Seconds later ten HE tactical missiles raced through space and into the atmosphere, homing in on their target, the explosion could be felt for miles and the debris were catapulted for hundreds of yards in random directions. Ravager City/ Main UEN Command HATAV found a place to park among the other armored vehicles and Neil disembarked, the marines that had survived from the support team and foxtrot were take to the medical tents where there were at lest two hundred wounded and more moving in and out constantly, Neil was laid down on a cot and despite the adrenaline in his system he quickly fell asleep as a doctor began to remove shrapnel from his right arm. A/N: And that is chapter 2, once I got started I couldn't stop and I am proud of how this one came out and I sincerely apologize for the obscenely ling wait. -R[Chapter 4] Chapter 3 A/N: Just so everyone knows the uploader and I are having some problems as it doesn't seem to support paragraph indentation Planet Alpha, Ravager Polar Base. Quinn stepped over a Ravagers' body and put two rounds into the last surviving alien as it tried to crawl away, this force of fifteen Ravagers was the only resistance the lieutenant and his troops had encountered and they seemed to have been guarding some kind of control room, octagonal screens lined the Walls, displaying alien symbols seemingly at random. \"Admiral Malcolm, I think we've found something.\" Quinn switch on the small camera mounted to his helmet and panned the room, the admiral's voice sputtered into his ear amidst a haze of static. \"Secure the location I'm sending down the eggheads, whatever information is here could be what we need to break the back of their resistance.\" Planet Alpha, Ravager City, Day 9 (Post landing). Neil had his body crouched down as low as he could to avoid incoming fire while still being able to man the mounted gun in front of him, he'd been posted to a hot zone near the north of the city along with the remains of Foxtrot and from then to now it was hell, the Ravagers continuous assaults made it clear that they needed something in this area, all Foxtrot had to do was hold out until incoming LATAVs with fresh soldiers could arrive and drive the alien forces off. The gun shook wildly in his hands as it sprayed a pair of crumbling building with thermal rounds, three of the nine aliens inside screamed as the heated metal riddled their bodies and boiled the water inside of them. The other twenty aliens scattered through the rubble popped out of cover to take shots at Neil and his gun emplacement, two marines from Foxtrot, Corporal Denner and Private Farnsworth began picking off the infantry with their assault rifles, adding more bodies to the dozens of alien corpses that littered the debris. A whooshing sound made Neil turn his gun to the right and he was blown back as one of the walking Ravager missile turrets lumbered into view from behind a piece of metal wall. Not bothering to run to his mounted gun and wait for it to spin up again Neil simply grabbed his AR from behind the gun and switched it to single fire, placing accurate and deadly shots into the knees of the machine and the heads of its crew, the walker stumbled and fell onto its side, two of the four aliens manning it fell to Neil's attacks as their cover tripped up. The other infantry left the machine and ran for cover. \"Yeah!\" That sight never gets old!\" Denner shouted, firing his rifle twice into the air, the other aliens around the outpost were also pulling back into the ruined city streets where the humans couldn't follow them. \"Denner, find the Lieutenant I need to speak with him, Farnsworth, cover this area we'll be back ASAP.\". Both of the marines instantly responded to their sergeant and split up, Farnsworth manned the mounted gun while Denner headed towards a cluster of low walls and makeshift gun batteries that was the main area of the outpost, there was still a few stragglers from the attacking aliens that were taking pot-shots at the humans in that area but nothing for the fifteen marines to worry about. It took three minutes before Denner returned with the lieutenant Rasting in tow, the officer was an older woman in her forties with a few locks of short blonde hair sticking out from under her helmet. \"Sergeant I hear you need to speak with me?\" Her tone was that of mild irritation, like Neil had pulled a teenager away from their videogames. \"Yes ma'am, I was wondering when we could expect those reinforcements.\" Rasting shook her head slowly. \"Not for another day at least, the Admiral is ordering the main bulk of our forces into a fortified line dividing the captured territory in half to minimize risk of losing all of our holdings.\" Neil shrugged. \"And that prevents our reinforcements from getting here how?\" \"Until Malcolm known what it'll take to keep the line secure transfer of troops is tight and for emergencies only.\" Finding frustration and annoyance bubbling within him Neil spoke plainly. \"Ma'am unless we get more ammo and troops here soon the Ravagers might be able to just walk right on up here and kick our asses, maybe you could convey that to command.\" Rasting ignored his small outburst in favour of turning on her heel. \"I'll remember to let them know Sergeant Jackson, in the meantime man your post and keep those alien bastards off of us.\" Once the Lieutenant was out of sight behind a low wall Neil flashed a middle finger and walked back to Farnsworth, the younger soldier turned as he approached. \"All quiet here sir, no sign of the enemy.\" A quick scan of the ruins confirmed this, not a single thing was moving out there, and it was dead. Neil was about to sit down on a piece of stone when a thrumming sound reached his ears he immediately stood up with his rifle pointed in the direction of the buildings, Farnsworth tightened his grip on the mounted gun. It took several seconds but soon the sources of the sound revealed themselves, a half dozen hover cars with mounted guns in the center manned by a crew of three Ravagers each. \"Incoming!\" Shouted Neil and dropped to one knee behind cover, his rifle remained above the metal wall and he fired controlled bursts of fire aimed at the pilots of the vehicles. The private opened up with the machine gun and tore the first machine into heated shrapnel in seconds but the gun and he were consumed in flames as the other five hover cars opened fire at once. Several more guns joined Neil's as the Lieutenant and four other marines raced to defend the outpost, the combined fire of six marines ARs shattered the protective bubble around one hover car's pilot and killed it sending the vehicle spinning into a wall where it exploded. \"Infantry, left side!\" Rasting shouted as she jumped down beside Neil, the marines turned to see dozens of Ravagers soldiers rushing the outpost from the left flank three marines shifted fire to try and suppress the advance but the numbers ensured that the Ravagers steadily gained ground. \"Pull back to the LATA-\". Rasping was cut short as a handful of thermal rounds peppered her neck and chest her corpse dropped limply and was left behind while the marines pulled back with Ravagers soldier's mere feet away. Neil was the first one into the armoured vehicle and he clambered into the main gun, rotated it to face the aliens and depressed the trigger buttons. Hundreds of thermal rounds raced through the air in a tight line kicking up glassed dirt wherever they hit, a third hovercraft was cut in half by the gunfire and twenty Ravagers were transformed into clouds of blood and bits. The surviving seven marines piled into the vehicle, one manned the controls and gunned the engines while another got on the comm channels and alerted command. \"Command this is Outpost Golf-03, we have been overrun by a superior enemy force and are falling back towards the FOB!\" The static filled reply came an agonizing ten seconds later. \"Copy that Golf-03, Ravagers forces are launching offensive all along that line of outposts, pull back to the outer FOB defences and report to Major Nantz for orders, over.\" \"Copy that!\" The LATAV arrived at the outer defences in minutes, Neil and Foxtrot left their vehicle near a makeshift bunker and walked towards the Major, who was shouting orders to a squadron of engineers as they set up MG Emplacements and fortifications, as the ranking officer Neil approached the officer and almost snapped off a salute before remembering battlefield protocol. \"Ma'am, Sergeant Brown from Outpost Golf-03 reporting for duty!\" Nantz turned and gave him a nod. \"Good to see more people survived the offensive, we've lost contact with all our western outposts and wounded have been flooding in for half an hour.\" A quick scan of the surrounding area confirmed her words, half a dozen medivac landers were lined up and being loaded with wounded soldiers in stretchers and bandages, medical teams rushed towards incoming LATAVs and unloaded the wounded from them. \"Walk with me sergeant.\" Neil and his marines followed the major as she walked towards a series of small walls and trenches being constructed along the northwest flank. \"I'm short on troops here thanks to the defence line being set up back at the FOB, with so few ready troops up here I'm going to need you and your squad to spread thin, I'm paring your unit up with what remains of Gamma platoon but you'll still be stretched thin.\". Neil looked over the defences and picked out strong and weak points for later analysis. \"We won't let you down ma'am.\" Nantz turned and extended her hand, Neil took it and they shook. \"I know you won't.\" At that she turned and walked towards a cluster of marines just getting out of their vehicles and looking around. \"Ma'am! I just wanted to say, it's a pleasure to serve under someone with a history like your families.\" Nantz shot Neil a look over her shoulder. \"I'm just trying to do my part; my dad's achievements don't apply to me!\" In Orbit... \"Admiral, our forces on the ground are calling for support, it seems as through the Ravagers have begun a large counterattack from the west.\" Malcolm leaned over Bordeaux's screen and glanced over the paragraphs, charts and images that flashed across it. \"Bring us over the city and prepare to fire the ventral rail gun battery in a spread across the area where the outposts we have lost are located.\" The captain nodded and tapped in several commands. \"Coming about 22.9 degrees and readying ventral battery! T minus four minutes until we are in range Admiral!\" The massive carrier pulled away from the main fleet and moved towards the main ravager city, as they passed over the planet Malcolm looked at the ventral camera feeds, 90% of the planet was now dark, tiny pinpricks of light dotted where massive cities had once lit up the surface, all erased in seconds from the massive bombs dropped on them. Once they were over the main city the ship stopped moving while the gun battery found a firing solution. \"Admiral I'm reading several energy spikes across the city, roughly twelve and they weren't there before.\" Polar Base... \"I didn't do it on purpose!\" Shouted one of the technicians and backed away from a panel, orange symbols and images scrolled across it by the hundreds, what images did remain weren't good, they showed massive collections of Ravager air drones in silos underneath the city all configured into frigate sized formations. Quinn tried to contact command as the techs rushed to reverse what was happening. In orbit... \"Sir, Lieutenant O'Neil is contacting us from the Polar Base!\" Malcolm walked over to his seat and pulled up a small monitor, he tapped a few commands into the touch screen and donned a headset. \"Patch it through here ensign.\" \"Sir, the energy spikes are rising!\" A short moment of static preceded Quinn's voice filtering into Admiral Malcolm's ear. \"Admiral something is happening here! We've somehow activated twelve Ravager drone frigates buried underneath the city!\" Ravager City... The ground shook and sounds akin to thunderclaps split the air, everyone including Neil looked up as huge pillars of debris shot into the sky at random points around the city, the chunks of metal and clouds of pulverized stone dropped back the ground to reveal twelve Ravager frigates rising into the sky from their hidden docks. In Orbit... \"Incoming, twelve hostile frigates approaching from below! Firing ventral battery!\" The Atlantis experienced two small tremors and two white streaks shot down past the ventral cameras, a tiny explosion marked the hits but they didn't bring the attacker down. \"They're firing!\" Time seemed to slow for Malcolm as twelve flashes of light appeared from the planet's atmosphere and began to grow in size. A/N: Okay, been a while since I updated this and I hope you all like it! BTW I am accepting character submissions for any of my stories in case anyone wanted to submit something.[Chapter 5] Chapter 4 A/N: As always I apologize for the inconsistencies of my updates and I hope to release a few more chapters over the summer closer together. ...In Orbit... The twelve Ravager frigates rose rapidly through the clouds and into space, the human fleet hovered several hundred kilometres higher and 'north' of them, railgun fire rained down on the huge clusters of drones, each hit shattered multiple drones into dust creating a divot in their structure but they powered through the barrage, splitting into six pairs each heading in a different direction while releasing clouds of cluster missiles at their attackers. Admiral Malcolm watched as the point defence batteries easily took out the scattered missile clusters, filling the screens and sensor displays with their death explosions, one of the crew broke the silence. \"Admiral, the hostiles appear to be creating a smokescreen, they are making for open space!\" Malcolm wasted no time in giving his next orders. \"I want those ships dead, all ships are to pursue and destroy ASAP!\" The fleet slowly peeled apart and went after the six pairs of frigates who continued to fire cluster missiles, which were useless protection against a UEN Carrier's primary railgun, the round flashed across space between the Atlantis and her first target, punching a wide hole straight through the frigate, the six rail-turrets began bombarding the smaller ship as it broke apart and began dispersing, a pair of missiles scattered any remaining active drones as the carrier fired on its next target. The Frigate seemed to freeze in space for a split second before stretching and flashing forward, the Carrier's rounds passed through empty space, Malcolm and the bridge crew were silent for several seconds before Malcolm began demanding answers. \"Someone tell me what the he'll just happened, give me a status report on the fleet and contact General Groves I want to know out situation on the ground!\". The officer on the sensor console spoke up. \"Admiral, the Frontrunner reports only one other ship got away, it is likely that these ships were an attempt by the Ravagers to either get important data, supplies or individuals off-planet.\" ... Ravager City/ Northwest combat line... Four dozen UEN marines, two HATAVs, six LATAVs and a pair of MSAC gunships were all the forces assigned to this section of exterior defences spanning at least 3 kilometres, Neil hunkered himself down inside a foxhole with three other marines and kept a close eye on his surroundings, to his left and right were more soldiers and equipment being readied for battle, behind him roughly 100 feet was a Ravager water storage plant, which the UEN was draining to use later, and in front of him was a war-torn city through which an unknown number of Ravager soldiers were currently massing in preparation for an attack. \"Ravager forces are moving, prepare to receive incoming ordnance!\" Captain Kimbal called over the comm system and Neil took it to heart, flattening himself as close to the ground as possible and aiming through a slit in the low metal rim of the hole, the other marines around him copied his actions and prepared themselves. There was dead silence for several minutes, nothing but the wind and the breathing from hundreds of nervous marines up until the first shot sounded, thousands of orange bolts began to pepper the entrenched humans and with a great rumble thousands of Ravager soldiers rushed from the cover of the destroyed city accompanied by three dozen or more hover vehicles. The chattering of thermal machine-guns and assault rifles filled the air in answer to the rush, dozens of Ravagers jerked and fell but for each that died another took its place, the air between the two forces was nearly boiling away from the exchange of thermal energies and it made it very hard for Neil to breathe. He began to breath more heavily as the air around him heated up but maintained his position and picked off the charging aliens one by one, LATAV mounted guns cut into the hostiles and HATAV canister launchers sent their explosive payloads into the Ravager mass. Two silver steaks of light flashed overhead and four ghostly trails of smoke detached from them and spiralled into the disorganized clusters of Ravager Hover cars, smoking metal shrapnel of all shapes and sizes mushroomed into the air. The distance between the Ravagers and the humans was closing rapidly and there were still plenty of the bastards left, Neil slid to the bottom of the foxhole as several bolts kicked up dirt around where he was shooting from, he ejected his spent mag and slotted a fresh one into place, he peeked back out of the slit before pulling a grenade from his belt and tapping the shoulder of the marine closest to him, she rolled over slightly to see him. He held the grenade so she could see it and held up three fingers, she nodded and pulled her own grenade out. After the quick mental countdown finished two dark green apple-sized spheres arced out of the fortified hole, over fifteen meters of dirt and rubble, hit the ground and rolled another six meters where they exploded just as the Ravager lines reached them, a pair of dust plumes was accompanied by severed limbs and alien howls of pain. More grenades were thrown by other marines as the alien hostiles entered the range; the front line became a wall of pulverized dirt and dead alien bits. One of the LATAVs ceased fire as forty different Ravagers concentrated fire on it, smoke burst from the dozens of holes in the hull and the rotating MG on the top topped over as a pillar of smoke and flame spat from the top hatch, the gun rolled and landed beside Neil nearly crushing his leg, he instinctively grabbed it as a light went on in his head and dragged it up, poking the gun over the edge of his foxhole and pulling the trigger, the powerful, formerly mounted, gunshot seventy rounds and killed forty aliens before it ran out of ammunition, Neil returned to his rifle and resumed firing, it was almost to the point where he was firing at their hips the aliens were so close, in a few seconds they would be on top of the marine lines. \"This is Kimball to everyone under my command, f-\". Whatever he might have said next was lost as his HATAV's turret was blown off and the vehicle tipped, slid down a small slope and exploded. Neil activated his comm. \"Charge bayonets!\" He shouted and clicked his into place. \"Prepare to receive the enemy!\" The three other marines in his foxhole attached their bayonets and readied themselves. After a few seconds the Ravagers began to pass around and through the foxholes and the marines were there to meet them with heat and steel, Neil jabbed upward into the chest of the first Ravager to reach the foxhole and pulled the trigger, the rounds ripped large exit wounds through it's back and it fell on top of him, it's gun discharged and singed his right cheek. He was stuck for a moment as the wind was knocked out of him and he saw the other marines with him fighting the Ravagers, one was quickly overpowered and shot through the chest twice then tossed aside, the other two fought like mad and managed to pile up the bodies into a better barricade as more Ravagers shot at them. After pushing the alien off himself, Neil crawled behind the body barricade and looked towards the rearmost marine line with the vehicles, the Ravagers were completely bypassing their adversaries and instead rushing the factory, hundreds dying in the process as the few who made it grabbed water containers and made for the ruins, the MSACs made another pass and gunned down the water carriers. As soon as it had begun the tide of incoming fire and rushing Ravagers ended as the last few crossed the line and ran for the containers, gunfire still echoed and Neil could see the surviving marines engaged in hand to hand combat with a few stragglers, a rumbling filled the air and Neil watched as the last two hundred aliens gathered what water containers they could carry and attempt to flee but were quickly gunned down by 3 incoming platoons of marines and armour and just like that the gunfire and noises stopped, Neil's knees shook his heart raced a mile a minute and he shakily stepped out of the foxhole, the entire area was filled with bodies, thousands of Ravager corpses lay strewn across the open ground that they had to cross more were mixed in with the marines and vehicles while the rest lay in puddles of the water that they had tried to run off with. Maybe twelve of the original forty-eight marines were still standing as the fresh platoons rolled in, Neil felt his vision darken and he looked down to see he had been shot in the abdomen, just missing anything vital but it was bleeding quite a bit, his legs folded in and he fell to the ground. ...Polar Base... Quinn and his crew had nearly decoded the information on the base's computers, it seemed to be a map of some sort, the language was still unknown but once the map was completely cracked it should be easy to interpret. The techs were busy working on Ravager tech, the egg heads were cracking the map and the Marines were finishing their sweep of the base and Quinn liked what he heard, not a single living Ravager had been seen in the complex after the small team they had killed early on now it was just waiting until the map could be read. ...In Orbit... \"Admiral, our ground forces have repelled the Ravager assault with better than acceptable losses, reports from frontline commanders are reporting that they were after the water refineries we captured.\" Malcolm leaned over an officer's shoulder and examined the sensor readout, larger and larger swaths of the city transitioned from red to orange and then to a soft green as patrols checked in. \"Patrols report dozens of surviving Ravagers and drones dropping like flies out there.\". Murmurs passed through the bridge crew, Malcolm straightened and held back a smile. \"We burned them out, they ran out of water and now they're dying!\" The whispers among the bridge crew intensified. \"Send word to all ships and surviving ground units, I want the planet to remain occupied until the relief fleet arrives, it seems that we have won.\" The contained joy in the bridge was overpowering, right up until the communications console beeped. \"Admiral, Lt. Quinn O'Neil hailing from the Polar base.\" \"Put it on the main.\" Quinn's face appeared on the screen and despite most likely hearing the news he looked more worried than happy, Malcolm addressed him formally. \"Lieutenant, what do you have for me?\" Quinn stepped back several feet and off the side, revealing a holographic galaxy map with seven points marked, one blue and six orange. \"Admiral, we've decoded the map and have found valuable intelligence that I need to share immediately, a quick scan reveals that this blue marker is Earth, the orange markers were a mystery until we discovered one of them is this very system, Dr. lannis believes the orange markers are Ravager colonies.\". The bridge crew was so silent they could have heard a pin drop from across the room; Quinn paused for a moment before continuing. \"Some data was deleted and some purged so there is no way to determine if there are more markers of either kind but we can safely assume there are five more Ravager worlds out there and they all know about earth.\". Malcolm turned to Captain Bordeaux. \"Captain, alert the flee to this news, those ships we engaged earlier were obviously messengers or something similar, send word to earth and keep the fleet ready.\" \"Aye sir.\" A/N: And this is the end of Part 1, I do plan on writing more and probably editing the earlier chapters to improve the punctuation, I would like to thank everybody who took the time to review and even read my work it makes me feel good knowing somebody out there enjoys what I've created, expect Part 2 to begin near summer. –Razz[Chapter 6] Counter Attack Part 2 announcement. After debating it for the past few weeks I have decided to upload CA part 2 and all its chapters as a separate story and not continue adding on to the current story. I would like to thank everyone who has read my work for your support and making it worthwhile to resume writing again. I also want to thank Ocelot9 and my good friend, who will go unnamed, for Beta Reading my recent works. To tide everybody over I have a sample from Part 2. ~~~ Neil felt like both arms would soon tear from their sockets, with one hand he held onto a metal pole parallel to the wall and with the other he clutched Ashley's arm as the atmosphere venting into space through the ragged hole in the hull threatened to pull them out with it. The cool blue star and nearby planets in the Damascus system spun wildly through the hole as the Atlantis tumbled through space leaking from multiple breaches in the hull, every once or twice Neil got a glimpse of explosions or gunfire from the rest of the fleet, his fingers began to slip just as the huge carrier leveled out and slowed its movements to a standstill, through the breach Neil could see the icy eighth planet and the huge Ravager vessel outlined against it. ~~~ ","Summary":" Counter attack A/N: My Dad and I were watching Battle LA a few months ago, and a few days ago I cam"},{"Movie":"Prom Night","Title":"Reunion","Author":"Harley-Jensen","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5817122","Passage":"[Chapter 1] 1. Plans It had been a year since the incident that happened to Donna Keppel passed, Richard Fenton had been killed and everything seemed to be back to normal. All except Donna wasn't the same as she had been once before; reoccurring nightmares happened most every night. She'd wake up drenched in cold sweat and screaming at the top of her lungs but luckily the pills worked again completely stopping the night terrors. Her aunt and uncle had thought her ready enough to go to college alone and live in a dorm. She still had her meets with her psychiatrist but all seemed to be going perfect for her, it was three weeks before finals and Donna was cramming in her room. Her roommate Jessica watched her cram and became bored and tired just looking at her, she got up from the chair she was sitting on and declared she was completely and utterly bored. Donna glanced up at her not surprised at her reaction. \"Come on Donna, I'm soooo bored let's go out\" Donna kept to her work scribbling notes down quickly and looking from her textbook to her notebook paper. She sighed tiredly. \"Jess you know I can't go out, we've got finals in three weeks and I'm definitely not going to waste my study time partying\" Jessica pouted and cleared her throat trying to get her attention, grudgingly it did. Donnas pencil dropped on the table she was working on and looked at her roommate in the eye. \"This'll be the last time I ever bother you when you're studying\" Jessica held up her pinky finger, \"pinky promise\". Donna sighed heavily and shook her head knowing she was defeated; she stood up slowly getting readjusted to standing up straight from sitting on her knees. She walked over to Jessica and linked pinky fingers. Jessica smiled gleefully and hugged her roommate. \"Change, we're not going anywhere with you looking like that\" Donna glanced down at herself thinking she looked absolutely fine to go out, she wore stretch pants and an oversized t-shirt, at second thought maybe she was right. Donna walked passed her roommate to her closet and opened the doors. The sudden movement caught Donna off guard causing her to have a memory of that horrible night. The memory flashed in her mind then disappeared, she sighed relived that it past as quickly as it had. Memories like ones she just had were a reoccurring thing that had never come to pass, she spoke of them to her psychiatrist but didn't speak of them anymore afraid that she might be going mad and be taken away from the one thing that was making her feel normal again. Jessica broke Donna out of her reverie frightening her; Jessica watched as Donna caught her breath and apologized sleepily. \"I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you\" \"It's okay, it's not your fault\" Jessica knew little of the incident that happened to Donna but the most she knew she learned from the news like everyone else at college. It was a surprise she hadn't gone mad, Jessica sometimes would think maybe Donna was in another world but would eventually come out of it. Jessica felt empathy for her sometimes but knew better than to show it, Donna was her friend and she wanted her to know she could trust her with anything. \"You don't get out much do you?\" Jessica moved from hanger to hanger trying to find the perfect outfit for the outing she had in mind for the two of them. To be honest Donna had changed from her prom night; she rarely went out changing from the social butterfly that she was in high school to a sort of loner in college. Who could blame her though? She had gone through seeing her boyfriend lying dead in her bed; her two best friends murdered and being stalked and almost killed and kidnapped by her ninth grade science teacher. For how she was holding up now was a win for her so far. \"Ah here we go\" Jessica held up a black sparkling/ruffle dress grinning down at the thing. Donna's eyes averted to the dress remembering the day her aunt had bought it for her, it was actually quite nice to Donna's surprise. \"Okay now shoes, we need shoes\", Jessica pushed the dress into Donna's chest and bent down looking at the few pair of shoes she had. After a moment she stood and walked over to her own closet and rummaged inside. Donna watched with curiosity then put the dress down onto her bed. \"Found them!\" Jessica turned around meeting the gaze of her roommate and deliberately showed the suede heels in her face. Donna's eyes searched the high-heels mesmerized at the sparkling dazzle-ness. \"You're wearing both of these tonight\" Donna took her eyes away from the shoes and stared at Jessica. She handed the shoes over to her and went over to Donna's bed handing her the dress as well. \"Now go change\" Jessica nudged Donna from behind to the door. Donna opened the door and turned to ask her roommate what she had in mind. \"Oh you'll see\" she grinned and winked at her. Feelings were tugging at the back of Donna's mind that maybe it was a better idea to stay in and study but as her eyes went back to looking at the shoes and dress those thoughts were droned away. It was time she had fun again just as she was about to shut the door a picture caught her eye, a photo of her friends and herself prom night right before the massacre began. They all appeared happy and carefree almost as if that night had never touched them. Memories instantly flooded her mind causing her eyes to become watery, before the tears could fall she wiped them away with her arm and shut the door vowing to start living for her friends for now on. She blinked a few times and walked across the hall towards the girl's bathroom planning on to just for one day to forget about her prom night. A/N: What'd ya think? Okay well this is my first time writing a story on fanfiction so go easy on me. If you would be so kindly and press that button on the bottom of the page that would be greatly appreciated. Don't worry it'll get better and more interesting since this chapter didn't give you much to press on but stay tuned!!.....[Chapter 2] 2. Forgetful Donna Keppel looked at her reflection in the mirror. A satisfied sigh left her lips. She had been dreading looking in the mirror when she slipped herself into the dress. It hugged her body snuggly but she had been insecure ever since she arrived to college. Now staring at herself in the mirror it was like a new change, a refreshing change. The door opened abruptly, a red head came bursting in. It was Jessica. \"You were taking too long so I wanted to come check up on you to make sure you weren't going to back out of this-\" Jessica stopped talking when she caught sight of Donna in her dress. A grin broke onto her face. Donnas face relaxed when she saw the reaction was good. \"You look hot!\" Donna smirked at her friend. She looked back at her reflection checking out the dress on her one more time. \"Now all you need is make-up\" Donna blinked at her reflection. \"Make-up?\" \"Yes. Make-up \" Jessica stood beside Donna making one of her \" duh \" faces. \"I say this with love Donna but…to hide those circles under your eyes you need make-up. Not to mention you've been looking pale for a while now\" Donna understood where she was coming from and she knew Jess heard her some nights tossing and turning and at worst crying. \"I haven't worn make-up in… a while \" Donna looked at Jessica in the mirror. \"Well now your gonna start wearing make-up again\" Jessica said with a soft smile and understanding eyes. Donna looked back at her reflection. \"Besides you know I live off of make-up. You're speaking to an expert here and on the plus side it won't hurt to put make-up on again.\" \"Okay. Just-\" \"And I'll be doing your make-up\" Donna opened her mouth to say something but was shut up with Jessica's hand in the air. \"No. You just said you haven't put make-up in a while so I'll save you the process and do it for you\" Jessica smiled. Donna looked at her skeptically for a few seconds then rolled her eyes smiling. \"I guess\" Jessica grabbed Donnas arm dragging her to the door. Before she opened the door she turned to look at Donna. Her face serious. \"Now I'm going to tell you now before we go to the room, expect a big fat \"I told you so\" after I'm done fixing you up\" Donna frowned. \"Okay, now that I've said it let's go\" And with that they walked to their dorm room. Just before Donna followed Jess into the room she caught something in the corner of her eye. Her head whipped quickly to the right hoping what she was thinking in her head wasn't real. He was dead dammit. No one was there. Just an empty hallway. She shook her head for thinking such things and chuckled as she entered the room. She shut the door slowly laughing inwardly at herself for thinking that horrible man Richard Fenton was there hiding in the shadows. He's dead Donna she thought to herself. You were there when he died; he's rotting in hell where he should be . \"Right, right\" she whispered to herself looking at the floor. \"Did you say something?\" Jessica looked over her shoulder where she stood in front of her vanity stand. \"Huh? Oh no. Nothing\" Donna shook her head smiling. Jessica's stare lingered longer than was necessary but she just shrugged going back to find the specific make-up she wanted Donna to wear. Donna curiously walked over to her closet stepping inside. Jessica looked over her shoulder at her one more time this time her eyes narrowed. \"Let me see your feet\" \"What?\" Donna peeked behind the door looking at her; a confused look on her face. \"You want to look at my feet ?\" Jessica held her stare nodding. Donna broke out laughing. Her laughter ceasing as she saw Jessica was serious. She smirked at her raising an eyebrow. She stepped out of the closet body facing Jessica. \"Are you alright?\" Jessica's eyes looked down at Donna's feet. \"Ha just as I thought. You didn't put on the heels I gave you\" Donna opened her mouth then shut it glancing down at her feet. \"Oh yeah. I forgot. I mean I was going to put them on but I wanted to make sure the dress didn't make me look weird then you came busting in and it just slipped my mind\" Jessica looked unconvinced. \"Hey I was going to put them on. Stop looking at me like that\" Jessica shook her head smiling; the real Donna she knew that was hiding behind all the college school work, oversized t-shirts and sweats was coming out. This was the Donna she heard about before that creep of a teacher tried nabbing at, the girl smiling and laughing happily in that picture of her prom night. The girl she had the pleasure of meeting every once in a while and the first time at their freshman orientation. \"I'll go get them, and don't even touch the make-up I have out\" Donna raised her hands up in surrender. \"Yes ma'am\" she said mockingly. Jessica scrunched up her face as she walked past her shutting the door leaving Donna to wait patiently in the room. Donna looked down at herself. She pulled the dress down, sure it was gorgeous but it was kind of short. Not to mention revealing in the cleavage department. Fiddling with her dress she hardly noticed the note that was laying on her pillow with her name written elegantly on it. A/N: I'm guessing your all thinking \"FINALLY!\" Hahahaha I am sincerely and utterly sorry for the long, delayed wait you had to go through. I know this wasn't much but now that I've been reading alot more than usual I will continue all my stories and finish them. I thank you all for the reviews and there will be more I pinky promise. Now hit that button![Chapter 3] 3. Pink The door swung widely open. \"Okay now you better put these on and don't forget \" Jessica walked over to where Donna stood mindlessly fiddling with her gorgeous dress and handed the shoes over to her. She raised an apprehensive eyebrow at Donna. \"Promise\", said Donna smiling. \"Good. Now where was…\" Jessica's voice drifted off as she walked over to the vanity stand eyeing all the make-up products laid out. She bit her lip thinking hard then turned around to see her friend checking out the heels she wore. Her eyes searched the room trying to retrace something then pausing at a white note sitting on her roommate's pillow. She grinned spotting the elegantly written name. \"Looks like someone has an admirer \" Donna looked up at Jess scrunching her eyebrows together; following her gaze she spotted the note that had her name written on it. Her heart practically stopped. \"Donna. It's just a note\" Jess said nonchalantly, \"Here I'll read it for you\" She walked over to Donnas' bed but before she could grab at the note Donna blocked her. The trance she was in broke. She smiled nervously at Jess seeing her surprised face at her reaction. \"No. It's okay I'll…read it later\" Jessica eyed her skeptically before smirking, a glint in her eye as she spoke. \"Oh I see\" Donna laughed dryly knowing Jess thought she knew what it was. \"Yeah hahahaha\" \"Well if you were talking to someone you could have told me\" Jessica raised her hands adding emphasis, \"You know I'm here for you Donna. Besides we're like practically bestfriends now or whatever, we can't keep secrets from each other. It's like girl code \" Donna sighed glad Jess assumed something else; she watched the back of her head as she walked over to the vanity stand again. Donna inwardly wished she could tell her everything but letting someone know everything that happened would open up wounds she had been trying to heal from. She didn't want Jessica to have the burden of knowing all the horrible things she'd gone through. \"Sorry, I was gonna tell you but you seemed so busy going out and stuff\" \" Yeah …I understand\" Donna brushed back her hair; fighting with the intense feeling she had to read the note or throw it away. She looked over her shoulder at the note, her heart quickening up in anticipation. \"Okay. I have everything you need. Are we ready to begin your transformation?\" Donna smiled happily at her roommate Jessica. She nodded her head. \"Yes\" \"Awesome\" Sitting in Jess's vanity seat did little to keep her mind distracted from the note that seemed to scream her name out. Of course Jessica told her the rumored gossip around campus and the cute guys she had been talking to lately but Donnas mind would always end up thinking what the note had. The elegantly writing wasn't Fenton's she had checked that off her list when she had first glanced at the note. He had written those overly obsessed letters to her a few years back but she knew his hand writing well, it was still fresh in her mind. \"Okay…just a little bit of blush and…there. Done\" Donna opened her eyes blinking several times looking up at Jessica. The huge grin she held told her that she was pleased which in turn meant she looked good? \"Look at yourself\" She swerved her around to face the mirror. Donna gasped as she caught her reflection; vivid blue eyes stared gloriously at her. She looked…different. \"I look-\" \"Absolutely gorgeous!\" Jessica's head popped up beside Donna a smile gracing her pink lips. Donna stared curiously at the woman in the mirror. Her eyes were the first thing to catch her attention, the smoky eye shadow bringing out her eyes. This person didn't appear sleep deprived or pale, she looked alive, renewed. This was the new Donna she wanted so desperately to find in college, this Donna was going to live for her friends and first true love she lost. \"Dang. I'm good\" Jessica blew on her fingernails leaning against the stand. Donna glanced at Jessica grinning. \"You Jessica are stupendous\" \"I think it's time for me to tell you… I told you so \" Jessica smiled winking at Donna. Donna rolled her eyes grinning at the figure in the mirror. \"Now about that hair\" Donnas smile faltered, \"What about my hair?\" \"You didn't straighten it after your shower this morning; you didn't do anything with it!\" Donna touched her blonde hair, \"So?\" \"So, it looks…it's not club worthy\" \"Club worthy?\", Donna scoffed, \"So then we're going to a club\" \"Well duh . You wouldn't go to a friend's party in that dress now would you?\" Donna looked down at her dress, \"On a special occasion, maybe\" \"Yeah right. That make-up and dress and heels totally tell people you're going to a club\" \"Or that I'm ' working ' tonight\" Jess rolled her eyes, \"Oh shut up. Now let me do your hair\" Donna smacked Jess's hands away from her, \"If I let you do it, you gotta tell me what you're going to do to it first\" \"Okay, okay. I'm just gonna curl it\" \"Don't curl it\" \"Why not?\" \"Because my hair takes forever to curl since it's so straight\" \"I can do wonders Donna\" \"No, I'll just leave it straight. The next time we go out again I'll let you curl it\" Jessica scolded, \"Well can I at least put some anti-frizz on it? Your hair is frizzing really bad\" \"No! Just leave it\" \" OK but don't be coming to me when people start looking at you crazy and you want something done to your hair\" \"Not gonna happen\" Donna said smiling evilly. Jessica shrugged ruffling Donnas hair just to be mean as she walked quickly away. Donna frowned at her raising her hands to brush out the tangles she caused. It would've been smarter to get a brush but she couldn't see one on the stand. \"I'm gonna go get changed-\" \"I thought you were going to wear that\" Jessica glanced down at herself a look of indifference on her face, \"I was but I changed my mind\" Donna shook her head rolling her eyes. \"Well I'm going to go get changed; I'll be right back\" \"Where you going?\", Donna peered at through the mirror. \" Going to get changed ?\" \"No I know that but aren't you going to get something out from your closet?\" Jessica laughed throwing her head back for a more dramatic look, \"You're funny Donna\" \"I-\", Donna shut her mouth. Not wanting to argue with her. \"Be right back\" The door closed slowly Jessica once again leaving Donna by herself. Donna finished the last of untangling her hair then sighed. She was all ready but now she had to wait for Jessica to get ready. God knows how long that'll take , she thought. She clicked her tongue out of boredom looking around the room. She glanced at herself in the mirror and smiled loving the way she looked. Then she remembered the note sitting on her pillow; she shot up skipping to her bed with eagerness. She locked the door so as there would not be any intrusion; either from Jessica or anyone else. She walked up slowly to the note picking it up. It was actually a tiny envelope. She looked around the room once more occasionally shooting her eyes at the only window in there. Her heart began pounding as she opened it and pulled out a folded piece of pink paper. How odd it's pink , she thought. Ignoring the curiosity as to why the paper was pink she unfolded it. Dearest Donna, I see you've gotten busy in college no doubt. Doesn't surprise me; you were always a smart girl in high school. No need to be frightened though I am a friend. It's so nice to see a genuinely pretty face around here. I really hope we can be the best of friends. You'll be pleasantly surprised to see me again. Give my best to Jessica for me please. Just a spoiler here, we're gonna have so much fun tonight! P.S. I'll be watching you Donna Keppel. A/N: I am sorry again for keeping the wait and the short length of this chapter. Unless you want chapters this short? Let me know, I would like to know y'alls preference. Thank you to all who reviewed quickly, you guys made me happy and hyper to begin writing the next chapters! :) I promise this story will get better and better...[Chapter 4] 4. Up or Down? Donna stood unmoving from her spot; heart pounding exceedingly. She read it over a few times unsure if this was a prank or actually true. She flipped it over scanning the paper, hoping to find something. To her demise it was blank. She jumped at the sound of the door handle being turned. The door handle turned but the door didn't open. The door handle began turning side to side; Jessica's muffled voice broke the silence in the room. \"Donna did you lock the door? Come on unlock it\" Donna immediately hid the letter behind her back in surprise, standing dumfounded looking all over the room. She walked over to the door unlocking it. Jessica busted in quick to ask her why she locked the door. \"Why'd you lock it? I was coming back\", she set her things down on her bed, \"Oh what'd the letter say? Anything corny?\" She grinned at Donna waiting her reply. Donna still had the letter behind her back thinking of a possible lie to tell her. If she told her she would not want to go out anymore and Donna couldn't have that, even if an anonymous letter told her they'd see her tonight. It was more than likely a prank. Right? \"Oh-uh yeah\", she scoffed and smiled, \"mostly just stupid stuff\" \"I knew it. What did it say though? Tell me everything since you don't wanna show me\" Donna slowly took the letter out glancing down at it; she cracked a smile acting as if she read over a funny line. \"It says 'You have natural beauty that shouldn't be hidden by products' blah blah stuff that like that\" Jessica nodded her head, \"Of course. You know I don't know why they always say that! I mean make-up was originally created to accentuate your features, like seriously it's so annoying like it's not hiding your natural beauty - but I will admit some girls do put on a lot of make-up which makes them look like clowns but that's not everyone…\" Jessica's voice drifted away from Donnas mind as she went through the letter again in her thoughts. It was nicely written so that left two things, one the person was probably a girl because of the handwriting or two it might be a guy but he must be a upperclassman. But why would an upperclassman write this letter to her? If it was a guy or a girl. It sure wasn't Richard Fenton he was dead and didn't write that neat, she knew first hand of how he wrote. \"Why'd you have it behind your back? Did you think I was gonna try to look at it again?\" Donna smiled. \"Well I wasn't. If you don't wanna show me it's cool\" \"Okay thanks for understanding\" Jessica nodded her head smiling. Her face changed from understanding to shocked, she sopke\"I bet it's from a girl! That's why it's pink\" \"No some guys like the color pink Jess\", Donna retorted \"Yeah but…I don't know I guess \" Jessica sighed,\"What do you think I should do with my hair? Leave it like this?\" Jessica pointed to her luscious curls, \"Or straighten it or put it up?\" Donna opened her mouth but was cut off by Jessica, \"Put it up right? Yeah I knew you'd pick the right thing\" Jessica walked over to her vanity stand beginning her process on her hair. \"I didn't even say anything\" \"I know but your eyes said everything\" Donna frowned but shrugged shaking her head going over to her bed. She grabbed the small envelope and put the letter back in sealing it away in her drawer next to her bed. Donna stared down at the drawer for a second longer then opened the drawer taking out the letter and re-reading it again. This time she sat on her bed going over it several times before Jessica spoke. \"Have you seen my brush? I don't see it\" \"Nope\" Jessica scanned her stand moving a few things to the side. She opened her drawers then finally found it. She brushed her hair then began picking it up trying different styles at first. \"Do you have any idea who the letters from?\" \"Huh? Oh no idea. I was thinking upperclassman but I'm not sure\" \"Oh an upperclassmen . What if it is? Aw if it is you better tell me Donna\" \"Uh-huh\" \"I bet it's someone in your class or someone that passes by you every day. Did the letter say anything like 'I'm in your class or I see you every day' or something?\" \"No just lovey dovey crap\" Jessica now had her hair up; she put pins in fixing the rest that was not to her satisfaction yet. She looked at Donnas reflection wondering why she was looking down, holding something. She must be fixing her shoes or something, she thought. Well the heels are pretty big. \"All done. What do you think?\" Donna looked up glancing over her shoulder at Jessica, \"It looks great like always\" Jessica smiled winking her eye then turning back to the mirror glossing up her lips. Donna looked back at the letter deciding if she should tell her best friend. She had a right as a close friend of hers but she didn't want to ruin their girl's night out. \"Well I'm ready, you?\" Donna slipped the letter back into the envelope setting it beside her, \"Have been since you finished putting my make-up on\" Jessica stood up walking over to her shoe collection and slipping her heels on. Donna finally realized she was wearing a very provocative dark blue dress that was like a second skin on her. It was gorgeous though. \"Where'd you get that from?\" Donna wiggled her eyebrows smirking. Jessica glanced down at herself, \"Oh from a friend she bought for me as a present from the favor I did for her\" \"Must've been a huge favor\" \"You have no idea \", Jessica's eyebrows shot up as she grabbed her handbag. Donna quickly grabbed her own handbag quickly slipping in her phone and wallet. Jessica sprayed small puffs of perfume on herself. \"Want some?\" \"Sure\" Donna took the perfume and sprayed a small amount on herself giving it back to Jessica. The smell was completely intoxicating but very light. It was the perfect perfume. \"All good?\" \"Yup\" Jessica grabbed her car keys looking the room over then walked over to the door, they were ready to go out. Donna followed behind glancing at the letter before she shut the door and locked it. She wouldn't forget what the letter said but it would be in the back of her mind in case anything happened tonight. If anything happened. A/N: I am really sorry for the hold up. No yelling please! It's just I've been very busy especially with school work and I've become an old person. Really, because now I go to bed early and when I don't I add stuff to a story I'm personally doing. It's not very easy trying to milk out ideas for four stories at once. Too much confusion. You understand if you tend to write different stories at one time such as myself. Plus I've more essays to do for my english college class and spanish projects to do but no worries ideas are always throwing themselves at me. Once again I apoligize for the long awaited wait, you do NOT deserve what I put you through but hopefully I will add more stuff. Thank you for taking the time to read this chapter :) it's greatly appreciated just like a good 'ol review! ","Summary":" 1.

Any form of war story that hits this close to truth will be touchy so I wanted to get some reactions before I post more. Not sure what this one chapter will give me, but reviews would be nice before I start posting the rest. If people think this is a bad idea I will tear it down and never speak of it again. If not, then I will continue. So please R/R.

Tess watched as he threw the rag over a toolbox and walked off with the doctor. She didn't move as she tried to keep her anger in check. \"You know he's just lookin' for something to mess with.\" Her commanding officer said squeezing her shoulder. \"He's just a little jumpy. He's not right.\" She just stood with arms crossed glaring a hole into Eldridge's retreating back. \"Or he doesn't trust me.\" She said turning to the older man. \"Don't start on that again Tess.\" She brushed past him to climb under the humvee. \"On what, sir?\" It was barely a question when she said it. \"You know what.\" He responded getting down on his knees so he could see her. She was silent as she picked up the wrench Eldridge had been using; making sure that everything he had been messing with was tightened down. \"Just let it go.\" \"Just let it go?\" She exclaimed climbing out from under the Humvee. \"He's a sexist asshole!\" \"I know, just let. It. Go.\" He responded enunciating the words for emphasis. \"You are one of the finest mechanics we have here, alright?\" She just nodded and picked up the rag off the toolbox. \"Thanks Grange.\" Just then a Humvee pulled into the base's garage and a few men got out. Two of them carried duffle bags. Duffle bags meant new guys. She watched as a commanding officer greeted them and herded them out of the garage. \"One of those sorry sons-a-bitches is replacing Thompson.\" Grange said once they were out of the garage. Tess didn't respond, just climbed back under the humvee. A few hours later Tess got to know one of the new recruits much better, seeing as she needed to show him around. \"What's your name?\" She asked the young boy now following her through the garage. \"Callahan, Sir.\" She rolled her eyes, which luckily he couldn't see. \"Your first name?\" She asked turning around. \"Trace, Sir.\" He seemed a little nervous, and a little uneasy about calling her 'Sir'. \"Alright Trace, you can call me Tess. Everyone else does. Or Taylor, which is my last name. And drop the 'Sir' crap it bugs me just as much as it bugs you.\" He smiled a little and they walked on through the garage. She showed him where everything was supposed to be… and where everything usually ended up, which was not the same place. He seemed to relax after a while. At dinner she sort of met the other newbie. 'Sort of\" because he was generally introduced to the whole table. His stare stayed on her a little longer when they introduced her, but she was used to it. Being one of three women on the base, and the only one working a mechanic's job made her stick out like a sore thumb. At this point in her career it didn't throw her anymore though, unless she ran into an ass like Eldridge. \"So we got a couple of new guys today.\" Regina, her bunkmate, knew everything that went on in the base somehow. \"Yeah, how'd you know?\" Tess asked. Regina flipped on her cot to face her. \"I had to examine them, make sure they were all in order, you know, medical stuff.\" \"Right.\" Tess got into her cot and flipped off the desk lamp between them. And that concluded day 50 of her 365-day tour in Baghdad. Reaction time! (feel free to tell me to tear it down, but a why would be nice along with it.) Thanks for the R/Rs I really appreciate it, especially on this one. :)[Chapter 2] AN: Here's a little more to chew on for consideration. The first chap. was a little OC centric... About two weeks later Tess was working under one of the humvees just doing a routine check before the guys were to take it out the next day. When she heard someone walking towards the vehicle she didn't think much of it. Then it caught her attention when the driver's door opened. She looked over to see someone standing there. What the hell is this guy doing? Then she watched as he got into the vehicle. Shit! She quickly scrambled out from under the humvee and hit the wrench on the front grill. The man in the vee looked up at her slightly surprised. \"What the hell do you think you're doing!\" She yelled at him, still in front of the vee. She watched as he held up a pair of gloves. \"I left my gloves.\" He said and after a moment, when Tess didn't respond, he got out of the cab. She was staring at him with an anger that could cook eggs. \"You need a little help understanding garage protocol.\" She said once he shut the driver's side door. \"I do?\" He said almost smirking. She wanted to slap him. \"Yes, you do. When you have any business with a vehicle in a garage you make sure that no one is underneath it before you start messin around.\" \"Oh.\" He said after a pause. \"Yeah, oh.\" She responded and she turned to put some tools back in the toolbox. \"I've seen men run over by those vees. Seen their hands, arms, crushed because some one didn't check before rollin' them out.\" \"I didn't mean to scare you I just needed my gloves.\" Tess sighed. \"No worries.\" She said, letting it go. \"I'm Tess, by the way.\" She said taking off her glove and sticking out her hand. \"Will James.\" He responded, shaking her hand. \"You're the new Bravo Company leader, right?\" \"Yep.\" Tess nodded and put her glove back on. \"You got anywhere to be just now?\" She asked him. \"No ma'am.\" \"Wanna help me with something?\" She asked, popping the hood of the humvee. \"Sure.\" \"Great. Get in the cab and fire her up.\" Will did and Tess leaned over the humvee, making sure everything looked and sounded all right. \"Is it in neutral?\" She yelled over the purr of the engine. \"Yeah!\" He yelled back after she heard the clink of the gearshift. \"Alright, give her some gas.\" The engine roared and then died back down. She moved to the other side of the vee and he pumped the gas again. \"Alright that's good! Shut her down!\" She yelled over the engine. It sputtered out and she dropped the hood. Will got out of the cab. \"Thanks.\" She said taking off her gloves and looking at her watch. \"No problem.\" \"James!\" Will and Tess looked over to the garage door to see Sanborn running towards them. \"We got a hot one at the UN building.\" \"Alright.\" James said. He turned to Tess as Sanborn got in the humvee. \"It was nice meeting you.\" \"You too.\" With that he got in the vehicle and they pulled out of the garage. Ten minutes later a humvee was towed into the garage with a broken axel. It was going to be a long day. Tess flopped down on her bunk and closed her eyes. The broken Axel fix had gone better than planned. Turned out Trace was a pretty good mech. even if he was young. She was still beat though. Twenty minutes later Regina came in and took a long drink from a water bottle. \"You are pissed off about something.\" Tess said sitting up. Usually her bunkmate was pretty chipper and would be smiling and saying hello when she came in the room. The bottle crinkled back into place when she was done drinking. \"It's that new guy, James.\" \"He seemed pretty nice to me…\" Tess said. \"Yeah, nice is fine, crazy is not.\" She said. She sat down on her bunk with a huff. \"What are you talking about?\" \"He just endangered the lives of his team. I don't like it when these macho soldiers think they can screw protocol. I'm the one who has to deal with the aftermath.\" \"Wait, wait, wait. What did he do exactly?\" \"They went to clear out the bombs at the UN building. Turns out they were in the trunk of a car. So he went in there to look at them. After he saw the bombs he decided he was going to take off the bomb suit and go at it without even a Kevlar on for Christ sakes.\" She paused and ran a hand through her hair. \"Then to make it worse he didn't leave it alone once the building was cleared so the engineers could take care of it and then he took his headset off. He wouldn't even communicate with the rest of his team.\" \"Well are they alright?\" Tess asked. \"Yeah they're fine. But that crazy idiot could have gotten them killed.\" \"Sounds like he's got problems.\" \"Yeah well he better clear them up quick. I don't want his problems landing his men with me.\" With that Regina grabbed her stuff and headed for the showers. Tess rolled back over on her bunk and passed out. Day 64 came to a close.[Chapter 3] AN: Hey there, so I know you guys are reading these, but no reviews yet? Is this a good or bad thing? Let me know! It was a slow day in the garage. All the humvees were up on their inspections and there were no recent breakdowns. There wasn't even an oil change to do. Tess took off her hat and wiped the sweat from her brow. It was ungodly hot out in Baghdad. She often wondered how the women wore those burkas in this environment. She would never make it in one of those. \"Tess!\" She looked up towards the stalls where the vendors sold to the soldiers. Will was waving her down as he stood next to the little kid who always sold DVDs. \"What's up?\" \"I bet Beckham five bucks that he couldn't keep me from putting this ball in that goal.\" He said pointing to the makeshift soccer field at the edge of the base. \"He said that if I got another guy it would be fair.\" \"Yeah, I said another guy, she is not a guy.\" \"What, afraid I might score?\" Tess asked the kid. \"Alright fine, your five bucks, man.\" Beckham said as he threw the ball at Will. On the centerline they turned their backs to the boy. \"What's our strategy?\" Tess asked him. \"You play soccer?\" He asked. \"Today, man! Come on!\" Beckham yelled at them. \"A little in high school. You?\" \"Never. You're shooting but we'll go back and forth so he won't see it comin'\" \"Alright.\" They turned and Beckham was ready at the goal. \"Not getting any younger!\" Beckham yelled. Tess smiled as Will started down the field. Tess followed and they kicked the ball back and forth. Beckham, watching them intently, crouched ready for the shot. When they got close Tess kicked the ball as hard as she could towards the goal. Beckham dove for it and missed. Tess threw her hands up in the air in victory. \"The sun was in my eyes!\" Beckham exclaimed as he ran after the ball. \"That cost you a dollar buddy!\" Will yelled after him. \"Four more tries.\" Beckham kicked the ball back to them. They went 4 more rounds and Beckham blocked 3 out of 5. \"Not bad, kid.\" Will said giving him three bucks. \"If the sun wasn't…\" \"Yeah, yeah, the sun, sure.\" Will said turning him back towards the stall. \"Get back to work. Break's over.\" Beckham ran back to the stall and started heckling again. \"Why are you so nice to the kid?\" Tess asked as they walked back to the main building of the base. \"He didn't ask to be born here, just tryin to help him. That's all.\" \"You have a kid of your own don't you?\" She said, guessing on a hunch. \"Yeah.\" Tess knew she should keep her mouth shut but she couldn't help asking the next question. \"Then why do you put yourself in harms way so much, throwing protocol out the window?\" \"I—\" He was cut off by Grange jogging up to her. \"We're going out.\" He said. \"What's going on?\" \"One of the vees got hit. Freak bullet made it under the hood somehow and mucked up some stuff. Command says it's too hot to try and tow out.\" \"So they want us to do a patch up job.\" Grange nodded. \"Go get your gear.\" He said and jogged back to the garage. Tess started for her bunk. \"You ever been out in the field?\" Will asked as he walked with her. \"No.\" She said. She was a little nervous, but then again she had always felt guilty about the other guys on the base going out and her always being so protected. \"But this'll be good, get some combat experience in, ya know?\" \"Just keep your head down.\" He warned her. \"This coming from you?\" She said over her shoulder because he had stopped walking. He just shrugged. She grabbed her gear out of her bunk and put on her Kevlar vest and gloves. Carrying her gun and helmet she jogged back to the garage where Grange was loading up a Jeep with tools and parts they might need. She strapped on a tool belt and hopped into the Jeep. On the way there Grange went over a few things with her. \"The guys that are already there will be covering us. You got your Kevlar on?\" Tess nodded. \"We need to go in there, find out what's going on, fix it, and get out. You need to focus on the humvee and only the humvee. Don't worry about the rooftops or any bystanders, leave that to the guys alright?\" Tess nodded again. \"We just get in and get out.\" She was quiet. \"You nervous?\" \"Little bit.\" She said squinting one eye and holding up her thumb and index finger showing Grange the 'little bit' of fear. Grange just chuckled and drove on down the road. They passed a few other outfits as they came back from their posts throughout the city. Turning down a side street the humvee came into view. They pulled up behind it and got out of the Jeep. \"Sgt. Daniels.\" One of the men introduced himself as they came over to the humvee. \"Sorry to pull you off base, I know you guys are pretty comfy there.\" \"Nah, we're giddy with excitement.\" Grange said sarcastically. They popped the hood quickly and started looking for the problem. \"The block looks fine.\" Tess said trying to keep her mind on the work and not look at the numerous civilians on the rooftops. They really did make her nervous just standing there watching her. \"I'll go try and start her up, see if you can see anything.\" Grange said walking to the side of the humvee. Her heart rate quickened when he left, she felt a lot more exposed to her surroundings. She heard Grange put his foot on the break and then she heard the starter, but the engine didn't turn. He tried again. The fuel wasn't making it to the engine somehow. She started to look for the line and found it once Grange reappeared. \"I think it's the fuel line.\" Grange said. \"Already on top of it.\" she said reaching into the vee and locating the line. She brought her hand back and it was covered in gasoline. \"It feels like it's just got a hole in it, maybe we can just patch it long enough to get it out of hostile territory and we can replace the line later.\" \"I'll go get some duct tape.\" Grange said. He left again and she again felt exposed. She reached in to re-find the leak when a shot rang out. Before she realized it she was on the ground gasping for air. More shots were fired and she started coughing. Another soldier was at her side. \"Where are you hit?\" He asked over the gunfire. Tess put her hand to her side and she could feel a rip in the covering of her Kevlar but it had stopped the bullet. \"We've gotta get outta here now!\" Another soldier yelled. Grange was already back and trying to get to the leaking hose. It was a tight squeeze. Tess slowly got to her feet and grabbed the tape from Grange. \"Taylor, get back in the Jeep. You're injured.\" He said looking at her arm, which was bleeding. She must have caught it on something in the vee when she fell. \"I got it, Sir.\" She said, knowing it would go quicker if she did it. Her arms were smaller and she could maneuver more easily in the awkward space. \"Here. Put this piece of hose over the hole and then tape over it.\" He handed her the small section of hose that he had cut off from a spare. A few more shots were fired. She did the job and gave the thumbs up to the humvee driver. He tuned the key and they heard the starter, but the engine wouldn't turn. He tried again with the same results. \"Give her a little gas!\" Grange yelled and the engine roared to life. \"Let's move!\" Sgt. Daniels yelled and Tess started hobbling back towards the Jeep. Suddenly someone was at her side and helping her. \"I'm the medic, I'm coming with you!\" He yelled as more shots were fired. Tess just nodded and opened the back door of the Jeep sliding to the other side as the medic got in next to her. Grange fired up the engine and followed the Humvee out of hostile territory and back towards the camp. \"Let's see what's going on.\" The medic said looking at her arm. \"My side.\" Tess grimaced and started un-velcroing the Kevlar vest. The medic helped her out of it with only one painful yelp from Tess and then pulled up her shirt to inspect the damage. \"Deep bruising, probably a fractured rib. No serious brakes though. That Kevlar saved your life.\" Tess was relieved to hear that it wasn't as bad as it felt. She picked up the Kevlar vest and gave it a kiss earning a chuckle from the medic, who was back to looking at her arm. Some alcohol and a couple of butterfly bandages later she was feeling a bit better. When they got back to base Grange stopped the Jeep outside the med. center. Tess slowly got out of the car with the medic. \"Hey, Taylor!\" Grange yelled out of the window. \"Nice work!\" Tess threw him a quick salute and hobbled into the building. The medic guided her over to a bed and told her to lie down. \"Oh my god!\" It was Regina, Tess could tell without even looking. \"Girl, what did you do?\" Her bunkmate asked, hovering over her. \"Ah, I got called out. Shot in the side. I'm thanking God for my Kevlar as we speak.\" Tess said pointing to her injured side. Regina took a look at it. \"Boy that is one nasty looking bruise.\" She said. \"Tell me if this hurts.\" Regina said and then she gently pushed on Tess's side. \"AH! Yes, Reg, that defiantly hurts.\" Regina moved a little farther up her side and pushed again. \"OW! Damnit, what do you have to go poking at it for?\" Tess yelled. \"Oh, stop being such a baby.\" Regina said. \"Come on, we're gonna need an x-ray.\" \"Oh, joy!\" Tess said sarcastically as she slowly got up off the bed. They took the x-ray and it showed a fracture in her 9th rib. They put some tape over the area to restrict movement and gave her a sling so her arm wouldn't move too much and upset the fracture. Luckily it wasn't to bad a break. \"Now go back and sleep, don't do anything for the rest of the day. Doctors orders.\" Regina said handing her a bottle of pain relievers. \"Yes, Sir.\" She said and headed out the door. Halfway to the bunks she realized that she still had her tool belt on so she turned on her heel and headed for the garage. When she got to the garage she walked past Grange who was unloading the Jeep. \"I get the rest of the day off Grange.\" She said, plunking the tool belt on the worktable. \"I know, go sleep.\" He said. \"How bad is it?\" \"Just a fracture. I should be able to do some stuff tomorrow if I take enough of these babies.\" She said shaking the pill bottle. \"Whoa. What happened to you?\" Trace said coming out from under the humvee that she had done the patch job on. The one that had gotten her shot at. \"Took a slug to the side doing that stupid patch job.\" She said pointing to the humvee. \"Got a fractured rib.\" \"Badass.\" Trace said with a big smile on his face. He was such a kid. \"Yeah, just get back to work greenie.\" She said and left the garage. Back in the bunkroom she shut the blinds on the windows and took off the sling. Sitting down on her bunk she tried to unlace her boots, but there was no way she was bending over that far. She popped a couple of pills and settled into her bed, boots and all. It was 3 in the afternoon and she was out like a light. She didn't get up until 11 the next day.[Chapter 4] AN: I'm getting some reviews from one lovely reader! (you know who you are... I hope... and THANK YOU!) So I will post this chapter, but the next few will take some time and planning so there might be a bit of a break. anywho... on with the tale. \"Ah! The wounded gazelle limps across the Serengeti!\" A few whistles and hoots broke out as she entered the Garage the next morning. She waved them off with the arm not trussed up in the sling. \"Thanks so much for that announcement Grange.\" He just smiled at her. \"How you feelin'?\" \"Eh, not as good as yesterday. It's all stiff now, ya know?\" \"Yeah well, you're not doin anything heavy today. You're playin nurse.\" \"How's that?\" \"I say wrench you hand me a wrench.\" \"Awe, come on! Don't you have anything more interesting to do?\" \"Nope, not unless you want to clean up the garage?\" He was getting way to much enjoyment from this. \"No. Okay I'll help you out.\" For the next three hours she was going back and forth between toolboxes, humvees, and the spare parts storage getting everyone what they needed to do their jobs. She stopped at 2 o'clock and popped another pill. \"Hey, go easy on those things.\" Grange said as she swallowed it down. \"Why don't you take a break?\" \"I'm fine Grange, I don't need a break.\" \"Don't care if you need one or not, go take one.\" \"You don't need to baby me, it's just a broken rib.\" \"Tess.\" He looked at her seriously. \"I am not babying you. If any one of the other guys in this garage were in the same situation I would tell them the same thing.\" \"Alright.\" She said only half convinced. \"I want you back here in a half hour!\" Grange yelled after her as she left the garage. She adjusted the sling strap around her neck and looked up at the sky. Not a cloud in sight. It was just constantly sunshine around here and she was starting to hate it. When she got to the stalls Beckham kicked the ball towards her. She stopped it with her foot and kicked it back without much zeal. \"What happened to your arm?\" He asked her. \"It's not my arm it's my rib.\" She said pointing to her side. \"I got shot yesterday.\" She was getting a little tired of answering the question. \"Hey man! You hear that! She got shot!\" He called over her shoulder. She turned around to see Will. \"Didn't I tell you to keep your head down?\" He said staring at the sling. \"My head was down, hell it was under the hood of a Humvee, James.\" \"How come you're not dead?\" Beckham asked. \"I had Kevlar on. It stopped the bullet.\" \"What did it feel like?\" He pried on. \"What did it feel like? It hurt, that's what it felt like.\" She snapped. She hadn't meant to be so short with him. He was a kid, he was going to ask questions. She was tense because she realized what a life and death situation she had been in. Had that gunman aimed any higher, she might not be standing here right now. \"Beckham, I want another DVD.\" Will said cutting in. \"And this one better not be shaky, alright?\" They walked off and Tess went and leaned against the wall. She felt a little shaky herself and blamed it on the pills. A foot higher and they'd be shipping my body to my mother. She kept thinking that thought over and over. \"You alright?\" Will asked, breaking her thoughts. He had a DVD in his hand. \"Yeah. I'm fine. Just a little light headed, you know. From the pills.\" She said taking them out of her pocket and giving them a little shake. \"Uh-huh.\" Will said unconvinced. \"Have you ever been shot?\" She asked him. \"No, not yet.\" She looked away. \"Got a good dose of shrapnel from a frag though.\" She looked back at him. \"Put me out for a month.\" \"Did you…\" She paused, struggling with her thoughts. \"Did you ever think about where they would send your body… had you died?\" Will nodded. \"Yup. Shouldn't think about it though. You're alive, that's all that matters.\" \"Right, doesn't matter that a foot higher and they'd be shipping my body to my mother.\" \"You know what I mean.\" He said. \"What did you buy?\" She said looking at the DVD, trying to change the subject. She didn't want to think about it any more. \"Kung Pow, Enter the Fist.\" He said turning the box around. Tess started laughing uncontrollably. She and her brother loved that movie. \"That funny, huh?\" She grabbed her side as it was engulfed by a wave of pain. She still laughed though. \"We'll probably watch it in the main building tonight. You should come. After being shot at anyone needs a good laugh.\" \"Okay.\" She said after composing herself. \"That sounds good. I'm gonna get some chow, I'll see ya later.\" She walked away still laughing slightly. That night she gathered Regina and they went down to the main building where most of the guys had already gathered. She sat down next to Trace. \"How's the… What did Grange call you? A gazelle?\" Trace asked poking her sling. \"Yeah a gazelle.\" Tess chuckled. \"I'm alright.\" She said. They fired up the movie and everyone whooped as the screen lit up, excited that they had some form of entertainment. Once the movie started Will sat next to her. \"Remind me to thank Beckham.\" The movie started and the laughter followed. The absurdity of the film made them forget that they were at war for a little, and that was enough for them. When the film was over everyone started filing out of the main building. \"Look at this kid.\" She said pointing to trace who had fell asleep. She smacked his forehead and he almost fell out of the chair. \"Come on greenie, show's over.\" \"What?\" He said looking around sleepily. \"I missed it!\" He exclaimed. \"Eh, you'll see it again sometime.\" She said as he got up and followed the other guys out the door. Will stood in front of her and held out his hand. She took it and got up slowly. \"God I feel like an old woman!\" She said. \"Eh, it won't last long.\" They left the building and walked towards the bunks. Tess stopped at the building behind it. \"Calling home?\" Will asked her. \"My brother, after watching that it feels wrong not to.\" she said leaning against the door. \"Now I know where the phone is.\" Will said peering into the room. \"You haven't called your wife since you've been here?\" Usually the guys leapt at the chance to call their loved ones as much as they could. \"I'm… not married.\" He said holding up his hand. No ring. \"Oh.\" Tess paused. She had assumed that since he had a son he was married. \"I need to stop assuming things. You know what hey say about when you assume…\" Will chuckled. \"No, I used to be married. It's a long story.\" Tess just nodded. \"I'll see ya.\" He said and turned towards the bunks. She watched him go. He was an unsolvable mystery to her sometimes. She let it go and went in the room. Signing her name on the list hanging on the wall she picked up the phone. As she dialed the number for her brother's house she walked outside and leaned against the metal wall of the building. The cold sensation on her back was a welcome feeling in the warm, dry night. \"Hello?\" \"Hey Harvey. It's Tess.\" She waited for the message to bounce off the satellite and back down to her brother in North Carolina. After a few seconds his response came through. \"Tessa! How's Baghdad these days?\" \"Swell. Just as welcoming as usual. How's Kate?\" \"She's doing fine, 5 months into the pregnancy and looking healthy.\" Tess smiled. \"I'm glad to hear it! And how's the terrible twos treating you?\" \"Terrible! Brad screamed all day yesterday because mommy wasn't home. Sometimes I wonder if he'll ever grow out of it. He misses you, you know…\" \"I know.\" She said quietly, she thought maybe her brother couldn't have heard it until. \"Tess, are you alright?\" \"No.\" She admitted. She had to tell someone back home what happened, just not her mother. \"Harv I got shot the other day. I had a Kevlar on so I'm alright.\" She paused. \"It just scared me, made me think, ya know?\" \"You got shot?\" He asked dazed. \"Don't tell mom. I'll tell her when I get back just don't tell her now. Next thing you know she'll be buying a ticket over here to drag me home.\" Tess said with a little laugh. \"I won't tell her.\" Her brother responded. \"Were you hurt?\" He asked. \"Fractured rib, but otherwise I'm fine.\" \"I wish you were done and back home, I worry about you.\" \"I'll be home before you know it. Hey,\" She tried changing the subject. \"Watched Kung Pow today.\" Her brother laughed. \"What do you get when you cross an owl and a bungee cord?\" \"My ass.\" She said completing the line from the movie. She missed her brother terribly, but talking to him made her feel a lot closer to home. After another ten minutes she had to let him go, her time was limited on the long distance phone. He told her to be careful more than three times before she hung up. Sighing she made her way back to the bunk and climbed into bed, this time able to get her shoes off if she held her breath.[Chapter 5] AN: Here it gets a little touchy... so let me know what you think... I'm trying to get better at this stuff... A few weeks later there was a scramble on base. Bravo Company had gone out to do some test explosives and they weren't back. It was getting close to sundown, they were supposed to be back hours ago and they were radio silent. Regina was ordered to stay in the med. Building in case there were any injuries when they returned. Tess decided to stick with her just to see what had happened to the guys. She couldn't explain it but she felt nervous for them. Most of the time when a company was late she didn't feel like this, but then again Bravo Company was the company she was closest to, being assigned to their humvee and all. Then again she knew it was more than that. She was scared that she might not see them again. Sure, Eldridge was an ass, but she new he was having a hard time here. Sanborn was a nice enough guy and Will… Okay, she had to admit she had a soft spot for him. She wasn't in love with him or anything, but he seemed to be a genuine person. She gave up thinking about it before she dug too deep into her emotions. She liked to keep those sealed away as deep down inside her as possible. An hour after sundown Bravo Company came through the front gate. Tess ran over to the garage after the humvee pulled in. She watched as the guys got out followed by 2 others. They looked beat and were covered in dirt and sweat. She passed Will on her way in. \"You guys alright?\" \"Been better, but were okay.\" He said, his voice hoarse. She let him go and went to check on the humvee. Trace was already there. \"Hey greenie. What's it look like?\" \"They said there shouldn't be much wrong except for some clean up on the inside. Guy took a shot to the neck on the 50. Medical already unloaded the bodies.\" Tess paused. \"Well, we better jump on cleanup then.\" She got out some supplies and a hose. Trace didn't move. \"What's the matter Callahan?\" \"I've never had to clean out a humvee before.\" He said. \"I'm not that good with blood. That's why I'm a mechanic.\" \"Alright.\" She said taking off her sling. \"Don't worry about it Trace. I'll pull out the equipment and stuff in the back, and you can wipe it down, not as much blood there usually.\" She opened the back humvee door. There was good amount of blood on the center consol and down onto the floor. She had never had much of a problem with small amounts of blood, but puddles of it threw her sometimes. She stepped back for a minute before trying to unload some of the equipment. \"You okay?\" Trace asked her. She had her hand up to her mouth and was swallowing over and over trying to force the gag reflex back. She nodded. After a few seconds she was unloading equipment, placing it on the floor of the garage. \"Here.\" She said, handing Trace a rag. \"Use this and the cleaning solution in this bottle. Wipe everything down.\" He nodded and took the rag starting on the crowbar. She turned back to the vee. She could smell the blood and she wasn't even up close. When she was pulling out the equipment she had held her breath but there was no way she could hold it long enough to hose down the vee. She took a piece of gum out of her pocket. \"You want some?\" She asked waving the packet at Trace. \"Sometimes the mint knocks out some of the blood smell.\" She said tossing him the pack. Hosing down the humvee was an annoying job. You had to be careful not to get the water everywhere, but you still had to hose out all the blood. Getting it off the middle console was easy, and the doors too. But when it came to the seats you had to do some scrubbing. While she was in the middle of getting some spatter of the back of the front seat another mechanic came in and helped her with the back seat. The body had fallen so that half of the blood pooled on the seat and spilled over onto the floor. After a couple hours of scrubbing and hosing there was nothing to do but let the vehicle air out. Trace didn't look any worse for the ware and Tess found that cleaning out the vee was easier than last time… but there was no way it was ever going to be easy. She wondered how Regina handled the amount of blood she did. Tess made a mental note to thank her for her services when she saw her later. Spitting out her gum she grabbed her hat and left the garage, ready for some much needed sleep. \"Hell no.\" She heard a voice as she was walking past some bunks. She looked up to see will standing in the door of Sanborn's bunk. As he came down the stairs he noticed Tess. \"Late night?\" He asked her. \"Yeah, I was cleaning the blood out of your vee.\" \"Oh.\" \"Who got shot?\" \"I don't know the guy. Some British dude named Chris. We were helping them out when we were sniped.\" They started walking towards their bunks. She noticed that his speech was a little slurred and he was walking pretty slowly. \"What were a bunch of British guys doing out in the middle of the desert?\" \"Bounty hunters.\" He answered. \"Ah, I see.\" They walked a few more paces and he stumbled a little. Tess grabbed his arm so he wouldn't fall over. \"Have you been drinking soldier?\" \"Maybe a little.\" He answered looking down at her, his eyes slightly glazed. She let go of his arm but he grabbed hers and pulled her to him. Swiftly he stooped down and kissed her. It was a few seconds before she pushed him away and he stumbled a little more. \"What the hell, James?\" He just smiled like a little kid and laughed. She blamed it on the alcohol and brushed it off. \"Come on, let's get you back to your bunk before you hurt yourself.\" She said pushing him towards his bunk. \"Or before I hurt you.\" She added. When they got there her turned to her. \"Sure you don't want to come in?\" The smirk on his face was huge. \"No I'm fine without that thanks.\" \"Okay, but you're missing out.\" \"Go to sleep James.\" \"Yes Ma'am!\" He said saluting. She saluted back before heading to her bunk. Her thoughts turned to the soldier. Why had he done that? Sure he was drunk but was he just messing around or did he slip up. She felt a little guilty because she knew he still lived with his wife and that their relationship was a mess. She had found that out through base gossip and Regina. He wasn't married though. She sighed and rolled her eyes. \"Forget it.\" She said out loud to herself but she couldn't ignore the twist in her stomach that she felt when he kissed her. Silently she slipped into the bunkroom, Regina was already asleep. She quietly changed and got into bed, vowing to forget about everything that happened that night because Will probably wouldn't even remember in the morning. Day 80 of her tour was over. AN: See? Touchy... let me know what you think with a review please and thanks. :)[Chapter 6] AN: Okay, so, this bit is a little longer, but it's probably due to the character development... so bear w/ me and hopefully you'll like it. :) A few weeks went by and she hadn't seen much of Will. It may have been because she was avoiding him, or because he was avoiding her, or because the amount of work in the garage exploded. Either way she hadn't seen him since the drunken incident and she was glad because she didn't know exactly how she would handle it if he ever brought it up. As she came into the mess hall there was a troubled energy in the air. She sat down next to Trace and Grange with her tray and they barely said anything. \"What's with the gloom and doom?\" She asked, fearing that they had lost a company or something. Trace didn't look at her. \"Bravo Company found something.\" Grange said. \"Well that's descriptive.\" She retorted eating some pasta. \"They found a body bomb.\" He said in anger. Tess put down her fork slowly. \"A little kid, couldn't be more than 13.\" \"Assholes.\" She growled pushing her tray away. \"James seemed really torn up when he got back. They said he was the one that found it and dug the bomb out of the kid.\" \"He took the bomb out?\" She asked. \"Why didn't he just blow the place?\" \"I don't know. Nobody really wanted to talk about it and I'm sure no one really wanted to ask James. He was livid.\" Tess pulled her tray towards her and tried to eat again but found that the food made her stomach turn. She stood up with the tray without a word to the others and left the mess hall. She needed to work off the anger she had built inside of her. Storming into the garage she found a humvee than needed some work. Most of the mechanics were at the mess hall so she fired up the radio and climbed under the vehicle. She felt safe there. She could shut herself off from the rest of the world and think about other things. No body bombs, no war, just her and the humvee. She spent most of the night under there. When she was walking back from the garage, it had to be at least 4 in the morning. As she walked up the steps to her bunk she heard Regina rushing around inside. \"Where's the fire?\" Regina looked at her bunkmate as she cautiously stepped though the door. \"Someone out of Bravo Company's been shot.\" Tess's breath hitched. \"Who?\" Tess's heart nearly clawed out of her chest at the thought of will being dead. \"Don't know yet.\" Regina said as she headed out the door. 'They're on their way back now.\" \"I'm coming with you.\" \"You worried about Will?\" Regina asked. Tess tried not to look shocked. \"Why would you think—\" \"You guys are pretty close, I've seen you and him with that little Beckham kid.\" \"Oh.\" Tess automatically thought that Regina had seen or heard about the drunken incident. Tess thanked Jesus that that hadn't gotten out. \"Yeah, I guess we kind of are.\" \"Don't understand why.\" Regina went on. \"The man is crazy and sooner or later he's gonna get himself or someone else killed.\" \"I'm sure he has his reasons for doing what he does.\" \"Are you defending him?\" Regina said turning to her. \"Not really, just speculating.\" Tess retorted, but she couldn't help but think that maybe she was. \"Better watch it with a guy like him, girl. You're liable to get yourself hurt.\" Tess just rolled her eyes. \"I'm not marrying the man Regina. Cool off.\" Regina put her hands up and didn't speak any more on the subject. Minutes later the Humvees came back through the gate. One of them pulled up to the med center and they opened the back to reveal a very irate and bloody Eldridge. Tess stuck around and helped carry the stretcher into the med center, but soon she and Sanborn were ushered away so they could start operating on his injured leg. \"What happened?\" Sanborn sighed and shook his head. \"He got shot.\" \"No, really?\" She replied sarcastically. Sanborn turned an angry gaze on her. \"If you really want to know what happened ask James.\" The amount of venom in his words was almost painful. Something definitely went wrong tonight. \"Where is he?\" She asked. \"Last I saw he was hiking it to the showers.\" Sanborn said before he sat down outside of the med building. A powerful bellow of pain came from inside the building. Tess decided to go looking for Will. As she approached the showers she steeled herself. She knew James was a time bomb, that the smallest thing might trigger him, especially after a high-tension situation like the one he just came out of. She stepped inside the bathroom and could hear water running. As she made her way down the row of showers she heard a thud and a bewildered yell. \"James?\" She questioned. There was no response. Farther down she figured out which shower he was in. \"James?\" She asked again, not looking in yet, just in case. \"Are you alright?\" \"That you Tess?\" He asked. He sounded calm but haunted. It made her shiver. \"Yeah, it's me.\" He didn't respond. \"You okay?\" \"See for yourself.\" She hesitantly peeked around the curtain to see Will sitting on the floor of the shower with all but his helmet still on. The water around him was dark with blood. \"Jesus, what happened to you?\" She said moving farther into the stall. \"It's not my blood.\" She then remembered the amount of blood seeping through the bandage on Eldridge's leg. \"Eldridge?\" Will just nodded. He hadn't looked at her. He just stared at the corner of the shower slumped and defeated. She didn't like seeing him like this, didn't want to. \"Come on, get up soldier.\" She said picking his helmet up off the floor and placing it on the seat outside the shower. She turned to Will who was gazing at her in vague confusion. She grabbed the top of his vest and gave it a yank. Reluctantly he stood and she inspected him. \"Let's get this gear off, huh?\" She undid the Velcro and straps on the Kevlar and helped him take it off. When she turned back to him he was looking at his hands. The gloves were still on and they were covered in blood. \"It's my fault.\" He said. \"All of it.\" His voice was stronger now but it was low and dark. It scared Tess a little. \"Damnit!\" He slammed the side of his fist into the side of the shower and Tess jumped. Breathing heavily, Will stood for a minute bracing himself between the shower walls. Slowly Tess reached out and took his hand. She undid the Velcro on the back of the glove and pulled it off. When she did she looked at his hand, inspected it. There were scars and fresh cuts and dirt under his nails that looked like it would never leave. They were hands that knew work. Tess wrung out the water and blood from the glove. Will did the same with the other and handed it to her. \"Is your bunk unlocked?\" She asked. He just nodded. She gathered up his gear. \"Rinse off.\" She said before leaving. When she got to his bunk she hung the gear over the chair to dry and placed it by the open window. Why am I doing this? She asked herself. Did she really care for him that much? She sighed. Yeah… yeah I do. She knew she was getting into a mess and she hated that, but at the same time she didn't care. Soon she heard his heavy footfalls on the steps outside the door. When he came in he held his jacket and shirt in his hand. Scars. Tess froze and stared at his chest for a while. \"Frag grenade.\" She stated. Will just stood there, like stone; cold, unmovable and strong. \"You change, I'll wait outside…\" She paused, \"unless you want me to leave.\" He just shook his head no. Minutes later he was in dry clothes and she was back inside. He sat on his bed and she on the table in silence. \"Bad day?\" She asked finally. He chuckled but it was empty and tired. \"Yeah. Bad day.\" He put his elbows on his knees and rubbed his hand over his face. \"War makes days bad.\" She said quietly. \"And so do half-assed plans.\" He responded. \"They make days really bad.\" \"What, you planned for Eldridge to get shot?\" \"No, I didn't plan for anyone to get shot.\" He stood up and paced a little. \"You didn't plan any of this, James.\" \"Yes I did. It's my fault.\" He turned to her. The anger boiling in him gave his voice life again. \"If it wasn't for me Eldgride would be fine right now… not lying on a gurney bleeding out!\" He stood in anger and started pacing the room. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" \"We went to check a suicide bombing not terrorist hunt, didn't we?\" His anger was rising. \"I just had to find them. Now Eldgrige has a fucking bullet in his leg.\" \"Will, calm down.\" He continued pacing. \"Will, please?\" \"Shut up!\" He turned on Tess and she froze. He didn't swing at her or reach for her, but he scared her more than ever. \"I'll go. I don't think I'm helping.\" She made for the door but Will took her hand and stopped her. It was gentle. If she kept walking she would have pulled right out of his hand. She turned towards him and he looked calmer. She wasn't used to him swinging back and forth like this. \"I'm sorry.\" He looked at her, held her gaze for the first time that night as if he hadn't noticed she was there before. \"Don't go.\" Shit. She thought. Whatever was going on between her and Will was becoming something more than friendship… and she didn't know what to do about it. She didn't love him, that wasn't it; of course it could eventually lead there if she didn't get off the path she was on. It was more of a need. She needed him to be alright and not fall apart because if he did she felt like she would probably lose it too. She was becoming dependent, and it scared her a bit. But she wasn't about to leave him alone. He still had her hand and he gently pulled her back to him. She put her cheek to his chest as his arms folded around her and a strong feeling of safety washed over her. \"Eldridge is gonna be fine.\" She said quietly. \"He may have a bum leg but he still has his life.\" Will's arms tightened around her. \"That's not the only thing that's wrong, is it?\" He pulled away from her and turned towards the wall. He ran a hand over his mouth. \"Beckham's dead.\" \"What?\" She almost screamed. How could he be dead? \"The body bomb…\" he stated. She paused. No, it couldn't have been him. Beckham came in a half hour after James had been called out to that site. \"It wasn't him.\" \"It was.\" \"No, Will…\" \"You weren't there! You didn't see him!\" She stood her ground this time. \"No! He was here! He came on the base a half hour after you left. It couldn't have been him.\" She watched as he took in the news. \"He did?\" She shook her head vigorously. He smiled for a spilt second, but then it was gone. \"Still.\" They were both silent again thinking about the poor kid who went through that brutality. Will sat down again on the bed slumped and tired. Tess walked around behind him and kneeled on the bed. She never knew how to give a massage, nor had she ever really tried, but he mother used to rub her shoulders sometimes and it always made her feel better. \"I think you did the right thing.\" She said starting to rub Will's shoulders. He sat up straighter and rolled his shoulders. \"How's that?\" \"Taking the bomb out instead of blowing the place.\" He stiffened a little from the memory. \"You've got a heart in there, even if people don't think you do.\" He was silent as she rubbed his shoulders and down his back a little then back up. He grabbed her hand and pulled it around in front of him. She leaned on his back and looked over his shoulder as he examined her hand. \"Not very pretty, are they?\" She asked him. She looked at the scar that ran from the space between her finger and thumb and an inch over the back of her hand. The nails were chipped and there was grease under them that would never come out. She was going to have arthritis before she was fifty, she could tell by looking at the knuckles. \"I like 'em.\" He responded. She snorted. \"Working hands are good.\" He said. She smiled. \"I couldn't agree more.\" They sat there for a while, her leaning on his back with their heads together. \"I should go. You need to sleep.\" She stood and walked around the bed. \"Thank you.\" He said quietly. \"Don't thank me.\" She said, turning around at the door. \"I don't need it.\" She smiled at him. \"Good night, Will.\" \"Night Tess.\" She left out into the cool night air. As she walked back to her bunk she couldn't help but smile to herself. She felt happy, well, happy as circumstances would permit. She felt different, kind of like she was floating. \"Uhg, God, you're like a little school girl. Shake it off!\" She said to herself. She knew she was smiling like an idiot. \"I'm tired, that's why.\" She retired to her bunk and slept like a baby. AN: Soooo reviews anyone? kthanks :)[Chapter 7] \"It'll be good for him.\" He said in the garage. \"But he's so new, you sure it's a good idea? I mean look what happened last time.\" Tess said. \"Just because you got shot, doesn't mean I will Tess.\" Trace said. He was already suited up and ready to go. \"Besides you went last time, it's my turn. I'd hate to see you get shot twice.\" \"Hate to see you get shot at all.\" She responded. \"We have to go.\" Grange intoned. \"Alright, fine.\" Tess caved. \"Take care of the old man.\" She said slapping Trace on the shoulder. Grange laughed. \"Watch it Taylor.\" Tess watched them as they got in the jeep heading out to help with a tow out. They followed the truck in the Jeep as it bounced out of the garage. She heaved a sigh and got back to work. After an hour her stomach told her it was dinnertime and she headed over to the mess hall. \"Hey Reg.\" \"Hey yourself.\" She responded. They chatted as they ate about nothing in particular. Halfway through their meal they were interrupted. \"Reg!\" Another medic came running towards them. \"Reg, there was an IED. We've got wounded coming in.\" Tess's heart tightened. \"Oh God no.\" She followed Regina and the medic back to the med building just as a humvee came into the base. She stood out of the way knowing that they had the situation under control. She prayed that it wasn't Trace or Grange. It didn't work. \"Let's go!\" A medic screamed as he started pulling a stretcher out of the back of the vee. Tess looked on in horror as Grange went by, his jacket covered in blood. Tess started shaking. The next stretcher was pulled out and Tess put her hand to her mouth as Trace went by. How could this have happened? Of all the people why them? She tried to go into the med building but a medic pushed her back telling her that the situation was to critical. She would have to wait. So she did. She sat outside the med center and watched the sun setting over the base wall. Will walked by and noticed her. She didn't even see him till he was right in front of her. \"You alright?\" \"I don't know.\" \"What's going on?\" He sat down next to her right as Regina came out. Tess stood up, but didn't say anything. She didn't know if she wanted to hear the news. \"Trace is going to be fine. His arm is all messed up, but he'll be discharged and sent home.\" She said drinking some water. Will was silent. \"What about Grange?\" \"He's…\" Tess didn't want to hear this. \"He's not too good. Took a lot of shrapnel to his torso.\" Tess sank back down on the wall. \"We're doing everything we can but…\" She was silent for a while. \"I'll let you know when you can see them.\" With that Regina went back inside. Will took Tess's hand. Neither of them said anything or looked at each other or moved off the wall. They just watched the sun. Half an hour went by and Tess laid her head on Will's shoulder and shut her eyes. She didn't know if she was praying or just hoping, but her mind kept working on different words to try to explain what she wanted. Grange was like a second father to her and she knew she shouldn't have let Trace go. He was only twenty years old and now… An hour later Regina emerged again. Tess stood immediately. \"How is he?\" Tess was filled entirely with hope, trying to block out the despair that she knew could very well come. She watched Regina's face. It was tired and blank. Her eyes slid from Tess to Will almost as if to tell him something first before she spoke. \"Tess honey…\" Regina Paused looking for words. \"No.\" Tess felt the hope disappear all at once. \"Nu-uh.\" \"Tess I'm so sorry. We couldn't save him.\" Tess put her hands on her head and her eyes pricked with tears. She started pacing back and forth. \"Not him. He had family. He had KIDS!\" She yelled. \"I know.\" \"Tess.\" Will reached for her, but she hit his arm away. \"Fuck it!\" She screamed. He shouldn't have died. She should have gone, not Grange. He had family that needed him. Everything about this was wrong and worst of all she couldn't fix it. Will reached for her again and this time she didn't fight him off she just stopped. He put his arms around her and she rested her forehead on his shoulder. For a minute she stayed like this. \"You can go in and see Trace whenever you want.\" She heard Regina's voice next to her and felt her stroke her arm. Tess sniffed and turned her head. \"I'm sorry Regina.\" She hadn't meant to have a melt down like that. \"You're not the first dear.\" Regina said. She looked up at Will and nodded at him before going back in the building. \"God.\" She whispered quietly before stepping back from Will. He brushed some hair from her face and wiped a tear away with his thumb. She just stared at his chest, lost in thought. \"Hey.\" She slowly looked up to him. \"You should see to the greenie.\" She just stared at him, still in minor shock. \"Tess.\" She blinked. \"Go talk to the kid. He needs it.\" \"Right.\" She said quietly. \"Thanks, Will.\" Absently she turned around and shook her head. Trace was attached to more wires than there were in the humvees. When she reached him his eyes were closed and one of them was badly swollen. There were cuts and bruises all over his skin and his right arm was wrapped in a thick layer of gauze. When she finally looked back up to his face his eyes were open. \"Hey greenie.\" She said quietly. The thought suddenly struck her that he might not know about Grange yet. \"Don't worry.\" He said hoarsely, \"I know he's gone.\" He must have read her face. \"That explosion came out of no-where.\" He croaked. \"Before I knew it I was down and Grange…\" He trailed off. \"I'm sorry I couldn't help him more Tess, really…\" He swallowed hard. \"Hey, hey.\" She said quietly, trying to calm him down. \"He wasn't your responsibility, hon, don't start thinking like that.\" She sat in the chair next to his bed and gently took his left hand. \"I'm glad you made it.\" \"Wish it was me instead of him.\" He whispered back. \"Shh. Don't say that.\" She quieted him even though she had been thinking the same thing about herself five minutes ago. \"This is how it goes, we can't change it.\" \"Fate.\" He said shutting his eyes. \"Something like that.\" \"Fuck fate.\" He said, anger rising in his voice. \"Fuck it.\" \"Look on the bright side,\" She started trying to pull him back out of the anger that was eating him. \"You get to go home.\" \"Yeah, lucky me.\" He said bitterly. Two days later she was standing under the whirring blades of a chopper as they strapped Trace into his seat. \"Give my regards to the U.S!\" She yelled over the roar of the blades. And the door between them was slid shut. She ran out from under the chopper and watched as it rose gracefully into the sky. As she watched it go she felt sick. Grange and Trace had been like family to her. Now one was dead and the other was going home. None of the other men in the garage we as close to her as Trace and Grange had been and now two new men would be joining the ranks. She felt hollow. She turned around and saw Will standing next to the garage. At least he was still here. And then a thought crossed her mind. She walked over to him as quickly as she could and before he could say anything she grabbed him by the shirt and looked him dead in the eyes. \"No more risks.\" She said in a low and almost threatening tone. \"No more hot shot risks, alright bomb squad?\" She had no idea what had gotten into her; she never reacted like this to anything. \"Because I swear if you are the next person to go I will fall apart and never forgive you.\" After that she let go of his shirt with a slight push to his chest and stormed into the garage. The hollow inside of her was replaced with a burning feeling that forced pressure up into her throat. Before she knew it she was standing in front of Grange's toolbox. She would have to go through it and sort out his personal stuff from the things the army owned... she was the only one in the garage who knew him well enough. She flipped open the lid and was ambushed by a picture of his wife and two daughters taped to the lid. The heat in her chest rose and the pressure increased. She didn't know if she wanted to cry or vomit. She peeled the picture from the lid and stared at it. The oldest girl was probably in high school. The youngest was maybe in middle school. His wife had a smile almost as wide as the state of Texas, she was laughing at something. Had he taken this picture? Had he made them laugh right before he pushed the shutter? She could imagine their faces when they got the news now that she knew what they looked like. She could see the horror, the tears. \"Tess.\" Someone said quietly from behind her. She blinked and realized that at some point she had sat down on the floor. She looked up to see Will standing above her with concern painted all over his face. She just looked back down at the picture. The fire in her chest was gone, replaced by a dull ache. \"When I get back…\" Her voice cracked. \"I'm going to go and see them. I'm going to apologize and I'm going to tell them what a great man he was.\" Will nodded even though she wasn't looking at him. \"C'mon Tess.\" He held out his hand. \"Get up soldier.\" She took his hand and got to her feet. \"I gotta go through his box.\" She stated. \"I'll help you.\" Will said taking the top tray out and setting it next to the box on the table. They went through each thing in the box, luckily nothing they came across was as personal as that picture. \"Do you have to go through his bunk too?\" Will asked as they closed the box with all Grange's personals removed. \"No, his bunkmate will.\" She sighed and ran her hand over the box. \"C'mon. You gotta stop thinking about this for a while.\" \"What?\" \"We are going to get our drink on.\" She snorted a little. \"'Get our drink on'?\" She mocked him. \"Yup. You, me, and Sanborn.\" He started walking out of the garage and she followed. \"Sanborn?\" \"He was deployed with Grange. Knew him well enough.\" She followed him into his bunk where she sat down on the table at the end of his bed. He took out a bottle of whiskey and took a swig, passing it to her as he swallowed. \"Whiskey…\" \"What, you don't like whiskey?\" \"More of a vodka girl myself.\" \"Straight?\" He asked as she took a swig. \"Sometimes… You know they make that shit in whip cream flavor?\" she asked him and he chuckled. \"Whip cream? You are such a girl!\" She passed the bottle back. \"Shut up James.\" There was a knock on the door and before James could even get up to answer it Sanborn invited himself in. \"Taylor.\" He said with his arms open. She suspected he was already a little drunk, mostly because of the bottle in his hand. She stood up and gave him a quick hug. \"Did you know him well?\" She asked him as she sat back down on the bed next to Will so Sanborn could have the table. She took the whiskey out of Will's hand and took another swig. \"He was my mentor a little while before we were deployed together.\" He took a drink from his bottle. \"Met his girls when we shipped out… and his wife… that is one good woman.\" He chuckled a little and then paused. \"She'll stay strong for those girls. She'll have to play both parents now.\" Tess stole the bottle back from Will who had lifted it from her while Sanborn was talking. They talked and drank and talked and drank and before she knew it they were all very drunk and apparently very loud because Regina busted into the bunk to find them attempting to play some form of basketball with a tennis ball and a plastic cup. At first she looked very annoyed but then she marched over to Sanborn, slamming the door shut behind her and snatched the bottle out of his hand. \"The last couple of days have been long, and we lost a good man.\" She looked around at them and held it up. \"To Grange.\" She clinked bottles with Will and they both took a drink before she gave it back to Sanborn who took a lengthy swig and Tess stole the bottle from Will for the hundredth time that night and took a sip before plopping down on the bed. As she did her foot hit something under the bed and she leaned forward slowly to pull it out from its hiding place. \"What's this?\" She asked slowly the alcohol weighing on her speech. Will sat down next to her as Sanborn and Regina continued with the makeshift basketball game. \"Stuff that almost killed me.\" \"Lovely thing to keep hanging around.\" He snorted. She sifted through it; wires, switches, transceivers, circuit boards, pieces of cell phones, timers. \"You know what all this stuff does?\" She asked a little stunned. \"Every bit.\" She poked through it and eventually got to the bottom where she saw a ball bearing chain. Pulling it out she found a ring threaded on it. \"What does this bit do?\" The alcohol blowing away any form of privacy that might have crossed her mind. \"Confuses the hell outta me.\" He responded, flicking the ring on the chain. \"Do you love her?\" Will stared at the ring as it swung back and forth. \"I think I did once, but now…\" He took a drink from the bottle. \"I don't think I really know how to.\" He didn't say it for sympathy. He stated it more like he was making a discovery. \"Just her or…\" Tess paused and Will looked over to her \"Or everything?\" \"Everything.\" He looked away and finished the whiskey. As Tess and Regina stumbled back to their bunk that night Tess kept replaying what he said over and over. She hoped that the amount of alcohol coursing through her system would wipe out the conversation while she slept, but she guessed it would still be there in the morning to mingle with the dark cloud that had been there since Grange was killed. Its not that she was hoping he would ever love her, because she didn't love him, but the statement itself, the idea of a person not being able to love anything and just muddling their way through life made her feel sick. \"Regina?\" \"Mmm-hmm?\" \"Tell me that you love something.\" \"I love my boyfriend back home.\" She paused and thought \"And I love my cats, and my parents. I love my brother and my niece…\" She paused before draping her arm around Tess \"And I love the heck outta you!\" She laughed and Tess pushed her off. \"You are drunk!\" \"As a skunk!\" Regina replied. \"Tomorrow is gonna hurt.\" They stumbled into their bunk and didn't even bother changing as they both collapsed on their cots ending day 105 of Tess's tour. AN: Getting towards the end here... maybe a couple more chaps. left? Thanks to all the people who are reading it! :)[Chapter 8] AN: Alright, another chap. Sorry this is taking me so long, but between work, class, and my mother retiring I'm a little bogged. For anyone who is still with me, thanks for sticking around. Also, for those of you who reviewed, I really appreciate it and just realized the other day that you can reply to those things (legasp). so i might start doing that... anywho. This chap. has more Will POV so I tried to stay in character... but we'll see. As always, let me know what you think. Also, I'm used to writing out an entire story and then just posting the whole thing, but I didn't do that for this one so updates will probably be slow... like this one was. terribly sorry... (Will James P.O.V.) They strapped… no… padlocked the bomb to this guy. What kind of sick psychos are they? Will looked at the time decreasing on the watch as Sanborn ran to get the bolt cutters. The man kept mumbling in Arabic, probably trying to plead with him, trying to make Will save his life. The radio crackled again. \"He says please, I have a family,\" The translator told him for the fourth time in the past five minutes. An image of his son flashed in his mind and he squeezed his eyes shut quickly. Will counted the padlocks and started running the numbers. Two minutes on the timer and Sanborn was still getting the bolt cutters. This was nowhere he wanted to be. So why was he here? He took the bomb out of the kid instead of blowing the place, and now he was trying to save this guy. One guy. \"What am I, a humanitarian?\" He mumbled to himself as he slowly made his way around the guy, trying to find a faster way to diffuse the bomb. Them man's words were coming faster and he could see him shaking. He placed a hand on the back of the guy's head. \"It's okay, you're alright, you're alright.\" Not that the guy could understand him. It sounded like he was praying now. Sanborn Showed up with the bolt cutters. \"Man, you weren't kidding.\" \"Nope.\" Will said through gritted teeth as he tried to cut one of the padlocks. \"What are these made out of?\" They were barely giving. \"That's case hardened steel.\" Sanborn said after he inspected one. No wonder the damn thing wouldn't budge. These bombers really had their shit planned out. \"We need a torch.\" \"We don't have one of those in the fucking truck, man. This guys a dead man! Just leave him!\" Sanborn was loosing it. \"No, wait, I can figure this out.\" Will said as he went through every possible trick of the trade he had and was still coming up dry. \"We don't have enough time Sanborn, We don't have enough time.\" He went back to trying to cut the bolts off. He hadn't felt this helpless in a long time. \"We've got a minute and a half, man, we have to go.\" \"Get out of here Sanborn.\" \"No, come on man, leave him!\" \"Sanborn, I've got the suit, just go!\" \"James!\" \"GO!\" He started cutting off another bolt and this one gave. \"Alright, that's one.\" He could hear Sanborn yelling for everyone to get back. This blast was gonna be huge. He looked back at the watch. 45 seconds. He had nothing left. \" I swear if you are the next person to go I will fall apart and never forgive you.\" He could hear Tess in his head like a ghost. Damn it! He kneeled down in front of the guy he was supposed to save and started apologizing. \"There's too many locks, do you understand, There's too many locks, I'm sorry.\" The words were flying from him and at this point it didn't even matter that they didn't speak the same language, the man understood what was going on. He took his hands from behind his head and started reaching for Will. \"You understand? I'm sorry! I'm Sorry!\" He turned and started running. Now there was nothing in his mind but getting out. No Tess, not his son, just him and the soon to be deadly explosion behind him. When he heard it detonate he turned in time to catch the explosion in his chest. It knocked him off his feet, the air out of his lungs, and his face straight into his helmet. The next thing he knew he was flat on his back staring up at… a kite? Who in the name of God was flying a kite? Was he home? No, still here in Afghanistan… and someone was flying a kite in what had to be less than half a click from a bomb that just went off. He had seen a lot of things here, but that was new. He layed there watching the kite for… he didn't know how long, before a medic showed up and started talking to him. He blinked a few times and looked from the kite to the medic. He knew he was talking because his mouth was moving but Will couldn't hear a damn thing the guy was saying. It all came through like he was underwater with his ears stuffed with cotton. He tried to shake his head, but the helmet wouldn't let him. Instinctivly he reached up to try and take it off. The thing that had just saved his life now felt like it was trying to suffocate him. The medic saw him reaching and helped him out of the helmet. Eventually they got him on his feet and out of the suit. His hearing was coming back and the medic had given him the OK. As he walked back to the truck he felt a little angry. Not that a man had just died, well maybe a little bit of that, but because he didn't figure out the puzzle. He couldn't figure out how to stop the bomb. He didn't like it when he lost to something he spent his life doing. He got in the truck and slammed the door shut hard. Sanborn was in five seconds later and they drove off back towards base. \"Can you tell me why I am the way I am J.T.?\" Sanborn just shook his head and stared out the windshield. Will turned the humvee down another sidestreet and a thought struck him. For a greenie this would be terrifying. Roadside bomb could be anywhere, snipers on the roof. A few kids started running next to the vehicle, pelting it with rocks and yelling things. To Will this was just another day, just another drive down just another street. He might as well be driving around at home, he was so used to it. He had gotten used to war. He took a hit from the Gatorade to try and clear the sand out of his mouth and throat and remembered how much it used to bug him on his first tour, how it got everywhere. But he was used to that too, not that he enjoyed it, but he was getting used to it… Not that he really enjoyed much of anything anymore, except for maybe the adrenaline rush of being on a job. I'm turning into a machine he thought, and felt nothing. When they got back to base Will got checked out at the med building and was left with nothing to do so he decided to go and bother Tess. The garage was in full operation and he had to look under a few vees before he found her. \"Hey!\" He yelled over the din. She shifted a bit and squinted at him from beneath the truck. \"What's up?\" she yelled back and returned to what she was working on. \"Bored!\" \"Mech. Crew only, James!\" She yelled back with a grin on her face. He just shrugged at her. \"I'll let you stay if you help me out!\" He nodded at her. \"Grab me that oil pan!\" He turned to where she was looking and retrieved it, sliding it under the truck to her. \"Thanks!\" She shifted over and placed the pan where she had been and reached up into the guts of the truck. Will watched as she strained at the cap trying to get it off. \"Want me to come under there?\" \"Don't pander to me, James!\" She gritted her teeth. \"Come on, baby!\" She put all the force she had behind it and the cap finally let go as Will watched the recoil in her arm. \"Good girl.\" She breathed. Unscrewing the cap she let the oil drain into the pan. She shuffled out from under the truck and Will threw her a rag. \"Thanks a lot.\" She said wiping her hands. Her shirt was disaster and her hair was a mess. She pushed some out of her face and consequentially got motor oil on her face. Will chuckled at her. \"What?\" She asked. \"Just trying to image you as a housewife.\" She squinted at him. \"Taylor!\" One of the guys yelled from across the garage. She threw the rag at Will and walked off. Will followed. \"You seem busy.\" He said when he caught up. \"I'm acting head of the garage until they replace Grange.\" She sighed. \"Which I hope will be soon. They stopped in front of a humvee where two privates were arguing. \"What's going on?\" \"She threw a serpentine belt.\" One private said. She eyed them. \"That's not really something to argue over.\" She looked under the hood to confirm the problem. Sure enough the serpentine belt was completely gone. \"So what's the problem?\" She said looking back to the men. \"Nothing Sir.\" The younger of the two said. The other rolled his eyes. \"You got a problem private Roff?\" She said reading off the name on his chest. He was at least two heads taller than she. \"Just don't like having to check in with some butch ass little—\" He didn't get to finish his sentence before Will hit him with a right hook to the jaw. After a moment of shock she turned to him. \"I would have handled that…\" She stated calmly. He just shrugged and she shook her head. Roff picked himself up off the floor and the other private tried to hide his smirk. \"Go get a serpentine belt from the hold, Pvt. Roff.\" She said. \"Yes Sir!\" He yelled before running off towards the back of the garage. \"Good work private.\" She said to the other before turning to survey the rest of the garage. No one looked particularly lost or frazzled. \"She'll take a while to drain.\" She said nodding to the truck she was changing the oil on. \"You hungry?\" Will shrugged. They sat down at the mess hall and Tess dug into her food like a caveman, oil still on her cheek. Will shook his head at her. \"We're going to have to train you to be a lady again before we put you back in society.\" \"Who said I was ever a lady?\" She replied with a smile. \"'Sides, I haven't eaten since six in the morning. I'm starving.\" She took another bite. \"Saw you guys were out today…\" \"Yeah.\" Will replied without much enthusiasm. \"Forced suicide bomb.\" \"Wouldn't that be a murder bomb?\" Tess replied after thinking about it. \"Guess so.\" He was quiet. She looked him over and noticed his nose was bruised. \"Didn't go so hot, did it?\" \"Couldn't get it off him. There had to be at least six padlocks.\" He took a drink. \"and he had four kids.\" Tess gritted her teeth and forced down the rest of the food in her mouth. Her stomach twisted. \"Why is it that I always have to hear about these things when I'm eating?\" \"Sorry.\" Will said sheepishly \"Didn't think about it.\" \"It's alright.\" She continued eating, but with much less zeal. \"You're going home in a few days aren't you?\" \"In a week.\" \"You don't look to excited.\" His gaze drifted from her face to the dog tags that hung from her neck. He reached across the table and wrapped his hand around them. \"I don't know if I can leave these here.\" He said. She watched his face and there was barely any trace of emotion there. \"I don't know if I can be a citizen again.\" He let go of her tags and she thought about what he said. He was right. They had all changed, seen things they could not unsee. Even as she sat there she could sense a dulling of her emotions. \"You're not the only one.\" AN: a couple more chapters, yes? we shall see...[Chapter 9] AN: Hey Y'all. Sorry this took me sooooo long. I usually write an entire story before I even start posting and I didn't with this one and I am learning my lesson. BUt, anywho, for those of you who waited around, here's another chap. not too many more left... maybe just one. Enjoy (I hope). One week later Tess and Will stood in front of the garage. Will had his bags packed and they sat at his feet. The truck to take him and a few other men to another base where they would be flown out and back to the U.S. was at the gate. \"How many days left?\" Will asked her. \"47.\" She said and reached into her pocket. \"Here, in case you ever want some company while you're trying to become a citizen again.\" She handed him a card. \"Once I get back, of course.\" He looked it over and found a phone number and e-mail address from the states as well as the number for the base. \"Just, ya know… If you ever want to come see the ocean, or something.\" She said awkwardly. \"Thanks Tess.\" He smiled but it wasn't a full smile and it only lasted a second. \"I'll come see the ocean. Meet your brother. All that, when you get back, ok? You keep your head down and don't do anything stupid.\" He felt like he was doing something wrong, leaving her here, but she was here without him before, and she wasn't his responsibility in any way. He still felt wrong. \"Hey, don't worry about me, alright? I'll see ya when I get home. It's a couple of months, no big deal.\" He nodded and looked over at the truck. \"Get gone, Will. Say hi to the states for me.\" He picked up his bags. \"Bye Tess.\" He gave her an awkward one-arm hug and then turned without another look and went towards the truck. He never liked goodbyes. Neither did she. He threw his bags in the back of the truck and was about to get in when he heard a dull thunk. It sounded like something heavy had been dropped from a long way off. But there shouldn't be any activity like that around here. \"Mortar! Four o'clock!\" Two seconds later the whistle of the mortar could be heard and Will ducked behind the truck as the explosion rocked the base. After the dust died down he looked out to find the round had struck the middle of the roadway right between the garage and the med building. The explosion was so loud that he lost his hearing for the second time that week. A thought hit him. Was Tess back in the garage? He took off from behind the truck to look for her, ignoring protocol that he had learned for situations like this one. As he ran his hearing started to come back. He could hear people yelling orders but no one confronted him. Some shots were being taken over the walls and so far he did not hear another mortar blast. He stopped at the blast site and looked towards the garage. The dust was still pretty heavy and he started making his way carefully forward. \"Tess!\" He called. No one answered. \"Tess!\" As the dust started to clear he could make out the door of the garage. A few men were stumbling out of it but Will ignored them, because he saw a body slumped against the wall of the garage. His chest tightened. \"Tess?\" He ran over to her and kneeled next to the body. It was her. She was slumped on her right side, bent at a right angle at the waist. Her left side was covered in spots of blood that were growing before his eyes. He put two fingers to her neck to check for a pulse. It was there, but erratic. \"Medic!\" He yelled over his shoulder, but everyone was running in every which way and he could see people already streaming into the med building. \"Shit.\" He turned back to her. \"Tess? Can you hear me?\" He tried to move her so he could pick her up, but he eyes sprung open and she immediately tried to move. \"Ahhh! Jesus!\" The pain that was coursing through her torso was nothing compared to when she was shot. \"Whoa. Hold on.\" Will said as she tried to sit up again. \"Will? What the, AH! Hell happened?\" She was dizzy from the pain. \"Aren't you supposed to be gone?\" She was confused and the back of her head hurt too, a dull dark pain to contrast the angry screaming pain in her torso. \"We got to get you to med.\" He said almost to himself. \"Tess. Tess!\" He had to yell to get her attention because she was drifting off. She looked at him slowly. \"I'm gonna pick you up, ok? This is gonna hurt but I want you to stay awake, alright? Do not clock out on me.\" \"Not goin anywhere James.\" She said quietly. He nodded. He moved her legs without much consequence but when he put his arm around her back she yelped in pain. \"Shit.\" He breathed. He was just going to have to do it quick. He put his arm under her leg and tightened his arm around her back. \"One, two, THREE!\" He stood up with her and she screamed. He immediately turned to the med building and walked as fast as he could while carrying her. \"Move, move!\" He yelled at the men standing around the med building door. They parted. As far as he could tell from looking at the guys Tess was doing a lot worse then a good portion of them. When he got in the med building he saw Regina holding up an IV bag as the doctor looked at a man who was bleeding pretty bad from the head. \"Regina!\" He yelled to her and her eyes snapped up. They widened when she realized it was Tess. \"Over there on that bed!\" She pointed. \"What's wrong?\" She called to him. \"Shrapnel!\" He replied and placed her on the bed. Seconds later a doctor was on her and a few nurses were nudging him out of the way. He tried to hang around, but another nurse got in front of him and ordered him out. He took a few steps back watching as they cut off Tess's shirt. When they started pulling the bits of shrapnel out he turned and walked out of the med building. He had to do something else or he was gonna bust back in there. Near the truck there was a small group forming and he jogged over to it just in time to catch the last of what the commanding officer was saying. \"We need men up on the perimeter wall at all times. Men who were going to ship out today stay within the base, we drive out when order is restored. Help with cleanup and damage reports and perimeter monitoring. Move!\" Will turned around and looked at the wall, the east side looked space so he jogged over and took position between two other guys. He shifted his gun, which had been slung around his back and flipped of the safety. Holding the scope to his eyes he surveyed the east horizon for any form of movement. The mortar had come from the North, the city was West. East and south were nothing but dessert. A minute or two later Sanborn found him. \"And here I thought I was gonna go home today.\" He said as he set up his gun. \"Tess got hit.\" Will said. \"What?\" \"Shrapnel caught her in the side. She's lucky she's not dead.\" \"That girls got some kind of luck.\" Will thought about the two times she had been hurt. The first time she was somewhere she usually wasn't and the other was because of a full out attack on a base where, at the time, she could have been anywhere: in the garage, in the mess hall, anywhere, but she had been right next to the blast. \"Or just the opposite.\" Will responded. Sanborn was about to respond when they were distracted by a couple of humvees making their way across the dessert towards where the mortar had come from. There hadn't been any more fired and no foot assault had been launched on the base. Will guessed it was a small insurgent group and that they were long gone by now. They had made a lucky shot. The humvees bumped along the road and Will watched them through the scope tracing ahead of them along the road. He stopped short when he saw a hump of something next to the road. Was it a man, or a bunch of garbage? \"Firing one shot, friendly!\" He yelled and then let a bullet fly towards the lump. He saw the dust rise next to it and the lump started to move. Shit. \"Stop the convoy!\" He yelled and turned to the man next to him. \"You have a radio?\" The man pulled it off his belt and handed it to Will. He pushed in the button and started yelling into it. \"Man on the side of the road approximately 2 clicks in front of convoy does anyone copy?\" He turned to Sanborn who was looking through his scope. \"I see him but with distance like that we might need a sniper.\" He squeezed off a few rounds. The man whose radio he had taken had jumped off the wall and started running towards the commanding officer. \"They're not stopping Will!\" Will switched the radio to all frequencies and repeated his message. \"Man on side of the road one and a half clicks in front of convoy. we need to stop the convoy. Over!\" There was a buzzing and then a man responded. \"Repeat, over!\" \"Stop the convoy. I repeat, stop the convoy there is a man—\" He was cut off by a load explosion. He snapped his head back to the road to see that one of the humvees had exploded and the other one had stopped behind it. He watched as sparks of light came out of the top of the second humvee and the lump on the side of the road started running. By the time the pops of the gun reached his ears the man was down. The radio crackled again. \"We have men down, I repeat, men down, send out a vee with medics. We also have an injured Hadji.\" Will cursed. \"Keep an eye on it.\" He said before tossing the radio to Sanborn and making his way to the med building. When he entered he immediately found Regina. \"One of the Humvees got hit.\" \"We know, were already prepping a team.\" She said. It was absolute chaos in the med building. \"Can I do anything to help?\" He asked. Regina looked around. \"Stay out of the way…\" She glanced over at Tess \"Keep an eye on her.\" Will moved over to her bed and listened to the heart monitor beeping. She was alive; he focused on that because at this point he felt like he was being pulled in more directions than he could handle. He was supposed to be gone, Tess was unconscious and injured, the base was attacked, he had been too late on calling in the IED. It felt like everything was going to Hell and he couldn't figure out whether he wanted to stay or leave. He was staring at the IV in her arm when he heard her voice. It was quiet and a touch hoarse, like someone waking up out of a long sleep. He could barely hear her over the commotion in the med building. \"James, why are you still here?\" He looked up to her face, her eyes barely open from the drugged sleep. \"Mommy told you it was time to get out of the sandbox.\" Her humor was still intact even if her body wasn't. \"Nothing holds you down does it?\" He smiled. She tried to smile back but it didn't work so well. Sanborne stepped up next to Will. \"Captain decided we're out in ten.\" He turned to Tess. \"Good luck, Taylor, we'll see you on the home side. Get better, a'right?\" \"Thanks Sanborne.\" She replied quietly and he left the med building after a quick goodbye to Regina. Will gently touched Tess's bandaged arm. He must have looked worried because she said: \"I'll be fine, Will. I'll be home before you know it and we can play the citizen game.\" He moved the hair off her forehead as her eyes started to close, the drugs taking over again. She garbled out something about him seeing his son and then her breathing slowed, her eyes shut. \"Bye Tess.\" He leaned down and kissed her forehead before grabbing his gun and moving to the truck. Five minutes later he left the camp for the last time.[Chapter 10] A/N: Alright! It's not the end, but it's closer. Thanks to everyone who's still around reading this crazy thing. Hopefully it won't be so long for the next update. I'm really sorry about how slow I'm going… and I really don't know how to write endings… but practice practice practice. Anyways, enjoy. Two weeks later Tess was up and about, but not quite back to work even though she could work if she wanted to. All her limbs were operational and she was healing nicely from the shrapnel wounds, but command was trying to figure out if she should be sent home with only one moth left on her tour. Meanwhile, she was stuck in limbo with Regina telling her not to work because she wasn't fully healed and \"I know you, girl. You'll lift something heavy and start bleeding all over again and I don't want to patch you up a second time.\" So she bummed around between the med. Center, Garage, and her bunk to pass the time. One day she was walking into the med. Center when Regina turned a young Private around to face her. He handed her a paper saying \"Sgt. James told you to call him at this number Ma'am.\" She took the piece of paper and saluted the Pvt. as he left. \"Sgt. James, huh?\" Regina said skeptically, eyeing Tess. She still didn't like the man all that much, even if he had saved Tess's life. \"This is a base number…\" Tess said staring at the paper. \"He's supposed to be home…\" \"They do need a lot of bomb techs. He could have been re-deployed already, you know how they bounce those guys around.\" \"I'm checking this out.\" Tess left the med. Center and walked over to comm. She signed her name on the list, marked it base-to-base call and picked up the phone. After two quick rings a man's voice answered on the other end. \"Camp Eagle.\" He stated in a gruff voice. \"This is Sgt. Tess Taylor calling for Sgt. Will James.\" She said curtly. \"Please hold.\" Was his response. It was a good ten minutes before he come back on the line. \"Sgt. James is out. You calling from Camp Victory?\" \"Yes Sir.\" \"Reason for calling?\" \"I was told to contact him.\" \"He'll get back to you.\" Then the line clicked off. She put the phone back and walked to the med. Center. She was lost in thought when she hit the building. Why was Will back in the sandbox? Did they really call him back that quickly? Had he volunteered? How long was his tour? \"Tess?\" She started and looked up at Regina. \"So, what did he say?\" \"Nothing, he was off base. He's gonna call back.\" She said quietly, distracted. \"I'm sure he'll be fine.\" Regina said going back to sweeping the floor. \"He's a big boy he can handle himself.\" She paused, \"Sorta.\" Tess smirked and sat down on one of the beds. She ended up sleeping there until someone shook her awake. Regina looked down at her in the dimly lit room. \"Guess who's on the phone?\" Tess sat up and practically ran out of the building. She blew through the door of the comm. building and grabbed the phone from the only man there. \"James?\" She practically yelled. \"Hi to you too.\" His voice sounded small on the other end, but she could hear it's cocky edge. \"What the Hell are you doing back here?!\" She said hotly. She realized now that coming back here and putting himself in harm's way again instead of staying home had really pissed her off. \"Citizen's life isn't for me, Tess.\" He replied, cockiness gone. \"Will, if you stay in this game, you're going to spiral out.\" There was a pause from his end. \"I was spiraling out quicker at home.\" She swallowed. \"How long are you at Eagle?\" \"A year.\" \"A YEAR?\" The words hit her like a sledge hammer to the chest. She could feel her blood pressure rising. The stiched up holes in her side started to throb, but she didn't pay attention. \"I'll be alright.\" Tess bit her lip. \"I swear. No hot shot moves, remember?\" \"You're the one who has to remember.\" She said quietly trying to calm down. \"I will,\" He said strongly, \"And then we'll both be back home.\" \"You better be.\" \"I can handle myself, Tess. You're worrying too much.\" He paused. \"How's the side?\" She snapped out of her sulking mood. \"I've been meaning to thank you for that, for saving me.\" \"You're welcome.\" She could hear him smile. \"Are they shipping you home?\" He asked. \"No word yet. I'm in limbo.\" \"How's that treating you?\" \"It sucks.\" He chuckled. \"Regina won't let me do any work.\" \"Tell her I say lighten up.\" \"Sergeant?\" The Private at the desk caught her attention. \"Yes?\" He nodded at her side. She looked down and saw her jacket spotted with blood. \"Tess?\" She didn't say anything and just focused on the blood and the sudden realization that she was in pain. \"Regina was right.\" Tess finally replied. \"What?\" \"I'm bleeding I must have… popped a stitch.\" She said distractedly. \"Go.\" Will ordered her. \"I'm sorry.\" \"It's alright.\" He said quickly. \"Go to med.\" \"You stay safe Will, You hear me?\" \"I will. Please, Tess, go, you're scaring me.\" \"Bye Will\" \"Bye Tess.\" \"I love you.\" She punched the end button and threw it at the Private before hobbling towards med. As she stepped through the door she called into the dim center. \"Hello?\" Regina rose from her desk in the corner. \"Tess why are you back here?\" \"Do you live here or something?\" She replied to Regina as she shuffled over to a bed. \"I think I popped a stitch.\" She started to sit down when Regina grabbed her arm. \"No! Don't sit, let me see.\" She pulled up Tess's shirt and inspected the damage. \"You popped two. What the Hell were you doing?\" She started helping Tess out of her jacket. \"I was yelling at Will, that jerk.\" She started to lie down so Regina could fix her stitches when she suddenly bolted upright and grabbed Regina's shoulders. \"What?\" Regina said in surprise, eyes wide. \"I think I told Will I loved him.\" \"You WHAT?\" \"I don't know!\" She lay back down with a thunk. \"I can't believe you? What did he say?\" \"I don't know. I hung up.\" \"Oh, girl, you are a mess.\" \"I know…\" She draped her arm over her eyes as she felt Regina inject some local anesthetic. \"I thought I didn't love him.\" \"Even I knew you were lying to yourself.\" \"Guess so.\" Regina chuckled. \"You're laughing at me now?\" Tess said in amazement. \"It's just ridiculous!\" Regina said starting to re-stitch her side. \"I mean look at you. You have five sizeable holes in your side, not to mention the ones in your leg and arm all of which required around 30 stitches, you're in limbo, the man you love is on another base for who knows how long, you're an ungodly number of miles from home and you can't even work at the job you love. Girl, you are the epitome of mess.\" \"Thanks\" Tess replied slowly after she was sure Regina was done. \"Welcome.\" In the next two weeks before she was sent back home Will called her three times. They never talked for long seeing as base-to-base calls were supposed to be restricted to military business only, but no one ever said anything. During their last conversation, Tess knew she was going home in three days and that she probably wouldn't talk to him before then. \"Happy to be going home?\" He had asked and she smiled. \"For now it sounds like the best thing on the planet.\" They agreed that he would call her because the military paid for calls home. He still had her number on the piece of paper she had scribbled her information on the day he had left. They never mentioned her 'I love you' slip and she assumed that he had hung up before he heard he say it. When she got home she settled into the spare room at her brother's house until she got squared away with a job to pay for her own place. She had wanted to call Will the next day, but they had agreed that he would call and knowing her luck she would probably end up calling while he was off base, or asleep. Being home distracted her for about a week before she got antsy. \"Camp Eagle.\" It was the same gruff voice that had answered the first time she had called there. \"I need to speak with Sgt. Will James.\" She stated. \"Hold please.\" There was a pause of maybe two minutes before he came back to the phone. \"It is listed that he is no longer with us. I'm very sorry ma'am.\" \"What?\" \"He's gone, Ma'am. KIA. I'm sorry, there's nothing else I can do for you.\" With that the line clicked off. \"KIA?\" She said into the dead line before dropping the phone. What did he mean 'KIA'? Had Will died? No, no way. He was fine, right? There was no way. Will was dead. Will was dead. She sank to her knees as her sister-in-law came up the stairs. \"Tess?\" She kneeled down in front of her. \"Tess, talk to me, what's wrong.\" She was too stunned to cry, to stunned to feel anything really. \"He's gone.\" She focused on the floor between them. \"Will is dead.\" She blinked and felt something warm on her cheek. Reaching up she brushed her hand across her face and it came away wet. She didn't register that it was tears. Her sister-in-law was hugging her now, but she did not return it. She just kept listening to the gruff man's voice echoing in her head \"He's gone, ma'am, KIA.\" A/N: Oh, Lord, what have I created?[Chapter 11] A/N: Alllright now. Dire requests have been made and so I churned out the end of this here story. Fair warning, I tried my best and hopefully came up with a semi decent ending, but endings are not my forte, especially for a story with this level of involvement and time. But, whatcha gonna do? Please (hopefully) enjoy. ….. From the spare room she had been staying at in her brother's house she heard the doorbell ring. She didn't get up. She didn't even move. She just stared at the wall. She heard footsteps and the door opening and voices, but she couldn't make out what they were saying. Her brain filled in the spaces. \"Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?\" She mumbled. \"Vote for What's his Nuts in November and do Hyde County a great service.\" She would have scoffed if she had more energy. She heard the door close and the voices continued. Whoever it was it was someone they knew. Ever since she had gotten into this funk that she refused to call depression there had been many well-wishers and old friends coming around, but she didn't want to see any of them, not now. She heard footsteps coming up the stairs and a soft knock on the door. \"Tess?\" Her brother's voice asked through the door. \"I don't want to see them.\" \"I think you might want to see this one.\" \"No.\" She heard him try the handle but the door was locked. \"I can't deal with it now.\" She thought she heard footsteps back down the stairs but seconds later he spoke again. \"Tess, please open the door.\" She was so furious that she forgot to unlock the door before she tried to open it. \"Damn it!\" She cursed before twisting the little knob and throwing the door open. \"Whoever it is they can just…\" He mouth stopped along with most everything else because staring at her, trying to hide his laughter at her inability to operate a door, was none other than the problem himself. \"James? I… You…\" He shook his head and pulled her into a hug before she could really process what was going on. \"Pain in the ass.\" All the stress she had been feeling left her in one giant rush. She leaned on him and then let her legs go all together figuring he could deal with it because she had dealt with his 'death' for the last three weeks. He slowly kneeled down, not letting her go. \"I'm sorry.\" He said quietly. \"You better be.\" \"They were moving me around and I couldn't…\" She just held him tighter. \"You're alive, that's the only thing that maters.\" After a pause they parted. \"Of course I'm alive!\" He said pushing her to arm's length. \"Why in the Hell would you think I was dead?\" \"I called Eagle after I was home for a while and they told me you were gone! KIA Will!\" She was holding back tears that sprung up after saying those words again. Even though he was right there in front of her she still felt the sting in her eyes and the tightening in her throat that had plagued her for three days before she shut down everything emotionally. \"There must have been some mistake… Jesus.\" He brushed her bangs out of her face. \"I'm so sorry Tess.\" The pain on his face was like a punch to the gut. She didn't want to see him sad or upset, or anything but happy. He was alive! Everything should be freakin rainbows and butterflies damnit! God she thought, I can't handle this. She shook her head. \"I look a mess!\" She exclaimed suddenly. She stood up quickly and started shuffling around her room, which was thankfully more pulled together than usual. Will got up and leaned on the door frame content with watching her move, how she picked things up and put them away, her hands deftly remaking the bed, listening to her voice as she asked him questions, not really waiting for an answer before saying something else. He just smiled and for the first time since he had left her broken and bleeding in the sandbox he felt a little more whole and warm. \"When did you get home?\" \"About a week ago. Decided it was high time I paid you a visit.\" He couldn't keep the small smile from his face. \"I'm gonna…\" She pointed at the bathroom and looked at the bundle of clothes in her hand. \"You can sit.\" She said pointing to the bed. \"I'll be out in a sec.\" She hurried off to the bathroom and Will walked over to the desk next to her bed. There was a picture of her and her brother in a silver frame. He picked it up and sank onto her bed. They were laughing at something. The smile on Tess's face was wider than he had ever seen, her eyes almost disappearing. Her hair was longer and framed her face. She looked younger, innocent. The war had changed her. He put the picture back down with clenched teeth. \"Alright.\" She said coming back out of the bathroom. He didn't even keep himself from staring as he got up off the bed. She looked so different from the woman he was used to on base and different from the girl in the photo. It was a mix of them both with an undercurrent of a haunted past. She was strangely beautiful. \"Tess, you look…\" \"Like a wreck, I know. But you put me through Hell!\" \"I was going to say beautiful.\" He said with a sincerity so deep it highlighted the silence that followed. She looked down and back up. \"Lets go.\" She brushed past him and out the door. She was starting to realize that being around Will here at home, without the war or distractions was going to be difficult. He had a woman back at his home and a son, people he was involved with. He couldn't love her, not like she loved him. She didn't need him too, but she wasn't sure how to approach the situation either. Everything was so much different than war. He followed her down the stairs and she re-introduced him to her family before they left the house. He followed her to the garage where a burnt orange Dodge Challenger 2009 was sitting in the shadows. \"Bet that's yours…\" Will said. \"What's a girl without her car, James?\" \"I missed you Tess.\" He said with a smile. She just smiled back, not saying anything because there were so many things she wanted to say, but had no idea how to so it would probably just come out as incoherent noises because she was so confused. Instead she got in her car and started it up. \"Where are we going?\" He asked. \"You'll see.\" She responded. They drove in silence, Tess gripping the wheel with both hands and Will watching the city go by out the window. It would have been a comfortable silence if Tess could stop herself from thinking about anything and everything involving her relationship with Will. She felt like a little schoolgirl again and she hated it. She had known this man for months and he had saved her life and now she was afraid to even say anything to him. This is absurd. She turned the car into a parking lot between two buildings and got out of the car. Will followed her, but she did not wait for him and he had to jog to catch up. \"Tess, we need to talk.\" \"Ah ah!\" She said holding up a finger to quiet him and then folding her arms back in front of her while continuing on towards the sand dune in front of them. She could smell the salt water already and apparently so could Will. \"You're true to your word. If I come see you I get to see the ocean.\" They walked the boardwalk and the ocean came into view. They could see a storm brewing to the north, but the south skies were clear. The sun wasn't too hot at this point in the fall so the beach wasn't too crowded. Tess took a moment to just stand and look at the water, at the clouds and how they were building, how the little clumps of grass swayed on the dune and she calmed herself down. Will watched her with concern, not really knowing what she was doing, what was going on in her head. She stepped off the boardwalk and sat down in the sand. Will sat next to her. \"Tess…\" \"I know! We need to talk.\" She sighed. \"Look, Will, there are multiple reasons why you and I shouldn't be together, at all, ever.\" He smiled and looked away at the ocean. \"For one, you have people that you're involved with, a son who needs you.\" \"I'm leaving them.\" He said shortly, playing with the sand between them. She furrowed her eyebrows and waited for him to continue. \"Connie doesn't need me. As much as she thinks she does, she doesn't, and I'm just holding her back. She doesn't understand what I've been through and I can't explain it to her. And my son…\" He paused. \"He'll be better without me too. I'd make a terrible father.\" He said with a sad chuckle. \"A son needs his father.\" \"I know, but… look, with me out of the way Connie can go find a good man, someone who can be a father.\" She wasn't going to argue with him. It wasn't her place. Tess sighed and went on to her other reasons. \"We're both a mess.\" She went on. \"So we'll keep each other together. There is not another person on this planet that understands what we went through better than we know each other. I know where you've been hurt, I know who you've lost. And you know my mistakes and will understand the other ones when they come back to haunt me.\" \"But you don't love me, Will!\" She said upset. She hadn't even meant to say it really. Why was he fighting so hard for her if he didn't love her? She didn't think she needed him to, but she couldn't see this working out very well if she loved him like she did without him reciprocating, without him understanding. \"I know, but I need you, Tess!\" She swallowed. \"Look, after I left and went to Eagle, I realized that you… I wasn't the same without you around. I was slipping up, depressed, angry. It's just, when you were around I felt… better. Connie can't do that, she doesn't understand.\" Will threw a rock towards the water. He didn't look back at her. \"Look, I can understand if you want someone who can love you, but I'm willing to give us a shot. Maybe along the way…\" Tess moved in front of him. \"We'll figure it out…\" She leaned in and kissed him softly. Smiling she shifted into his lap and put her head on his shoulder. His arms came around her after a second and one of his hands gently covered the side with her shrapnel wounds. \"I like this.\" She stated plainly after a minute. \"I could give this a shot.\" He kissed the top of her head and smiled because that warmth that he didn't usually feel in his chest had started glowing there again. ….. A/N: AAAaaaaannnnd that's a wrap. Trolololo Will's not dead. I hoped you liked it, because as I said I suck with endings, especially long ass things like this.

I'm talkin to my friends that i sit by. The bell for the pledge rings. We stand up and say the pledge then have the moment of silence. After we sit back down everyone starts talkin again. Mr. Cagle tells us to be quiet so we could hear the morning announcements. \"For lunch today is chicken o's or steak and gravy. There are still some more annuals for sale if you haven't bought one already. See mrs Crawford. Also students t-cap is next week. Be prepared. We have one more announcement. Will all students come to the gym after the dismissal bell.\" \"What's that about?\" I ask Mr. Cagle. \"I'm not sure.\" Mr. Cagle goes on with class. \"Ok guys when the bell rings go put your stuff in your locker and line up outside my room.\" The bell rings two minutes later. I walk out to my locker. I'm the first one there as usual I put my books where they go and line up outside his room. When everyone is in line Mr. Cagle leads us to the gym. 6th, 7th, and half of the 8th grade is already there. We got to sit anywhere we wanted to. I saw my friend Kate And went and sat by her. \"What are we doin in here?\" I ask her. \"I don't know. Somebody said something about a pep rally.\" \"But for what?\" \"I have no idea.\" When the rest of the 8th grade gets there Mrs. Reel walks in the middle of the gym with a microphone. \"Hey guys quieter down.\" We all get quiet. \"Alright guys I know you're probably wondering why your in here. Well before i tell y'all, Mr. Cagle wiil you go get about 4 chairs from the band room?\" He nodded and asked Mr. Perry to help him. He says yes and they go get the chairs. They come back and put them near Mrs. Reel. \"Alright. We are gonna play a little game. I need a volunteer.\" A bunch of hands go up. \"Um I pick Hanna.\" She said pointing at me. I didn't raise my hand because I not that good with crowds. I fake like I'm excited when I'm really terrified. I get up and walk to her. \"Ok Miss Hanna what I need for you to do is go down the 8th grade hall and find a poster in one of the classrooms that has something to do with nature! Now proably know where one is but we moved all the posters around! It's in a classroom.\" \"Alright.\" \"You ready?\" I nod. \"You can't run! On your mark he set go!\" I walk out of the gym and head to Mrs. Martins room. There were the posters with math stuff on them. I walk to Mrs. Kim's room. I see more math posters. I walk out and go to Mrs. Jones room. I see science posters but none about nature. I walk into Mr. Cagles room. I see English posters but none about nature. I just sneak a peek in Mr. Perry's room but I just see posters with history stuff on it. Mrs. Spicers is the last room. I walk in and see a poster from Mrs. Martins. It has trees on it. I grab it and walk back to the gym. When I get back everyone is quiet and smiling at me. \"Alright! Good job Hanna! Now take a seat right here.\" Mrs. Reel said pointing to one of the seats. I sit down. \"Ok so you're probably wondering why I just made you do that we'll we have a surprise for you!\" I'm shocked. \"I bet you're dieing to know what it is!\" I nod. Everyone is really quiet which is unusual for my school. I see everybody's eyes move behind me. I'm tempted to turn around but I don't. Just then a pair of hands cover my eyes and says \"Guess who?!\" The voice sounds really familiar but I can't place it. \"Um I know the voice but I don't know.\" The hands uncover my eyes. I turn around and see Brittany Snow standing there smiling. I cover my mouth in shock trying not to scream. I start crying. Everyone is clapping. \"Hello Miss Hanna Haston. My name is Brittany Snow.\" Brittany says holding out her hand. I shake it. \"I heard that you were a big fan of mine!\" I nod still crying. You stand up and give her a hug. Just then Courtney rolls out a Love Is Louder poster. He sets it up behind me and Brittany and I sit back down. Mrs. Reel sits beside me. I give her a hug and say thank you. Then Brittany and Courtney start talking about Love is louder. After I get a picture with them and their autographs. \"So Hanna would you like to finish the tour with us? We already talked to your parents and they said it was ok but you have to have a friend go with you.\" I nod and start crying again. \"I want Kate to go with me!\" I say. I run and get her. She is allowed to go and we exchange numbers. We get clothes and they pick us up at our houses in the RV and we finish the tour.[Chapter 2] Love Is Louder Tour Day 1 It's been a day since Brittany asked me to go on tour with her. I was still starstruck and couldn't believe that this was happening. The RV is huge! It has 3 beds. A queen sized bed which was Courtney's and large bunk beds. Brittany has the one on top and me and Kate have to share the bottom one. We have to text our parents every hour of the trip to let them know what we are doing. Brittany showed us around the RV. She showed us the bathroom, the kitchen, and of course the wall. The wall had pictures of a bunch of people around the world with Love is Louder on their hands. \"Wow that's amazing!\" I said. Brittany nodded. \"Yea it really is. It's amazing how I helped with that and that there are so many people who support it.\" Brittany said. \"Oh you have no idea.\" I said. \"What do you mean?\" \"Well I kinda have a fan page dedicated to pitch perfect on Instagram and you have no idea how many people post pictures of you and Love is louder.\" \"Wow. Really?\" \"Yes like it's crazy!\" Kate said agreeing. \"Can I check out this account?\" \"Sure!\" I said. I log out of my personal on my phone and log into my pitch perfect account. I hadn't been on in a few days since I've been on tour. Over 100 notifications popped up! \"Wow! You're popular!\" Kate said. I laughed. \"Hey! How bout we post a picture on there?\" Brittany said. We smiled. \"Alright!\" I hold my phone out and get all 3 of us in a picture! I post it and the caption says \"Hey guys sorry i haven't been on in a while! Somethin amazing happened! Guys I would like y'all to meet Brittany Snow, me, and Kate! We are on your with them! Havin a blast so far! brittsnowhuh & apple_girl20\" Brittany gets on her phone and finds my account and follows it and likes the picture. She comments \"Havin a blast with yall too ;)\" Kate gets on her account and likes it and comments \"I love you guys!\" Not even 5 seconds later I get over 50 comments askin if this is real and that I am so lucky and stuff like that! Brittany screen shotted the picture and posted it on her personal! Her caption said \"Hangin with hanna_leigh23 ( gingers_jiggle_juice_) & apple_girl20 in the RV! Havin a blast! Couldn't of picked two better girls to go on tour with!\" Just then we got a bunch of more followers! We sat there on in instagram for a few more minutes. It was about 9 in the morning when Courtney finally woke up. \"Hey girls? What's goin on?\" He asked. \"Just hangin out waitin on you to fix us breakfast!\" Brittany said. He laughed. \"We'll what do y'all want?\" \"I was thinkin pancakes!\" Kate said. We agreed. \"Alright pancakes it is!\" He went to the kitchen and made us some pancakes. \"Order up!\" He said placin the pancakes in front of us. Me and Kate dig in! Brittany and Courtney watch in amazement about how fast we ate those pancakes. We were already full by the time they eat one pancake. \"Where we goin today?\" Kate asked. \"Well our first stop is New York City.\" Courtney said. \"What are we gonna do?\" I ask. \"Both of you are going to help spread the word by like walkin up to random people and giving them compliments and then when we are talking y'all can sit on stage and take pictures or something? Y'all can really do just whatever you want. Just think of me and Courtney as your older siblings!\" \"Alright! We can do that!\" Kate says. I nod. We are almost in New York so we should probably get ready.\" Courtney says. We leave the table and get some clothes. Brittany wears a owl shirt with red pants and black heels. Courtney wears a grey shirt with blue jeans and black tennis shoes. Kate wears a yellow short sleeve shirt with blue jeans and her yellow vans. I wear a blue shirt sleeve shirt with blue jeans and my blue vans. Brittany does our hair. She puts hers in a cute little bun. She puts mine and Kate's into a high pony tail with a little braid on the side. \"Cute!\" Brittany says looking at both of us. We smiled. She started to do her make up. \"Y'all want me to do yours too?\" Kate nodded. \"That would be great!\" Kate said. \"What about you Hanna?\" Brittany asked me. \"Um I don't know I'm not the make up kind of person.\" \"Come on! It'll be fun!\" Brittany said. \"I don't know.\" \"We'll I'm doing your make up whether you like it or not! Ill force it on you if I have too!\" I laughed. \"Alright fine but me and make up dont go good together.\" I said. Brittany laughed. \"We'll make it work!\" I grin. She does Kate's and she looks gorgeous as always. Then it's my turn. Her and Kate talk about what color to use for my eyes and I'm just sitting there. I don't anything about make up so I'm confused about what they are talking about. About 5 minutes later they were finished. I turned around and looked in the mirror. I thought I looked pretty good. \"Beautiful!\" Brittany said. I blushed. Kate nodded. \"Thanks!\" \"Alright Courtney your turn!\" Brittany shouted through the RV. \"Yea right!\" He shouted back. We laughed. When we were finished getting ready the RV pulled up at the place they were speaking. We walked off the RV and a bunch of fans ran up to Brittany and Courtney. They give out a bunch of autographs and take a bunch of pictures with people. Me and Kate just stand there like lost puppies and by that time is what we feel like. While we were standing there we saw these 2 cute guys lookin at me and Kate. They walked up to Brittany and Courtney. Both of them looked about 14 and had brown hair that went to the top of their forehead with blue eyes. They looked like twins except one of them was taller. One of them whispered somethin into Brittany's ear. She smiled. We were confused. Brittany turned around and motioned for us to come here. We walked over to her. \"Hanna, Kate I would like you to meet Drew and Tyler.\" She said pointing to the two boys in front of us. \"Nice to meet you!\" We said smiling. \"So Hanna would you like to sit by me in there?\" Tyler asked me. I nodded. \"Kate would you like to sit by me?\" Drew asked her. She nodded. They looked at Brittany an she winked at us. We laughed. \"We'll save you two a seat.\" Tyler said winking at me. \"Alright see you in there.\" I said smiling. They waved bye an went to stand by their moms. We walked away as calm as we could and when they weren't looking we jumped up and down screaming. Brittany saw us and laughed. When they were done with autographs and it was time to go in there we walked backstage with them. \"I would say y'all could stay back here but I know you got some friends Savin you a seat.\" Brittany said winking. We laughed. We walked off stage and tried to find Tyler and Drew. They were wavin and jumpin up and down trying to get our attention. We saw them and smiled. We walked over there. It went Drew, Kate, me, then Tyler. We were gettin to know each other while we were waiting for Brittany and Courtney to come on stage. Apparently they were from Tennessee too! They just wanted to be one of the first people to see the Love is Louder tour. After a few minutes they came on stage. Everyone clapped. \"Hi everybody and welcome to Day one of the Love is Louder tour!\" Brittany said. We screamed and clapped along with everyone else. \"Before we start I would like y'all to meet my partner in this tour, Courtney!\" Everyone clapped. He walked on stage and waved. \"Also we have two special girls in the audience who are in your with us! Hanna, Kate will y'all please stand up?\" Brittany asked looking at us. We stood up and waved at everybody. Everyone clapped and Tyler and Drew were clapping and screaming. I was still terrible with crowds so I always got a feeling in my stomach that I was Fixin to throw up but I never did. My face was probably red after I sat down. Kate on the other hand was great With crowds! She won homecoming queen and Ms. Eighth grade this year! Brittany and Courtney talked more about Love is Louder. When they were finished Tyler and Drew asked for our numbers and we gave it to them so we could keep in touch. After that we walked backstage. We saw Brittany so we ran up to her and hugged her from behind. She jumped. \"You were great!\" I said. She smiled. We let go. \"Alright ladies we better go if y'all want something to eat before we get back on the RV. Me and Kate got excited. We were starving like always. We walked down the road to a restaurant called The Hard Rock Cafe. Me and Kate had never been there before but Courtney and Brittany said it was really good. We ordered a big thing of chicken wings to share. While we were sitting there we saw a bunch of people whispering and pointing at Brittany. Brittany saw that me and Kate noticed that. \"You get used to it after a while. Give it a minute and people will start asking for autographs. Just then a little girl walked up to Brittany. \"Can I have your autograph?\" She asked in the most innocent voice ever. \"Aw of course you can!\" Brittany said. She took the little girls pen and signed her paper she had. She handed it back. \"Thank you.\" \"You're welcome sweetie.\" Brittany smiled then waved at her as she walked away.c\"Ok so now we have to go before more people come over here.\" Brittany said. We got up and walked outside. We walked up the street to a store that looked like it was for teenagers. \"Let's go in there Courtney!\" Brittany said begging Courtney. He finally gave in and let us go in there. There was a bunch of hats and sunglasses and necklaces and earrings and a bunch of other stuff! Brittany ran straight to the hats. She picked up a green fluffy Kate and put it on me. Then she got a yellow fluffy one for Kate and got a blue fluffy hat for Courtney and got a purple fluffy hat for herself. Then she went and grabbed 4 pairs is sunglasses that had a mounts he attached to them. She handed the to us and we put them on. She pulled out her phone and we took a picture together. Then out of no where Kate yells \"TANGERINE!\" I bust out laughin. I'm on the ground holding my stomach and Kate is too! Brittany looks at us like we are stupid. \"What the heck?\" Me and Kate can't stop laughing long enough to tell her. We lay on the ground laughing for another 5 minutes before pulling ourself together. When we stand up Brittany says, \"So what was that about?\" \"Um do you remember the MTV movie awards? Well we watched it together and now every time we see each other we will yell it then start laughin.\" Kate said. \"Yep it's our little inside joke!\" I said. Brittany laughs at us. \"Well all I can say is y'all have a unique friendship!\" Brittany says. We laugh then nod. \"Yes, yes we do!\" Kate says. Brittany decides to buy the hats and sunglasses for us. We wear them back to the RV. It was about 4 in the afternoon so we decide to watch a movie. Brittany didn't even ask us what we wanted to watch she just pulled out a movie and put it in. It was Lilo and Stitch. Me and Kate smiled. \"I kinda saw that you two like Lilo and Stitch well so do I!\" We laughed. We sat there and watched the movie. When the movie was over we put on our pjs. We sat and talked for a little bit. Brittany asked about Drew and Tyler and we told her about how we gave them our numbers and they actually live close to us, and that we had a bunch of things in common. \"I knew I was doin the right thing by introducing you guys!\" Brittany said. We laughed. Brittany yawned. \"Alright girls. We better hit the hay. We got to get up early in the morning.\" Brittany said. We didn't argue. Courtney fell asleep half way through Lilo and Stitch so we just left him there. Brittany hopped on her bunk then we got on ours. She clapped her hands and the lights went off. Then we fell asleep.[Chapter 3] Love is louder tour day 2 The next morning me and Kate wake up to the smell of muffins. Kate sniffs the air. \"Strawberry and Blueberry muffins.\" She says. \"That a good honker you got there!\" Brittany shouts from the kitchen. I laugh. \"We walk in the kitchen. \"Why thank you!\" She says sitting at the table. I sit beside her and Brittany places the muffins in front of us. Kate was fixin to grab a muffin but Brittany slapped her hand. \"What the crap?\" She said. \"Wait till Courtney wakes up! If we don't then you two will eat all the muffins and we won't get any!\" I laugh. \"We've been with her for one day and she already knows us so well!\" I say. We sit there for about 30 seconds and Kate couldn't take it any more. She got up and crawled over me and got herself a glass of water. We thought she was gonna drink it but she walks to Courtney's room. I look at Brittany. \"This is not gonna be good.\" I say to Brittany. \"You don't need to mess with Kate and her food.\" I add. About a few seconds later we hear a scream. Then Kate comes running in the kitchen. She sets the glass on the counter and climbs back over me. Then Courtney comes in the kitchen soaking wet. He looks angry. Right when we think he is fixin to yell he starts bustin out laughin. Kate looks confused. Me and Britt start laughin. While we were laughing I'm pretty sure Kate snuck a muffin without us seeing. Courtney went and dried off. Then he came back and ate a few muffins then Britt let us eat some. While we were eatin Kate wanted to know where we were going. \"So where are we going today?\" \"We'll we have a small conference then we have a surprise for y'all!\" Brittany said. Me and Kate looked at each other and smiled. When we were done eating me and Kate were so full we had to lay down. We went and laid down on our bed. \"Hanna Kate get up and pick out your outfit!\" Britt said. We groaned. \"But I don't wanna!\" I said. \"You pick them out for us!\" Kate said. \"Fine but you wear what I pick out!\" About five minutes later Britt had our outfits picked out. She picked out for herself a black shirt with white polka dots, blue jeans, and flats. For Kate she picked out a pink shirt with blue stripes, blue jeans, and grey vans. For me she picked out a blue and purple plaid shirt, blue jeans, and potatoes shoes. Courtney picked out his outfit and he wore a Love is Louder t-shirt, black jeans, and his tennis shoes. Brittany got us to get up by pulling on our arms till we were up. When she got us up we put on our clothes. Britt wanted to curl our hair so we let her. It just took about 5 minutes. We looked great! Then she curled her hair. She looked great. \"You girls ready for the day 2 picture?\" Britt asked us. We nodded. She pulled out her phone and pointed it at us. \"Alright no smiles do a weird face!\" Britt said. We laughed. Brittany did the duck face, I stuck my tongue out, and Kate cringed her nose. She took the picture. \"Gorgeous!\" She said lookin at it. She posted it on Instagram and so did we. \"Day 2 with these lovely ladies! ? hanna_leigh23 apple_girl20 #loveislouder\" Courtney commented on the picture. \"You ladies look great! But the picture would look better if I was in it ?\" We laughed at his comment. \"So are you guys gonna give us a hint on where we are goin?\" I asked. \"Nope. It's a surprise!\" Britt said. \"I don't like surprises!\" Kate said. \"We'll you're gonna have to learn to love them!\" Britt said. \"Alright you two you ready for he make up?\" We nodded. She gestured toward a seat and I sat down. Her and Kate went to work again. I was gettin used to them putting it on me of a morning but I still wasn't used to the make up. When they were finished I looked in the mirror. They did really great on it. \"Wow!\" I said. \"You like it?\" Britt asked. \"I love it!\" I said. They smiled. \"My turn!\" Kate said. She pulled me out if my seat and sat down. I would've helped but I didn't know a thing about make up so Brittany went to work. \"Kate you look great!\" I said when Britt finished. Brittany nodded. \"Thanks!\" She said. It was about 10 in the morning when we left the RV. We walked to a conference building. There wasn't that many people outside waiting so we didn't have a problem going in. When we got in there we went backstage. \"Are you girls gonna stay backstage?\" We nodded. We didn't have anybody out there we knew. Brittany and Courtney walked on stage. \"Hello everyone. And welcome to day 2 of the love is louder tour!\" Courtney said. Everyone clapped including me and Kate. They started talking about how one person can change the world, and how Love is louder came to be and what it is meant to do. They were really amazing and delivered the message so great! It was seriously an honor to be with them. The conference just lasted about an hour. When they were finished they walked off stage and met us. \"What did you think?\" Britt asked us. \"Y'all were amazing!\" I said. \"Thanks!\" Courtney said. We smiled. While they were on stage me and Kate came up with some things that they might take us too. We came up with 3 possible places. 1. The New York Zoo. 2. The New York aquarium. 3. Times Square. Now was the time to find out. Kate poked me to get me to ask. \"Alright. So what's our surprise?\" I asked. They smiled. \"We are takin you two on a tour of NYC!\" \"Yay! I can't wait!\" I said. \"Me either! This is gonna be awesome!\" Kate said. Britt and Courtney smiled at how excited we were. \"Let's hit the road girls!\" Courtney said. \"Wait before we go I need to stop by a store.\" Britt said. \"Ok well then we better go!\" We walked to a store up the road from the conference center. Brittany walked in there while we waited outside. She came out a few minutes later with a bag. \"What did you buy?\" I asked her. She pulled out four pairs of sunglasses and put them on us and a camera. \"We want to remember today! I mean it is the first day in New York for you two!\" Britt said. We walked up the block until we got to a double decker bus. \"Alright girls go to the top!\" Courtney said. We listened and went to the top. When we got up there nobody was there. \"Why isn't anybody up here? Ain't the top of double decker buses usually crowded?\" Kate asked. \"Yes they usually are but me and Britt rented this bus for you guys!\" Courtney said. \"Seriously?!\" I said getting excited. They nodded. Me and Kate grabbed hands and jumped up and down. They laughed at us. Brittany took out her camera and got a picture of all of us on the bus! \"We were gonna hire a tour guide but we figured it would be more fun if we showed y'all around!\" Brittany said. We agreed. The bus driver rode up the road a ways till we got to Central Park. \"Now if you look to your right you'll see Central Park!\" Britt said trying to sound like a tour guide. We didn't have time to stop and walk so Britt took a picture of all of us at Central Park then we moved on. Me and Kate had our phones out takin pictures of different things on the way and sendin them to our parents. We even saw one of those metallic robot man! We got a picture of him. Our next stop was The Statue of Liberty. \"Wow!\" I said. Brittany took out her camera and took a picture of just me and Kate then of all of us in front of it. \"Now folks the Statue of Liberty is a woman holding a torch so I wouldn't make her mad!\" Brittany said in her tour guide voice. Me and Kate busted out laughin. We couldn't help it. Brittany was to darn funny! After that we rode on to the Empire State Building. \"If you'll look to your left you will see a large building. I believe it's called the Empire State Building? Correct me if I'm wrong!\" Britt said. We laughed. \"Some tour guide!\" I whispered to Kate. She laughed. We took a picture in front of it then moved on. Our last stop was Times Square. Me and Kate were really excited! We had always wanted to visit there. We rode into Times Square and there was lights everywhere. Signs with advertisements everywhere! There was even one with Brittany, Courtney, and us on it! Britt pulled out her camera and got our picture in front of the flashing sign. \"This is amazing!\" Kate said. \"Yes it is! Thank you guys so much!\" I said. We hugged Britt and Courtney. \"You're welcome! Anything for our favorite girls!\" Britt said. We rode around for a few more minutes looking at signs and people then the bus turned around and we headed back to the RV. It took us about 30 minutes to get back and when we did we all took a shower and out on our pjs. \"Where we goin tomorrow?\" I asked. \"We are heading to Newtown, Connecticut.\" Courtney said. \"Can't wait!\" I said. We talked a little bit longer about our day then went to bed.[Chapter 4] Love is louder day 3 The next morning me and Kate are the first ones up. We decided to surprise Courtney and Brittany with breakfast. We made biscuits, eggs, bacon, and gravy. I set the table setting out four plates and four cups then put the food on the table. \"We did good!\" I said to Kate givin her a high five. \"Wait we are missing one final touch!\" Kate said. She walked to the fridge and pulled out four tangerines. She laid them on the table I laughed. \"They are goin to love this!\" I said. We sat there got a few minutes talking about Tyler and Drew. We had been texting them nonstop on the tour. We were really getting to know them. While we were talkin we heard Brittany wake up. We decided to hide under the table. She walked in the kitchen and saw the breakfast. We jumped out and said \"SUPRISE!\" \"Oh my god girls you didn't have to do this!\" She said walking to the table. \"No we didn't but we did! To show how appreciated we are that you and Courtney allowed us to go with you and take care of us like we were your own!\" I said. She hugged us. \"You guys are the best!\" \"We know!\" Kate said. Britt laughed. Courtney walked in the kitchen. \"We'll whats this?\" He asked. \"Breakfast!\" I said. He was surprised. We sat down and started eating. \"I noticed the tangerines, Kate.\" Brittany's said looking at Kate. Kate smiled. \"I have no idea what you're talkin about!\" Kate said. We laughed. \"So what are we doing today?\" I asked. \"We'll we are goin to speak at the conference hall then we are going to visit Sandy Hook Elementary school to talk to some of the kids!\" Brittany said. \"Really! This will be awesome!\" I said. Kate nodded. We finished eating and got ready. We all wore our grey Love is Louder shirts with blue jeans. Kate wore her navy blue vans. I wore my pink vans. Brittany wore her yellow vans. Courtney wore his tennis shoes. Me, Kate, and Britt pulled our hair back. We were all matching. Brittany pulled out the camera and we took a picture together. \"Gorgeous!\" Britt said. She posted it in Instagram. The caption said \"Day 3 in the beautiful Newtown, Connecticut we are all matching! hanna_leigh23 apple_girl20\" I posted it too. \"You know you're getting close when all of you match! apple_girl20 brittsnowhuh courtknows\" They all got on there and liked it. We sat on Instagram for a few more minutes then Brittany and Kate did my make up again. \"I'm actually gettin used to this believe it or not!\" I said. They laughed. It took about 5 minutes then they did theirs. When we were all finished getting ready we walked to the conference hall. There was a lot of people there today. Brittany and Courtney was stopped by a group of fans wanting pictures and autographs. This one little boy caught my eye. He walked up to Brittany and said \"I've never met anybody famous before. Will you sign this for me?\" He had the most precious eyes I have ever seen. He had blue eyes and when he asked her he used the puppy dog face. He looked about 5 years old. \"Aw of course I will sweetie.\" Brittany said. He smiled and asked for a picture too. She agreed. \"Can those girls be in it too? They are really pretty and wearin the same thing as you!\" He asked her. \"I'm sure they won't mind!\" She said to the boy. \"Hey girls come here for a second.\" She said to us. We walked over there. \"This little boy wants to have a picture with all of us. Do you girls mind?\" We shook our heads no. Me and Kate bent down beside him and Brittany got behind him. Me and Kate decided that it would be cute if we kissed a cheek. I kissed one cheek and Kate kissed the other and Brittany put her arms around all of us. His mom took the picture. The little boy was blushing. \"What do you say to these nice girls?\" His mom asked the little boy. \"Thank you!\" He said turning around waving. \"You're welcome!\" Brittany said. \"Bye!\" Me and Kate said to the little boy. He waved and him and his mom went inside. Brittany and Courtney have a few more autographs and pictures then the security guard escorted us to the conference hall. Me and Kate were gonna sit backstage again but Brittany made the people who set the stage up set 2 chairs out there for me and Kate. I had terrible stage fright but I guess that didn't matter now. Brittany was pretty determined to get me on stage. Brittany and Courtney walked on stage. \"Hello everybody an welcome to day 3 of the love is louder tour!\" We clapped with everybody else. \"Now before we get started we would like to introduce to you two special girls who have been on your with us and feel like family! Hanna and Kate everybody!\" Every one clapped for us and we walked on stage. We waved then sat down. So far so good. I was still nervous but nobody paid attention to me just Brittany and Courtney. They talked about the same thing again as usual it was really inspiring. When they were finished we all walked off stage together. \"You guys ready to go to Sandy Hook?\" Courtney asked us. We nodded. \"This is gonna be really sad.\" I whispered to Kate. \"Probably but we got to be strong!\" She said. I nodded. We got in a car and it took us to Sandy Hook. When we got there the principal came to meet us. \"Hello. I'm the new principal of Sandy Hook. Welcome.\" He held out his hand to shake Brittany's and Courtney's. They shook it. \"Nice to meet you. I'm Brittany. He is Courtney and these two pretty girls are Hanna and Kate.\" We shook his hand. \"Nice to meet you girl.\" \"Nice to meet you too.\" We said. \"So would you like a tour of the school?\" He asked. \"Sure we would love too!\" Brittany said. We walked into the school. He showed us every class room. We stopped at every classroom to talk to the kids. Each time we did me and Kate would find a seat near the kids and talk to them. We got to know a few of them. We met Katie who was a seven year old girl who lost her best friend and loved to play softball like Kate. Her and Kate became friends really fast. We also met a little girl named Amber who was Katie's best friend. She was also seven years old and was a very smart girl that wasn't really into sports but loved to play with friends. Me and her got to know each other. And by the time we left we had those two little girls in our laps. We couldn't help but love them little girls. \"Hanna?\" \"Yes Amber?\" \"Can me and Katie get a picture with you two?\" \"Of course you can!\" I said. \"Hey Britt do you mind takin the picture?\" She shook her head no. Me and Kate sat beside each other and Katie was in Kate's lap and Amber was in mine. Brittany took the picture. \"Thank you!\" They said. \"You're welcome sweeties!\" We said. \"Brittany can we please take these little girls home?\" I begged her. \"Yea please!?\" Kate said. Brittany laughed. \"Now I don't think their Momas would be to happy about that!\" \"Aww!\" We said. We gave them a hug and said \"Now you two girls be good! Well try and talk Britt into driving us back down here to see you guys!\" I said winking at them. \"Yea! We won't forget you girls!\" Kate said. The girls wrapped their arms around our necks and we hugged back. \"Bye!\" We said walkin out wavin at them. School was Fixin to let out so we had to leave. \"Thank you guys for coming and talking to the kids. It means a lot that you came!\" The principal said. \"It was our pleasure!\" Brittany said. We got back in the car and waved good bye. As we drove by the window we saw Katie and Amber in the window. They waved good bye to us and we waved back. \"You should've let us take them home!\" I said to Britt. Kate nodded. She laughed. We went back to the RV. \"You guys wanna order a pizza?\" Courtney asked us. \"Yes!\" Me and Kate yelled. \"Jinx! Double-jinx! Triple-jinx! I don't know what's next! Jinx again! Double-jinx again! Triple-jinx again!\" Before we could say something else Brittany stopped us. \"Y'all could keep this up for days!\" We laughed and nodded. \"So do you guys wanna watch a movie?\" Brittany asked us. We nodded. \"Alright. What do you wanna watch?\" We walked to the movie case. We saw a bunch of disney movies. \"I'm gonna pick out a movie and Kate is then you're gonna pick the winner!\" I said to Britt. She nodded. I picked out Monsters Inc and Kate picked out Little Rascals. \"I pick both! \" Brittany said. \"Lets watch Little Rascals first then Monsters inc!\" Britt said. We agreed and put the movies in and got some pizza. When the movie was over we sat and played cards. \"What card game do y'all wanna play?\" Courtney asked us. \"Gold fish!\" I screamed. They all laughed at me. \"What? That's a fun game! Now lets play it!\" I said. \"Alright!\" Courtney said. He passed out the cards and we played. I won! Brittany didn't like that I won so she demanded a rematch! We played five more times and I won every time! Brittany was mad. \"Hanna cheated!\" Brittany shouted! \"I did not!\" I shouted back. We were laughing while shouting. \"Yes you did!\" \"No I didn't!\" \"Did!\" \"Didn't!\" We kept that up for a few more minutes then we both hushed. We stopped laughing and checked Instagram. Nothin much had happened except me and Kate got a bunch of more followers. After we did that we laid down and were out five minutes later! We were tired![Chapter 5] Love is Louder day 4 The next morning I woke up and Kate wasnt beside me. I got up and looked to see if Britt was up there. She wasn't. I walked into the kitchen. They were there watchin Cinderella. They were so into it they didn't even notice me walk in there. \"Good mornin.\" I said. \"What oh hey Hanna!\" Britt said looking up from the tv. \"Yea hey hanna.\" Kate said keepin her eyes locked on the screen. \"Watcha watchin?\" I asked sittin between them. \"What's it look like? Cinderella duh!\" Kate said. \"Yay! I love this movie!\" I said. Britt laughed at us. Me and Kate got in the floor and laid on our belly to watch it. Brittany was playing on her phone. I texted my mom and told her what we were doin then I got a instagram notification. \"Wanna keep these girls quiet? Just put in Cinderella and sit them in front of the tv. hanna_leigh23 & shaniakatexx \" I liked it and commented. \"Hey now you love it too!\" She laughed when she read it. \"Alright you got me there hanna_leigh23\" Kate got on there and commented on it too. \"Can you guys be quite I'm tryin to watch this?!\" We laughed. \"Shhh!\" She said. When it went off Courtney walked in. \"What's for breakfast?\" \"Cereal.\" Britt said. She got up and pulled out 4 different kinds of cereal, milk, 4 bowls, and 4 spoons. There was Mini Wheats, Lucky Charms, Captain Crunch, and Cheerios. Kate grabbed the Cheerios, I grabbed Lucky Charms, Britt grabbed Captain Crunch, and Courtney grabbed Mini Wheats. We sat at the table and ate our breakfast. \"So where we at?\" I asked. \"Baltimore.\" Britt said. \"What are we gonna do today?\" Kate asked. \"Um the conference of course then I was thinkin we could come back to the RV and be lazy!\" Britt said. \"Sounds like my kind of day!\" I said. She laughed. When we got done eatin we got ready. I went through all my clothes trying to find something to wear but I just couldn't decide. \"Brittany! Kate!\" I screamed. \"What?\" \"I need help!\" \"With what?\" Britt said comin around the corner. \"I don't know what to wear!\" \"Here let me look.\" She pushed me out of the way to look through my clothes. She found a tie dye shirt, blue jeans, and my blue vans. I went and put it on then looked in the mirror. Brittany walked up behind me. She was wearing a orange low cut shirt with blue jeans and black boots. \"Am I good or what?\" \"You're pretty good.\" She laughed. She pulled out her phone and pointed it at the mirror. \"Make a funny pose.\" I put my hand on my waist and stuck my tongue out and she linked her arm with mine and stuck her tongue out and took the picture. She posted it on instagram. \"Yeah, I know we're hot. #sorryboyswearetaken hanna_leigh23\" \"Thats a very creative caption.\" I said. \"Thank you.\" She said laughing. \"Hey look Anna Kendrick commented on that picture.\" \"Really?! What did she say?\" \"She said 'yes by me #sorryboys ;)\" I screamed on the inside. Brittany could tell I was gettin excited. \"Gettin excited?\" \"Little bit!\" I said. She laughed. \"Where's Kate? I haven't seen her in awhile.\" I asked. \"I don't know.\" \"We should probably find her.\" \"Good idea.\" We walked around the RV and found Kate dressed wearing a white shirt with a pink tank top, blue jeans, and her pink vans. She was playin Rummy with Courtney who was wearing a grey polo, blue jeans, and sperries. \"Who's winning?\" I asked sitting beside Kate. \"Me of course. I'm the Rummy Queen!\" I laughed. The game lasted a few more minutes until Kate finally ran out of cards before Courtney. \"What was your score Court?\" Kate asked. \"65\" Kate smiled. \"I beat you SUCKA! I got 126\" \"Dang it!\" \"I told you I was the Rummy Queen!\" Just then Kate got up and started doin the wobble. I was holding my stomach laughin at her. That dance brought back so many memories. She finally quit and Britt did our hair. She put both of ours in a side braid. Then she did our make up of course. \"As soon as I get home I'm not gonna be wearin make up anymore. I hope you know that.\" I said. \"Why not?! You look gorgeous!\" Britt said. \"Thank but I told you I'm not the make up kind of person!\" \"I'm gonna make you!\" \"And how exactly?\" \"Ill text you everyday and tell you to until you do.\" \"How will you know when I do?\" \"I have my ways.\" \"Ok now I'm scared.\" She laughed. \"You're gonna come and visit us all the time right?\" Kate asked. \"Of course! I couldn't stay away from my 2 favorite 14 and 13 year olds for a long time.\" She said hugging us. We laughed. \"Just wait till I'm 14 then well be your favorite 14 year olds!\" I said. \"That's right!\" She said. \"You girls ready to go?\" Courtney asked from the kitchen. \"Yes are you?\" Britt yelled back. \"Yes now let's to before we are late!\" \"Coming!\" We walked off the RV and went to where the conference was being held. Me and Kate stayed back stage that time. Brittany and Courtney were great as usual but this time they took questions from the audience. The first person to ask a question was a girl who looked about 17. \"What are some ways to help a friend who gets bullied?\" \"That's a good question. But you could stand by their side when a bully comes to bully them or tell an adult or just be their friend. Hear them out and don't let them do something that they will regret\" Brittany said. \"Thank you.\" The girl said. Brittany smiled. A few more questions were answered then the last question. That person was a boy who looked about 15. \"What has been the most moving thing about the tour?\" \"Um that's tough. The kids at Sandy Hook were amazing and the fact we are helpin so many people with stuff like this but I think Courtney will agree with me that Hanna and Kate have affected both of us in more ways than one.\" Courtney nodded. We smiled. Brittany looked at us and we blew kisses to her. She laughed. \"Where they at?!\" Somebody yelled from the audience. \"They are backstage.\" Courtney said. \"BRING THEM OUT!\" Everyone chanted. \"Hanna, Kate you heard them. Get your butts out here.\" We walked onto stage beside Brittany. Everyone clapped and whistled. We just laughed. \"Anybody have any questions for these 2?\" A bunch of hands went up. Brittany picked a girl who looked about 14. \"What's it like to be on tour with Brittany and Courtney?\" Kate took the microphone away from Courtney and I took it away from Brittany. \"It's amazing!\" Kate said. I nodded. \"It's like a once in a lifetime experience and they are like our older siblings.\" Kate nodded. \"Couldn't of asked for 2 better people to do this with!\" Brittany and Courtney smiled. \"Awww!\" Brittany said hugging us. Britt picked another person from the audience. It was a boy who looked like he was in his early 20s. \"How did you 2 end up on tour with them?\" \"Um it's a long story.\" I said. \"Come onnn!\" People were yelling. \"Fine aright well I was gettin on Brittany's nerves tellin her to come to my school and I guess it worked because she came and said I could come on tour with them if I left her alone for the rest of our lives and they invited Kate to keep my mouth shut.\" Everyone laughed. Brittany took the microphone away from me. \"That is so not what happened! I went to their school because they recently lost their principal and a fellow student and Hanna was the one who was tweeting me and stuff like that about it and their new principal helped me surprise Hanna by makin her go on a wild goose chase then I asked her to go because I'm just that nice.\" She said winking. I rolled my eyes. \"And then Hanna invited Kate to go too.\" Everyone clapped. \"One more question.\" Britt said. She picked a girl who was a little younger than 10. \"Have any of y'all been bullied?\" \"Well people have made fun of me in the past but they never really bothered me.\" I said. \"I have been called a few names but not enough to bring me down.\" Kate said. \"We've gotten through it together and the interviews of Brittany about Love is louder helped us.\" I added. Brittany smiled. \"That's it guys. Thank you for coming! Let's give a Hand to these 2 great girls!\" Courtney said. Everyone clapped. \"Let's give a hand to these 2 amazing people!\" I said pointing at Britt and Court. Everyone clapped and whistled. Then me and Kate walked off stage. Brittany and Courtney said their good byes then followed us. Me and Kate were talking about what had just happened and we were surprised we didn't throw up or pass out. We were talkin so we didn't see or hear Brittany came up behind us and gave us a bear hug. \"What was that about?\" I asked. \"You girls are the best!\" \"Thank you!\" I said \"We know.\" Kate said. We laughed. \"You girls ready to go?\" Court asked. We nodded. \"Alright let's go back to the RV!\" We walked out of the building a bunch of people ran up to Britt and Court askin for autographs and pictures. All you could see was flashes from camera and phones. Then we heard someone yell, \"Hanna Kate get closer to Brittany and Courtney!\" We did as we were told. There was more flashes. It was blinding me. Brittany put her arm around me and Kate and Courtney did the same to Britt. \"Aww one big happy family!\" Somebody yelled. We laughed and smiled. Then a security guard came and pushed us through a crowd. We started walkin towards the RV. \"Wait right here I got to go get some stuff.\" Brittany said walkin towards a store. She put on her sunglasses and hood and walked in. She came out with 2 bags. I couldn't tell what it was. \"What did you get?\" Kate asked. \"It's a surprise!\" \"You know we hate surprises!\" I said. \"Exactly!\" She said winking. Kate rolled her eyes. \"Let's go!\" Courtney said. We obeyed and walked back to the RV. When we got there Brittany grabbed some clothes out of her closet and went to the bathroom. She took the bag with her. \"She's hiding something.\" Court said. We nodded. We sat Down on the couch and waited for he to come out. She came out five minutes later in a completely different outfit. She was wearin some fuzzy black pajama pants with different color polka dots on them and a yellow sponge bob shirt. We laughed at her. \"What's so funny?\" \"Oh nothing.\" Courtney said laughing. She crossed her arms. \"Brittany? Why are you dressed like that?\" I asked. \"I thought it was cute!\" \"And it is!\" She smiled. \"Glad you think so because I got all of you things that match it!\" \"Yay!\" Kate said. She got her bag and threw the clothes to us. I had the same pants but a pink shirt with Patrick on it. Kate had the same pants but a brown sandy shirt. And Courtney got blue plaid pants with a red mr krabs shirt. We all got changed. Me Kate and Britt pulled our hair up in a messy bun and sat on the couch with Courtney. It went Courtney, Britt, me, then Kate. \"So what are we gonna do?\" I asked. Britt got up and got the other bag. She pulled out 2 different movies. She had Pitch Perfect and Hansel and Gretel. \"Movie time!\" \"You got like my favorite movies!\" I screamed. She laughed. \"What do you want to watch first?\" She asked. \"Pitch perfect!\" Me and Kate both said at the same time. \"Jinx!\" \"Double jinx! \"Triple jinx!\" Brittany rolled her eyes. \"I think y'all need a break from each other.\" \"Naa\" I said. We laughed. \"Ok pitch perfect it is!\" She put it in and sat back on the couch. \"You're amazing in this movie by the way!\" Kate said. I nodded. \"You were our favorite Bella from the start!\" I said. She smiled. \"Thanks girls!\" Then the movie started. Me and Kate were laughin and quoting everything and singin along. Brittany just watched us and laughed. Courtney on the other hand looked bored. When it was time for the finals me and Kate jumped up and started dancin to the Trebles. Brittany and Courtney both laughed. When the Bellas came on stage we made Britt do the actual dance with us. We didn't know the whole thing so she taught us. We were laughin the whole time. I saw Courtney through the corner of my eye laughin and actually tryin to dance but quit before he could get caught. When the movie was over Britt got a call and had to step out of the room. \"So Courtney what do you want to watch?\" \"I was actually wantin to watch one of my movies is that ok?\" \"Of course what movie?\" I said. \"Hansel and Gretel.\" \"Yay! I love that movie!\" Kate said. He put it in and we waited for Britt to come back before we started it. When she did it looked like she had been crying. \"What's wrong Britt?\" I asked. We got up and walked over to her. She started cryin again. Me and Kate hugged her. She hugged back. \"What's wrong Brittany?\" Kate asked again. She pointed toward her laptop on the counter. We went and looked. It was an article about all of us. The title was \"One big happy family.\" So Brittany wasn't cryin because she was sad she was cryin because she was happy. We read more of the article. It said stuff about the tour and how they were helpin people with bullying problems and what happened at our school. It was really touching. Me and Kate started tearing up too. We walked back over to Britt. We hugged her and cried in her shoulder. Courtney saw it and hugged us all. \"We are really one big happy family.\" Brittany said. We nodded. We pulled away from the hug and sat back on the couch. \"So what are we watchin now?\" Britt said wipin her tears. \"Hansel and Gretel!\" Court said gettin excited. She laughed. \"Ok great put it in court!\" He put it in then sat back down. Throughout out the movie, being the big chicken I am, I would cling on to Britt or Kate or both. Every time I did they would laugh at me. When it was over it was around 7. We decided we had time for one more movie. \"What's it gonna be?\" Kate got up and looked through the movies. I got up and helped her. \"How about this one?\" She asked pickin up Parent Trap. \"Perfect.\" I said. We got up and she put it in. \"What did y'all pick?\" Britt asked. \"It's a surprise!\" I said winking at her. She laughed. We sat back down. It went court, Britt, me, and Kate. When the movie was almost over Kate fell asleep with her legs on my lap and her head on the foot of the couch. Then I fell asleep on Brittany's shoulder. They didn't bother to wake us up. Brittany just fell asleep laying her head on mine and Courtney went to bed. ","Summary":" Meeting Brittany Snow scenario (Love is louder tour) I'm in first period. I'm talkin to my friends "},{"Movie":"Battle: Los Angeles","Title":"Summer Invasion","Author":"Marine69","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7104130","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Hello any one kind enough to read this story. This is my first fanfic, really anything I've ever written, so don't flame and yell at me for being a terrible writer. Harsh reviews are welcome however so that I am able to improve my writing skills, none of the soft plushy stuff that everyone asks for. Anyways this is what happens after the aliens first invaded the east coast of the U.S. Rated M for lots of shooting, killing, cursing, and possible sexual references, not sure yet. Here we go I didn't think that this was going to be the way to spend the summer. Well, the shooting stuff was right but the getting shot at by aliens, almost getting run over by cars, and being picked up by a National Guard unit was not number one on the priority list for me. I'm Robert by the way, Robert McGrew. Brown hair, blue/green eyes, tall, and fairly strong. I was supposed to go to a rifle range with my thirteen year old brother Christian and my friend Sean Collier on Long Island. My new .306 was gonna be a beauty! Unfortunately, on the car ride there, a bunch of meteor, uhhh…. space ship things? Whatever you want to call them, fell from the sky into Long Island sound. Even better, my friend Sean, who's 18 by the way, needed to go and take a piss so he pulled the car over to a beach shack and we had to wait for him to go to the bathroom while these things are falling out of the sky! Now I know your saying 'Hey shouldn't you be listening to the news, there's an evacuation going on!' Well in my defense, I'm a teenager, who the fuck wants to listen to the news when you can go around shooting targets. So, as me and my brother are waiting, were watching the things crash into the water and are making bets on how many boats get destroyed ( I lost count at around 12). Then some god forsaken noise comes out of nowhere and the water begins to bubble. \"Oh shit\" my brother says, \"What should we do?\" \"Guns?\" was the only thing I could think of. \"Shotty the Zoli!\" \"I want the rifle.\" So me and my brother grab our respective weapons, he, a Antonio Zoli under-over double barrel 12-gauge, and me, A bolt-action Remington 770 with standard Bushnell scope and .308 ammunition. For those of you who don't know how big the .308 is, picture the world war two guns like the M1 Garand and then look at the bullets, that about the same as my bullets now. Sean, the idiot, finally comes out of the bathroom saying \"YO! What's with the guns?\" That's when about a platoon's worth of aliens start coming out of the water. I tell him to grab the spare Benelli M4 Shotgun and me and my bro take a defensive position behind the shack. Me on my stomach setting up the bipod for the rifle and my bro crouching behind me with the shotgun, he had goose loads loaded and in his shooting pouch so he was set. I however forgot to grab the ammo, ya I know, in an idiot. \"Sean Grab the 30-cal ammo!\" \"Got it!\" He runs back to our position with the two backpacks of ammo, one he gives to my brother and they both put them on their backs. My bro gives me a bullet as he starts to load a magazine and I look up. We can now see the aliens very clearly. A large dark grey creature with long legs and wide flat head turned towards us. I loaded a single shot into my rifle, closed the bolt, took aim and fired directly into its head, where the slit that looks like its eyes were. \"Kill,\" I proclaimed as a loaded an entire magazine into my rifle. \"FIRE AGAIN!\" screamed Sean; he was covering the other side of the shack protecting our flanks. I looked up and saw that the alien raised its arm at us. \"No way, I'm engaging now!\" As I said this I worked the bolt of my rifle expending the shell and loading my magazine into the receiver. Closing the bolt I took aim. 'Head shots don't count so let's take out your organs.' Before I could take the shot, the alien opened fire with a Gatling gun. I'm guessing it was around a 20 mm because it started punching craters into the ground and the wall beside me. I flinched, resighted and fired, bringing the bastard down. \"Oorah! How you like me now you fuckin chode!\" That was the second biggest mistake of my life, the first being not listening to the radio. My showboating caused the rest of the aliens to look at our pathetic excuse for a military position. Then a missile flew at us. I screamed 'bail', jumped and rolled to the left and ran to the car. The shack exploded knocking us to our feet. I screamed as piece of shrapnel hit my leg. Sean, getting up started the car while my bro helped me up and loaded me into the trunk of the SUV. \"GO SEAN GO!\" My brother screamed as he jumped into the passenger seat. I put my rifle down and took out a SOCOM 2 rifle, the civilian version of course, and loaded a magazine of the 7.62 mm ammunition. I then aimed down my ITECH reflex sight and started to open up on the enemy, dropping one more, from the moving vehicle. I loaded another mag and saw that we were away from the action. \"Sean, get us to the national guard base, the one near funzone.\" \"Don't you think you need a hospital Rob?\" \"If there following a simple invasion plan they'd have hit the hospitals and other public centers. National Guard can give us some guns and we can move to the city and try and link up with the real military, you know how to drive a stick?\" My brother and friend looked back at me, flabbergasted looks on their faces as I explained what I thought was a simple plan. \"Just get there, well need to 'commandeer' a Humvee, hopefully it's got a .50.\" I said as we quickly made our way inland, away from the shore.

Thank you New-Classic22 and IAmTheStars for submitting your characters, both of which will be used in my story. If you really like the story, please leave a review and if you can, also submit a character. Thank you and here's the next chapter. Well now, funzone did not seem so fun after being blown to bits. The carnival rides were now obliterated, one of them was now even inside of the main building. To my groups dismay, there were many dead bodies surrounding the amusement park, both alien and human. Neither man woman or child was spared, all had bullet wounds and none of them were alive. There was only thing on my mind now; revenge. \"Sean, keep moving to the national guard base, its right behind the parking lot,\" I said as I finished up nursing the wound on my leg. \"Hey, Rob, do you think the National Guard could have held out?\" My brother was in a current state of shock and I didn't want to scare him. \"Hell ya, how else would those alien bastards have died, our boys held 'em off.\" Said Sean as we rounded the corner into the National Guard base. It was not in that much of a better condition than funzone was, but there was human life. There was a single MH-53 Pave Low helicopter with the Marines insignia on the tail, hovering over a single M2A2 Bradley IFV. A crew of Marine personnel was securing hooks onto the vehicle to prepare it for flight. Sean pulled up to an out posts with two marines manning an M2 Browning machine gun. \"Hey, what happened here?\" he said while gesturing towards the dead alien bodies surrounding a blown-up barracks. \"What the fuck does it look like? We got invaded. If you want to live grab what gear you need and jump into the Bradley, were going to respond to a Naval distress call on the south shore.\" His uniform was shredded and blood stained his fatigues. His large burly form however seemed able to take and dish out one hell of a beating. Seeing the man talking to us was a gunnery sergeant by the name of Rogers, I said \"Sir, can we have some better weapons, all we got is a couple of shotguns, a bolt-action rifle and a single-fire version of the M14.\" \"Why, do you expect us to let a kid like you fight?\" stated the second marine, a short stout Lance Corporal by the name of Fredrick. By looking at his face, I could tell he was running on fumes, his black face seemed to be drawn of its natural dark color, leaving him looking pale. \"Wasn't asking for your permission, I already killed two and I'm ready to kill a hundred more.\" The two marines looked at each other before Rogers said \"Talk to Colonel Wilkins over by the chopper, leave the car here but bring what weapons you want, and don't talk like that to either of us again, you hear me?\" \"Yes sir. Christian grab the Zoli, SOCOM and lots of ammo for it, Sean grab the Benelli and a lot of ammo.\" As I said this, I began to grab ammo for my 770 and shove it into my backpack. I also grabbed the rifle, otherwise the ammo would have been useless. Duh. As we walked over to where the Helicopter was, me with a slight limp, I easily spotted out the Colonel, he was the one yelling orders to the Pave Low pilot about loading the Bradley. As we got closer, the Marines finished loading the Bradley and began arming the weapons on it. The Colonel appeared to be in his mid-forties and had grey hair with the usual Jarhead cut. He had several scars on his forehead and had dry blood on the back of his neck. \"Colonel Wilkins? We need some weapons and combat gear.\" I said. He looked at the three of us with an observant eye and asked my brother in a Brooklyn accent, \"How old are you son?\" \"Thirteen sir.\" \"Are you able to use that rifle?\" \"Yes Sir!\" \"Then welcome to the Marine Corp, we need as many guns as we can get. M16's are under the tarp, ammo's on the shelves opposite the gun racks. Combat Gears next inside the compound.\" He turned back to yelling orders at the pilots. We all yelled \"OORAH!\" before moving to the tarp to load up on weapons. I and Sean both grabbed an M16A4 assault rifle, his with a fore grip and mine with an M203 grenade launcher. \"Hey we should probably get the gear on before grabbing ammo,\" stated Sean. \"Ya, you're probably right.\" I said placing down the magazine I was loading. We moved to the compound and started to search for the gear. \"HOLY SHIT!\" yelled my brother as we heard a loud gurgling sound. I ran over to where Christian was and I saw an injured alien. \"HEY! We need someone over here!\" Yelled Sean as he stepped outside to get some more Marines. A Private walked over to us and said; \"what, you can't even get dre- Whoa! Colonel! We got a live one!\" The Colonel began running over to us with a Navy Corpsman right behind him. \"Shit, well I guess we need to see what kills it. Jackson you and Private Hideyoshi do an autopsy. You kids quickly get ready and then load into the Bradley, were low on time. Get it done Marines.\" We complied and got our gear, a MICH helmet and body armor as well as some extra Magazine holsters. We then got our ammo and we each grabbed a side arm. I was reaching for an M9 but saw a small crate underneath the rack. I opened it and saw a Colt M1911 pistol. I grabbed it and loaded all eighty rounds into ten magazines then moved out. I had about a hundred rounds for my 770 in my back pack, five thirty round magazines of 5.56 NATO ammunition for my M16 and ten grenades for the under barrel launcher. My brother and Sean then followed me into the Bradley. \" You three will be dropping last, were going into a hot combat zone, so be ready, get low and kill everything not human, got it?\" the gunner of the 25mm cannon said to us. He seemed to be a bad ass lieutenant because he had a number representing the amount of enemies he's killed, 43. \"Got it.\" We simultaneously responded. \"Good\" he said. As he turned back to the gun controls the rest of the squad filed into the Bradley or the Pave Low. \"Jackson says to aim right of the heart. Its where there most vulnerable\" said the Asian private as he sat down in his seat. \"You heard him Marines, right of the heart,\" said Wilkins, \"aim to kill, Oorah?\" The entire squad yelled \"OORAH!\" in response. \"Out-Fuckin-Standing Marines! Let's go get some!\" We all yelled our agreement as we felt the Pave Low begin to take off. We were going to war, and I was ready to kill some bastard aliens with the Marine Corp. Oorah. A/N: Sorry about not having any gunfights or action but I promise there will be a huge battle scene next chapter. I am also sorry about not putting any OC's in yet but one of them will join the story next chapter. If you can see the foreshadowing and you've read the reviews, you'll know who. Anyways see you in a week and please leave some reviews and more characters thanks.[Chapter 3] \" Were coming over the LZ now. Get ready it looks hot down there.\" As the radio transmission from the MH-53 pilot ended, all of the Marines got into their respective positions. Lance Corporal Fredrick and Private Hideyoshi were going to be the first out, followed by Gunnery Sergeant Rogers and Corpsman Jackson then Sean and my brother were behind them. I was acting as a marksman and was leaving the Bradley last. The Driver, Sergeant Patrick Falci, along with the Colonel and Lieutenant Coleman were remaining in the IFV to provide vehicle support and commands. The Pave Low was to remain at the landing zone and pick up whatever wounded navy personnel and civilians that were there. Jackson and Frederick were going to load the chopper and protect the landing zone while a fire team consisting of Rogers, Hideyoshi, Sean, my brother and I, were to assist the two combatants that were holding what was left of the naval base. The Bradley was going to flank around the left side of the compound to suppress the alien infantry that had set up an artillery position. \"Ten seconds to drop off, get tactical marines!\" As this was said every Marine loaded a magazine and flipped the safeties on their rifles to the off position. I waited what was the longest ten seconds of my life; the only sound was the muffled whooping of the helicopters rotors through the steel armor of the Bradley. Everything else was quiet and not knowing what could be on the other side of that door when we landed sent shivers down my spine. I sucked it up as we landed. \"Go, Go, Go, give em hell marines!\" As the Colonel shouted this, the hydraulic doors at the back opened up and we all rushed out. We were met with an alien flanking force that was trying to hit the combatants inside the naval compound. Jackson and Hideyoshi dropped to their knees and opened up on the hostile fire team, knocking two down to the ground, a small explosion erupting from their chests as they hit the cement. The other two blindly fired on us. Christian quickly exited the Bradley and aimed down the sights of his SOCOM 2 and dropped another with one shot, he then quickly aimed at the other and killed it with two pulls of the trigger. \"I'm tied with you now Robert!\" \"Shut up and move into the building.\" As I said this our fire team sprinted to the rear entrance of the compound. We heard gun reports from the inside so we stacked up with Sean in front with his shotgun, not normal procedure but it was probably the best gun for the job. As he rushed in he screamed, notifying the friendlies, if any, that they had support. \"US marines! US Marines! Is there any one in here? \"Ya! Quickly up here near the armory!\" The voice that responded seemed familiar. We quickly rushed up into the hallway next to the armory where we saw two people firing their rifles at the enemy. I quickly jumped between the two and took out my 770. I balanced my rifle on the sand bags that they set up and took aim at an enemy trying to get shot from the left. Since he was moving fast I quickly aimed slightly ahead of him, held my breath then fired, killing the invader. As I worked the bolt I looked back towards the rest of my team and saw Sean and Christian carrying a wounded man in a Navy uniform. Rogers and Hideyoshi then lead two civilians outside to the chopper. I turned my attention to the two combatants fighting beside me. The first one to my right was a girl that looked a little older than me, in a Navy outfit. The second one was my neighbor and best friend Matt Greenholtz. Both of which were firing down range at an advancing group of enemies. \"Matt, is that you?\" I said as I aimed at another target and fired, killing the alien where he stood. \"Rob? What are you doing here?\" \"I'm here with some Marines, Sean and my brot-\"I was cut off as an artillery shell landed in the armory behind us, destroying all the munitions stored there. The shock wave threw the three of us down and forced us to duck down, attempting to make smaller targets of ourselves. \"Shit, where's that Bradley? You two stay here and wait for the rest of my team, I'm going up stairs to get a better angle.\" \"Got it, try and take out the aliens operating those guns\" said the girl whose name I did not know. I then proceeded to fall back to where the stairs were, climbed them and took a position forward and to the right of where I was previously, giving me an angle on their exposed flank. I looked around and saw an enemy taking aim with its arm at position. I worked the action on my bolt, took aim and fired, dropping the enemy. I continued this process three more times, killing them with one shot each until I had to reload the magazine. I quickly pulled five rounds out of my pouch and loaded them into the magazine, slapped it into the receiver and cocked the bolt. I balanced my rifle again on the window but saw an alien aiming a rocket at me. I quickly jumped away from the window as the rocket was fired. It hit the wall and exploded, causing me to be blown away from the wall, hitting my head against a desk. I groaned in pain, feeling a dull throbbing in my head. Despite my pain I got up, and headed to a window that was closer to the staircase. I looked down my sights and saw that they were not aligned correctly, I cursed and switched to my M16. I looked down the ACOG Mk2 sights and began firing on more enemies using the single fire mode on my weapon. While in the process of firing on the enemies I saw our Bradley pull out from behind the building, guns blazing. Its .50 Cal and 25 mm cannon began to tear apart the enemy infantry. \"Rob come on, were getting out of here, chopper took the wounded and civvies away so were meeting the Bradley out back.\" Sean had come up behind me without me noticing. We quickly ran to the landing zone where everyone was already securing a pick up point. I looked up and saw the Pave Low about 500 yards away and flying quickly. \"Incoming!\" I looked up and saw two odd looking ships flying in the direction of the helicopter, they had multiple engines and their fronts were glowing orange. The ships then fired a salvo of missiles from their fronts, hitting the Pave Low and causing it to explode in midair. \"When did they get air? Fuck!\" Rogers began yelling and cursing obscenely. The two hostile aircraft then came around for a second pass on us. At that moment however, the Bradley came around again and fired on one of the craft with its cannon and machine gun while simultaneously targeting the other with its TOW launcher. A firestorm of lead erupted from the Bradley quickly downing the alien jets. The Navy chick and my friend Matt went over to the rubble of the craft and inspected the crash. \"It's not piloted, it must be a drone.\" The two then returned and we all quickly piled into the Bradley. We pulled out of the naval base while shooting at what was left of the enemy infantry. \"Since those bastards took out our air, were going to have to use the urbanized areas to move as close to New York city as quickly as possible, then we'll try to reestablish communications with the rest of our military.\" The Colonel looked distraught over losing those civilians and the soldiers under his command. But, he still continued to move ahead in his orders to make sure he didn't lose any one else. \"Who are you two, what happened?\" \"I'm Matt Greenholtz, I'm a civilian but I wouldn't just sit by while these assholes were shooting at us.\" Matt was shorter than me about 5 foot 9 with shaved blonde hair and a fairly well-built body, he was wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans. \"I'm Leading Seaman Frankie Gordon, I was the recruit leader at the base before we got attacked.\" \"You were in charge of the recruits? How old are you?\" asked Rogers, skeptical of her rank and position. \"I'm seventeen but I'm very capable of leading a group and fighting, I was also the best marksman on base and ranked in the top ten in my hand-to-hand combat class.\" Gordon responded, obviously pissed off that someone was challenging her abilities. She stood at about 5 foot 4 and had what seemed to be an incredibly fit body. She has naturally tanned skin and has deep dark brown hair cut into a side fringe with a blonde streak inside of it. She looked like she could handle herself. \"We were doing our usual morning routines at the base when the reports of meteors began coming in. Most of the base was mobilized into the ocean, that's where they were expected to land. The recruits and a couple of the senior instructors were to remain at the base. \"Nothing happened for a couple of hours but then we started to receive maydays from ships and reports of extraterrestrials began coming in from what was left of our ships. I was listening to the radio reports with my senior officer when we heard explosions and gunfire outside. That's when the battle started, Matt here came in with a few civilians, and he guided them here to safety.\" \"I didn't know there was going to be an attack on the base, but me and one other civilian grabbed guns and helped make a stand. We tried our best but we lost so many guys, it took an entire clip to kill the things until we figured out that they were weak on their right side, but by then, we only had four combatants left. You guys showed up ten minutes later and saved our asses, thanks.\" \"Damn, they got our Navy too? What else do you think they've taken out Colonel?\" Private Hideyoshi said nervously. \"I don't know Jeff, we'll have to meet up with command first, let's head into town and see if we can save anymore civilians, we don't leave anyone behind, oorah?\" We all stated our agreements. \"Good, well move for as long as possible before we have to make camp and look for fuel. Great work out there Marines. And you civilians, you truly can fight were glad to have you aboard, you too Seaman.\" Simultaneously Frankie, Matt and I said \"Thank you sir.\" He nodded then turned to the driver, \"Falci, get us moving.\" The Bradley lurched forward, beginning its long trek towards the city. I turned to Gordon and Matt, \"You guys were holding that position amazingly. How did you do it?\" \"Rob, you know I'm a great shot, and Miss Gordon here is also an expert marksman.\" \"You weren't too bad yourself, Robert was it?\" \"Ya, Is it alright if I call you Frankie?\" \"Just call me Crash, everyone does.\" A/N: There's the end of the third chapter, with the big battle scene. Hope you guys liked it, please review and submit characters if you haven't already. Also, I have a poll in my profile about what vehicles you would like to see in my story. You can choose up to three choices. See you guys in about a week or so.[Chapter 4] Looking at the New York City skyline used to be an awesome sight, skyscrapers and bridges lined the island of Manhattan, showing the world that New York truly is the Empire State. However, that was in the past, before the aliens invaded. Now, the skyline was reduced to raging flames and destroyed buildings that were turned to rubble. As the Colonel and I reconned the Manhattan Bridge, I saw that the Empire State Building was no longer standing, the Chrysler Building had large holes in the side, presumably from the alien jets and their missiles. The everlasting glow of the skyscrapers lights at night was now replaced by the fires that littered the streets, buildings, and the occasional bridge. The only bridge that was still standing was the Manhattan Bridge. Unfortunately, It was being used as a logistics lane for the enemy. Looking through my sniper scope, I saw that they had some new vehicles, a type of hovercraft. The vehicles seemed to be comprised of a light metal, it was very open and the crew was extremely exposed. There was a driver, two gunners and I guess what must have been a crew chief or co-pilot. \"Colonel, can you use the NV's and see what kind of weapons those vehicles have? I count two machine guns but I can't tell if there's anything else.\" \"There is, it appears that they have mortar tubes, that or smoke grenades, like that on the Abrams. Those are going to be tough to get past, even with the TOW.\" He was right, the entrance was heavily guarded and there were even more troops on the bridge itself moving supplies, about a platoons worth of infantry was supported with four of those vehicles, two on each end. I had a plan however; if I could convince Wilkins then we might be able to push through without much of a problem. \"Sir, I've got an idea. Look to the right, there's a small ridge over there that we could position marksman at, there we could take out as many infantry as possible. That would throw them into confusion and force them into cover. After that we would have the Bradley take out the two vehicles with its TOW launcher, fire a volley with the 25, and then pull out to reload the TOW. That's when we would push forward with our infantry, taking out the main personnel on guard while sending a couple of men on the left walk bridge to flank the enemy. The Bradley would then have to cover from the entrance of the bridge while the infantry moved forward clearing the bridge. The snipers would constantly be giving support. When the other two vehicles attempt to engage, the Bradley will take them out with the TOW again. \"After we would wipe out the rest of the enemy infantry and we would have to quickly head for the urban environment, where we will be safe from enemy air. Will that work?\" \"Yes, that will, but the only adjustment is that the snipers will have to aim for the enemy officers there those big ones that are floating around. Otherwise it's excellent, we may lose men though.\" \"It's the only way sir, we can't get across any other way, the Brooklyn and Triboro bridges are down and the Queensboro has at least a battalions worth of men, this Is the most practical approach, unless were gonna swim.\" \"So be it, let's get back to the camp and get started. We only have six hours until sun up.\" \"Yes sir,\" as I said this, I lifted my rifle and we ran back to base, about a mile away. We got back to base in about fifteen minutes, stopping every once in a while to make sure that there was no hostile activity. We got back to camp which was really just a gas station with a big garage. The Bradley was in the garage with Hideyoshi and Sean on guard M16's at the ready. \"Friendlies coming up, don't shoot.\" I yelled as we moved towards the building. We entered the garage, I gave both of the guards a fist pound before heading into the main building where many of the marines were stocking up on food and water. \"Listen up! We got a plan on how we can get over to the city. Tell them.\" At the last part he nodded at me. I told them the plan using M&M;'s as a way to signify positions on my make shift diorama of the Manhattan Bridge. Matt and Frankie would be on sniper duty, Matt would be getting my 770 while Frankie would be using my brothers SOCOM 2 rifle, and we added an ACOG sight onto it for longer range combat. Rogers and I would be the flanking force, taking the walk bridge to hit the enemy in the side. We would both have M16A4's and we would also have the two shotguns in case they jumped onto our bridge and CQC ensued. Falci, Coleman, Wilkins and Sean would be manning the Bradley, Sean was acting as an extra gunner since the lieutenant needed to focus on the TOW launcher. That left my brother, Hideyoshi, Jackson, and Frederick as the main assaulting infantry force. They would all be armed with M16A4's. \"Alright, this is what we have to do to get over to the city and later the rest of the military. We may lose men in the assault but no man left behind, dead or alive. We will prevail and we will kill the enemy, they will be sorry they ever thought to invade Earth, they will be sorry that they thought to invade my beloved country. Most importantly however, they will be sorry that they ever came into the same fuckin universe as the United States Marines! They will witness what we are capable of, you don't fuck with the marines, Oorah?\" Everyone screamed their approval, even Gordon and my friend Matt who was in favor of the Navy. We fell out and got into our respective positions, Jackson informed Sean and Hideyoshi of the plan since they were on guard. That's when we all moved towards the bridge, the Bradley close behind us. We were now ready to stage the assault, Frankie and Matt were in position and the Bradley was hiding behind a building ready to attack at any minute. The rest of us were lying on our stomachs, waiting for my command to move. Even though I was a fourteen year old kid, the Colonel wanted me to take charge since it was my plan, and the fact that he'd seen my capabilities in combat had proven my competence. \"Crash, on my command, unleash hell,\" I spoke into the built in helmet radio. I couldn't resist using the Gladiator reference there. \"Ready up Marines, were going in a couple of minutes. I was waiting for the officers to come out of their, uh, headquarters I guess. It was just a large box made out of some kind of tightly weaved fibers. I needed to make sure Frankie and Matt had clear shots on the enemy, otherwise we would get mowed down, not great for my first command. \" Rob, Matt here, we have visual on the commanders, should we engage?\" \"Do you to have a clear shot?\" \" Affirmative, Crash says the same. Should we proceed?\" As I listened to the radio transmissions, I realized that everyone here was counting on me and my decision, a kid's decision whose only experience of command was in strategy games. I was nervous, but I was also confident in the fact that we would be able to annihilate the enemy. \"Waste em,\" I whispered into the mike. At that moment, we heard the cracks of gunfire and saw two officers drop dead, then four, destroying their command. In their confusion, the invaders did not take cover but simply looked around for the shooters. Our marksman then proceeded to take out the enemy infantry dropping rounds down range into them until their magazines were empty. \" Fifteen confirmed kills, repositioning to a new location, send in the M2.\" Frankie's voice crackled through the radio as we saw them moving. I heeded her order and radioed the Colonel Wilkins to move up with the Bradley. I knew it was almost time for our advance as the Cummins 8-cylinder diesel engine powering the IFV started up and powered the Bradley forward from behind the building. The dual TOW launcher on the Bradley's turret opened up while the driver made a drive by pushing the engine to its limits and forcing the treads to carry the vehicle at 40 mph. The two missiles hit their targets, destroying the hovercrafts in a fiery explosion of plasma. The Bradley then opened up with its .50 cal and 25mm, mowing down enemy infantry and causing explosions where there happened to be enemy cargo and munitions storages. \" Enemy vehicles are down, move it kid!\" Coleman's report spurred me into gear. \"MOVE MARINES! Kill 'em all! Rogers with me!\" As the Bradley retreated our team moved forward. Rogers and I moved to the left where the walk bridge was located and killed three enemies that were about to take aim. The rest of the team took cover and opened up on the enemy, dropping several more. The enemy then sent reinforcements, the ones handling the cargo transport now got into the fight. I kept running down the path as more alien chain gun fire opened up above me. I loaded a new magazine into my rifle and looked to my right where some aliens were setting up a mortar position. I opened up on them, killing three while two more returned fire. I jumped back and fell down. Rogers then came up and finished them off. Me and the Gunnery Sergeant leaned against the catwalk and opened up on the enemies exposed flank, killing some, three or four, and forcing the rest out of their cover, exposing them to the rest of the fire team. \" Snipers are back were engaging,\" Crash's voice made me look back to the entrance where I could see Matt and Frankie opening up on the enemy. \"Rogers keep moving, we gotta get ahead of the next enemy strongpoint!\" I shook Rogers out of a bloodlust that he seemed to be in, he was yelling obscenities at the enemy and had gone through three magazines already. I pushed him forward and we kept moving, running to flank them. Unfortunately the enemy learned that we were advancing on their flanks, three of the aliens jumped down in front of me, about 20 feet ahead of us. We instinctively dropped to our stomachs and engaged. I dropped one but the others got behind some debris that was on the walk way. All of a sudden, while one stood up to get a shot off, it recoiled and fell off the bridge. I quickly rushed up while pulling out my Benneli and jumping over the cover and the alien and shot four 12 gauge goose loads into the alien at pointblank range, cutting it into pieces. \" Guardian angel at your service,\" \"Thanks Matt I owe you one.\" I kept moving ahead with Rogers close behind. We got to an enemy strongpoint and we repeated what we did before, attacking the enemy on their exposed flanks. All of a sudden however, I heard a blood curdling scream through the radio. \"Man down! Man down! Jackson get over here! Fredericks hit!\" I was relieved that my brother wasn't hit but I was angry that they hit one of my brothers in arms. \"Falci, bring the Bradley around, the enemy hovercraft are coming across. Quick they move fast!\" Rogers screamed into the mike as the hover craft moved towards the main fire team. I heard the 25mm cannon open up on the enemy infantry while also hearing the TOW fly toward the hovercraft, killing them both. This time however, the Bradley stayed and continued to suppress the enemy, killing the hostiles. We quickly finished up and killed off the remaining infantry. \"Colonel, how'd we do?\" I said into the radio. \"You did great son, but Frederick, he's paralyzed, his spinal cord was hit, we saved him but he won't be able to walk anymore.\" I was in disbelief, my actions led to a man getting hit in combat, changing his life drastically for the rest of his life. \"O.K. sir, were coming up now, let's load up on the Bradley and get into the city before air comes.\" Our engagement lasted seven minutes, we killed over fifty enemies and had one man severely wounded. We loaded onto the Bradley and moved into the city, brushing past the cars and dead enemies on the bridge. As we headed into the city, I heard a whoosh and a popping sound as several enemy fighters rushed overhead and destroyed the bridge, burying their own dead under the water and rubble of the bridge. \"What do we do now sir?\" asked Coleman, he was scratching additional \"kills\" into his helmet, now up to 67. \"Now we look for civilians, and we kill as many alien bastards as possible while moving towards the mainland.\" A/N: Well that's the next chapter, please read and review, I plan on using everyone's character at one point or another so don't worry your characters will be used if you have submitted them. Thank you and see ya next time.[Chapter 5] A/N: I'm back with a new chapter for the story. I really have to thank everyone who has submitted a character and reviewed, the OC's will mainly come in this chapter. I also have to thank DarkNinja24k for letting me use his name for the aliens. I recommend his story Counter Attack also. Also, New-Classic22's story for Battle: LA, The Art of War, is also very good and I recommend that as well. Any ways, here's the next chapter. Disclaimer: I don't own anything involving Battle: LA, only my characters, any refrence to a mainstream item on a market I also don't own. The streets and buildings of New York were much worse than they did when we were observing the city before our assault. Bodies littered the ground, many of them dismembered. The side buildings of Manhattan were either obliterated or had so much debris in them it was inaccessible. In one case there was an SUV launched through a window of a Mexican restaurant. Everything was destroyed, the signs of war escaping nothing, not even the civilian populace. The worst and most disturbing thing we saw, was that the aliens must have executed some civilians for there were bodies lined up, each of them with a large hole where there face would have been. The incendiary bullets they used burned through the flesh, utterly destroying the man, woman or child's identity. They were re-enacting the horrors of world war two when the Japanese invaded Nanjing. Everything was ravaged. So that was what we called them, the Ravagers, not a Latin name as the other species on earth were classified, but they weren't from Earth, and we weren't scientists, we were soldiers. I stepped over another civilians body, trying to hug the wall of what remained of a skyscraper. Rogers and I moved forward of the Bradley to make sure that the way was cleared. We would also check the bodies that weren't completely eviscerated for a pulse. We had no luck so far. \"Rogers, I'm going to go check out that last building, and then we should be ok for the Bradley.\" I said, gesturing towards a bank on the corner of a street. It had a large hole in the side of it on our side of the street. \"Roger, I'll follow as soon as you get in, well clear the building then check for survivors.\" I nodded and pulled myself into the building. I was greeted with a smack to the face of some sort of object, what kind didn't matter, it hurt, a lot. I fell back out of the hole and hit the concrete, falling on a piece of metal that scratched my leg. I could hear Rogers screaming that everything was okay and to not shoot, followed by other voices I didn't recognize. I sat up groaning and rubbing my forehead, my vision was blurry but I could see other humans surrounding me, making sure I was alright. When my vision cleared I could see three figures on the ground in front of me, one was Rogers, the other two were two young women. The first woman was obviously military, she was wearing a helicopter pilot's uniform and was holding an M9 Beretta pistol. She had short, regulation cut strawberry blonde hair and green eyes. Although the flight suit hid her body's physique, I assumed that she was fit since she had a patch on her outfit signaling she was an AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopter pilot. The second one looked to be around eighteen or nineteen years of age with lightly tanned skin with black hair tied up in a pony tail. She had green eyes and stood at around five foot two or five foot three and possessed what appeared to be a fairly fit body and wore a tank top and blue jeans. I was assuming she was the one that hit me since she was holding a large piece of plywood in her right arm. She was stronger than she appeared. \"Well, that certainly was a warm greeting for a fellow human,\" I said standing to my feet and dusting myself off. \"Sorry but you could have been an alien, we were trying to protect ourselves and the other civilians inside,\" the gunship pilot said. \"I'm Selena Valentine by the way, I'm a Chief Warrant Officer for the Army's air wing.\" She said introducing herself and shaking first Rogers then my hands. \"Gunnery Sergeant Tim Rogers, United States Marine Corps, and this is Robert Mcgrew, he's a civilian but he can fight very well, we gave him a rank of private to make it safe.\" \"Nice to meet you,\" I said, \"and who would you be?\" I asked gesturing towards my former attacker, she seemed… off, and she didn't talk or introduce herself. It seemed like she wanted to stay scarce and stand off to side. \"I'm Robin Alexander, sorry about the bump, but you're a tough guy, you can walk it off.\" She said with a smirk. I smiled back and we shook hands. \"You said you had other civilians? Where are they?\" Rogers said, looking around. \"We're right here, happy that you guys made it to help.\" The voice came from the large hole, standing there were three people. The first, the one who talked, was your stereotypical surfer dude, shaggy sandy blonde hair, tan skin and blue eyes, this guy must have walked out of a movie. He had a muscley build and stood at about six foot three, about my height. He was also carrying a Glock 21. He obviously didn't know how to use it because the slide was open and there was no magazine inserted. The next one was a black man that stood at around five foot nine. He had black hair and hazel eyes and didn't seem all that fit or strong. The most eye-grabbing feature of this man was that his right arm was amputated from the elbow down, leaving a long stub-like appendage. He was standing behind the surfer dude and had a sheepish look on his face, suggesting he was afraid. Standing behind him and clutching onto his leg was a very young girl, no older than three or four. She looked almost exactly like her dad but her hair was longer and her eyes were an abnormal shade of green. \"Daddy, are they here to stop the monsters?\" The young girl asked, looking to her father for assurance that she would be okay. \"Don't worry Abby, these men are here to help and keep us safe.\" The father said, leaning down to stroke his daughters face with his good arm. \"Gunny, what the hell is taking you two so long! Did you find a corner to jack off in or-\" Rogers quickly shut off the radio and walked away to answer Lieutenant Colemans transmission. I heard him say that we had civilians and that we needed a pick up. The buzz of Coleman's response came shortly after and I saw the veteran soldier scowl. \" Coleman says that the Bradley is full, Frederick is taking up to much space, so we need to find an alternate form of transportation for the civvies'. Coleman can take three civilians, Frankie is willing to help us out here and one of you can take her spot in the IFV.\" \"Hi, I'm Ferdinand Carter, I won't be able to do much out here, so can me and my daughter Abigail here go into your tank thing? I can navigate the streets easily so I might be able to help you guys get around quicker.\" The amputee picked up his daughter in one arm and moved towards Rogers as he spoke. \"Alright, you two can go in the Bradley.\" Rogers said. He then looked between the remaining two civilians and seemed to be weighing the difference between the two in his head. \"You,\" he said, pointing towards Robin, \"You're going in the Bradley.\" \"Fuck you, what makes you think I'll listen to you?\" she said, glaring at the Gunnery Sergeant. Rogers didn't seem to be good at questioning peoples abilities, the same thing happened with Gordon yesterday. \"Just go, trust me you won't want to be exposed in the open, plus you will most likely be called upon to fight sooner or later, we are down a soldier.\" I said, \"Plus you're not in the best clothing to be going around shooting at the moment. It would be beneficial to all of us if you got your ass in the vehicle.\" I said, staring her down, she obviously did not like taking orders, especially the person she just recently wacked in the head. As I finished my sentence, the Bradley came around the corner and pulled up next to us, its doors opening to allow the Carter's in. \"How considerate of you to put we civilians before yourself. You might just be my knight in shining armor.\" She said, sarcasm very heavy in her voice as she walked to the Bradley doors and got in. She was immediately replaced by Crash, our previously only female companion. I gave her a high-five as she walked over to us and she handed rifles to Selena and the surfer dude who had not introduced himself yet. As Crash handed him his rifle, he must have took an immediate liking to her because he got a big cocky grin on his face. Frankie raised her eyebrows and shoved a couple of magazines into his arms, saying, \"I hope you know how to use it.\" \"Well couldn't you teach me? I'm a very fast learner, and we could get to know each other better. I'll start, I'm Angelo DiAntonio, and you are?\" Oh, so he was Italian. \"I'm Frankie Gordon, just call me Crash though.\" \"Will do Crash\" he said smiling. I rolled my eyes and hit him over the head with my hand. \"Hey, stop ogling, you'll get yourself shot, pay attention to her and load your rifle.\" \"OW! Was that necessary?\" he said rubbing his head. \"No, but you can consider it a gift from Robin to me, which I simply passed on to you.\" \"Will you cut it out Mickey? We have to move, Carter said that he saw an abandoned Humvee few blocks north, Infantry is taking point while everyone else is in the vehicle, you ready?\" I really hated that nickname, he didn't even grab one for my first name he had to go for my last name. \"Ya, who do you want on lead?\" I asked, checking my rifle to make sure it was okay. He looked at Angelo and Crash and their pathetic excuse for a \"lesson,\" they seemed to be getting nowhere. He once again scowled then shifted his gaze towards Valentine who was expertly loading her M16 and checking to make sure the sights were adapted to her eyes. I guess he made up his mind. \"I want you and Army girl on point, let the two idiots take middle and I'll take the rear.\" \"Oorah,\" I said in confirmation, \"hey, Selena, were going to take point.\" I looked down at her adjusting the zoom setting on her ACOG sight and said \"I guess you know how to use that?\" She looked up and said quietly, \"My father used to take me hunting, I got real good at maintain his guns.\" She looked down her sights one more time and, being satisfied, stood up. \"Ready?\" she asked, I nodded and I gestured to the Bradley that we were moving out. We then began creeping up along the deserted streets of New York, moving up in a staggered two by two movement. I would run up while the rest of the fire team would cover me, then Selena would sprint quickly to where I was and get behind me, we would secure the area while the rest of the group would fall in behind us. This process repeated until we reached the Humveee that Carter had pointed out. The Humvee was turned on its side but aside from that seemed absolutely fine. \"Fuckin Ravagers must have shot a concussive weapon, blew it on its side.\" I said, examining the black scorch marks on the side of the vehicle. \"Ravagers?\" Selena asked, raising her eyebrows. \"Ya, that's we call 'em, look at what they did.\" I said gesturing around the street at all the dead bodies and destroyed cars. I was also looking for a way to upright the vehicle but to no avail. \"Good name for them,\" she said looking around, she then looked back at me as I began looking in the back of the Humvee for a jack we could use. \"Um, why don't we just use the winch on the front bar and use that to flip it? Would that work?\" She asked shyly, not sure why, she was the older Army officer. \"Good idea, now you made me look like an idiot, get on the controls inside, I'll tie it to those construction poles over there,\" I proceeded to grab the hook on the winch and brought it to where the belly of the Humvee was facing. I then secured the hook to a construction scaffold and gave the thumbs up. Selena activated the winch and the Humvee began to turn upwards. That's when I realized that the poles that it was tied to started to bend. I ran away from there as the scaffolding collapsed on top of the winch. The Humvee was flipped but a loud noise was generated by the collapse. \"Awww crap,\" I said as two of the Ravager aliens came around the corner ahead of us, about fifty yards away. They turned the way they came from and pointed towards us and we heard some faint clicking noises from where they were. I shoulder my rifle and took aim at one, pulled the trigger twice and dropped it to the ground. I was going to aim at the other but it was already dead, Valentine had shot it. \"My dad also taught me how to shoot good.\" She said slyly. The rest of the infantry rushed up to us and piled into the Humvee, Rogers got on the M2 Browning machine gun and loaded the current belt. DiAntonio got into the driver seat and Frankie the passenger. Three more aliens came around the corner and Rogers lit them up with the Fifty Cal, mowing them down. I grabbed Selena's hand and pulled her towards the Humvee but Angelo pulled away to get it turned around. I cursed then pulled both of us down as a rocket soared past us. Selena landed on top of me and I pushed her off. I then began to return fire at the oncoming enemy presence. Which had grew to over thirty infantry units in under twenty seconds. Also, there appeared to be some kind of mech that the aliens had brought to the playing field. It was a bipedal machine that had a single operator and two crew men next to it. \"That's the thing that took out my chopper!\" Selena screamed, \"We have to move NOW!\" She pulled me up and we ran to the Humvee where the back was open and Rogers was opening up on the enemy. All of a sudden, however I hear a loud humming and then a large bang. Next thing I know I'm flying through the air into Rogers as he gets knocked down by my body. He groans go and Selena jumps in at the last minute as we move towards where the Bradley had begun opening fire on the enemy positions. I was lowered into the Humvee cabin as we followed the Bradley out of the combat zone. I opened my eyes and was flipped onto my side where I could see Selena leaning over me treating what appeared to be a severe wound on my left shoulder. I guess I was in shock because I blacked out. Next thing I know its night time, we're out of the city and I can see a bridge burning and falling into a river. I try to lie on my back but when I land I feel immense pain and instinctively sit up. I look to my left where Angelo, my brother and Selena are looking to see if I'm okay. \"Sorry about pulling out before you guys could get in, I didn't know you were coming and I was panicking.\" Angelo said, sincere concern in his voice, \"No problem, it's just a flesh wound, and we're still alive so that's all that matters. Although don't you think this was a little overkill for payback when I hit you in the head?\" I smiled and he chuckled, \"glad to see that you really can't keep a Marine down.\" He said walking away towards where Gordon, Matt and Robin were sitting. I looked at my brother and said, \"So, how was hiding in the IFV? You can't do much in there you idiot.\" I said, sharing an inside joke from when we got the game Homefront last year. \"Shut up, you know I'm a priority threat.\" He said walking away towards Sean who was looking at the Humvee's suspension. I turned towards Selena and said \"Thank you for helping me out back there,\" I gestured towards the burning city. \"I could not have made it had you not told me to run. Also, thank you for your handiwork here.\" I said, pointing to the bandaging that surrounded my left shoulder. \"Not a problem, I had to learn how to do that medical stuff in survival school when I said I wanted to become a pilot.\" \"So, how long were you in the army before you became an officer and started flying?\" I said curious to know more. \"I joined the army's air wing as a technical student where I worked on the mechanics and engineering of several different helicopters. That's where I fell in love with the Apache. I joined officer training school and was quickly promoted to a Chief Warrant Officer when they realized they liked my flying skills.\" \"Well, I'm glad we have you here to help us out, were gonna need as much talent as possible and you've got plenty of it. Now let me sleep.\" She smiled then walked away towards some other part of the camp. I smiled in my sleep, thankful that I was alive as well as thankful for the new friends I made. I must've been on a morphine high because I was very droopy and fell asleep immediately. A/N: That's that, anyways I got everyone's character who has so far submitted one. If you are reading the story, please leave a review and leave a character submission if you'd like. See ya next time.[Chapter 6] A/N: Once again thank you for the reviews, I'm glad you all like the way I'm portraying your OC's. I was reading over my story so far and I noticed that there were some grammar problems and at some points had some misplaced modifiers. Because of this, I would like to have a Beta reader so if any of you would like to proof read my chapters before I put them up, please PM me. Thank you and here's the next chapter. Disclaimer: I don't own anything but the story and the original characters, but they are in turn owned by the people who have submitted them. General George S. Patton had a firm belief in the theory of quantity over quality. He also was very enthusiastic in the art of armored warfare, learning from his nemesis Erwin Rommel, a German tank commander during World War two. Had he seen the accomplishments that the United States had made in the development of our M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, he would have said; 'What took you so long?' The tank is the future of warfare, it can dominate a battlefield. Our current enemies had not adapted to the armored warfare tactics that through recent years, the United States had mastered. A lack of mechanized vehicles also gave us an advantage. So far, only a small hovercraft dubbed the 'slider' and the bipedal mech that many call the 'walking gun' based on its crude design, has been the support vehicles of the infantry-based enemy. This is where Patton would have had a field day. Looking through my bore sighted 9X40 scope on my Remington 770, I spotted an abandoned Abrams tank near a deserted outpost that had become overwhelmed. The Tank seemed to be in fairly good condition but its track was blown off and its main turret had scorch and blast marks on the sloped armor. The effective chobham armor had been able to deflect the incoming rounds from the alien's guns. After leaving New York, our group attempted to regroup at the defensive positions on a map that we found in the Humvee. So far, out of the twelve FOB's that we had visited, there had been no survivors. Traveling from the southeastern corner of New York to Albany where the last perimeter was set up, the rest of the forces had been put in Boston where another large invasion was taking place. Apparently these invasions were occurring all over the world, targeting mass population centers and areas where little military presence was seen. Beijing and Shanghai in China, Berlin in Germany, Le Havre in France and Tokyo in Japan, had all been hit and there inferior militaries were not sustaining as well as we were in the U.S. Now, I was on a scout mission with the Humvee that we had picked up, searching for enemies and possibly a better vehicle than the Humvee, it was very open and had already taken severe damage in the city and the suspension was nearly shot. My partner, Private Hideyoshi, was in the Humvee, keeping the engine warm in case we needed to make a quick escape. I switched on my mike and radioed to an all channel frequency that the enemy could not track. The new frequency was being adapted by our military everywhere as we had learned at former bases. It was a low frequency radio that snuck under the radar of the enemy drone 'colonies' as they hovered above our heads. \"Colonel, McGrew here, I've spotted an Abrams that looks like it can run. Its track is hit but nothing we can't repair.\" \"Roger, go check it out to make sure, we'll rendezvous with you two momentarily, we're almost done refueling the Bradley.\" I confirmed Wilkins command then told the Japanese private that we were moving out. I looked down my sights one more time and saw some movement of some shadows near the far side of the tank. \"Hold it Eryu, we got movement,\" I said sighting over the unknown contact. I kept looking before I saw a flash towards the opposite end of the tank. Quickly looking to the left, I saw a human in military fatigues pointing a sniper rifle towards me. \"You're dead buddy, come on down, I'm on your side. I need help repairing this tank, not familiar with the Abrams, We use the Leopard.\" The voice had a Canadian accent, not a heavy one, but noticeable. \"Coming down,\" I said, frowning that I had fallen for the simple trick. \"Eryu, lets head down there, there's a friendly that were gonna meet, he seems like spec-ops personnel.\" \"Oh great, probably some Delta boy that went lone-wolf.\" He responded, kind of nervous that we were going to come face to face with an unidentified person. \"Not Delta,\" I said, climbing into the passenger seat of the Humvee, \"He had a Canadian accent, might be part of their spec-ops.\" We drove the 300 yards to where the Abrams lay and where an obviously well-trained military man stood, holding an M4A1 with M203 grenade launcher. As we stopped I noticed that he also had an Accuracy International Arctic Warfare .338 Lapua Magnum sniper strapped to his back, as well as a Glock 17 in a side holster and a 4\" combat knife in a holster on his chest. He was also wearing a MICH Special Forces helmet. This guy was loaded for bear, actually, more like rhinoceros. He took off his helmet exposing a brownish-blonde military-style hair cut. Standing at about six feet, he looked around his mid-twenties. He had intense green eyes that intimidated even me. A lot of people seemed to have green eyes in our group, strange. He also had a strong jaw with a small amount of stubble around his chin and mouth. He actually was Canadian; he had a uniform that designated him as part of the Canadian Spec Ops Group. I knew them to specialize in arctic and forest warfare. I also knew they had some great snipers, some of the best in the world. Although that didn't explain why he was here in Albany, New York. \"Hey, if your Canadian why are down here?\" I asked, checking to take a look at the Abrams, it was so cool up close. \"I was doing some training maneuvers with the 10th Mountain Brigade at Fort Drum, my company and your forces were all wiped out, they sent the drones in and knocked them out. I'm the last one. I made my way here because I heard there was a tank. Do you know how to fix this?\" He asked gesturing towards the broken track on the right side of the tank. \"Names Travis Lawrence by the way, I'm a Lieutenant.\" \"We might be able to but we need our Bradley to get here first we'll wait a little bit before they ge-\"Hideyoshi was cut off by the rumble of the M2 Bradley, the standard support vehicle of the Abrams, perfect. The vehicle came to a stop and the rear doors opened up. Warrant Officer Valentine and my friend Matt stepped out of the IFV. They each stepped out with their rifles ready to fire on Travis. \"Don't worry, he's okay. Do we have any repair kits in the Bradley? There's some back up tracks and suspension wheels on the tank already but we need a power wrench and a hand welder,\" I said as the two lowered their weapons. Matt went around back and grabbed a repair kit from the crew compartment and brought it over. Inside was a small battery powered wrench with several different socket sizes. There was also a small propane welder with an additional next to it. \" Okay, this might take a while but we can get it done, I want the new suspension wheels on the tank and then the new track patches have to be connected together,\" The Canadian Lieutenant stated, \" then we have to replace the armor on the side of the track. There's some extra ammo inside those supply crates in there, you two get them out and load them into the Bradley.\" He said gesturing towards me and Hideyoshi. \"The others will help me get the repairs started. Where's your CO? I need to talk to him.\" I pointed towards the Bradley and he walked towards the side of the vehicle where the Colonel opened a side hatch. \"Sir, I need you to have your men set up a defensive position while we get these repairs going. Have the Bradley move towards those supply crates so we can load up some extra ammo and gas.\" The Colonel nodded and barked orders to the personnel inside the Bradley. A second later, every combatant left in the vehicle stepped out. They then formed defensive positions on the machine gun mounts that were left behind in the Army's retreat. The Bradley then pulled up to where Eryu and I had lifted up a large crate containing ten 120mm SABOT Anti-Tank shells. We loaded four of these crates, some containing SAOT rounds and some containing HE anti infantry shells. Upon finishing loading the shells into the compartment behind and next to the driver and crew, Robin Alexander approached me as Hideyoshi went to help with the repairs. She was now wearing Fredericks old combat jacket, dried blood still stained the lower area of the protective wear. \"I feel useless just sitting here, teach me how to use one of those guns.\" She said pointing to the M16 I had strapped around my back. I said okay and went outside with her. I handed her the rifle and began to teach her how to hold and use the rifle. \"First things first,\" I said handing her the magazine I had released from the rifle, \"in order to load your rifle you have to make sure that the bullets are far enough up that the receiver will accept the bullets.\" I demonstrated this by bumping the bottom of the mag on my helmet a couple of times. \"Next, you load the rifle by slamming the mag into the little hole here bullets up and the outer curve facing towards you.\" She followed the steps well but did not slide the mag far enough into the receiver, not making the clicking sound. \"Hit the bottom of the mag, it didn't go in all the way,\" I said pointing to the bottom of the gun. \"After that you want to pull that tab at the back of the ACOG sights, the one that has two little stubs sticking out the side.\" She followed and loaded a single shot into the rifle. \"No your locked and loaded, now look here,\" I said walking up to here and grabbing the rifle, showing her the fire mode switch. \"This here identifies whether the rifle is in safe mode, meaning it can't shoot, single fire or full auto. We're gonna start you off on single fire so you can get accustomed to the recoil. Now, hold the rifle tight to your soldier, bringing the sights to your eye, not your eye to the sight, its more accurate.\" As I said this, I mimicked what I would have done had I possessed a gun. \"Okay, but when can I shoot it? I want to get in this fight, my life's not getting any better.\" She said this with a somewhat sad look in her eyes. \"What's wrong? Did something happen?\" I asked sympathetically, wondering why she acted gloomy all of a sudden. She must have realized what she was doing because she quickly grew a determined look on her face and looked like she was in disbelief. \"What do you think happened? Aliens invaded, duh! Jeez, I thought you were smart to have survived, guess not.\" I looked at her with one eyebrow raised. Was she really expecting me to believe that bullshit? She kept up her demeanor for a few more seconds before she let out a heavy sigh and resumed her sad expression. \"Okay fine, it's something that happened a while ago and I'm just thinking of now. It's not important, don't worry about it.\" She said turning away. Feeling sorry for her I walked up to her and put a hand on her shoulder. \"Hey, if there's something bugging you, you can tell me, we're all in this together,\" I said, waving my hand towards the rest of our group. \"If it would make you feel better, you can tell me, I'll try to help.\" I said, giving her what I hoped was a reassuring look. \"All right, when I was young my mom died when I when my younger sister was born, and my father died shortly after when I was six, leaving me with my bitch of a step mom Lucy. She treated me like shit but praised my younger sister Jeanine. Eventually I got so tired of her and I decided to run away. I wanted to bring my younger sister with me because I loved her, she was family after all, but I didn't think she could survive on the streets, she was eight and I was fourteen. I've been living as an urchin stealing and fighting for food and money. I haven't seen my sister since and I was wondering if she made it out of the city alive.\" Throughout her story she seemed to grow more and more depressed but when she finished her last sentence, she broke into tears. I blushed and put an arm around her, saying it was okay and that her sister probably did make it out alive. \"Hey, if she's anything like you she probably hit anything that stood in her way with a piece of plywood. She's strong, just like you, and the only way that you're going to see her again is for you to survive. She already did her part now it's your turn.\" I said helping her up. She hugged me and said thank you. At that moment, Frankie came around the corner of the Bradley with Sean and said that the M1 was up and running. Upon looking at us she froze and then smiled, Sean did the same. \"Sorry to be interrupting, but we have to get moving, otherwise we'll be tracked by the ravagers, so if you two are done, Roberts needed in the tank.\" Me and Robin quickly separated, Blush's apparent on both of our faces. Sean just stood there chuckling and I threw my helmet at him. He dodged it and went back inside the Bradley with Crash. \"Alright I guess we have to go,\" I said turning towards Robin, \"I'll see you when we stop for camp.\" \"Robert, thanks for talking to me, I had to let that off my chest, no one else would listen,\" \"Hey, whether you like it or not, being able to use that rifle has made you one of my brothers in arms, your part of a whole new family, we support each other.\" I said picking up my helmet and walking away, waving as I did so. As I neared the Abrams, I started to strap on my helmet but Travis stopped me, he waved his finger and gave me a tankers cap, the one with the earmuffs on the side, guess the gun was really loud. I followed him into the M1 where Matt was already sitting at the gunners controls. \"Hey Rob, this is just like the video game huh skeetsie?\" he said, sharing an inside joke from a game that we played. I smiled and was about to head to the loaders station but was stopped by Gunny Rogers who had jumped in, apparently Lawrence was driving. \"Colonel wants you to be in command, he thinks that since you had the great plan for the bridge that you will do good for the tank as well. My, smile grew tenfold. I was now a tank commander, the only other thing I would have wanted more would have been to be a pilot but this was awesome. Rogers closed the hatch and set up the radio frequencies. We had17 Sabot rounds of ammunition and 20 of High Explosive. Damn, they must have bailed quick, they only got three shots off. \"Okay, lets test the turret ring. Gunner, traverse gun 360 degrees.\" I said, referring o matt who responded with \"Aye, gun turning.\" I timed the traverse speed for the gun and measured it at around 40 degrees per second. \"Good, Lieutenant take us out were heading west where the last line of defense that has been made according to the map, let's hope were not too late.\" We were traveling for about an hour or two, pushing the Abrams to its limit and bringing it to an incredible speed of sixty miles an hour, only possible due to the fact that Travis ripped out the governor, disabling a speed limit, we where now moving faster than the fastest tank in world war two the soviet made A-20. Unfortunately, there were no seats in the Abrams, and the war torn streets were battered with holes, making the ride very bumpy, Rogers accidentally pressed the transmit button on the radio as I was saying some derogatory things about the Russians T90. Mainly that it sucked, and a couple of other obscene words that Abigail Carter did not need to hear. \"McGrew! Be quiet will ya? Why are you even talking on this channel?\" Wilkins voice was pissed, and I was scared, the last thing you want is to have an angry war veteran pointing his displeasure at you, especially since he was a Marine. \"Sorry sir, were moving at ungoverned speeds and the vehicle is very bumpy, Rogers hit the transmit button at an inopportune time.\" I said, quickly covering my outburst while picking Rogers up off the floor. \"HMPH! Pull over here, were making a pit stop for gas, you were low on JP-8 anyways, we need to fill up on diesel.\" He said, referring to the JP-8 jet fuel that the Gas Turbine engines of the Abrams consumed. \"Aye sir, Travis, pull over here, we're making a gas break.\" He stopped the vehicle and I stepped out, since I was the commander, only I was allowed to get out and relax, according to combat doctrine. I laughed at Matt, got out and started to help Sean and Christian refill our gas tanks. After that was done, we were about to climb into our vehicles again when loud popping sounds were heard and bullets started flying past our heads, I jumped into the Abrams and closed the hatch as a mortar shot was fired from the aliens. \"HOLD! Rounds incoming!\" I screamed, warning everyone to brace. The mortar strikes struck near us, rocking the tank but not hurting us. \"Get moving private! Are you ready to move?\" The Colonel's voice was mingled with Coleman yelling attack orders for the driver. \"We are ready to rumble sir! Just give us a target!\" I said as Travis started up the engine. \"Get to the open field, we can engage them better there.\" I told Lawrence to move to the field and began yelling combat orders to the crew. With a similar pattern of commands following this pattern: \"HEAT!\" \"UP!\" \"LOCKED!\" \"SAFETY OFF!\" This process repeated with the loader telling when the round was loaded, me yelling that the shell was locked and ready to go, Matt flipping the safety off of his gun and stating that it was ready to fire and me finishing the command by yelling; \"FIRE!\" The High Explosive shell ripped through the air with a bang and a flash of fire from the barrel of the cannon. When the shell landed, a large explosion tore through the forest, ripping alien bodies to shreds while burning trees and revealing enemy positions. We fired three more before we made it to the open field, that's when the alien armor came up. Two 'sliders' came from the road we were previously on and began firing grenades and incendiary machineguns at us. This time I told Rogers to load a SABOT round to kill the enemy vehicle. \"Gunner, traverse gun thirty degrees and track target for a five twenty degree deflection shot.\" I heard the hydraulic turning of the turret as it quickly began to target the enemy hovercraft. Our loading sequence started again and another shell was launched, incinerating the craft in the flames that were released from the SABOT shell. The Aliens friend began to charge us, knowing it couldn't damage our armor enough in time with its gun so it tried to disable us by ramming the side of our tank. Similar to what the Soviets did to defeat the superior Tiger tanks in world war two. Knowing what the consequences would be if they managed to do that, I yelled for Travis to hit the gas. We propelled forward and Matt took control of the electronically powered .50 cal, decimating the vehicle with a quick thirty round burst. We gave a yell of cheer but it was short lived as a series of explosions rocked the front end of our tank. I yelled through the radio \"What the heck is going on outside?\" as my optics were down and were fizzing. \"It's a walking gun! Keep hittin em!\" Christian's voice came through the radio, I looked back through my optics and sure enough a walking gun was being loaded for another shot our frontal armor. 'Oh no you don't' I thought. \"Fire a sabot at that target!\" I yelled to Matt as Rogers loaded another round, \"On the way!\" The shell hit the mech, killing it and everything around it. Then, something that scared the shit out of me happened, the entire forest erupted with a terrible sound, then, a new kind of vehicle emerged. A quadrapedal mech that had two large machineguns in front with turret mounts on each of its shoulder joints on a crab like body. It opened up with its turrets, hitting our Abrams and forcing us to be knocked back by the sheer force. Travis began to pull out as shells began to pierce the armor, narrowly missing us and dropping dead to the floor, having lost all momentum. I quickly ordered Matt to fire and a shell ripped the mechs leg apart. It stumbled, causing a break in fire. However, it quickly regained balance and its leg was somehow boosted up by some form of rocket engine where some ground infantry began to repair it. Just as the guns began to glow again however, multiple missiles struck the mechs body, causing a blue green explosion to erupt from its center. I heard screams over the radio saying that it was our air. I opened the hatch and saw two A-10 Warthogs coming around for a strafing run on the forest where a large amount of enemies were retreating. Our celebration was short lived as a drone 'colony' came by and began to deploy fighters. One A-10 launched a Stiletto Air-to-Air short range missile. The blast killed one of the drones and another was knocked out by the other A10-'s missile strike. I yelled into the hatch for Matt to target the 'colony.' The gun started turning, then elevating until it had a direct line of fire with the drone group. \"FIRE!\" The shell raced through the air, causing a large explosion and taking down multiple of the drone ships, only two getting away, but they were chased down by the A-10's. \"Welcome back Devil Dogs, proceed East until you reach the FOB that we've established, we'll need every tank and soldier we can get for this counter attack, were not dead yet.\" As the last sentence of the A-10's transmission was spoken, three B-52 Stratofortress bombers flew overhead, where in the distance we could hear and feel the rumble of the powerful planes carpet bomb. That's why I want to be a pilot. A/N: sorry for the abrupt ending, but I was getting a little tired when writing the last bit. Thanks for reading and please tell me if any of you are interested in Beta Reading. See ya next time.[Chapter 7] A/N: sorry about not updating for a while, personal things came up and prohibited me from writing. I'd like to thank New-Classic22 and my friend Matt for offering to Beta for me, it is really appreciated. Anyways here's the next chapter. Also, I was going back over previous chapters and I realized that I never mentioned Robert or Matt's age. They are both seventeen in this story. Also every time you see a bunch of plusses, it just means that there's a time lapse or a break in the story. The upcoming assault was going to be big, loud and deadly. A lot of people were going to die but according to the \"higher ups,\" New York was a major city that we could not afford to lose. Besides being the world's financial capital, there was also a morale factor concerned with the city. The American people saw New York City as the city that never sleeps. After the counter attack, it will also be known as the city that never dies. The tank that we had come into the FOB in was severely damaged and was not safe to be brought back into battle. The Bradley was also hit very badly during the firefight, killing Private Eryu Hideyoshi and Corporal John Fredericks. Sergeant Falci was hit in the torso, leaving a large wound that looked similar to that of a white phosphorous injury. The loss of our squad mates hurt us deeply, though it took the greatest toll on Rogers and Coleman, both of whom had known them when they did their two tours in Iraq. They, along with everyone else, wanted payback. The FOB looked like it had experienced heavy fighting. There were many blood stains on the floor and large craters littered the forward defense line. The entrance was flanked by two posts boxed in by sand bags and each had an M240 LMG with two operators. There were also other defenses down the line surrounding a large area that stretched on for about a thousand yards on each side. Behind the entrance were several vehicles ready for cavalry duty, mainly Humvee's but the occasional Stryker or M3 Bradley were there as well. We apparently had the only M2 left. There were more sand bag fortifications here as well, although these were only manned by one man on a machinegun with several riflemen patrolling the vehicles. There were also a couple soldiers' with FIM-92 Stinger missile launchers. Many of the soldiers there were from multiple units, Marines, Army, National Guard, even a few Navy personnel were on guard duty. Farther back from the vehicle depot is what seemed to be a fire support center. This area had multiple forms of artillery, mortars, and anti-air systems. There were six 105mm howitzers shooting a mixture of High Explosive anti infantry artillery rounds and M712 Copperhead anti-tank missiles. There were also multiple M224 60mm mortar systems being operated by Marine and Army personnel. They were following instructions from a forward observer and were following commands from the senior mortar operator who stated the firing adjustments and giving commands to fire. \"Adjust three degrees, forward twenty yards then let it hang!\" \"Hang it!\" \"FIRE!\" This pattern repeated multiple times on each of the mortar stations until someone stated that rounds were complete. Behind the artillery and mortars were some anti-air placements, SAM platforms, Stinger stations and even a couple of old 40mm BOFOR's. Our rag-tag group walked towards a tent that Colonel Wilkins had led us to. There, a couple of men came over to escort the civilians to another part of the base. For some reason they thought our group were ALL civilians. \"You kids come with us, it's not safe for you to be fighting,\" one of them said grabbing my brothers' arm and attempting to pull him in another direction. \"Hold it Corporal; only the ones that don't want to fight have to go with you, everyone else is old enough to fight in the military.\" Rogers said, putting a hand on the soldiers shoulder. I told my brother he was done fighting, and that he had to go look for mom and dad. \"Fine,\" he said; angry that he couldn't help fight anymore, but also relieved that he was getting out of the danger zone. \"But any more aliens you kill will not count towards the final score, we're in time out.\" I smiled at him, and he smiled back at me. After this he joined the corporal and the private accompanying him. Ferdinand Carter turned to us, holding his daughter in his one good arm. \"Thank you all for what you've done, we couldn't have made it had it not been for you. Thanks for protecting me and my daughter.\" He also turned and joined the two soldiers and my brother. \"What about all of you? Aren't you all non-combatants?\" said the second soldier, an Army private. \"There's no such thing here today sir, were all fighting for our lives.\" Sean said, shifting his stance and his rifle. I looked towards the rest of our group, Frankie, Angelo, Matt, Robin and Sean were all nodding their approval, and we were all ready to fight. \"Whatever, you three come with us, Colonel, you're wanted in the debriefing room in the main building. The rest of you, go rest up, counter attack is in twenty four hours. They're not good at fighting in the dark, so that's when we hit the city. Words coming in from the Mojave Desert, apparently they found a way to disable the drones. The SEAL's are trying to find out where their CAC is.\" The corporal then took my brother and the Carters to another area, Abigail Carter waving to us over her father's shoulder. \"Rest up all of you, you've deserved it.\" The Colonel said, walking towards the debriefing room in a large concrete building. We in turn, headed towards a wreck area that some soldiers pointed out. It was really just a room with several soldiers sleeping on couches and chairs, but hey, a nice sofa beats standing up in an Abrams any day. \"Well, at least the people from my town hit them back, hope it's not too bad over there.\" Angelo said, dropping onto a couch that was unoccupied, Crash followed shortly after sitting next to him. \"You're from California?\" she asked stretching out and leaning her head back. \"Yep, came here on a scholarship for playing soccer at Cornell. I was in the city for an exhibition match with Kings College when we were attacked, I made it out of the Hotel where I was staying and eventually ran into these guys,\" referencing to the group we picked up at the bank. \"Lucky you,\" I said, plopping into a chair and closing my eyes, \"I'm gonna try and sleep, wake me when I'm needed.\" I felt a slap on my head and realized I didn't take of my tank cap yet. I opened my eyes and saw Robin grinning down at me. \"Is that your night cap? Looks good on you.\" She said chuckling slightly. I took it off and threw it at her, \"What's with you and hitting me in the head? It's like you're obsessed.\" I said once again closing my eyes. Feeling really tired now \"Is that a bad thing?\" I heard her say before drifting off to sleep. They found the Command and Control center on one of the barrier islands surrounding New York City. Apparently the Ravagers saw the need to place their base of operations on Liberty Island, next to where the Statue of Liberty lies. Apparently they were using the closeness to a body of water to funnel water into their ship, using that to fuel their vehicles. Word from Los Angeles said that they got lucky bringing it down, hitting it with an Anti-Tank missile in what was believed to be a munitions pit, causing explosions to rupture throughout the machine. The area that we were attacking made it more difficult to achieve our goal. The SEAL's that found the CAC, saw that there were really only two options, neither of them were preferable, but then again, nothing is in war. The first option was to simply order a major airstrike onto the island. The problem with that was that we were unsure whether or not our non-nuclear weapons would be effective enough to penetrate that far into the ground, plus, our Air Force might get knocked out of the sky before they even got there. Also, if an airstrike was ordered, a major landmark of our nation would be lost, the Statue of Liberty. Seeing the statue go down would be a morale loss for all Americans and possibly the rest of the world. If the greatest nation could not hold their own against the invaders, then what chance did the rest of the world have? The most definite way of taking out the CAC was a series of beach landings. The first would take place on Governors Island where a large amount of enemies had set up an aid station and a logistics point for their hover vehicles. Marines and Army would take them out with combined support from both branches Air Corps. Air Force was also going to aid us by sending in A-10 warthogs to either strafe enemy positions or provide anti air against the drone 'colonies' that our stingers couldn't shoot down. After securing Governors Island, Apache Gunships would soften up the ground forces stationed at Liberty Island, meanwhile, our troops would move across the water in landing craft to assault the island. The SEAL's also found out that they were using the elevators in the Statue of Liberty to move up and down from their control center to the surface. That's how we would enter the CAC, through the elevators and stairs that lead into the underground section of the Island. Once there, we would use French MATADOR anti-bunker missile systems to hit the weak point of their munitions pit. The additional breach charge on the MATADOR would allow the hit to ignite their munitions, taking down their air power. Then, we would have a chance of counter attacking and later helping out the other nations in need. The higher-up's decided to go with the beach landings, they wanted to make sure that we got the CAC. And my group was going to be with the first troops that were landing. We were going to support a few Abrams that were landing in a Navy LCAC hovercraft. From there we would secure Fort Jay, set up artillery positions, and then support the Abrams assault on the enemies, moving building to building. We were ready to kick some ass. For the past five minutes we were riding in the hovercraft with an Apache gunship hovering above us, escorting us to the designated landing zone. The helicopter was piloted by none other than Warrant Officer Valentine, she had been transferred to her old Air Corps and was escorting the craft that were assaulting the beach. Colonel Wilkins was designating the attack, observing from an out-of-battle perspective. Lieutenant Coleman and my friend Sean were part of the crew on one of the Abrams, Sean was apparently a great gunner for the Bradley so they gave him the role on a main battle tank. Lieutenant Lawrence was leading a squad of twenty, consisting of our group from the city and several other new soldiers whose units were wiped out in the attack. We were designated Survivor Squad. \"McGrew, You will be commanding fire team three, You, Greenholtz, Gordon, DiAntonio, and Alexander will sweep the Northern end of Fort Jay, the enemies Aid Station is located there and you are to breach the fort. Use whatever force is necessary to get inside, the Abrams and air will cover the outside. The rest of our group will be coming in the western end, causing crossfire to develop. The fort is only secure when every one of the Ravagers has been killed, got it?\" I looked at the map that Traverse was showing me as he explained the plan. It was simple enough but it could all go wrong in a minute, we might not even make it to the island, but, might as well hope for the best. We ditched our civilian weapons and were issued standard military ones. Seeing how the enemies were significantly stronger, one man on each fire team was issued an M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle. They would act as a marksman and would focus on one shot kills to the enemy instead of suppressive and concentrated fire. Matt was the marksman. Our squad was also fitted with two M249 Squad Automatic Weapons, or SAW's. Our team got one which was carried by Robin, who had received training on how to load and unjam the weapon at the military base.. \"Landing in three minutes people, stay low, aim true and we'll kill all of these Alien Bastards. Get to your Teams and get ready to-\" The Lieutenant was cut off as an alien mortar landed ten feet to the right of our craft, shaking the personnel on board and knocking some to their feet. \"GET READY!\" yelled our Gunnery Sergeant. As he said this, Rogers rallied his team to his departing zone on the craft. I followed his actions and moved my team to the correct area. As we arrived, another mortar fell from the sky, this time hitting one of the LCM-8 landing boats. The Craft erupted in flames and an explosion sent the soldiers on board and pieces of metal flying everywhere. Looking to my right I saw one of the crewmen operating a .50 cal machinegun get hit by a volley of the aliens incendiary bullets, igniting his clothes and leaving the man dead. Overhead, I saw Valentine and her gunner opening up with a volley of Hydra rockets, hopefully hitting some targets. She then moved the helicopter forward more where she continued to use all types of weapons to decimate the enemy. \"30 seconds! Get ready,\" Lawrence called as he cocked his M4. I got down behind the Abrams that we were supposed to follow to the Northern end while the rest of our group engaged the enemy at the main landing sight. When the doors dropped, the Abrams were met with a volley of rocket and machine gun fire. Most of the machine gun's bounced off of the sloped armor and the Explosive Reactive armor repelled the incoming rockets. The Abrams responded with a volley from their weapons systems, 120mm cannons, .50 cal machineguns and 7.62 mm coaxial machineguns opened up on the enemy positions. The Abrams began to move out and we followed ours to the extreme left where it continued to lay down suppressive fire with its weapons. We were following a little too closely because when ever its main gun fired, I heard a loud ringing noise that hurt my ears and sent a shiver down my spine. We rounded the north western end of the fort where a large open area was presented. \"Matt, Robin, Lay down fire while we move!\" I ordered to the two who jumped to their bellies and began opening fire on the enemy with support from the Abrams. Angelo, Frankie and I sprinted as fast as we could to a building that was overlooking the enemy's position. I was hoping to get a better shot on them while the other groups moved up on the other flanks. \"Frankie, breach the building,\" I said as we took cover behind the building. Frankie kicked open the door to find a surprised alien, standing eight feet tall and about to bring up his weapon. Crash fired fully automatic on the creature, tearing it apart and killing it. She stepped to the side to allow Angelo and me to move in while she reloaded. As I moved into the building I shot the alien one more time in its weak spot to make sure it was dead. Inside there was a living room that had a dining room adjoined into it. I looked left and saw a staircase leading to the second floor. I pointed it out to Angelo and he moved up, me following close behind while Gordon secured the ground floor. We moved up and saw to more aliens trying to shoot through windows in what appeared to be a bedroom. I dropped one with three shots while Angelo killed the other. He moved into the room and made sure it was clear. I began to look left when I saw one of the Ravagers moving towards me, and fast. It swung its biotic arm at my head and I ducked, dropping my M16. It then attempted to stomp on my face but I rolled to the right, pulling out my .45 and turning around to shoot it. As I turned, it shot a couple of rounds above my head, I fired the entire magazine into it, tearing it apart with the large bullet. I loaded a new magazine and picked up my rifle as Angelo came out of the room and Frankie stated that the ground floor was clear. We then checked the rest of the rooms which were empty. We then all began firing from windows that gave us good shots on the enemy positions. Combined with the fire from the Abrams, we were able to quickly neutralize the enemy infantry and their single support weapon, a 'walking gun.' My squad regrouped outside the Northern entrance to the fort, the Abrams had gone to support another area of the operation. \"You guys ready?\" I asked, looking at each one of my squad mates. They all nodded and I gave the order to stack up, I then radioed to Lieutenant Lawrence that we were ready. He confirmed and began a countdown from three to one, going on one. \"Three…two… one!\" At this Angelo and I burst in shooting at anything that wasn't human until our magazines were empty. On the opposite side, the rest of the squad were performing similar actions and began using grenade launchers to kill the enemies. My group moved up to the second story where we spotted more enemy, infantry, an officer class, and some new kind of alien that we hadn't seen before. It being new, however, did not mean I wouldn't shoot it. I raised my rifle and fired at its weak point, dropping it. The rest of the enemies were tightly packed on the elevated lane so when Robin opened up with the SAW, they quickly fell victim to the 5.56 mm bullets that tore through their bodies. I looked around and saw that the rest of the Fort was secure and people were already brining in some of the 60mm mortars that were packed in on the landing craft. As the rest of my squad went to go assist in the set up of mortars, Robin and I walked towards the new breed of Ravager. What we saw, was possibly something that showed that the aliens were not built completely for war. This 'class' seemed to stand at only about five foot ten and appeared to be chubbier than the other types. It was also unarmed, no biomechanical weapons attached to its arms. However, it did have what appeared to be a built-in HUD system on its head, where the visual receptor slit of the aliens usually was, was now a large panel that appeared to be a built in computer. It also had multiple instruments with gauges scattered along its arm. \"Lieutenant! There's a new kind of alien here and it looks like some kind of intelligence probe!\" I screamed to Travis who was directing the mortar fire. He gave command to Rogers and ran up to us. He looked down and reached for his radio to report back to Colonel Wilkins. As he turned it on, a gauge on the alien's body lit up and some form of words appeared on the display. \"That must be how they tracked our radio signals, these guys must be solely dependent on figuring stuff out.\" Robin said as she observed what the read-out was doing. \"Traverse, do you think that these things control the drones as well?\" I asked seeing one of the Abrams get blown up by a drone. As I said this, the alien shot its arm up and punched me in the chest, forcing me back. Traverse shot a burst into it killing it. At that moment, a drone 'colony' fell out of the sky, falling apart as it did so and sunk into the water. \"Guess so,\" he said reaching for his radio, \"listen up squad leaders, there's a new target of opportunity, a shorter version of the aliens controls some of the active drones and track our radios, and hit them if you can.\" As I looked up the aliens were now just starting to be finished off by our air and tanks. At that moment, our Apaches and a flight of A-10's and F-18's flew in to strafe the ground on Liberty Island. That was our queue to get back on the boats. We piled in with the three Abrams that were assigned. Apparently the Abrams that was lost didn't belong to our squad. Which was good. We had lost three men in the attack, and two more were wounded, one of them was Rogers who had a bullet wound on his right shoulder. People who I hadn't even know for more than four hours had simply died in a matter of minutes, although there was nothing I could do, I felt that I could have done something to save their lives. We loaded the LCAC and headed off towards Liberty Island while airborne troops deployed from helicopters secured the rest of Governors Island. Looking up, I saw a large air battle between our jets and helicopters and the alien drones. The furball grew in size as more and more drone 'colonies' joined the fight. Colonel Wilkins must have requested more air support because one of the two squadrons of F-22's that the United States posses joined the fight. They fired multiple AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles at the enemy drones, destroying multiple of the intended targets. They joined the furball, tearing up the skies with their advanced engines. However, the maneuverability of the enemy drones proved an even match for the F-22's and losses were heavy on both sides. Looking back down, I noticed that we were almost at the island and Traverse was already giving the thirty second warning. I checked my rifle and sidearm and made sure they were good to go. I looked up as the doors dropped, there weren't many enemies left from the air strikes and many of them were mopped up by the Abrams \"breach.\" Our squad, and others, rushed to the statue entrance, dodging strafing runs from the enemy aircraft as we neared the entrance. When we reached it, three soldiers from another squadron rushed into the building and found the entrance to the underground room. As the rest of us were about to move up, the three soldiers brought up the elevator. When the doors opened, five aliens were in there about to get out. The three soldiers opened fire and were soon joined by the rest of our assault team. The Ravagers were eviscerated by the onslaught of bullets and they fell to the floor. The large cargo elevator could hold twenty people at a time so we had to space out the people going down between four trips. My squad and five other troops were going in on the third trip. The first group, an Army squad led by a veteran Captain, descended into the ground. About a minute later, the elevator arrived back up at the main floor. The next group was a Marine squad led by a second lieutenant, they also went down. Another minute later, the doors opened again, this time, three wounded men were in the elevator, our squad moved in as an Army medic saw to the injured soldiers. The elevator ride took about twenty seconds, when the doors opened there was a dark hallway that had scorch marks and bloodstains on it, it was illuminated only by a small series of fluorescent lights, some of which had been shot and were sparking and crackling. A Marine from the second squad was waiting for us, he was wounded in the leg but not badly. \"Keep moving up, the rest of the team is already assaulting the CAC, they need your MATADOR's get moving!\" He screamed as he hopped onto the elevator. The two soldiers in our squad that carried the MATADOR's were a Sergeant from the Army and a corporal from the Marines. We moved into the corridors following the sound of machinegun fire and explosions. As we got deeper in, there were multiple electric nodes surrounded by puddles of water, they were sparking and seemed to follow wires into an area where we heard more shots from. We followed the wires and eventually came into a clearing where a monstrous machine stood supported by several beams made out of some kind of alloy. Before we could get a good look at it, it opened fire with what seemed to be a large caliber cannon. \"Get to cover!\" Rogers screamed as the shots began coming closer to us. We moved towards some sort of power warehouses that the Ravagers had constructed. They were about thirty five feet tall and surrounded the large structure. Behind each was a human or ravager squad, exchanging fire and the occasional missile or grenade. Most of our squad went left with the lieutenant but the two MATADORS's, Angelo, and Crash moved to the right with me. We moved behind the rectangular structure and began engaging enemy troops swarming out of the CAC. I told the MATADOR's to hit the notch above the suspension, where their machine guns and ammo pit was located. One got down on his knees on the right side of the structure and began to line up his shot but he was struck down by multiple cannon rounds. Frankie and I pulled him behind cover and checked for a pulse. Frankie looked up at me and stated he was dead by shaking her head. I cursed but saw the other MATADOR from the Marines get a shot off at the enemy CAC. At this time more troops from the other squad moved into the area and bypassed our area. I moved to the left to help out the corporal while Frankie picked up the MATADOR launcher and fired on the CAC. As she began to reload the launcher, a missile flew into the area of the structure that she was taking cover under. The building blew into large pieces of rubble. One of which began to fall onto Frankie. Seeing the impending danger, Angelo jumped to his feet and tackled Frankie out of the way of the large piece of rubble. A slab of concrete landed soundly on her right leg and a loud cracking sound was heard. She let out an agonized scream and fell into Angelo's tight hold. He then proceeded to drag her to the more secure structure. As he was dragging her to the warehouse, a round pierced his leg, causing him to falter and grit his teeth in pain but he continued to drag her to cover, dedicated to protecting the strong girl. Seeing that they were safe, I began to dig the missile launcher out of the rubble and grabbed the last salvageable piece of ammo. I began to load it when all of a sudden a loud metallic groaning noise was heard coming from the enemy ship. I looked at it, while it was being continually hit by MATADOR missiles, it began floating as its support beams were ejected from the base of the control center. I heard from the dead sergeant's radio \"Take it out!\" quickly! The drones are pulling it out and away from the island, our air is too preoccupied! Take it down!\" As its support beams ejected, I saw a point that one of the other missiles hit, it was very damaged and a large hole was in the CAC. \"Corporal! Focus fire on the hole in the ship!\" I yelled at the other Marine holding the MATADOR. He nodded and took aim. He fired his missile and it struck home, blowing a hole in the ship that was even larger. I then saw that the hole was glowing, the incendiary ammo of the turrets was stored there. I took aim, held my breath and fired. I watched as the missile flew into the hole in what seemed like slow motion. When the missile hit its mark, the first blast of the two stage system simply ignited the ammo in that room causing a large explosion, but the second stage struck deeper into the ship, exploding the main ammo room and destroying the ship in large firestorm, incinerating all the alien infantry that were close to the ships take off point. \"You did it! Their air is dropping out of the sky! This is Colonel Wilkins, all air units respond to this message, Broken Arrow, repeat, Broken Arrow, Kill all enemy units in the city. We're taking New York back.\" As the colonel's message was transmitted over the radio, I dropped the launcher and stood to my feet, we'd done it, we took it out. \"Good work Marines!\" yelled the other squads as they rushed over to congratulate me and the corporal whose name I still did not know. Matt walked over to me and gave me a high five. \"Fuckin bastard, that was my kill!\" he screamed, joking now that the worst was over. I smiled and high fived some others. I looked back at Angelo and Crash and saw that they were already treated by a medic and locked in a passionate embrace. I grinned even more at the sight and turned around again. As I did Robin attacked me with a bone crushing hug. \"Guess you are the knight in shining armor,\" she said. I smiled and returned the hug. \"It's not over yet, we still have to help out the other nations,\" I said looking down at her. \"But for now I guess I am.\" I said as I leaned down and kissed her. Even though there was still a large amount of fighting to do, at least there was a chance to save humanity. And one thing was for sure; you don't fuck with the Marines. A/N: Well that's the end of Summer Invasion, although it is definitely not the end of this series. I plan to make another story about the retaliation and support of Europe and Asia. Hope you liked it, sorry if the ending was a little cheesy, couldn't resist. ","Summary":" A/N: Hello any one kind enough to read this story. This is my first fanfic, really anything I've ev"},{"Movie":"Prom Night","Title":"Prom Night","Author":"Androidfish7","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10594184","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prom Night by Androidfish7 \"Don't worry\" Aiden assured Sheila, his girlfriend and prom date \"I won't let anything happen to you\" he said as he drove into their school's parking lot. This night was meant to be perfect. But it almost seemed like everything was stacked against the chance of that happening. Between the spontaneous murders happening to the cityfolks, including Aiden's good friend, Justin winding up in the hospital, and the frequent larceny happening all over town with law enforcement, beyond 1 officer, being completely helpless, it would almost seem like this was a perfect chance for something wrong to happen. Especially after last year... When Aiden made his face known to the New York city mob that would wind up terrorizing his life in many, many ways. Flashback 1 year, 2 months, and 29 days to March 5th, 2019 the day Aiden's life would change forever It was a long school day in Aiden's 7th period math class. They were learning about the Pythagorean theorem, which absolutely nobody had even the slightest of interests in. Feeling bored and needing to stand up and walk around, Aiden asked his teacher, Mrs Banas, if he could go to the bathroom, which he was admitted. He entered the boy's restroom and walked into the stall. Before he finished, Aiden heard the door open. Thinking little of it, Aiden was about to leave the bathroom stall until he heard the most ear piercing shreak he would ever hear. \"NO NO NO NO! PLEASE NO!\" A girl voice begged. \"Shut up! You're gonna get my cover blown. I will cut you if you don't shut up!\" A seemingly adult voice replied. Hesitating to open the door, Aiden decided to peak underneath the bathroom stall to see what was happening. He could not make out much, but there was a man in a dark grey coat and a black hat on held a .22 revolver to Sheila Cummings, who Aiden did not know at the time. The man backed Sheila into a corner, which gave Aiden the perfect moment to silently open the door and tackle the man to the ground. Amidst the confusion, the man dropped his .22 revolver. Aiden tried to force the man into a chokehold, but the man pulled a switchblade and stabbed Aiden in the arm, forcing him to retreat a little bit. Sheila reached for the .22 revolver, but the man stood to his feet and stomped on Sheila's hand. He then picked up the .22 revolver and held it to Aiden. \"Eh, trying to play hero hmm? This your girlfriend?\" The man asked. \"Fuck you, you pathetic pansy.\" Aiden replied The old man laughed \"I'm pathetic? You were the one who sneak attacked me and still lost\" The man replied with a dry and cackly laugh Aiden then lunged for the man, who did not expect the sudden advance. The man dropped his knife, as Aiden pinned him to the ground. Sheila picked up the knife \"Aiden!\" Sheila cried out, as Sheila gave Aiden the knife. Aiden then plunged the knife right into the dead center of the man's head, killing him. Aiden sighed a sigh of relief, as did Sheila. \"Thank you, I don't know what that man would've done to me without your help\" Sheila said \"Do you know who that man was? Are there more of the-\" Aiden started, but Aiden's sentence was cut off by a loud gunshot off in the distance \"Does that answer your question? Yeah, there are A LOT of them. They took my gym class hostage except for me, I got into the building but that man subdued me before I could make it to the main office. There are a whole lot of them\" Sheila said with a bit of a scared expression \"Hmm, okay, be careful, I'm gonna head down to the auditorium, that's where Mr Centares is right? He's the dean of students, maybe he can help\" Aiden said \"Can I come with you? I'm worried what will happen if any of them come in here\" Sheila said \"Sure, just be careful\" Aiden said, as he slowly opened the bathroom door. As he looked into the hallway, he saw a thug, with the same coat as the man from the bathroom on, appearing to hold the classroom hostage. Aiden and Sheila stealthily snuck down the hallway, being careful not to attract the attention of anyone or anything. They made their way down the hallway, down the steps of the 2nd floor of the academic wing, down through the main office room, through the Varsity Hall, down through the hallway in the gym room, being especially careful there, as they approached the auditorium door. \"We don't know what's going on in here, so be careful\" Aiden whispered as they slowly entered the auditorium. They could not get 1 foot in the door without realizing 3 thugs had taken over the room. Aiden poked his head out from the left side of the stage as he looked at Mrs Wally, the theater teacher. Mrs Wally looked back at Aiden with an expression of fear and amazement as Aiden held up 1 finger. \"Go, my car is parked in the 1st row of the student parking lot. Go to it, be careful and quiet. This won't take long\" Aiden whispered to Sheila \"Are you nuts? What're you doing?\" Sheila asked \"Just go. And be ready to get in the car when I come out\" Aiden whispered as Sheila reluctantly agreed Aiden then put his hands together and whistled a loud, high pitched, and obnoxious whistle, intentionally giving away his position to the thugs. The thugs, playing into his hand, dashed to his position as he turned and dashed for the student parking lot. He took out his car keys and unlocked his car, allowing Sheila in, as he jumped into the driver's seat and tried to speed out of the scene. It would not be so easy, as the thugs got right into their Chevrolet to pursue Aiden and Sheila. They would never eventually catch Aiden, but they saw his face and got down his license plate, which would be plenty for the mob to use at their disposal. Aiden distracting the thugs allowed Mr Centares to have enough time to call the police, who, led by the chief of police, who was a well known officer around New York, would eventually scare off the mob, at least temporarily. Flash forward 2 months and 29 days to June 4, 2019, prom night for Aiden's junior year Aiden and Sheila pulled forward into the student parking. Having had the incident with the mob at their school long ago, it was completely off their minds. As a matter of fact, all they could think about was the night in front of them. Aiden and Sheila entered the school building and entered the gym, where the prom day festivities were being held. Aiden and Sheila met up with Aiden's good friend Justin and Sheila's friend Janey, who were also a prom couple. Then, they began to converse as they awaited prom day festivities to officially begin. But while everything was happy and merry inside the building, the same could not be said outside. You see, Justin drives a Ford, which has a very large- and accessible- trunk. While he had it started in his driveway, Justin realized he had forgotten his wallet, as he decided to run back into his house to retrieve it. While this had happened, a man who had been stalking Justin for days, and who was responsible for many spontaneous murders across town, by the name of William Stephenson, hopped into Justin's trunk and hid in it, undetected. Justin, not realizing a thing, got into his Ford and drove away, and to the school. When he arrived and met Janey, he emerged from his car, but he had forgotten a large cake that he had bought from the bakery in his trunk. Within the bag the box of cake was in, was a receipt that Justin had received when he had paid for the cake. This was all William needed to frame Justin for what he was going to do next. Half an hour after Justin and Janey had arrived, the prom had begun. When almost everyone was inside, William found an open window out in the open, undetected and not near any of the security guards. William, receipt in hand, climbed through the window which led into a science class. There was a vent in the ceiling that William then climbed to which, after following the trail, eventually led him to be hovering right over the gym where the prom was going on. William spent over an hour stalking it, trying to pick out his next target, when he noticed Justin and Janey appeared to be getting into some kind of argument. \"Just 1 more dance! Then we can take a break!\" Justin pleaded \"No! I wanna take a break! We've been doing it for almost an hour and a half!\" Janey retorted \"Well why even come to the prom if you're just gonna sit around?\" Justin argued, seeming to get angry \"Hey guys, come on, it's prom night, we don't need to quarrel here\" Aiden interloped \"I'm just saying, 1 more dance! Come on!\" Justin seemingly demanded \"No! No means no! Don't you get it? You're so bossy! Why'd I even come here with you?\" Janey shouted, as she walked away, appearing to cry. \"Perfect\" William thought, as he climbed through the vent to where he was back in the science room. There, he was Janey walk out of the building and Justin go chasing after Janey. Justin appeared to be more sympathetic as he tried to calm Janey down. William crouched at the window just close enough where he could hear what they were saying. \"I'm sorry babe, really, I didn't mean it\" Justin pleaded \"*sigh* fine, I guess I was a little dramatic. Just go back in, gimme a sec to collect myself, and we'll get back to it\" Janey said. Justin agreed, as he walked back into the building to leave Janey outside, all alone. William, not about to let such a ripe opportunity go, pulled out a bowie knife, as he crept up to Janey. Janey, squinting, could just barely notice William's shadowy figure approaching her. \"Huh?\" Janey said, as she squinted and leaned more towards the figure. William then got closer, as he was now easily seeable, with his bowie knife. \"Who are you? What do you-\" Janey asked But before Janey could finish, William shoved the sharp end of the bowie knife right through Janey's chest. Janey's widened eyes shifted from William to her chest, but this was not the case for long, as she fell dead shortly after, presumably from massive blood loss. Just to make sure, William slit Janey's dead throat to make sure he confirmed the kill. William then proceeded to take out the receipt that had Justin's name on it, and dropped it onto Janey's dead corpse. Satisfied, William ran back into the window of which he crawled through. He went through the vent over the gym to stalk the party once more. It took Justin about half an hour to be confused. \"Hey Aiden, have you seen Janey?\" Justin asked \"No, I thought Janey went outside with you\" Aiden replied \"Yeah, but Janey said she needed a moment to collect herself before coming back in\" Justin replied \"I haven't seen her man, good luck\" Aiden replied. Justin, feeling a tad bit betrayed, confused, and angry at the same time, proceeded to walk back outside. He discovered Janey's dead body when he walked back outside. Out of shock, he stared at the body and began to put it together that Janey had been murdered. Instantly, Justin went sprinting back to the gym. \"MURDER! Someone's been murdered!\" Justin yelled out. However, most of the people ignored Justin's cries as they went back to dancing and enjoying the prom. Aiden, however, was not one of them. \"What the hell is going on?\" Aiden asked \"Janey's dead! Pool of blood outside!\" Justin anxiously replied \"Holy shit! We gotta tell security!\" Aiden replied, as he signaled to Sheila that he would be back soon. The whole time, William kept an eye on the party. He began planning his next move, as he noticed the vent carried him to a part of the school where he could cut the power to the gym. He crawled to that part of the vent, but waited for a better timing to do so. He determined that Justin would be his scapegoat, and that any killing he did should be centered where he could have Justin blamed for it. Seeing that Justin was not in the room, William simply decided to bide his time and wait for the right opportunity. Meanwhile, Aiden and Justin approached a group of security guards. \"Sir, sir, I think there's been a murdering!\" Justin frantically approached a guard, whose eyes widened at the word 'murder'. \"Take me to the dead body\" the guard replied, as he and the guard standing close followed Justin and Aiden to Janey's dead body outside. \"Go back inside, let us handle this\" A security guard said, as the 2 guards began to inspect the body. William noticed how Aiden and Justin had inadvertently paved the way for William to enter the school building unimpeded, as there were no longer any security guards guarding the entrance to the school. Part of the vent William had crawled through would, if he dropped down, lead him to the entrance of the building. So William developed a plan. As Justin and Aiden re-entered the gym, Justin stood next to a guy named Nick, as Justin tried to collect himself while Nick was simply trying to get a cup of fruit punch. William cut the power then. Amidst the confusion and hysteria, William went through the vent, dropped down nearby the entrance to the building, entered the gym undetected, and found his chance, as he pulled out his bowie knife, and approached Nick, still undetected. William held Nick's mouth shut as he plunged the bowie knife into Nicks' chest, and impaled him, as to confirm the kill. William then dropped the body, as he ran back to the entrance, jumped back into the vent, and crawled back to the power. William then turned the power back on. It took people exactly 15 seconds to realize Nick was dead, as people who noticed started going crazy. Justin, sure that he was delirious, eyed Nick's dead body with horror. Nick had just been standing next to Justin seconds before the power was out! That had to have meant this killer was, at some point, also standing right next to Justin! The only issue is, nobody but Justin had been standing anywhere near Nick before the power went out. At that moment, the security guards entered the gym. Before they noticed Nick's dead body, they approached Justin. \"Are you Justin Prater?\" One guard asked. \"Yeah, why?\" Justin replied \"This receipt with your name on it was found on top of that girl's dead body.\" The guard replied. \"Holy shit! *points to Nick's dead body\" The other guard exclaimed, as the 2 guards noticed Nick's dead body. \"Justin, man, what's going on?\" Aiden said. But at that moment, more chaos was inbound. Apparently, the local mob had planned an assault on the prom, as 3 thugs entered the front entrance, armed with 2 .44 Magnums apiece. They entered the gym. Immediately, they began spraying, as they killed both security guards. Thankfully, there was an emergency exit outside in the gym, as panicking prom couples flooded the exit. The thugs shot and killed many more, what was later discovered to be a total of 17 people. Aiden ran to Sheila and Justin. \"Come on! We gotta go!\" Aiden said, as Sheila, Aiden, and Justin dashed for the exit. Aiden and Sheila made it outside safely, but Justin did not. 2 .44 Magnum shots hit Justin, 1 in the back, the other in the leg, as Justin fell to the ground. Aiden proceeded to help Justin up, and Aiden and Sheila helped Justin run with them for Aiden's car. They would wind up getting away, but prom night as a whole was a total disaster. 19 people wound up dead, 23 people wound up wounded. Those who were not killed would eventually escape safely, but it was marked as one of the grisliest nights in school history. The school has, since then, intensified security, hiring Armed Guards to patrol the perimeter during the school day, and during any extracurricular events, the police were stationed along with the Armed Guards to protect the perimeter. This is how Aiden knew that he and Sheila were going to have a good makeup night at the Prom. Or so he thought.[Chapter 2] Prom Night by Androidfish7 \"I just... After last year, I'm on edge\" Sheila stated \"It's hard to blame you\" Began Aiden \"But the school has multiplied security since last year. Everything will be fine.\" Aiden finished. Finally, Aiden and Sheila made it to the school parking lot. As expected, there were 2 gunmen on the roof, guarding the perimeter, there were multiple armed guards all around, and there was probably a police car per every inch of the property. Okay, maybe not that many, but there were plenty of police cars. Even the chief of police himself was expected to give an announcement before the prom began. Aiden and Sheila approached the entrance, they took their tickets out and handed them to one of the 3 heavy machine gunners stationed in front of the school. \"You may pass\" one of them said, as they stood out of the way to allowed Aiden and Sheila into the building. Behind them, a very strange kid in a ghost costume approached the heavy machine gunners. Thinking nothing of it, Aiden and Sheila proceeded through the school. Meanwhile, the kid in the ghost costume handed the gunners a prom ticket, as they allowed him inside just as they had done Aiden and Sheila. The kid then entered the bathroom and shut the door, proceeding for a stall. The kid then took off his ghost costume. It was no kid at all, it was none other than William Stephenson! William, amazed at how easy it was to infiltrate the school, knew that in order to \"crash\" the prom again, he would have more work to do, so he decided to sit down and think about what to do next. Meanwhile, Aiden and Sheila entered the gym, where festivities, along with the chief of police's announcement, were expected to take place. The chief of police himself and 2 other police officers would personally be guarding the prom, as not to take any chances with security. Many of the defenses were not placed in preparation for a lone murdered such as William, they were placed in preparation for something much larger, such as a mob invasion, something the 2, now dead, security guards from the year before had no chance of being ready for. As Aiden and Sheila met up with friends and did side festivities, such as photo boothe sessions, claw machine games, and pie eating contests, the memories of last year's prom slowly began to fade and the enjoyment and merriment of the immediate moment began to settle in. Shortly after they finished, the chief of police stood up to a podium and decided to address the promfarers. \"Hello\" the chief of police started \"As you know, I am the chief of police here in New York City, also known as The Overlord. I am, of course, well aware of what happened last year and has been occurring around the city. Well I am here to tell you that there is absolutely no chance anything will interrupt your evening here tonight. Crime rate over the last month is lower than it has been in years, and the city is truly under vice grip. I promise you that you will all be 100% safe as you normally would be. And with that being said, please enjoy your evening. The prom has just begun.\" The Overlord finished, as he walked off the podium to a roaring ovation and approval from the promfarers. As the music turned on, the fun came with it too, as promfarers, like Aiden and Sheila, slowly let the memories of the prom past dissolve into the immediate moment, one of pure joy, as slow music, fast music, and everything inbetween filled the air. While this was happening, a police officer approached The Overlord. \"Sir, we have a problem\" the officer said. \"KEEP IT DOWN! What's the problem?\" The Overlord hushedly exclaimed. \"There's 1 extra person registered here\" the officer replied, to which, The Overlord took interest. \"Hmm, get me a RADAR on the whole building and I will trace it. It's probably nothing, don't get worked up over it, and DON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT, but I will give it a look\" The Overlord said \"Sir, yes sir\" The officer replied, as he trotted away. Meanwhile, William had figured out his whole plan, as luckily for him, the same vent he had used to make his mark on last year's prom had a trail that went through the boy's restroom. William jumped up and climbed right into it, carefully shutting it behind him, as he crawled through it. Since he had gone largely unnoticed in last year's affair, nobody has thought to remove the power controls from the tail end of the vent, so William had that on his side. Unfortunately, for him, security was maximized DUE to said incident last year, so pulling this off would not be as easy as it was the year before. William crawled through the vent right over the gym, where prom festivities were being held. William identified many potential targets, but all were well within the line of sight of security, so William knew he had to do what he had done the year before, and that is bide his time and sit and wait. Meanwhile, the officer brought The Overlord a small laptop. This laptop, which constantly had the school marked for heat signatures, would tell The Overlord where the extra identity, assuming there was one, was residing. The Overlord, pulling out his Profiler app on his phone, which would tell him the name of every heat signature on his laptop he decided to scan. The Overlord, profiling everyone, found nothing out of ordered until he scanned in the upper part of the gym. Someone by the name of \"William Stephenson\", age 27, according to the laptop and Profiler, was hiding up in the vent. Very disturbed and intrigued by this newfound information, The Overlord instructed 2 officers to inspect the vent. All the time, William had been eying The Overlord and knew what was coming next. Thus, William crawled through the vent and back into the bathroom. William hid in one of the stalls until the 2 officers entered the bathroom and entered the vent William was in moments ago. William then quietly reentered the vent and pursued the officers. The 2 officers were crawling until just about where William was, directly over the gym. Below them, the crawling in the vent was starting to make a lot of noise. \"What's that?\" Sheila asked Aiden, eying the vent. \"It's probably nothing. Don't worry about it\" Aiden reassured, as they went back to dancing to the slow music playing. Meanwhile, the officers reached the tail end of the vent, and found nothing. The officer in the front turned on his walkie talkie \"Officers Brian Hunt and Jim Yates reporting, there is nobody up in the vent, repeat, nobody up in the vent, isn't that right Jim?\" Officer Brian asked, but to no response. \"Jim?\"Officer Brian repeated, as he turned around. Jim's face was down, facing the vent, so it wasn't likely Jim didn't hear him. Officer Brian lifted up Jim's face, but all he could see in Jim's eyes were widened expressions of horror. Upon putting Jim's head down, Officer Brian noticed there was a bowie knife plunged into the back of Jim! Just about pissing himself in shock, Officer Brian turned on the walkie talkie. \"Overlord, come in, Overlord!\" Officer Brian anxiously said \"What? What? Did you find something?\" The Overlord replied \"We have an officer down! Requesting backup!\" Officer Brian exclaimed \"Shh! Just relax. I am coming to get you. Just, try and meet me in the bathroom.\" The Overlord replied. Officer Brian, reluctantly and tearfully trying to crawl past his now deceased partner, eventually made it back to the bathroom. Officer Brian walked to the door to the room, but found a sticky note on the door that was not there before they entered the vent. Officer Brian pulled the sticky note off the door. Officer Brian thought he was going mad when he read \"Beeeehind yoooouuuu!\" Officer Brian slowly but steadily turned around and looked right into the eyes of William.[Chapter 3] Prom Night by Androidfish7 Using speedy reflexes, William plunged a bowie knife right through Officer Brian's heart, removed it, and laughed to himself as he thought up a very horrific and sadistic prank. Meanwhile, The Overlord entered the bathroom. He saw what appeared to be an outline of blood as he eyed it very carefully. Walking through the bathroom, he began to call for Officer Brian \"Officer Brian, report Officer\" The Overlord said, as he came to a stop He noticed 2 feet in 1 stall. They looked to be boots, the ones Officer Brian had been wearing. \"Get the hell out of there, this isn't a time for a piss break\" The Overlord said. Upon no response, The Overlord approached the door very cautiously. Slowly starting to put together what may have happened, The Overlord busted down the door to find the dead body of Officer Brian hanging on a noose! Immediately upon seeing this sight, The Overlord pulled out his Walkie Talkie \"Execute Operations NOOK immediately, we can't let this guy get away\" The Overlord said through his walkie talkie Operation NOOK was designed by The Overlord to lockdown the school silently, as not to disturb the partygoers. From that point, until the operation was decommissioned, nobody was allowed inside the building, nor was anybody allowed outside. However, none of the officers were to do anything to or with the partygoers, except for 1 thing. 2 officers would enter the gym, recorders attached to their chests underneath their uniforms, and they would search the gym stealthily for any suspicious activity or conversation. If the killing persisted, obviously The Overlord would have to abandon the stealth job and handpick the killer himself, but seeing as though last year's prom was a disaster and the city upped the budget for defenses, The Overlord would only do that after every option had been exercised. As another part of the plan, The Overlord would also have the bodies of Officers Brian and Jim taken away stealthily, so that none of the partygoers knew that there had been a murder in the building that night. The Overlord would also have the heavy gunners guarding the door move inside to guard the entrance from the inside. Finally, the windows were to be locked as well as replaced with indestructible maxiglass, so the killer could not escape through the windows. One way or another, The Overlord was gonna catch this guy and make sure justice served it's course on him. The Overlord, eying the suddenly open vent, wondered if the killer could be in the vent. Deciding to check the area later, The Overlord left the bathroom. William then dropped down from the ceiling. He had been using grapple hooks to keep himself attached to the ceiling, as he had watched what The Overlord had done. He briefly wondered what Operation NOOK was. Rather than wonder, William slowly opened the door to the boy's bathroom. Upon discovering there was nobody outside, William very silently but quickly snuck into a nearby classroom. Since the officers had not yet appeared to replace the windows with maxiglass and the heavy gunners had been moved outside, William simply opened the window and crawled outside. William then turned around and, using the grapple hooks, began to scale the school walls. Upon reaching the rooftop, William found an unguarded vent on the top of the roof which would easily allow William to go in and out of the school as he pleased. William entered the vent, and, since it was a different vent, it would be a different trail. William found himself directly above the cafeteria, where the only lunch lady the school had was just about finished with making prom day food, including pizza, chicken wings, hamburgers, hot dogs, and finally, the glorious cake. William then got an idea so raucous, so gut wrenchingly evil that he had to cover his mouth to stop himself from laughing out loud and giving his position away. William pulled out his bowie knife, and waited for the right opportunity, when the lunch lady would be directly underneath his position. When that opportunity came, William jumped down, and with one swift move, snapped the lunch lady's neck. William, then, grasping the bowie knife, did something so despicable, so, disgusting, so, nauseating, that it was the perfect storm. William, upon completing said despicable task, used his grapple hooks to re-enter the vent he had entered the cafeteria in. About 2 hours later, The Overlord reported back with his officers. \"Have you found anything yet?\" The Overlord said through his walkie talkie None of the officers had a clue as to William's whereabouts. \"Okay. Corp Sam and Officer Phil, go check the cafeteria to see if the lunch lady is all done with the prom day meal.\" The Overlord said. \"Yes sir\" Corp Sam said, as he and Officer Phil met up at the cafeteria. \"What's the lady's name again?\" Corp Sam asked \"No clue. Let's just say 'lunch lady' until we find it out\" Officer Phil suggested. \"Oh Lunch Lady! When will the prom meal be made?\" Corp Sam yelled, to no response. \"Hmph, maybe the lunch lady left\" Officer Phil said \"No, that can't be, we're under Op NOOK, nobody could have left the building\" Corp Sam retorted \"Then where the hell is the lunch lady?\" Officer Phil asked, as they entered the cafeteria. There were goodies as far as the eye could see. The hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, chicken wings, and cake appeared to be done. Apparently the lunch lady also prepared for the partygoers to be thirsty, as there was also a table with many cups filled with fruit punch. The food appeared to be done, but where was the lunch lady? \"Hmm, well, we don't got all day. Let's just let the kids in.\" Corp Sam said, as Officer Phil agreed. About 20 minutes later, some of the partygoers began to drift into the cafeteria. After sitting down for about 5 minutes, they began to fill their plates with food. However, it did not appear as though the food was entirely popular, as many of the partygoers complained of horrendous taste in the food. As well as some complained for the texture of what they were given. After awhile, it started becoming more than a coincidence, at least in the eyes of Corp Sam and Officer Phil. \"Now look Philly, I went to this school, I remember the food here not being good, but I don't remember it being as bad as these kids say.\" Corp Sam said. \"Yeah I know. Seems kinda odd it would be going over this badly.\" Officer Phil. \"Maybe we should have some, see what these kids are talking about.\" Corp Sam suggested, to which, Officer Phil agreed upon. Corp Sam got 1 slice of pizza, 2 chicken wings, a hamburger, a hot dog, and a slice of cake, as well as Officer Phil did before they sat down at a table. Officer Phil gripped a slice of pizza, but noted that the crust was so weak that the cheese, pepperoni, and sauce nearly outweighed it. Meanwhile, Corp Sam noted that the meat in the hamburger was dripping way too much of what appeared to be grease. It was very sloppy. Meanwhile, the Frank in the Hot Dog was far too skinny and small for Officer Phil's liking. As well as the Chicken Wings looked very flabby and the bones looked minuscule in comparison to ordinary chicken wings. Finally, the cake was far too flimsy and weak, and the red frosting on it was also very syrup-y. This was all noted before either of them even ate a bite. Finally, the eating came. The chicken wings tasted awful, sort of like rotten pickles. The pizza tasted poorly, the hot dog was very hard to chew and tasted dreadfully, the cake was bad, but then Corp Sam found something very suspicious in the hamburger. He removed the bun, and after a second of inspection, realized something very, very, and I mean, VEEERRRRYYYY wrong with the meat. Underneath the bun, Corp Sam had almost taken a bite out of a piece of a human brain.[Chapter 4] Prom Night by Androidfish7 \"Agh! Don't eat anything else! We gotta shut this place down!\" Corp Sam exclaimed, drawing attention from the nearby partygoers. \"What'd you find Sammy?\" Officer Phil exclaimed. Now, Corp Sam did NOT want to cause a stir that The Overlord had worked so hard to keep suppressed. If he did, it might result in a demotion, or worse, termination from his job altogether. So Corp Sam, realizing what needed to be done, looked at Officer Phil with an as-a-matter-of-fact expression. \"Just do it. I will explain later.\" Corp Sam said sternly. \"Alright. *Addresses partygoers* Hey kids, go have some fun in the gym, we're locking down the cafeteria. We won't be long, will we Sam?\" Officer Phil announced \"Hope not.\" Corp Sam replied as he tried to process what had just happened. Reluctantly, the partygoers slowly emptied the cafeteria, and when nobody but Corp Sam and Officer Phil remained in the room, Corp Sam came out with it. \"I, now bare with me here, I may be crazy, but I have a degree in medical school. WHATEVER THAT IS, it is, to put it mildly, NOT what anyone should be eating!\" Corp Sam exclaimed \"Huh? Why not? Did you find something poisonous in the stuff or something?\" Officer Phil asked, with legitimate concern to his voice. \"Philly, you've known me for awhile. I'm no lunatic. But that is NOT hamburger meat\" Corp Sam replied \"Then what in God's name is it?\" Officer Phil asked, seemingly annoyed yet afraid of what Corp Sam was alluding to. \"I believe it is a piece of human brain.\" Corp Sam said. \"OH HELL FUCKING NO!\" Officer Phil yelled, as he ran towards the nearest trash can he could find and vomited violently into it. \"Hey! Watch your language! There are minors, and many of them, in the building!\" Corp Sam scolded. Officer Phil looked up from the trash can. \"H-H-How did that go unnoticed? Is the lunch lady some sort of sadist or something?\" Officer Phil asked. \"I don't know. But we need to report to The Overlord immediately.\" Corp Sam said. However, almost as if on cue, the lights in the room went out. Some very light movement could be heard. \"S-S-Sammy?\" Officer Phil said \"Yeah, I'm here. This room must've had some sort of power failure or something.\" Corp Sam replied. \"Okay, just making sure you were still there.\" Officer Phil said. Corp Sam then approached Officer Phil, to the point where he was standing right in front of Officer Phil. \"Okay, gimme your phone, I'm gonna dial up The Overlord and then we'll get out of here\" Corp Sam said. \"Okay, here *hands Corp Sam walkie talkie*\" Officer Phil said Corp Sam turned on the walkie talkie. \"Come in Overlord, come in\" Corp Sam said. \"Overlord here. State your business\" The walkie talkie replied. \"Overlord, we got a-\" Corp Sam started, but something seemed to have cut him off. Officer Phil, eying the walkie talkie, then looked up at Corp Sam. \"A-a-a-a-a\" Corp Sam said weakly, as he fell right on top of Officer Phil. \"What the-?\" Officer Phil said, as he shoved Corp Sam off him, to which, Corp Sam just fell to the ground. \"Come in Corp Sam, Overlord here, state your business\" The Overlord said in a somewhat annoyed tone. All of a sudden, the lights came back on. When they did, Officer Phil nearly yelled out in shock. Corp Sam was lying on his back in a pool of dark blood. Dead. \"Oh-!\" Officer Phil hushingly exclaimed. Officer Phil then reached for the walkie talkie. \"Come in! Overlord! Overlord! Come in!\" Officer Phil exclaimed. \"Yes, Overlord here, for the 3rd time, please state your business\" The Overlord replied. \"We got a man down! Repeat, man down! Corp Sam is down!\" Officer Phil exclaimed very, very loudly. \"KEEP IT DOWN! Okay, how did it happen? Did you see it happen?\" The Overlord said in a much quieter, yet excited tone. \"I-I didn't see it happen.\" Officer Phil replied, but then, in the opposite window into the room, Officer Phil looked at something that startled him. It was William, eying him with a maniacal smile. \"I-I see him! I see him! The killer!\" Officer Phil whispered, before he slowly reached towards his back pocket for his Desert Eagle .44. \"Detain him QUIETLY if possible! But detain him at all costs! Sending reinforcements to your location!\" The Overlord said, deciding that stealth was not going to work any longer. Meanwhile, The Overlord, seeing as though one of his better agents had been murdered, knew stealth would not be sufficient, knew it was time to call off Operation NOOK and bring about Operation SUN. Operation SUN was designed to find and eliminate the murdered at all costs, and it was far from stealthy the way NOOK was. Under SUN, 3 Police Choppers with snipers positioned inside would be summoned to the area, whilst 15 police officers in armored Police Cruisers would show up. Finally, 2 Armored Convoys, containing 15 heavy gunners apiece, would show up to the scene. All of them tasked with 1 simple yet complicated task: find and kill the murderer. \"Attention NY Police department city-wide. This is The Overlord, I am calling for Operation SUN on location P34WTAT, effective immediately!\" The Overlord said through his walkie talkie. Meanwhile, Officer Phil took out his Desert Eagle and fired 2 shots at William, before realizing. The windows William was covered by were made up of Indestructible maxiglass! At the sight of this, William laughed and dashed away, back into the student parking lot. William crawled underneath the Chevy Aiden had driven to the school, as he decided to wait out the onslaught there, and watch everything unravel. At that moment, William knew he had won. He had come unto the day in an attempt to crash the prom the school was holding, and even through heavily advanced security, William had still done it. William knew the partygoers had heard the 2 gunshots Officer Phil had fired, and it would stir up suspicion. It was only a matter of time until they discovered the dead bodies, and furthermore for those who ate in the cafeteria, it was only a matter of time until they discovered what EXACTLY they had eaten! As soon as William heard 3 police helicopters overhead, he knew he had won the battle. Now the school was going to be placed behind metal locking down as they would go chasing their own tails trying to track him down in the school building. Meanwhile, Aiden, realizing what was happening due to the shots being fired, looked into Sheila's eyes. The couple had had such a wonderful night, but Aiden knew the plug needed to be pulled. \"Sheila, we need to leave, now!\" Aiden exclaimed. Sheila, apparently getting the same impression, agreed that leaving at the immediate moment was the best idea. Thankfully for them, the heavy gunners that were positioned to guard the entrance had been shifted, so the entrance was largely vulnerable. Not knowing of the law enforcement action behind the scene, Aiden and Sheila dashed outside, and found the police helicopters in the sky. At that moment, their worst fears were confirmed. The murdered was back, and he had almost certainly found his way inside the school building. \"To my Chevy!\" Aiden said, as they dashed to the parking lot. Aiden and Sheila found Aiden's Chevy, as Sheila entered the passenger's seat. Aiden fumbled around with his keys, until he stumbled and dropped them underneath his Chevy. Aiden reached for his keys. But at that moment, another hand held Aiden's to the ground.[Chapter 5] Prom Night by Androidfish7 William emerged from underneath Aiden's Chevy with a maniacal smile and a bowie knife in hand, as he plunged the bowie knife into Aiden's hand. Writhing in pain, Aiden knew he had to react or William would insert the bowie knife into a much more vital area. Aiden swept his legs against William's legs in an attempt to trip him, which was successful. Aiden then tried quickly getting into his Chevy. Aiden opened the door and started the Chevy, but William, using his bowie knife, shattered the driver's seat window in one lunge. Aiden drove out of the way just before William could get off another stab. Aiden had escaped William for now. \"It's okay honey bunches! I will be back on the night of your wedding day! This isn't the last you've seen of me!\" William yelled out crazily At that moment, a bunch of heavy gunner acquired a gauge on William's location, A helicopter flashed a high light on William, and the heavy gunners shot William down easily and quickly. \"I knew SOMETHING was up!\" Sheila exclaimed, as the heavy gunners began to return to the entrance. \"I think we're lucky to have gotten out of there. They had that place locked up quite tightly. Not the kind of senior prom I would have hoped for.\" Aiden remarked. \"And that threat he made...\" Sheila started. \"I wouldn't worry too much about it. Those gunners looked like they got him pretty good.\" Aiden stated. \"You're always so laid back on these things! First, the really tight security was supposed to protect us. That didn't work, and now you're content now? I mean, look at your hand! He put a hole in it!\" Sheila exclaimed \"I am trying desperately to ignore it until I can tend to it... And anyway, we saw it with our own 2 eyes, they ripped him to shreds with bullets. No way he's coming back.\" Aiden stated. \"That isn't even the bulk of it. He mentioned our wedding day... But, um\" Sheila started before Aiden cut Sheila off. \"Clearly that guy's a wacko. I wouldn't think about it too much.\" Aiden said. \"Yeah, you're probably right. It's just been a hectic night is all. At least you were right about not letting anything happen to me.\" Sheila said. Sheila, Aiden, and many of the partygoers made it home safely and on time that night. After the incident, The Overlord installed laser defenses and walled in turrets in the school to, this time, assure that nothing like it would ever happen again. Going to school had a different feel, as it did when it had happened a year prior, but after 3, 4 years, the attacks and random strangers on school property stopped happening, and continuity was restored. As expected, the Mob violence in New York was still high as ever, but it stopped targeting the school. Flash forward 4 years, Aiden and Sheila have graduated college, still as a couple, and have sought out an apartment room where they both reside, ready to begin their lives. Sheila got a degree in Education, meanwhile, Aiden is pursuing a career as an airplane pilot. Aiden entered their apartment room one afternoon. It was after pilot training class, and Aiden was feeling very tired. Aiden sat down on a couch and turned the TV on. While channel flipping, Sheila entered the apartment room, with good news in mind. \"I got the job!\" Sheila exclaimed, as Sheila came bursting into the room. \"Where are you gonna be teaching at?\" Aiden asked. \"I am gonna be teaching at the old high school we went to\" Sheila replied \"Hmm, well good luck with that. I hear they still got that place locked up tight after, well, you know.\" Aiden stated. \"Yeah, but that shouldn't be an issue anymore.\" Sheila replied. A few months after that, the school year began. Life for the young couple was good. Aiden finally got a job as a pilot after hours and hours of extensive training, meanwhile, Sheila was about to begin a teaching career that would hopefully last a long time. For the time being, it felt like the 2 were peaking. Well, they were right. They were right. Sheila entered the teacher's lounge. In there were 2 other teachers sitting at a table, coffees out, one with a newspaper. There were a few teachers searching cabinets for some sort of book or paper and what-not. Sheila, having brought coffee in a thermos, sat down at the table. \"Oh hi! You must be the new English teacher!\" One of the teachers greeted. \"Yes, I'm Ms Neparsky\" Sheila replied. \"I'm the school librarian, Mrs Porral\" Mrs Porral introduced. \"Always a pleasure to meet friendly faces!\" Sheila said, as Mrs Porral left the lounge, presumably to go to the library. As Sheila met and greeted the other teaches, the school day began, where Sheila would begin the first day of a hopefully very long career as a teacher. Meanwhile, Aiden sat down in the cockpit of an airplane. It would be Aiden's first time getting a chance to live his dream of actually flying an airplane. Aiden would be tasked of flying from New York City to the windy city of Chicago. It would be a few hours long of a flight, but based on Aiden's training, it would be nothing he could not handle. As Aiden sat in his cockpit, Aiden's assistant, James DeNarvo entered the cockpit. \"All set for takeoff?\" James asked. \"All set. Have a seat, we're gonna do this!\" Aiden exclaimed. \"Don't get too excited now. Remember what I taught you. Oh, I remember my first flight. The summer of 1984, I was 22 years old. Even at the young age I'm still at, I think my flying days are over, but I am ready to assist you on your path to being a successful pilot!\" James exclaimed. \"Alright!\" Aiden exclaimed. It was 7 AM, takeoff was scheduled for 8:30 AM sharp. \"You know, I totally know what it's like. As a rookie, you show up to the plane sometimes hours early just to make sure you're on time. You'll shake that habit as you grow into it. I did this for 23 years before I retired.\" James stated. \"Yeah, guess I'm just excited. I won't let it get to me though.\" Aiden said. Aiden and James would go on with their conversation for awhile before 8:30 struck. James pointed to the button on the control set that would allow Aiden to communicate with the passengers of the plane. \"Go ahead. It's your first time. Make it special.\" James said. Aiden tapped the button before beginning to speak. \"Attention passengers, we ar-\" Aiden started before James interrupted. \"Uh, you need to hold the button down or else it won't work.\" James stated. Aiden held the button down. \"Attention passengers, this is Pilot Aiden Vernon speaking. We are set for takeoff, please buckle your seat belts, remember that there are oxygen masks at your disposal, and if you need anything, feel free to ask a flight attendant\" Aiden said, as he released the button. \"Well, how do you feel?\" James asked. \"I feel like I'm ready to fly this damn thing.\" Aiden replied. Aiden's flight to Chicago was ultimately successful. However, something Aiden had not planned for. An old friend was about to reappear.[Chapter 6] Prom Night by Androidfish7 Sheila, using chalk, drew \"Ms Neparsky\" on the chalkboard. It was 5 minutes until students were supposed to show up for class. Mrs Parroll poked into the room. \"Good luck on your first day! You have quite the crowd on hand!\" Mrs Parroll said, before quickly leaving. Unsure if this was a warning or a friendly gesture, Sheila quickly put it off and grabbed a stack of syllabus papers in hand for the students. At that point, the bell rung. Shortly after, a slew of students walked into the room. It seemed like pretty much none of them even wanted to be there, but Sheila had expected that, having it be the first day of school. But something was very off with this group of kids. Sheila counted 14 of them in all for the first period, and of the group there was one really tall kid with a Minnesota Twins hat on, one short and chubby kid who smelt like death, a girl who had 2 phones, 1 in each hand, another guy who had a plate of nachos at his deck, one kid who had headphones with an IPod plugged in listening to awful music very, very loudly, and a trio of 2 guys and 1 girl who had positioned their desks to be adjacent to one another, presumably so they could whisper the day's gossip to each other. The rest of the class seemed somewhat ordinary, as Sheila handed out syllabus papers. \"Hello class, I am Ms Neparsky\" Sheila said. After a long moment of silence, Sheila generated one very low pitched sound. \"Whatever\" The chubby, smelly kid said, as Sheila continued to pass out papers. \"Why don't we all start by giving me your names?\" Sheila said, again, to dead air for response. As the day went on, Sheila would learn the names of the kids, though it felt like the class was practically dead. One worded answers were about all Sheila could get the kids to say. But towards the end of the period, things got dicey. \"Anthony\" Sheila said to the tall kid with the Minnesota Twins hat on. \"You know we can't allow students to have hats on during school\" \"Yeah? What the F#$% are you gonna do about it?\" Anthony sharply replied, to Sheila's astonishment. \"Take the hat off. Now.\" Sheila said sternly, to Anthony's astonishment. Anthony, taking the hat off, gave off a glare as the bell rung. The class emptied, as Mrs Parroll visited Sheila again. \"Real lively bunch eh?\" Mrs Parroll stated. \"I couldn't get them to say ANYTHING until I asked this kid, Anthony, to take off his hat\" Sheila replied. \"Yeah, we in the teacher's lounge, call that group the class from the black lagoon. Good luck.\" Mrs Parroll said. Throughout the rest of Sheila's day, the classes were pretty normal, and mostly even enjoyable, but that first period class hung thick in the back of Sheila's head. At the end of the day, Sheila went back to the apartment and waited for Aiden to come home. A man in a brown leather coat with a grey hat boarded the plane back to New York that Aiden was piloting. Aiden was set to takeoff in roughly half an hour, but this man boarded the plane early in an attempt to gather a good seat. As passengers began to board the plane, the man hid his face using his grey hat from public view. As the plane took off, the man kept this approach, as the plane flew. As the flight attendant came around, giving passengers chicken noodle soup with crackers, the man eyed the bowl very closely and carefully. Deciding he did not want to eat them, the man did not eat the soup and crackers. A family sitting next to him, noticing the man did not want his food, asked him if they could give the soup and crackers to their kids. With a smile, the man gave the soup and crackers to the family, as he sat in his seat and stared at the ceiling. One of the kids from the family then told his parents he needed to go the restroom. The kid, probably about 13 or 14 years old, walked to the back of the plane and into the restroom. About an hour later, the plane touched down, and the kid hadn't yet emerged from the bathroom. Everyone but the family left the plane. The family would later come upon the kid, suffocated and poisoned to death while having apparently barfed violently and frequently all over the bathroom. It was chaotic, and nobody knew how it happened. Autopsies would later reveal the kid had suffered a severe case of food poisoning, combined with the fact that the kid was deathly allergic to honey. It was discovered that a half of a teaspoon of aliphatic acid was put into the chicken noodle soup the kid had eaten on the plane ride. \"We need the I.D of every single person that boarded this plane\" A police officer said to Hector Dyson, the owner of the plane company. As the police later reviewed the I.D and positioning of every person who was on the plane, Corp Jarrod, the force's newest Corp, emailed the information to The Overlord. The Overlord reviewed the email carefully. After awhile of reviewing it, The Overlord hadn't found much, until he found an I.D on the man sitting right next to the family. It read \"William Stephenson\".

But one of my favorite actors, Lucas Till, was barely in it. I caught 2 glimpses of him and then they (SPOILER ALERT!) killed him off! I was really upset about that, so I started planning this fanfiction. It follows the movie, but it will be my imagination mostly. His character's name in the film is Corporal Scott Grayston, so this is a Grayston/OC fanfic. I'm sorry that the first chapter is so short, but it will get longer as the chapters go along. So please enjoy Chapter 1! I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was something straight out of War of the Worlds. Meteors were crashing down along the coastline, and people were screaming, running, and hopping into their cars. \"Layla, what are those things falling out of the sky?\" my little brother, Johnny, asked me from the backseat as I turned the corner. At ten years old, he was very perceptive as well as smart, so nothing could get past him. I quickly glanced back into his big brown eyes, and turned forward again. \"Um, I don't know, but it's not good, that I know for sure,\" I answered back. Just then, my cell phone rang, and dad's name came up on the caller ID. \"Layla, where are you? Is Johnny with you?\"my dad asked frantically. \"Yes, I just picked him up from school. Dad, what is going on?\" \"Layla, honey, I need you both to come to the police department. They are saying that an alien invasion is happening, and they won't hesitate to kill. Joe and Hector are here already, so please hurry,\" my dad urged. But there was something else there in his voice, like he was trying to hold back tears. I turned the corner and asked, \"Dad, what's wrong?\" Dad sniffled and mumbled, \"Your aunt, Sasha, is dead. She was killed by gunfire this morning.\" I nearly swerved off the road when I heard that. Tears formed in my eyes, but I wiped them away before Carter could see them. \"Look, dad, we'll be there in about 10 minutes, okay? I love you.\" \"Love you too, kiddo. I gotta go. Bye.\" I put my phone back into the cup holder and took deep breaths to keep my composure. I just couldn't believe that my aunt had died. She was the rock of the family, and kept everything together when our mom died. Now, I had to step up to the plate, and become the glue to keep everything from falling apart. AN: Once again I'm sorry this was short, but my graduation is this week so I haven't had a lot of time to make it longer. But I'm thinking that the Marines will show up by chp 2 or 3. Please Review![Chapter 2] Chapter 2 -Waiting Scott's Pov Why is life unfair sometimes? Why do strange things happen? Can some good things come out of bad things? I don't know, but that's what was going through my mind as the rest of our unit and I watched the invasion on television. Aliens were attacking us, with advanced weaponry, but no one knew why just yet. All those innocent people, blown to ashes. It was terrifying and heart wrenching, but I knew that all my training was going to be put to good use. Soon, the orders were given, and my unit was to head off to a LAPD station to find civilians before the bombing at 1930 hours. The head of our unit was Second Lieutenant Martinez, followed by Staff Sergeant Nantz. I could tell that Lockett didn't like the idea, but unfortunately, he had no choice in the matter. \"Let's move, men!\" Martinez barked. We all hustled into the helicopter and proceeded to make our way toward Santa Monica. (…) Layla's POV The past few hours of my life went by so quickly that I could barely remember them. I could only remember in brief flashes. My dad's scared face, Uncle Joe holding Hector, people screaming, explosions in the distance… I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling. There were only a few of us left alive, and my Uncle Joe had managed to send an emergency call using the radio my dad left him. My dad forced us into the bunker behind his office so that even if he didn't survive, the rest of us could still have a chance. My dad… The tears came back again, but I sobbed in silence since Hector, Carter, and two other children, Kirsten and Amy, were sleeping. Michele, their aunt, was sitting in the corner nearby with her hands wrapped around her knees and her head in her lap. From what I gathered, she was a veterinarian, and an all-round nice woman put into a difficult situation like the rest of us. Uncle Joe was sitting by Hector with his flashlight, trying to find the signal again. Carter was bundled up beside me, dried tears still fresh on his tan cheeks. I ran my fingers through his soft curls and kissed his forehead. \" No matter what happens, I will make sure that you make it out of here safe ,\" I whispered in his ear. \"Anything yet?\" I asked Joe. He shook his head and continued to fiddle with the buttons on the radio. The ground slightly shook, and I held Carter closer to me. All of a sudden, in the midst of the silence, there was a noise, and then voices and footsteps, coming closer and closer. \"U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!\" someone shouted. Michele's head popped up, and the kids began to wake up. Joe and I exchanged glances of relief, and Carter sat up and rubbed his eyes. The door to the bunker was pulled open, and a blinding light flooded the room. \"How many of you are there?\" a man in a military uniform asked, frantic. \"Uh, there are seven of us. Four kids,\" Michele answered. The man said something to another man behind him, and they began shuffling us out of the bunker. Carter grabbed my hand, and we followed the Marines outside, where a helicopter was waiting for us. We all stopped as the helicopter began rising from the ground, and everyone panicked. Everyone began yelling and screaming, and Carter wrapped his arms around my waist in fear. Suddenly, out of nowhere, an alien aircraft shot a beam at the helicopter, blowing it to bits. Someone grabbed me and shuffled me and Carter back inside the building for safety from the falling debris. As we ran down the hallway, Carter started crying again, and I snatched my arm back. I hugged him, and said, \"It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be fine.\" Joe appeared beside us in an instant, with Hector by his side. Hector hugged me, and Joe patted Carter's back to calm him down. The Marines are in a slight daze since, from what I can hear, they had people on the chopper. Carter breaks away from me and wipes his face with his Transformers t-shirt. \"Are you okay?\" I asked. He nodded and sat down on the ground next to me, with Hector on my other side. \"So what happens now?\" I asked Joe. Joe sighed and replied, \"I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. C'mon, Hector.\" When Hector left with Joe, a Marine came and stood in his place. He looked young, around my age at least. I guess he noticed me staring at him, so he turned around. \"You might want to take a picture, it'll last longer,\" he jokes. Embarassed, obvious by my flaming cheeks, I remark, \"Sure, why not? At least, I'll have something pleasant to look at while people get blown up.\" His smile faded and there was hurt in his eyes. \"Sorry, that was inconsiderate of me. I didn't mean it like that.\" He sighed and shrugged. \"It's fine. I'm Scott.\" He put his hand out for me to shake. I took it and replied, \"I'm Layla, and this is my brother, Carter. Over there, is my uncle Joe, and cousin, Hector.\" I pointed down the hall where Joe was talking to some men, and Hector was sharing his nerd candy with the other kids. \"Well, at least you have your family with you. How long have you guys been here?\" \"A few hours at the most. It's a long story. Maybe if we survive this, I might tell it to you.\" He smiled a small smile at me, and Carter asked, \"Are those things gonna kill us?\" \"Don't worry, we're gonna make sure that that doesn't happen, okay?\" Scott reassures him. Suddenly, a loud bang went off and the Marines began shuffling us toward the back of the building. \"What's going on?\" Carter whispered to Scott, who was in front of us. \"We're going to get you out of here,\" he answered. AN: A long overdue chapter 2! I wrote this inbetween classes ( a growing habit of mine) at college, so it is not as good as I wanted it to be, but I wanna thank you guys for all of your wonderful reviews! Thanks! Please Review![Chapter 3] AN: Thank you guys for the wonderful reviews/alerts that I have been receiving! You guys are awesome, and I feel so loved! Here is the long overdue chapter 3! Enjoy! Soon, we were being ushered from the back of the building to a city bus that the soldiers were gonna use to get us out of the area. Once we were all inside, the bus began moving at a steady pace, not fast enough to attract the aliens, but not slow enough to get us out either. The soldiers were scattered throughout the bus, with us 'civilians' in the middle. Carter nestled his head in my chest, and I wrapped my arms around him. Joe was in front of us, shielding Hector, and Scott was looking out of the window, intensely. Despite all of the dirt and grime on his face, he still looked young and innocent, but the look in his sky-blue eyes were mature, like they had seen and experienced things I probably wouldn't understand. I realized that I was staring again, and glanced down at my shoes, but I swear that I saw Scott smirking out of the corner of my eye. One of the leaders of the group was whispering into a radio, and suddenly, an alien ship started hovering over the bus. The bus stopped and everyone quieted immediately. I pieced it together quickly, and whispered to Scott, \"I think the aliens can tap into the radio. I think that's why the ship is following us. They can hear us…\" Scott looked confused, but then realization dawned on his face. He turned to another soldier and repeated what I had just told him. I held Carter tighter as the Marine who found us took the radio and bolted out of the bus. Everyone started freaking out, and Joe looked at me questioningly. I shrugged my shoulders and adjusted myself so I could look out of the window. I couldn't see much because some debris was blocking my way. I slumped down and everyone screamed when a loud BOOM came out of nowhere. Instinctively, I shielded Carter, and felt someone slam their body into mine. There was a loud crash, and everyone looked at each other with confusion. I tried to move, but someone was hovering over me. It was Scott. I raised my eyebrows at him and cleared my throat to get his attention. He turned to me and noticed the position that we were in. \"Oops, sorry. Reflex,\" he mumbled. I noticed the slight pink coloring of his cheeks. Xxx Apparantly, the Marine had figured out what I had, and had used the radio to distract the alien ship long enough to take it down with a grenade. Now, we were on the outskirts of the city, maneuvering past debris and blown-up cars on an off ramp. Carter held my hand and hummed quietly to himself. I realized that it was an old lullaby that our mom used to sing to us. My heart ached at the memory of our parents, but I had to be strong, so I held back the tears that were threatening to spill over. Scott, the ever-observer, noticed and mouthed, \"Are you okay?\" I nodded and smiled sadly. Everyone groaned when the bus started shaking and we stopped suddenly. Unfortunately for us, we were out of off ramp, and there were a few aliens nearby. Talk about being between 'a rock and a hard place!' \"What are we going to do now?\" I whispered to Scott. Xxx \"Layla, can you hear me? Layla!\" Scott yelled at me as he shook my limp body. I was curled up in a ball, trying to erase the most recent memory from my mind. A few hours ago, our bus became under attack and the soldiers spilt up into three groups: the first group was to fight off the aliens, the second group was to protect us, and the last group had climbed down below the off ramp to catch us as they rappelled us over it. Everything was so chaotic and happened so fast that it just seems like a distant memory now. But one of the things I do remember quite clearly was when Uncle Joe spotted an alien nearby, picked up a gun from one of the fallen soldiers, and fired at it. Luckily, he killed it, but he got shot as well. Then, I finished climbing over the side of the ramp and Scott caught me before I let go of the rope. I think I passed out after that… I sighed and opened my eyes. It seemed as if we were in some kind of department store, and it was dark. Scott turned on a flashlight and stared at me with sad eyes. \"Is he…is he dead?\" I asked, barely a whisper. Scott shook his head and sat down next to me. \"No, but it doesn't look good. I'm so sorry, Layla. I really am.\" He leaned over and wiped the tears from my face. I took down my ponytail and put it back up in a loose bun. Scott pulled a loose strand of hair back behind my ear and my face tingled from the touch. I looked at him, reached up, and took his hand. In the back of my mind, I felt as if we were breaking the rules a little, but I realized that we had crossed that line a long time ago. I glanced around and Scott, never breaking his gaze from my face, said, \"He's with your cousin and uncle up front. We're trying to do the best we can to find help soon. The airbase isn't that far from here.\" \"What if the aliens have already blown it up? I mean, think about it…\" \"That's what we're afraid of. While you were still unconscious, we were waiting for the bombs to drop, but nothing happened. We're trying to figure out what's going on. But we DO know that the aliens are here for our natural resources, that's why they're taking over.\" \"So, they traveled across the universe for some water? What the hell?\" Scott snickered and continued, \"It's a little more than just thirst. They use water like we use oil for cars. It's their fuel.\" \"Oh, that makes sense. Scott, can I ask you something?\" \"Hmm?\" \"Where is your family?\" Scott tensed up, and I knew immediately that it was a sensitive subject for him. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked…\" \"No,\" he spoke up, \"it's just that I never really had a family. The thing is…my mom gave me up when I was a baby. Since then, I lived in foster home after foster home. The last foster home I lived in, my foster mom's dad had been a Sergeant in the Army, and since I was about to be eighteen, he encouraged me to join the military, so I did.\" I rested my head on his shoulder and asked, \"How do you feel about it now?\" \"I could do without the aliens and such, but it's still the best decision I ever made,\" he replied confidently. I looked up at him and he was smiling at me. I smiled back and noticed how close our faces were. Scott's face began to get closer and closer, and my breath hitched in my throat. Suddenly, someone opened the door at the end of the hallway we were in, and Carter was there, staring at us. I blushed in embarrassment, and stood up a little too quickly. Scott sighed and followed me down the hallway. I took Carter's hand and he led me to the room where Uncle Joe was resting. Beads of sweat covered his forehead, and he was wrapped up in a thick bundle of blankets. Joe smiled when he saw me, but then he glanced between me and Scott, like he knew something was going on. He smiled even wider and motioned for us to come beside him. I knelt down next to Hector and wrapped my arm around him. He turned and sobbed silently into my shoulder. I held my tears in, trying to stay strong for the boys. I grabbed Joe's hand with my free one and smiled sadly at his weak state. \"Layla, I think we both know that I'm not going to make it,\" he said in a weak voice, \"But you will.\" \"Joe, I don't think I can do this by myself. I'm not even twenty years old yet,\" I mumbled. He shook his head at me. \"Layla, you are one of the strongest young women I know. Just like your mother and aunt were. You can do this, I know you can. You just have to be brave and believe that you are strong.\" I nodded. \"Okay. I will…try.\" Then, Joe turned to Scott, whom I hadn't realized was still standing in the background, and said, \"Young man, can you make me a promise?\" Scott nodded, \"Anything.\" \"Just promise me that you'll get my family out of here.\" Scott paused but then he replied, \"I promise, with all my heart.\" \"Good, I'm trusting you, both of you, with all that I have left in the entire world.\" Joe squeezed my hand and whispered so that only I could hear, \"He seems like a nice boy, don't let him get away, okay?\" I blinked in surprise. \"What are you talking about?\" \"You know exactly what I'm talking about, Layla. I might be dying, but I'm not dead yet.\" I giggled a little and shook my head. \"I love you, Uncle Joe.\" \"I love you, too, kiddo.\" Hector shifted out of my arms and hugged Joe. \" I love you, Daddy.\" Carter took Joe's other hand and also said, \"I love you.\" By then, Scott had informed me that we were getting to go on the move again. AN: So yeah, this chapter is like WAAAYYY overdue, I know. But college and other aspects of my life have kept me busy. Plus, I had slight writer's block for a while. I hope you guys liked this chapter. I didn't want to stay on the action parts, as that's what's the movie is for, so I just summed it up so that I could move on to the romance parts. I know I ended this chapter kinda sad but the next chapter will have a bit more romance to balance it out (for those who know what's coming). Anyways, please review![Chapter 4] When we finally reached Santa Monica Airport, most of it was wiped out. Bodies were everywhere, buildings, planes, and debris were in flames, and there was no sign of life anywhere. The soldiers were dragging Joe's body, which was getting paler by the minute, and I was holding Carter's hand as we walked behind them. Hector held Scott's hand and it broke my heart to see him trying so hard to stay strong. We found cover in one of the buildings that had not been completely damaged, and they took Joe into a back room. Hector let go of Scott's hand and followed. Carter looked at me, and I let him go after Hector. Scott went to go talk to the medical officer, and I went over to Michelle and the girls. \"I'm so sorry, Layla. I really am,\" Michelle said in a low voice. \"I know. But it was bound to happen to one of us. I think I've seen enough movies to know that aliens don't play nice, anyways. People die every day. It just so happens that today I lost everybody all at once.\" Michelle put a hand on my shoulder. \"Don't say that. You have lost people, yes, but you still have Carter and Hector. And I'm here for you, too.\" I smiled a sad smile, which Michelle returned. At this moment, she reminded me of my mother, since that was exactly what my mom would say at a time like this. \"You'll make a great mom, someday,\" I smiled. Michelle chuckled and replied, \"Thanks, but I'm not so sure if that is even happening anytime soon.\" I was about to open my mouth to say something else, when Scott called me. I wandered toward the back and found him hovering in the doorway to the room Joe was in. His helmet was off and some of the dirt and blood off of his face had been removed. I couldn't make out what color his hair was since there was so much dirt in it and it was so dark, but I was pretty sure that it might be blond. I smiled when I saw him and he noticed my presence. \"Hey,\" he smiled at me with sad eyes. He looked as if he pitied me, which made me heart drop. I bit my lip. I didn't want his damn pity. \"Hey, how is he?\" He sighed and ruffled his hair to shake some of the dirt out. \"I'm gonna be honest and say that he's not gonna make it, Layla. I'm so sorry.\" He reached out to touch my arm, but I snatched it back from his grip. Tears began to well in my eyes and my stomach was in knots. Scott seemed taken aback by my coldness, but he sighed as if he understood what I was going through. Then, I heard the sobs of my brother and cousin, and knew that we had lost Joe forever. I was on my own now. I had to look after two young boys, with no help at all. Xxx I wanted to be alone, so I took off toward the back of the building where no one would see me cry. I just let everything that I had been holding in-losing my dad and uncle, all of the innocent people that had been killed, my growing feelings for Scott- just spill out into my sobs. After a while, I heard footsteps approach and I yelled, \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\" The footsteps stopped for a moment, but then they slowly started up again. I felt someone sit beside me, and wrap their arms around me. I shifted into their lap, and felt the fabric of Scott's uniform. I clutched his chest and continued to sob onto him. Scott patted my back and hummed softly. The melody of his humming reminded me of a song, so I began to sing softly: Sing me to sleep, Sing me to sleep, I'm tired and I.. I want to go to bed Sing me to sleep, Sing me to sleep, And then leave me alone. Don't try to wake me in the morning 'Cause I will be gone. Don't feel bad for me I want you to know, Deep in the cell of my heart I will feel so glad to go. Sing me to sleep, Sing me to sleep, I don't want to wake up On my own anymore. Sing to me, Sing to me, I don't want to wake up On my own anymore. Don't feel bad for me I want you to know, Deep in the cell of my heart I really want to go. (ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh) Sing me to sleep, Sing me to sleep, (oooooooahhhhhhh) There is another world There is a better world Well, there must be. Ohhhhh, there must be. There is another world. There is a better world. I think I drifted off to sleep after a while, and Scott must've followed shortly after, because soon there was some rumbling and yelling that awoke us. I wiped my face and stared up into Scott's dazzling blue eyes. I didn't know what kind of emotions that were flowing through them, so I asked, \"What are you thinking?\" \"That you're the strongest, fierciest, smartest, and most beautiful girl I have ever met,\" he replied confidently. I frowned, \"We've only known each other for about a day, Scott.\" He nodded, \" I know, but you can learn a lot about a person when you go through as many near-death experiences as we've had.\" I shifted out of Scott's lap and stood up. Scott stood up and looked down at his feet, suddenly shy. I dusted myself off and then hugged him tightly. When I was about to pull back, Scott leaned down and kissed me. The kiss was very brief, but also sweet and gentle. I felt myself smile and things began to look up. AN: I just want to say that this I won't be able to update this fic until next week, since finals will be over for me. But thanks so much for the reviews/fav/ alerts! Keep Reviewing! The song is Asleep by the Smiths, but I like the Sucker Punch version a little better.[Chapter 5] AN:Thank you guys once again for the wonderful reviews/fav/story alerts! This chapter is my favorite, but also kinda sad, too. The title of this chapter is a mash-up of the songs I used in it, Don't Forget by Demi Lovato and Set Fire to the Rain by Adele. Enjoy… I let it fall, my heart And as it fell, you rose to claim it It was dark and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me When we joined the others, everyone was collecting supplies and reloading their guns. I found Carter and Hector by Michelle, eating some canned fruit. Scott had to go reconvene with his unit, but kissed my forehead before leaving me. I sighed, wondering if we really had a real future after this was over. It would take years to clean up the mess the aliens left behind, once there was a solution to defeat them (if there even was one), and I probably wouldn't see Scott for a long time. Suddenly, my heart felt heavy and weak. I snapped out of it and went over to check up on the boys. Both of their eyes were red from crying and their cheeks were stained with dried tears. But Hector had a determined look in his eyes, and I smiled weakly at him. Carter noticed my return and handed the can back to Hector. Then, he got up and hugged me. Scott returned back to me with a sad, but hopeful look on his face. It was a very contradictory facial expression. \"What is it?\" I asked. \"We managed to get in contact with Echo Company, and we will be heading to an alternate extraction point in a few minutes. We're going to be shipped out by helicopter, but once we get to the base, I…\" Scott was interrupted when a few soldiers came over and grabbed my arm and Carter's, and began shuffling us into a tank. Michelle, Hector, and the girls were already inside, with some of the soldiers. \"SCOTT!\" I yelled, but the door was shut in my face. Carter stroked my back to comfort me, and I wrapped my arms around my legs as the tank started moving. It was a bumpy ride, since we ran into a small scuffle of the aliens, but luckily, we managed to make it out unscathed. I bit my lip as I hoped Scott, who was in the Humvee behind us with the rest of his unit, was okay and still following us. The tank shook again, and I went to my happy place, where there were no aliens, just Scott and me. When laying with you I could stay there, close my eyes Feel you here, forever You and me together, nothing is better The tank stopped and I heard the sound of a helicopter. The kids perked up and were actually smiling, which in turn, made Michelle and I smile also. Then, the tank's door opened again, and we were quickly pulled out and pushed into the helicopter. Carter and Hector sat close to me on both sides, with Michelle and the girls in front of us. I looked around for Scott, worry written clearly on my face, but then to my relief, he jumped inside next to Michelle as the helicopter rose from the ground. Scott beamed at me, happy that finally leaving LA. I hugged the boys tightly to my chest, but then, we screamed when the helicopter started shaking and descending rapidly. Suddenly, we were level again, and we all stared in shock at the mass destruction of the city. There was some mumbling and then, all of a sudden, someone dropped out of the helicopter. I was so busy staring at Scott that I almost missed it. Scott looked down at the ground and said, well more like yelled, \"It's my commanding officer. He's going back to take down the aliens. We can't let him go alone. I-I have to go with him, Layla!\" I wanted to scream \"NO!\" at the top of my lungs, but I knew that it would fall on deaf ears. Scott had already made up his mind, I could tell, and I wasn't, I couldn't, stop him. The rest of his unit were already climbing out of the helicopter, some watching us in with curiousity before disappearing from sight. I sighed, leaned over, and whispered in his ear, \"Then, go, Scott.\" We had it all, we were just about to fall, Even more in love, than we were before I won't forget, I won't forget us Scott inched closer and kissed me passionately on the lips. Tears were threatening to spill over, and I said, \"Don't forget me, Scott.\" \"Never. Hector, Carter, take care of your sister and each other. Your dad would have been so proud of you,\" was the last thing he said before climbing out of the helicopter. I didn't dare look back at him, but instead etched his crystal blue eyes in my memory. Then, I sobbed the whole way to the base. But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Let it burn while I cried Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name AN: I know, you probably hate me now for separating our beloved Scott and Layla, but it was coming eventually. But don't worry, they will be reunited soon, there will be at least 2-3 more chapters before it ends…Please don't hate me too much to review…[Chapter 6] AN: Sorry that I haven't updated in a while. The holidays had me crazy busy, and then I went out of town for a while. But now I'm back, but tomorrow I start my new semester of college. Yay! When we reached the base a few hours later, we learned that we were about 30 miles outside of Las Vegas. The war with the aliens however was still going on on the coasts so moving inland was the safest thing right now. After we landed, the pilot told us to go to processing so that we could get checked by a doctor, and get clothing and food. When we found the tent, we were looking for, and a tall man with a clipboard greeted us. \"Hello, there. I see that you have made it safely?\" the man asked. Michelle and I nodded. \"Alright then. Names?\" I spoke up, \"Um, Hector and Carter Rincon, and my name is Layla Rincon. No, no… Layla Rincon-Grayston.\" Michelle and the boys turned to look at me in surprise. I just shrugged. I didn't know if Scott was alive or dead at this point, but I wouldn't let the memory of him die either. Soon after, we went off to see the doctors, and the kids, Michelle, and I were deemed , they took us into an empty tent with 6 cots inside. \"Well, this looks…roomy,\" Michelle commented. Xxx A few days later, a turning point in the war came when the unit that rescued us, Scott's unit in fact, had discovered how to take down the aliens. Apparently, if you took out the aliens' command center, you rendered them basically powerless. Now, countries all over the world were following suit, so the war was to end sooner rather than later. I was glad to hear of it, but I was still worried about Scott, though. We hadn't really heard anything about Scott and the other soldiers, but I figured that they were out there, still fighting. Life on the base wasn't all that bad either. We had clean clothes, food, and water at least. After a while, some of the refugees, who were also teachers, had decided to set up some tents at the back of the base, and turn it into a makeshift school. So, every morning, Michelle and I woke up the kids, got them dressed and fed, and walked them to the \"school\". Then, Michelle would go off and help the other vetenarians with the injured animals and pets. Meanwhile, I would volunteer to help with in the \"kitchen\", cleaning pots and pans, and prepping for lunch and dinner. xxx One day, though, I got a phone call from another base. I took the satellite phone from my new friend, Patricia, and said, \"Hello?\" \"Guess who?\" My heart almost jumped out of my chest at the sound of his voice. It was still the way I remembered it, but a little more ragged, like he had been to hell and back, but maybe he had. \"SCOTT! IS THAT YOU? IS THAT REALLY YOU?\" I screamed, unable to contain myself. He laughed, \"Yes, it's me. I'm sorry that I couldn't let you know how I was, but you know, I was out there fighting.\" \"I know. I saw what you guys did. It has been all over the news. Are you okay?\" \"Yes and no. We were ambushed, and I got a little banged up. My arm is broken, and I have two fractured ribs, but I'm okay. I missed you so much, I had to hear your voice.\" \"You have no idea. He wouldn't stop talking about you and the boys. Even in his sleep,\" another male voice interrupted, laughing. I chuckled, \"Who is that?\" \"Oh, that's Imlay. He broke his leg, and he's in the bed next to me. Uh, you're on speakerphone.\" \"Yeah, that's right, so no dirty talk, you two,\" Imlay joked. \"Well, he seems to be in a good mood,\" I laughed. \"Yeah, but it might be from all of the drugs in his system. Anyways, how are you and the boys? How's Michelle?\" \"Oh, we're good. Michelle finally got in touch with her sister and son-in-law. They're still in Hawaii, but they're okay. The boys are doing better, too. We've been seeing a family grieving counselor on the base, so everyday gets a little better. They have their good days and bad days, and so do I sometimes.\" \"That's good. So any future plans?\" \"Well, I have been doing some research, and found out that my mom's sister lives in Alabama. She hasn't talked to us since my mom's funeral, but I managed to contact her. She lives in Montgomery now, with her new husband. She…wants us to come and live with her.\" There was a long pause, but then, I heard Scott sigh, \"If that's what you want to do, then that's your choice. You and the boys need to be with your family.\" \"But I want to be with you,\" I whined. \"So do I, but the war still isn't over yet. Not completely. Once I recover, I'm going right back out there to fight. They destroyed your family, and they are the reason why we are separted from each other. I'm not gonna stop until they're gone for good. It's my job, Layla.\" I twirled a piece of my hair absentmindedly, and said, \"You're right. But will I get to see you again?\" \"I can't promise you, but I can say that I will try. I will try to do everything I can to see you again.\" \"Okay.\" We talked for a little while longer, but then the drugs Scott had to take started kicking in and I had to hang up. Patricia took the phone away and stared at me. \"What?\" I shrugged in an innocent manner. She smiled mischievously, \"Nothing, nothing…\" AN: Please Review![Chapter 7] AN: So here's Chapter 7, I hope you enjoy! (And I hope that it's not too sappy and corny, because I was very inspired by the movie Dear John for this one.) I'm miles from where you are, I lay down on the cold ground And I, I pray that something picks me up And sets me down in your warm arms -Snow Patrol \"Set Fire to the Third Bar\" A year later… \"Layla, did you make sure that the boys did their homework?\" my aunt, Teresa, asked me from the kitchen. \"Yes, I did, and they're out playing in the backyard,\" I answered back from my seat at the desk in the living room. So much had changed in the past year that sometimes I barely believed that it happened. We had finally won the war against the aliens, but now the military and volunteering civilians were cleaning up debris, looking for survivors, and trying to salvage what was left of the coasts. Because of this, more and more people began showing up at the base, so the military began asking people to go and stay with relatives that lived inland. My aunt, Teresa, and her husband, Mike, lived in Montgomery, which had been untouched by the aliens, so the boys and I were sent to live with them. I still kept in touch with Michelle, who now lived in Las Vegas with her sister, brother-in-law, and her nieces. She had started working at a new vet clinic, and the girls were doing very well in school. However, they still had to go to therapy, like the boys, since they still had nightmares from our time in LA. I was trying to cope myself, often wondering where Scott was. I still loved him, and missed him terribly, and so did Carter and Hector. My aunt and uncle were really helpful with the kids, though, so that made it a little easier. Time to time, I got a phone call or email from him, but it would be very vague and brief. The last email I got from him, he said that he was in New York. That was 4 months ago . I haven't heard from him since then. So I kept myself busy by taking online classes, working with my aunt in her flower shop, and taking care of my brother and cousin. I also befriended a girl my age next door named Carmen. She was half-Puerto Rican, really sweet, and full of energy. As I finished my essay for my English class, Teresa let Carmen in and she sat in the stool beside me. \"Hey, what's up?\" \"Oh, nothing, just finishing my essay. Do you want to catch that new Tom Cruise movie? I heard it was good.\" \"Sure, but maybe later. Actually, I came by because there's someone you need to meet,\" Carmen said grinning. \"Oh no, not another blind date, Carmen!\" I whined. She was always trying to set me up with someone. I always turned them down. She grabbed my arm, pulling me out of the chair. I groaned, fighting against her. I didn't want to meet a guy, dressed like this. My hair was in a messy ponytail, and I was wearing sweats and a tank top. \"You'll like him, trust me,\" Carmen said as she opened the door. \"I mean it, Carmen; I do not-\"That's when all of the air flew out of my lungs. Because he was there, standing at the end of the walkway in front of the house. Scott's POV Layla just froze on the spot when she saw me. Her mouth was open, and her beautiful brown eyes were staring straight into my blue ones. She looked a little dishelmed, but still as beautiful as I remembered. I smiled, nervously, unsure of what she was thinking. Did she want me here? Should I just turn around and leave? Was she already seeing someone else? I didn't know what to think, let alone what to say to her. Her friend, Carmen, the one whose house I went to by mistake, glanced between us. She sighed and decided to break the ice. \"Layla, isn't this the Scott that you told me about? You are Scott, right?\" She turned to me. I nodded and turned back to Layla. Layla shook her head and rubbed her eyes. \"I'm sorry, I'm just in shock. Is it really you? Or… am I dead?\" I stepped forward as she stepped out onto the porch. I chuckled, \"No, you're not dead. I'm really here.\" When we were standing right in front of each other, she reached out her hand and briefly touched my arm. I took her hands and intertwined them with mine. She smiled, \"It is you. You came back. Why?\" \"Because I missed you, Layla. The worst part was that I didn't have a picture of you, so I had to go off of my memory in order to see your face every day. I didn't know that missing you would hurt so badly.\" She smiled and hugged me tightly. I never wanted to let her go. Then, I leaned down and whispered in her ear, \"I love you, Layla Rincon-Grayston.\" She looked up at me, tears in her eyes. \"I love you, too.\" Her lips met mine in a kiss, and heard the sound of a car honk behind us. Imlay and his girlfriend wolf-whistled from the rental car and Layla blushed. \"You brought him here?\" Layla asked. \"Who do you think drove me here from the airport?\" Layla laughed and soon, we heard the high-pitched yells of two little boys. \"Scott! Scott! You're back!\" Carter and Hector yelled as they nearly tackled me and Layla. A woman, who vaguely resembled Layla, walked out and grinned at us. I guessed that it was Layla's aunt. After a long group hug, I pulled Layla down the steps and looked over at Imlay, who was standing off to the side. He smiled and nodded. I took a deep breath and asked, \"So, Layla Rincon-Grayston? Really?\" She blushed, embarrassed. \"Well, I was sad, and I thought you might be dead. I know, very a la Titanic , huh?\" I smiled, \"I like it. But…I was thinking that if you wanted, we could make it official.\" She looked at me questioningly. \"What are you talking about, Scott?\" Imlay handed me the box from his jeans pocket and I got down on one knee. All the girls gasped, and Layla's mouth fell open…again. \"Layla, I love you, more than anything else in the world. I've been through hell and back to find you and be with you. So, will you marry me?\" I held my breath waiting for her answer. She started nodding her head before the words came out. \"Yes! Yes, I will marry you!\" Everyone cheered and Layla started jumping up and down with excitement. Then, she jumped on top of me, and we both fell onto the grass laughing our heads off. I slipped the ring onto her finger, and she looked at it approving. I leaned over, lightly kissed her lips, and wrapped my arms around her. AN: Yay! They're getting married! The next chapter will be the last one of this story. I wish it could go on, but all good things must come to an end. Thank you guys so much for the wonderful reviews, and fav/story alerts! Please review![Chapter 8] My dress was an ivory Charmeuse Side-Drape Gown with a champagne-colored sash that wrapped around my waist. My hair was pulled back into a loose bun, and curls framed my face. Pink and white flowers were placed on the side of my head as well. When I started dress shopping, I wanted a veil, but then decided against it. I looked outside the window of my 'dressing room', which was really the guest bedroom of the manor. One of Mike's clients graciously offered to host the wedding here in the backyard, and the reception was to take place under a tent near a lake on another property. I had waited for this moment my entire life, and yet my father wasn't here to walk me down the aisle and give me away. Instead, Mike had offered to do it, and I accepted since he was an overall good guy. There was a knock on the door, and Mike peeked in. \"Wow, you look so beautiful, Layla. Are you ready?\" he asked. \"Are you ever for this?\" I mumbled as we walked down the long hallway that led to the stairs, and then into the giant room where the ceremony was. Teresa was waiting for us, and motioned with her hand to start the music. I heard everyone stand and took a deep breath. Teresa patted my hand and came to stand on my other side. \"Ready?\" \"As I'll ever be,\" I said as it took everything in me to keep from crying. We descended down the stairs and my heart started beating rapidly. The room was lit with candles and flowers everywhere, and long blue drapes were hung all along the walls. At my request, the aisle was also decorated with white rose petals. When we reached the aisle, I didn't look anywhere, except at Scott. Heart beats fast Colors and promises How to be brave How can I love when I'm afraid to fall But watching you stand alone All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow One step closer It took everything in me to keep from taking off and running up the aisle to Scott. Teresa looked at me and whispered, \"Don't even think about it.\" Mike and I giggled, but proceeded to walk. Scott held out his hands, and I gave my bouquet to Teresa before taking them. The minister started the ceremony, but I barely listened to what he was saying. Time stands still Beauty in all she is I will be brave I will not let anything take away What's standing in front of me Every breath Every hour has come to this One step closer The rest was a blur, even though I did begin to tear up a little when Scott and I exchanged our vows. Scott started tearing up too, and I smiled at the boys, who were sitting with Teresa and Mike.. \"I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride,\" the minister said in a booming voice. When we kissed, the music started again. I have died everyday waiting for you Darling don't be afraid I have loved you For a thousand years I'll love you for a thousand more And all along I believed I would find you Time has brought your heart to me I have loved you for a thousand years I'll love you for a thousand more When we broke apart, I grinned at him. \"Did you pick this song?\" I whispered. \"Yeah, it reminded me of us,\" he whispered back. \"I love you,\" I said a little louder as we walked out of the room. \"I love you, too.\" The End AN: Well, thank you guys! It was great writing this story. I am really glad people like it. Thanks! ","Summary":" Author's Note: I saw Battle: LA a week ago (I live overseas) and thought it was awesome. But one of"},{"Movie":"Battle: Los Angeles","Title":"Battle: London","Author":"Anzac123","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8381124","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Two possibilities exist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.\"- Arthur C. Clarke Hexham, England February 29th, 2008 There couldn't have been a better night for the two teens to sneak out. The night sky was completely devoid of clouds allowing the sky to show its complete array of stars. The temperature was comfortable and a slight breeze prevented it from being muggy. Andrew Webster and Jennifer Cartwright lay intertwined on a blanket in a field not too far from the town. Both grew up in London where the lights of the city blocked out most of the stars. Out in the country however there was no interference with the sky's natural light show. \"What constellation is that?\" Andrew asked pointing up at the sky. Jennifer furrowed her brow for a moment. \"It's Perseus. The guy who killed Medusa and married Andromeda.\" Jennifer said. Despite growing up in the city she knew more about stars than most amateur astronomers. Andrew twirled a finger in her strawberry blonde hair. \"You going to teach our kids how to spot all these stars?\" Andrew asked. They were only fifteen but they'd been dating for five years. Kids may have been a while off but it was nice to think about it. \"Of course. The stars are a wonderful thing.\" Jennifer said smiling. Andrew chuckled to himself. \"What?\" \"Our kids are going to learn all about the stars from you and they'll know everything there is to know about the military from me. I just find that funny.\" Andrew said with a smirk. Jennifer propped herself up on one elbow. \"You're really serious about joining?\" The look on Jennifer's face told Andrew she was totally against it. Andrew shrugged his shoulders and looked up at the sky. \"Yeah. I mean it kinda runs in the family. I'll be fine so don't worry.\" \"My dad said the same thing.\" Jennifer said coldly and lay back down. The look of joy on her face she had when she was talking about stars and kids had been replaced by a look of sadness and disappointment. \"I love you.\" Andrew said pulling Jennifer closer. \"No matter what happens I'll be okay. I love you too much to let something happen to me.\" \"You ever wonder what's up there?\" Jennifer asked changing the subject in a split second. Andrew looked back up at the stars. He couldn't even begin to count how many he could see and the idea of there being millions more put him in a state of awe. \"Like what? More stars?\" Andrew replied. His right hand traced figure eights along her inner thigh. \"Like someone up there wondering what it's like down here.\" Jennifer said ignoring the slight tingling in between her legs. Andrew was now kissing her neck. She hoped he didn't leave any hickies because if her dad found out she snuck out there would be hell to pay. \"I've never really thought about it. There could be.\" Andrew said between kisses. At the moment his mind wasn't on the possibility of the existence of alien life. \"You think we'll ever meet them?\" Andrew stopped and looked at Jennifer. She was staring up at the sky with a slight smile on her face. He shrugged and went back to kissing her neck. He tried to slip his hand in her pajama pants but she grabbed his hand. \"Answer me first.\" she said with a seductive edge to her voice. \"I don't know.\" Andrew said and pulled his hand back. \"I sure hope we do.\" Jennifer said rolling on top of Andrew. \"If you want it so bad I'll build a spaceship, fly into space, grab the first alien I see, and bring it back to you love.\" Andrew said as he started rubbing her side. \"I love you, hun.\" Jennifer said. She felt Andrew's warm hand slip up the back of her shirt. \"I love you too.\" Andrew said and tacked on a smile to show he meant it. \"I know.\" Jennifer muttered. As much as she hated to admit her thoughts weren't on Andrew. All she could think of was how amazing it would be to meet something from another planet. She was so entranced in her own thoughts she didn't even notice that Andrew had undid her bra. Honestly, she didn't care either.[Chapter 2] \"War is sweet to those who have never experienced it.\"-Pindar Bulford, England August 11th, 2011 The normal boredom that surrounded Bulford Barracks was broken. The men of the 3rd Mechanized Division, 19th Light Brigade, 2nd Rifles waited in the football fields north of the base. One thousand three hundred men sat grouped in sections waiting for the helicopters to take them away. The base was fully mobilizing. Most men talked quietly among themselves about what they had just seen a mere six hours ago. The great balls of fire streaking downwards, the way they slowed down a few hundred feet off the ground, the destruction of the docked HMS Belfast, the landing of the things in the Thames River, and the advance of the mechanically looking things from the beach. They remembered how vast groups of people were wiped out by missiles launched by what looked like small walking tanks. Very few of them had seen something like that. Only the few that had been in Afghanistan had seen things like small crowds of people wiped out in a single explosion. All the young men who once talked about how they so badly wanted to go into battle were now quiet. All of them knew exactly where they were going; London. It was on the shores of the Thames River that the things first appeared. And it wasn't only London that was experiencing such an event. Reports were coming in from places like New York, Paris, Hong Kong, Sydney, Cairo, and Los Angeles. \"Well organized, equipped with advanced technology, and extremely tough to kill.\" was how the intel pukes at the briefing described them. Initial reports indicate they are mechanical in some nature with a metal exoskeleton. Their weapons use some kind of incendiary rounds that are extremely lethal. They have no air force so the Royal Air Force is slowing down their advance by bombing the piss out of them. This hasn't stopped them from occupying a large part of the city. And in the chaos of it all the more and more aliens are landing in the Thames River. One such section was led by Corporal Willis Westmorland. Under his command were Lance Corporal David Pirie, Rifleman Andrew Webster, Rifleman Anton Marshal, Rifleman Kyle Smith, Rifleman Eric Osburne, Rifleman Alex Franks, and Rifleman Stanley Garrison. All of the men sat in the freshly cut grass but Corporal Willis. He stood searched the sky with a crossed arms and a deep frown on his face. He kept checking his watch every thirty seconds. \"Willie, I don't think checkin your watch is gonna make those helis come any faster.\" Rifleman Anton said setting his L110 Light Machine Gun on his lap. Corporal Willis shot Rifleman Anton a look that would melt an ice cube but Rifleman Anton just smiled. Rifleman Alex Franks sat on one knee with a sketchpad. He was putting his final touches on a drawing of Corporal Willis. He leaned over and showed Rifleman Andrew that drawing. He did his best to stifle a laugh. The drawing was too funny. It was Corporal Willis in his present pose but in a bunny suit. The drawing was so funny because Corporal Willis was the manliest man in the entire British Army. \"You saw the ways those bleedin walkin tanks wiped out of those civvies?\" Rifleman Kyle asked Rifleman Eric who was his L12A1 40mm Grenade Launcher. \"Yeah, man. I've never seen anything like that. You think we gonna be able to knock those buggers out?\" \"I think we can knock it on its arse.\" Rifleman Kyle said poking a finger at the MBT LAW Rocket Launchers that Rifleman Anton and Rifleman Alex carried on their backs. \"And when we knock it on its arse it's gonna get back up and wanna knock us on our arse.\" Rifleman Eric said. \"That's why they issue us ground pounders two of the things.\" Rifleman Kyle said with a grin. Lance Corporal David Pirie sat a few yards away from the rest of the squadron reading his all-time favorite book; All's Quiet On The Western Front. He first read the book in primary school and had fallen in love with it. It was because of this book he joined the army. He wanted to experience what a war was like. He wanted to form an unbreakable bond with the fireteam under his command like the men in the book had. In all honestly he got excited when the Tinnies, as the men called them, opened fire. It meant he and his men were going to be deployed. Now here they were, in a football field waiting for the helicopters to whisk them off to all the glory of battle. Corporal Willis called him a horrible person for wanting to go into combat but he didn't care. He was ready. The first EH101 appeared as a little dot over the horizon. Several other Merlins followed close behind. Groaning and griping in the typical army way, the men cleared the football fields to allow the helicopters to land. The crew chiefs beckoned the men to come aboard. \"Let's go!\" Corporal Willis barked to his section as he led the jog to one of the Merlins. The crew chief helped each man get into the helicopter and helped them sit down. After Corporal Willis' section was seated two more were brought in filling the helicopter. With a total of twenty-four troops excluding the crew chief the air inside of the cabin got stale and hot fast. The smell of oil and gasoline overpowered the men's nose. There was a collective sigh of relief as the helicopter took off and the crew chief left both side doors open flooding the cabin with fresh air. The helicopters circled the base a few times allowing the other helicopters to take off. Eight WAH-64 Apaches met up with the helicopters and the small air fleet headed off. They flew directly over A303 were a long column of Challenger 2 Tanks and Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicles was heading towards London and an even longer trail of civilian vehicles were heading away from it. They flew over Andover and Whitechurch which seemed to be perfectly calm. The men caught a glimpse of Basingstoke which was filled with military vehicles heading towards London. They continued east to Woking where they turned north. As they were passing over Staines they could see smoke rising from the city. A Tornado GR4 streaked by with its wings laden with bombs. The men felt suddenly tense as they approached Heathrow Airport. As they descended they saw ten AS-10 Self Propelled Artillery Pieces fire off a salvo. They hopped off the helicopters which didn't stick around longer than needed leaving the men. Heathrow had become a Forward Operating Base or FOB. All coordinating forces fighting in London was being directed from here. They were crowded into a massive tent where a tough looking colonel gave told them what they needed to know. \"Men of Her Royal Majesty's Army, we are facing a threat like we have never faced before. An unknown alien species has made landfall in our country. Most of London south of the Thames is theirs. Our main line of resistance is here.\" The bulldog faced colonel pointed to a map that had a red line that was a few blocks behind the north shore of the Thames River. \"Whatever these things are, they are smart. They're focusing most of their forces pushing north with just a minor screening force engaging our forces to the west. We're going to use this time to get as many civilians as we can out of the area before retreating across the Richmond Bridge and sending it to the bottom of the Thames. Drones have spotted a large build-up of hostile forces and we believe they are going to push west in an attempt to divide our forces. They are going to have to cross the Richmond Bridge and Twickenham Road Bridge to achieve this. We are not going to let them cross those bridges. But before we go through that we have a casualty med evac site in Richmond Green. This mission will have two parts. I need you to support the men already at Richmond Green and assist in the evacuation of civilians. This shouldn't take more than thirty minutes people. After, you will make your way to defensive positions around the two bridges. Now our engineers are going to wire both bridges to blow but they will rely on you to keep hostiles off of them. You will have armoured support. Once they are finished all of you haul arse back to friendly lines so we can blow the bridge and stop the Tinnie attack before it starts. The RAF will be providing you with close air support so this shouldn't be too hard. Now men, this enemy is unlike any we have faced before. They seem to know what we are going to do before we even do it. Their weapons are unlike any we have ever seen too. When they fight you better hope you are ready because these fucks won't just charge you. They have been observed taking cover and using covering fire. They fight just like us, people. They are tough but they can be killed. These bastards aren't invincible and they know we know that. If we stop them here we can stop reacting to their moves and have them reacting to us for once. Now go to the armory and load up. Make sure you take plenty of grenades. You'll need them. May God be with you all.\" The colonel saluted us smartly and nodded. They all stood and returned the gesture before walking out. Corporal Willis saw Lance Corporal David and ran to catch up with him. \"Are you ready?\" Corporal Willis asked shouting a little over the roar of jets taking off and helicopters landing. \"I'm ready to kick some alien arse!\" Lance Corporal David barked. Corporal Willis just shook his head. \"Now don't go Rambo on me. I want you to stow that bloody heroics shit because that shit is gonna get you killed. I can't afford to lose you, mate. You're me second in command. If you bite the dirt then imma have to let one of those kids lead Delta Fireteam and that is gonna get even more men killed. You got that?\" \"Gotchya. No heroics.\" Lance Corporal David repeated and nodded his head. Corporal Willis patted him on the shoulder and disappeared in the crowd. The line that stretched from the airport terminal was long. The terminal was now where they kept scores of ammunition and gear. The munitions were displayed like lunch would be at a cafeteria. Corporal Willis got seven magazines for his L85A2 and three for his Browning Hi-Power. He only took three L109A1 HE Fragmentation Grenades. Lance Corporal David took eight magazines for his L85A2 and one spare magazine for his Browning Hi-Power. He only grabbed one L109A1. Rifleman Andrew grabbed ten magazines for his L85A2 and took four 40mm grenades. Deciding it was two heavy he put two magazines back. He clipped two L109s to his tactical vest and continued moving. Rifleman Anton inspected four boxes of ammunition for his L110A1 and one L901A1. Rifleman Kyle took seven magazines for his L129A1. He looked at the tray of grenades and decided against it. He was one of the two sections designated marksmen. He couldn't afford to be weighed down by the extra weight. Rifleman Eric took only five magazines for his L85A2 and four grenades for his 40mm grenade launcher. Rifleman Alex grabbed as many boxes of ammunition as he could effectively carry. He took five grenades and made sure he had two extra rockets for his MBT LAW. Rifleman Stanley figured they wouldn't be doing much shooting. He took only four magazines for his L129A1. The men headed outside and secured all of their gear on various combat netting and pockets. The section now looked like a force to be reckoned with. In civilian clothes they all looked like a bunch of lanky kids not even out of their twenties. In Osprey body armor and laden with weapons they looked like deadly killing machines. A line of Warrior IFVs were already had their back ramps down. The three man crews of the Warriors were stretching their limbs close to the vehicles. When they say the growing number of troopers they hopped in their vehicles and started up the engines. The roar of over a dozen Perkins V-8 Condor engines only momentarily overtook the sound of artillery fire. The men headed for the Warriors and immediately found something wrong. Each Warrior could only seat seven troops. Corporal Willis found the solution. The section leader would squat down in the middle of the troop compartment while the rest of the men sat in the seats. It wouldn't be comfortable but it would save the IFVs from having to make a second trip. Corporal Willis' Section crowded into the dank compartment of the Warrior and sat with the exception of Corporal Willis. The men watched with growing fear as the back ramp rose slowly blocking out the light from outside. Rifleman Anton felt an icy ball form in his stomach. \"I got a bad feeling about this, mate.\" Rifleman Eric said to Rifleman Anton as he nudged him with his elbow. \"Me too, man. I don't like where this might end up.\" Rifleman Anton replied. Rifleman Anton rubbed the small golden cross that hung around his neck. The IFVs lurched forward and headed towards their destinations. The Warriors they were in had just been shipped back from Afghanistan and had been partially disassembled. They put them back together completely with the minor exception of the air condition units. The air inside the Warrior was stale and smelled heavily of oil. It made the men dizzy. About halfway there the radios that every man carried crackled to life. \"This is Captain Steve Barrios. Men of the 2nd Rifles I believe now is the proper time for a prayer. I know I am one of the few Catholics in the unit but I ask you now to disregard your religious preference at the moment and bow your head in prayer with me.\" All of the men in the IFVs bowed their heads. Even the drivers did stealing occasionally peaks at the road. A few men made the sign of the cross as the prayer began. The crackle of the radio made the captain's voice seem slightly distorted yet firm. \"Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. They will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.\" All of the men no matter what religion made the sign of the cross at the conclusion of the prayer. Many saw this like their last rights. There was no cheering, no more smack talk. There was only silence and the clank of weapons as men checked and re-checked them.[Chapter 3] War is not an adventure. It is a disease.\"-Antoine de Saint-Exupery London, England August 11th, 2011 Light streamed into the backs of the Warrior as the ramps lowered. The smell of gunpowder and the screams of the wounded greeted Corporal Willis as he stepped out of the Warrior. The IFVs had somehow gotten through the mass of people on the bridge and was droppings them off right next to Richmond Field. The rest of the section stumbled out shielding their eyes from the sun. As the men formed up a man jogged towards them waving his arm above his head. \"You unlucky buggers must be Second Rifles.\" the man said looking them over. His face was covered in soot and his uniform had numerous holes in it. Most of his left sleeve was burned off and he had a bandage wrapped tightly around his head like a turban. \"Bravo Company. We're full strength and ready to assist.\" Major Steve said with a nod. \"Leftenant Erin Cartwright at your service, sir.\" the man said as he snapped off a slopped salute. \"You're the highest ranking officer?\" Major Steve asked as he returned the gesture. \"Well we did have a leftenant colonel with us when we were coming here but we got ambushed and he took a few rounds to the chest. That made me the commander of this hodgepodge group of men here. We have men from every unit in the British Army I'd like to say.\" Lieutenant Erin said as he scratched his bandage. \"We're here to reinforce you and assist in the movement of civilians.\" Major Steve said. \"Well we could use some reinforcin' but I'd suggest you don't mess with the civvies. They're moving around perfectly fine without us getting in the way. Just set your men up around the perimeter of the field. Just tell your men to give the helis enough room to get the last of the wounded out.\" Lieutenant Erin said. Corporal Willis looked over the crude defensives. Nothing but sandbags stacked up to about chest height. While the bags might stop small caliber rounds they weren't enough of them to absorb the shock of a grenade or something along that sort. \"Do you have anything we can beef up the defenses with?\" Corporal Willis asked. \"What you see is what you get, mate.\" Lieutenant Erin said and shrugged. \"Our perimeter is pretty thin. Ya' won't mind deploying your men, eh?\" \"Not at all.\" Major Steve replied. He tapped his radio earpiece twice. \"Second Rifles, perimeter defense! Do not fire unless fired upon! I don't need some bugger with an itchy trigger finger shootin' up civvies! \" The men fanned out and took their positions. They really didn't have much to do besides watch the steady stream of civilians go by. Chinooks constantly landed and took off behind them. They had medics on board the Chinooks so they needed no help loading the wounded. It didn't take long at all for all the people who were WIA to get airlifted out of there. Despite the semi-calm aurora all of the men were tense and were ever vigil. Rifleman Andrew didn't give a rat's arse about the Chinooks at the moment. He was trying to scan each face in the fast moving crowd. Jennifer had to be safe. She was visiting family here last time he heard from her. Sure they'd been broken up a few months but right then and there that didn't matter to him. He had to find her. He saw all walks of life in the stream of refugees. Poor, middleclass, rich. They were all heading in the same direction. Most didn't even bat an eyelash at the soldiers but a few peeled off and tried to enter their perimeter. They were always turned away and told to keep heading west where it was safe. Rifleman Andrew spotted what he thought may have been Jennifer. It was hard to tell because the woman's face was almost covered in blood. He kept an eye on her as she got closer. He sighed with defeat when he realized it wasn't her. Instead of giving up he kept searching for a needle in a haystack so to say. \"That's an ace house, eh?\" Rifleman Anton said as he let his L110A1 rest on the sandbag wall. He looked over at Rifleman Stanley and laughed quietly to himself. The kid had fallen asleep standing up. \"Oi.\" Rifleman Anton said and nudged him with his elbow. \"Yeah. What.\" Rifleman Stanley gasp suddenly wide awake. He went to bring his L129A1 to his shoulder but the more senior Rifleman Anton stopped him. \"That's an ace house.\" Rifleman Anton repeated bucking his head to the house across the street from them. It was a nice two story bungalow that was painted a pearly white. A suitcase and a few articles of clothes were scattered on the well-kept front yard. The front door was open and in the doorway was a teddy bear leaning against the doorframe. \"Too true. Wouldn't be able to afford it with an enlisted salary though.\" Rifleman Stanley said frowning. Rifleman Anton did the calculations in his head and came up with the same outcome. He couldn't help but frown too. \"So what was it like fighting the Tinnies?\" Rifleman Eric asked one of the soldiers who had come in contact with the aliens. \"Fight?\" the soldier snorted. \"They tore me unit to feckin' shreds. I think McGregor and I were the only ones left from Sixth Battalion.\" The whole time the soldier spoke he never stopped scanning the area in front of him. It made Rifleman Eric nervous. \"What unit were you in?\" Rifleman Eric asked scanning the landscape in front of him too. Not much to see but row after row of houses. \"Fifty-Second Lowland Regiment.\" was the soldiers brief replied. That explained to Rifleman Eric why the man said fucking so funny. He was Scottish. \"About how many rounds it take to kill the bastards?\" Rifleman Eric asked as he tapped the trigger guard. The soldier looked at him from the corner of his eyes for a brief second. \"Loads of feckin' questions, eh. I only slotted one of the sheep fuckers and it took damn near a whole magazine.\" Rifleman Eric gulped making his adam's apple bob up and down like in cartoons. WAH-64 Apaches flew overhead firing their rocket pods. Rifleman Eric could feel the resulting explosions vibrate his bones. The stream of people slowed to a trickle and then stopped completely. He clenched his jaw so tight you would have thought it was wired shut. He could feel it; not long now. Corporal Willis wasn't sure who first spotted it but he knew it was bad news as soon as someone yelled something that every infantrymen fears. \"GAS! GAS! GAS!\" Corporal Willis wasted no time taking his gasmask out of its carrying case and slipping it over his head. He took out the plug and took a breath of rubbery tasting air. He looked to his left and right making sure the rest of the men were doing the same. Thankfully none of them had freaked out at the call. He hated wearing gasmasks. They restricted his vision and fogged up way too much for his liking. However at the moment it seemed like his best chance for survival. Back at the FOB a group of stern faced officers were gathered around the screen showing the video feed from one of the dozens of Global Hawk UAVs circling over London. This one in particular showed a milky white cloud rolling heading towards the men at Richmond Green. The cloud flowed like a wave swallowing everything it came in contact with. It rapidly came closer and closer to the entrenched men. The tension was so thick in the room you could have cut it with knife when the gas cloud washed over Richmond Green obstructing it from sight. The officers could only hope the gasmasks would save the men. If not than the Battle of London was lost. Lance Corporal David was bored out of his wits. The gas had been an interesting twist but only for a few moments. By now he expected to be standing on a pile of Tinnie corpses waving the Union Jack above his head and taunting the aliens to bring it on. This was nowhere close though. Never in a million years did he picture himself just standing around waiting for the enemy to come to him. He heard the sound of Apaches flying overhead. He looked up and caught glimpses of the helicopters as they passed. He cast his gaze into the endless mist in front of him and tried to think about his wife. The thought didn't get far though. He brought his L85A2 up to his shoulder and looked through the ACOG sight. He swore he saw a shadow dart from one house to the other. Lance Corporal David would have put his life on it. When he saw it again he wasted no time emptying half of his magazine at the phantom figure. What followed was a soul crushing silence. Everyone on the line tensed up in anticipation. What they were anticipating not many knew. \"Who the bloody 'ell fired!\" Lieutenant Erin demanded over the radio. \"Sir, I had a hostile contact.\" Lance Corporal David reported still scanning the area. He didn't stop scanning until he heard footsteps coming up behind him. \"The fuck you think you doing?\" the gas mask clad soldier growled. Lance Corporal David quickly glanced at the soldier's name tag above his heart and saw it was Corporal Willis. \"I saw a Tinnie.\" Lance Corporal David responded pointing to where he saw the shadow. Corporal Willis looked over Lance Corporal David at the appointed area. \"I don't see a fucking thi-\" Corporal Willis' words were cut short by a flurry of bullets. Before his body could resist Corporal Willis threw himself against the sandbags just as a lance of fire pierced the air where he was a second before. Lance Corporal David was slower to respond but he too pressed himself against the sandbags. A soldier next to him was even slower to respond and had his head blown off in the process. Lance Corporal David stared in horror as the corpse collapsed like some whacked him in the knees with a sledgehammer. What had once been the soldier's head resembled a smashed grapefruit. He kept blinking and hoped that every time he opened his eyes again the body would hopefully disappear. \"Come to papa!\" Rifleman Alex screamed at the top of his lungs as he fired his LMG in long bursts throwing the concept of burst fire out the window. Of course his voice was muffled because of the gasmask but he didn't care. The more he yelled the better he felt. He couldn't what he was shooting at so instead he aimed wherever a muzzle flash pierced the cloud. He ducked down as rounds slapped into the sandbags and etched their way up until they ate up the space where he was standing a few moments before. As soon as the coast was clear he stood back up and fired at the ever increasing number of muzzle flashes. \"Grenade out!\" someone yelled. He didn't see who or where the grenade landed but he did hear the muffled explosion. He ducked down behind the sandbags just as another flurry of enemy fire ate up his position. Even though the sandbags were about two feet thick he felt the impact of every round that hit it. Static in his radio earpiece burst to life as officers tried to their bests to coordinate accurate return fire. He swept his L110A1 in wide arcs hoping he hit something or at least suppressed whatever was chewing his section to bits. Rifleman Kyle felt like he was suffocating under the rubber/charcoal mask. He had to put extra effort into breathing and it was taking a toll on him. Sweat beaded and dripped down his forehead pooling under his chin where the gas mask stopped. He wiped the mist from the gas mask lens and took several more laboured breaths. He stood upright and immediately put his eye to the 5x scope. He couldn't aim anywhere near as well as he could without the unwieldy gas mask on but he would have to make due. If he didn't he would die but more importantly his friends in the unit would. He picked out one of many muzzle flashes and fired two quick rounds and moved onto the next target. Normally two 7.62mm rounds would be enough to put a man down but he had to remind himself that he wasn't facing normal human beings. Rifleman Kyle had to stop shooting, duck down below cover, and wipe the mist from the lens again. An explosion a few meters in front of the sandbags bombarded him with chunks of concrete. Despite the muffling effect of the gasmask he could still hear Rifleman Kyle yelling words that would earn him a smack behind the ear by his mother if he ever said such things. A smile crept across his sweaty face at the thought of his buddy whooping and hollering like a wild man. The smile was immediately swept off his face when the soldier next to him stood up to shoot but took two rounds in the chest. Rifleman Kyle was immediately at the man's side trying his best to help. He winced when he saw first-hand what the Tinnie rounds could do to flesh. The two gaping holes in the man's chest gushed blood covering up the burn marks around the entrence wound. He would have thought that incendiary rounds would have cauterized the wounds but the miniature fountains erupting from the man's chest told him otherwise. \"Hold on, mate.\" Rifleman Kyle said calmly and a little louder than he needed to be as he put pressure on the bigger of the two wounds. When he put pressure on the wound a geyser of instantly erupted from the second one. The soldier let out a howl of pain and reached up to bat Rifleman Kyle's hands away. \"Stay still!\" The man's hands shot up to his mask and tore it off before Rifleman Kyle could do anything about it. He sucked in a lungful of contaminated air and immediately started coughing. Thick yellow foam poured out of his mouth and his eyes seemed to bulge out of his skull. A spider web of black veins etched his neck and face making his skin look like a roadmap of a densely populated area. He jerked spasmodically and tried to yell spotting Rifleman Kyle's lenses with the vile foam. Then just like it started the soldier went limp. \"Son of a bitch.\" Rifleman Kyle murmured as he picked his rifle back up and returned to the firing line. The cross was freezing cold against Rifleman Anton's chest. Normally he would have moved it to the outside of his shirt but the cold let him know he was alive. Which is more that could be said for several others around him. \"Die mother fucker die.\" Rifleman Anton whispered to himself as he fired a measured burst at a muzzle blast. \"Die motherfucker die.\" Not many things fazed him. Unlike most of the men in the squad with the notable exception of Corporal David he'd seen service in Afghanistan. \"Die mother fucker die.\" This was nothing like that though. In A-Stan, as the men who served there called it, you rarely saw your enemy but at least you knew they were human. Sure they fought like scared bitched but at least the Taliban was made up of human fighters. Now…Rifleman Anton didn't even know where to begin. \"Die motherfucker die.\" The thing that frustrated him most was at the moment he couldn't even see what he was shooting at. He just aimed where he saw a muzzle blast and squeezed the trigger. He didn't even know if he was hurting or even hitting what he was shooting at. He took a quick glance at the mangled bodies around him. Hopefully the Tinnies didn't know how bad they were hurting them. \"This is some bullshit!\" Rifleman Stanley yelled over the fire as he slapped another magazine into his rifle. He reached a hand up to itch his neck. \"They gas us and shoot us to pieces and we can't do anything about it! Sod all mate!\" \"Sod all is right!\" Rifleman Anton replied as he fired a neat five round burst towards a muzzle blast. The muzzle blast didn't reappear so he figured he killed whatever he shot out. Rifleman Stanley stood up and started firing again. Rifleman Anton heard the roar of jet engines coming from behind. His well-trained ears were able to identify the distinctive rumble of Tornado GR4 Strike Fighters above the racket of combat. Those planes had saved his arse too many times to count in A-Stan so the roar was a welcome sound. \"Incoming napalm! Take cover!\" one of the officers shouted over the radio. Rifleman Anton took cover behind the sandbags but a wave of heat washed over him. Even though he wore a gas mask he could smell the gasoline like smell of the napalm. He loved that smell. Corporal Willis was the first one to stand up. He had his rifle ready of course. The houses that once stood across the street were all ablaze. The fire sucked in oxygen and the Tinnie gas clearing the air in a matter of minutes. He looked up and saw the Tornados circling above to see what effect they'd had on the battle. No more Tinnies remained; whether they were burning in the growing fires or retreated Corporal Willis didn't know. He preferred the former of the two options naturally. Slowly he peeled the gas mask off his face. He took a tiny breath and waited for his lungs to burst in flames. When they didn't he took a deep breath and wiped the sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand. All along the line men tore off their gas masks and sucked in fresh air. His radio crackled to life and Lieutenant Erin came on the line. \"Okay mates bully job. We really kicked some arse.\" Corporal Willis looked around and frowned. A good number of men lay sprawled in unnatural positions. Some arse kicking. \"We're picking up the wounded and heading towards the bridges. Single column. Wounded in the middle. Second Rifles take up the rear guard.\" The men filed out of the field and rallied on the road that led to Richmond Bridge. The men who had been at Richmond Green before the arrival of 2nd Rifles made up the front of the column, the walking wounded and men carrying stretchers filled in the middle, and the now bloodied men of 2nd Rifles made up the end of the column. They left the dead behind simply because they didn't have the men to carry them back. \"Sign off. Who's not dead?\" Corporal Willis asked as the column of soldiers started moving. He was too tired to see for himself which members of his section had bit the dirt. Now that the combat adrenaline had worn off he felt like someone had beaten him with a cricket bat. \"David, here.\" \"Andrew, here.\" \"Anton, here.\" \"Kyle, here.\" \"Stanley, I'm fucked up but I'm not dead.\" \"Alex, here.\" \"Eric is alive and well.\" Corporal Willis checked the names off mentally in his head. No one had died in his section. That honestly surprised him. He'd expected one causality. Up ahead was the bridge. If the Tinnies didn't decide to spoil his day than the engineers could wire up both bridges in about twenty minutes and their part in the battle would be over for a while. He could basically feel taste the shit food the Army chefs would be serving back at Heathrow. \"Tinnies up front! It's an ambush!\" someone shrieked over the radio. Corporal Willis felt like shitting his pants when the words finally registered in his mind. Somehow the Tinnies had gotten behind them and the all-seeing buggers at HQ had failed to notice. Well it wasn't the first cock up the higher ups had made and it certainly wasn't going to be the last. I'm sorry about the rather shoddy quality of this chapter. I had to rewrite this one from scratch and I know it sucks. The rest will be much, much, better with a lot more action.[Chapter 4] \"In modern war... you will die like a dog for no good reason.\"-Ernest Hemingway London, England August 11th, 2011 Rifleman Eric and Rifleman Stanley were pinned down smack dab in the middle of the street. Well they weren't the worst off. They had amble cover behind an overturned lorry. Rifleman Eric peaked over the cab and jerked his head back down as a flurry of rounds cracked by. \"The piss we gonna do?\" Rifleman Eric asked as he checked his 40mm grenade launcher. He stood up and fired the grenade. The low thump couldn't be heard over all the shooting and screaming. Rifleman Stanley peeked around the truck and looked down his ACOG scope. What he saw truly frightened him. Whatever he was looking at was no shorter than two meters. It hid behind a small wall on the side of the ramp that ran up to the bridge. Its head looked like an American football except larger and had a large cheese grater looking eye. The most interesting thing was its skin. It wasn't all metal like they thought. He noticed that it was more of an organic skin with a metal exoskeleton covering the arms, legs, and bits of the chest. Rifleman Stanley seemed frozen to the spot when he noticed that the Tinnie was looking right at him. It was its skeletal like arm brandishing a six barreled weapon. Rifleman Stanley pulled back just in time to see several lances of fire zip past. \"What the fuck are those!\" Rifleman Stanley screamed over the gunfire. Rifleman Eric shrugged and leaned around the bare engine block of the truck to shoot. Lance Corporal David sat huddled in the Tide Tables Café. He had dropped his rifle when the ambush sprung itself upon them. He wiped his sweaty hands on his fatigue pants and grabbed his Browning Hi-Power out of its holster. He looked among the men strewn about the street for any familiar faces. After a few seconds he just gave up. A hunched figure came running towards him from across the street. He raised his pistol and squeezed the grip. He lowered it once he recognized the face of Corporal Willis. \"You hit?\" Corporal Willis asked as he knelt down next to Lance Corporal David. He patted himself down and weakly shook his head. \"Where is your section?\" was the next question. \"I..I…I don't know.\" Lance Corporal David stuttered. Corporal Willis shook his head and slapped a new magazine into his rifle. \"I'm taking your section and flanking the enemy. You just stay here.\" Corporal Willis ordered. Lance Corporal David nodded happy with his order. Rifleman Andrew stood across the street from the Tides Table Café in a clearing of trees. He and Rifleman Anton were acting as point men for the section. They moved in a double staggered column. Behind them was Rifleman Alex and Corporal Willis in the second row, Rifleman Kyle and Rifleman Eric in the third row, and Rifleman Stanley finished up the column watching the rear. They moved quickly stopping every few seconds to stop and listen for sounds of enemy movement. The only thing they heard was the same thing they've been hearing since they got there; shooting and explosions. The men kept silent and kept their heads on constant vigils. They would not get ambushed again. After getting through about a fifty meters of woods they were met with sands under their boots. Corporal Willis now took point leading the men along the edge of the woods towards the bridge. The men were hunched low and stepped carefully. They had little idea how many Tinnies were on the bridge but they did have the element of surprise. They entered another patch of foliage right next to the bridge. Corporal Willis looked at all the men and nodded in approval. They each took one grenade off their tactical vests and pulled the pins. Corporal Willis did his too and took a deep breath. The grenade arced through the air followed by six more grenades filled with RDX explosive. Rifleman Anton fired a short burst into the air and joined the others as they lunged over the railing and ran to the other side of the bridge. They threw more grenades as a flurry of fire decimated nothing on the other side. Several explosions tore across the bridge silencing all fire. Corporal Willis led the men back around the woods and onto Bridge Street. Most of the wounded that were lying in the middle of the street were now dead. Severed limbs were scattered about like Halloween decorations. The men who could stand stood hunched over with weapons at the ready. Some collected the dog tags from their fallen comrades. \"Leftenant Erin!\" Corporal Willis called. Lieutenant Erin looked up from pulling the tags off a body and nodded. He picked up his rifle and jogged to Corporal Willis. \"Bloody ace job taking out those Tinnies. Thought we were screwed for a second.\" Lieutenant Erin said wiping the blood on his hands on his fatigue pants. \"How many casualties do we have?\" Corporal Willis asked. Lieutenant Erin looked over his shoulder at the bodies in the street and shook his head. \"Twenty-two dead, double that wounded. No bloody way we are getting all those across the bridge before more Tinnies hop on our arses. Speaking of the bridge where the piss are those engineers that are supposed to be blowing these things to Kingdom come?\" Lieutenant Erin said looking around. \"Leftenant, HQ is on the net wondering why we aren't back yet?\" a young Rifleman wearing a radio pack said handing the receiver to Lieutenant Erin. He snatched it and started screaming. \"Exactly what the fuck is going on! There were supposed to be engineers on the bridges but all we found were fucking Tinnies! You have ninety-nine and a half million UAVs in the air and you can't warn us that there are Tinnies waiting for us around the fucking corner!\" Whoever was on the other end mumbled a reply they couldn't here. Lieutenant Erin took a deep breath before continuing. \"Roger that. We need immediate helicopter extract. We have multiple wounded in critical condition. I don't know how long they can hold. I don't know how long we can hold either. If any Tinnies show up I don't think we can offer much resistance.\" Rifleman Andrew was close enough to hear the reply. His grip tightened on his weapon as his brain filtered the information. \"Leftenant Erin we have a problem. At least a company of Tinnies are heading towards you. They want that bridge. Challenger Twos are on their way. The Fortieth Commando Battalion is gearing up to reinforce your position. Set up a casualty collection point at the foot of the western side of the bridge and defend it. We'll provide as much air cover as possible but don't expect much because they are making a major push near Campden Town. If we can get some bombers over there to drop that bridge in the water we will. Your standing orders are to hold the western side of the bridge. Godspeed.\" Lieutenant Erin swore and stomped his foot at the ground. He motioned for the men to gather around and waited until they did. He addressed the large group with a professional and stern tone. \"Okay, mates. We're almost through. Our orders are to hold our side of the bridge until they send some bombers to sink the bridges. We can expect a few Challenger Twos supporting us when they arrive and the Fortieth Commando won't be far behind them. Get all the wounded across the bridge and set up defensive positions. Half of Second Rifles will defend Richmond Bridge. I'll take the other half along with what is left of my unit and defend Twickenham Bridge. Who is the most senior officer in Second Rifles?\" They looked at each other comparing rank patches. Apparently Captain Barrios had bought farm during the ambush. Major Matthew Flemming stepped forward and said, \"Guess I'm in command. The short, stocky man sported a well groomed mustache that would have put Lord Kitchener to shame. His bushy eyebrows were slightly singed at the ends and his helmet had a large chunk missing from it. His face, like many of the other soldiers, was covered in dirt and grime. Lieutenant Erin nodded and divided the remains of 2nd Rifles roughly in half. Corporal Willis' section was one of the fully intact ones to go with Lieutenant Erin. After a short jog they arrived at the bridge. The partial remains of sandbag barricades provided perfect cover but most of it was on the other side of the bridge. The men labored quickly in the August heat making more barricades and fall back positions. \"How many soldiers are in a company?\" Rifleman Andrew asked Rifleman Kyle as they pushed the remains of a burnt out car in the middle of the bridge. \"Dunno for sure. Like one hundred men. Why?\" Rifleman Kyle replied as they stacked extra sandbags in front of the car for better protection. \"So about fifty Tinnie are going to be coming towards us and fifty for the other bridge, eh?\" Rifleman Andrew said as he checked his field of fire through the car's shattered windows. Rifleman Kyle thought for a second and said, \"Holy shit that is a lot of Tinnies.\" He looked around at the few men remaining from 2nd Rifles and Lieutenant Erin's mix matched unit. He roughly estimated they had a platoon of men working to turn the bridge into a killing field. Rifleman Kyle shook his head and got back to work. Rifleman Alex took a swig from his canteen and passed it to Rifleman Stanley. He and Rifleman Stanley were on the only thing that overlooked the bridge from a decent height. Rifleman Stanley and Rifleman Alex lay prone on a train car on the Richmond Railway to the right of Twickenham Bridge. Rifleman Stanley was to pick off targets on the other bridge while Rifleman Alex kept the Tinnies off their own arses. \"How much ammo you got?\" Rifleman Stanley asked counting his own magazines. Rifleman Alex made a quick count and frowned. \"Three boxes of ammunition including the one in me weapon, two rockets for me LAW, and four grenades. Not enough in my view.\" \"Better than nothing.\" commented Rifleman Stanley as he wiggled about trying to get comfortable. \"Too true, mate.\" Rifleman Kyle replied. \"Corporal Willis! Look what I found?\" Rifleman Anton shouted as he and Lance Corporal David waved to Corporal Willis. He double timed to where they were standing in front of a partially collapsed apartment block to the right of the foot of the bridge. \"What is it?\" Corporal Willis asked. Lance Corporal David and Rifleman Anton headed a bit deeper into the rubble with Corporal Willis close behind. When he saw what they had found he couldn't help but smile. \"Don't you just love the Yanks?\" Lance Corporal David said smiling for the first time in a while. A Land Rover Wolf had smashed into the building totaling it completely. The driver still sat in the driver's seat with a bad head wound. The stink coming from the corpses was bad but they could deal with it due to the vehicles contents. It was an armed version of the vehicle sporting one M2 Browning Heavy Machine Gun, a L7A1 7.62mm General Purpose Machine Gun, and a MILAN ATGM complete with launcher. \"That Browning is gonna be useful. Anton, get some men in here to salvage all the ammo for these weapons. David, I want you to report to Lieutenant Erin and tell him about our finding. \"Gotchya.\" Lance Corporal David said and ran off. Corporal Willis watched as the men worked to dismount the weapons with wrenches and screw drivers. Once secure he consulted Lieutenant Erin about where to put them. \"We have a lot of ammo for the L7 so we can mount that on the train by my sharpshooter. One of your men will have to man it though. For the Browning we only have two hundred and fifty rounds for it so we have to use that carefully. I suggest we put that near the foot of the bridge so if we are pushed back that far we have something to hit them hard with. The MILAN can be set up in the middle of the bridge and given a clear view of fire so if the Tinnies bring up one of those walking tanks we can knock it out.\" Corporal Willis suggested sketching the plan on an etch-a-sketch they picked up. \"I think the MILAN should be deployed in the front so we can knock out any Tinnie armor that decides to come at us. Why let them take half the bridge before knockin' em out. I don't mind the L7 on the train. I'll send one of me men to man it. I like where you plan to put the Browning.\" Lieutenant Erin said making his own adjustments. Corporal Willis observed the map and pointed to the far side of the bridge. \"No, sir. Not as much cover on that side you see. Tinnies can easily take it out. I think my plan will work out better.\" Corporal Willis said. Lieutenant Erin nodded taking in the information. \"Mkay. We'll go with your plan. I'll get me man over on that train. You get some men to set up that MILAN. Make sure it has extra cover. Hurry up too. We don't have much time.\" Lieutenant Erin ordered. Corporal Willis saluted and got to work. Lance Corporal David had regained most of his senses. He wasn't sure what made him zone out before but he couldn't let it happen again. They were spread out evenly on the bridge. The men were all hidden behind sandbags or burnt out cars and even large chunks of rubble. When the Tinnies came they were bound for a surprise. Lance Corporal David felt much more confident. He checked and rechecked his L85A2 and flicked the safety off. He now knew what he was fighting. He couldn't say he wasn't scared; if he did he would be lying to himself. The best way you could put it was he was now prepared mentally. He pulled back the charging handle to his rifle and peaked over the low wall of sandbags. Not much longer now. Rifleman Stanley's eye was glued to his scope. He was keeping a close eye over the other side of the river waiting for any signs of movement. He blinked a bead of sweat from his eyes and continued scanning the other side of the ridge. \"I have to drain the weasel.\" Rifleman Alex said rolling off his belly. The soldier who Lieutenant Erin had sent over was a lance corporal named Jack Brun from the 3rd Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment. He chuckled softly as Rifleman Alex rolled to the side of the train and pissed. Lance Corporal Jack didn't like being so exposed. He had mounted the L7 on a tripod to provide the most stable firing point. He had no loader so he had to do it all himself. In preparation for this he had several belts of ammo neatly coiled at the base of the tripod. He tapped his index finger on the trigger guard growing impatient. Whoever said waiting was the worst part of war was dead on. \"Enemy contact reported!\" came the call over the radio. Everyone tensed up in unison. They were fighting the same enemy that had fallen from space only a few hours ago and gave them a good licking at Richmond Green. Rifleman Stanley saw figures running hunched over towards the bridge. He watched as a lance of Tinnies made their way up crisscrossing stairs on the other end of the bridge. He noticed a Tinnie that looked different from all the others. It was about a meter taller and the smaller Tinnies seemed to go wherever it pointed. It seemed to dance gracefully along the ground on its long thin legs. Rifleman Stanley put what had to be an officer Tinnie in his crosshairs. He immediately reconsidered and put a bit of a lead on the target. He took a deep breath and let half of it out. As the officer Tinnie marched up the final set of stairs, Rifleman Stanley gently pulled the trigger. There was a bang and a second later the officer Tinnies chest had a gaping hole in it. The other Tinnies looked stunned as their leader fell backwards into the dozen or so Tinnies. Rifleman Stanley didn't let up. Another group of twelve Tinnies marched cautiously onto the bridge. A quick check revealed no officers so he just went for the closest one. The Tinnie took a round in the head spinning around but getting back up soon after. The other Tinnies fired their weapons in random patterns not sure where the shot came from. The first line of defenders on the bridge stood up and fired a volley of short bursts. Three Tinnies immediately toppled over and one just exploded. The others were quick to take cover and return fire. Rifleman Andrew ducked down below a large chunk of concrete as a flurry of enemy fire whipped past his head. He waited until the fire dulled before firming his grip on his rifle and standing up to fire again. He fired at a Tinnie taking cover in the stairwell of the bridge hitting nothing more than concrete. He fired a 40mm grenade into the alcove killing everything in it with a thump. He readied another grenade and sent one flying towards two Tinnies that slid to the cover of an ice cream truck. I struck the ice cream truck blowing it in two and sending the Tinnies sky high. They landed somewhere in the river two seconds later. The crack of Rifleman Stanley's rifle had a slightly comforting tone to it as the head of another Tinnie suddenly expanded and it crumpled to the ground. Lance Corporal Jack traded tracers with a Tinnie on the other bridge. The Tinnie's rounds went far overhead while Lance Corporal Jack's rammed home. The Tinnie's chest sparked and it dropped like a sack of potatoes. He raked his machine gun over the bridge keeping the Tinnies pinned. He swore when his firing pin hit empty air. With the barrel smoking, Lance Corporal Jack began reloading his L7. He took his canteen and poured half the bottle over the steaming barrel. He put the canteen down next to his ammo and pulled back the bolt. \"Oi, Jack! We got Tinnies comin towards us!\" Rifleman Alex shouted placing three rounds into a Tinnie's chest at the foot of the railway. Lance Corporal Jack swiveled the L7 towards the opposite end of the railway. There were about a dozen or two Tinnies heading towards them. There was something strange about them. They were just shy of two meters tall and seemed stockier. The new Tinnies had a weapon graphed onto their right hand but their left hands were free. They didn't move like regular Tinnies either. They skillfully weaved side to side with the grace of a ballerina. Lance Corporal Jack fired a prolonged burst just as the Tinnies let loose a barrage of fire. Lance Corporal Jack didn't notice he was screaming as bullets ricocheted all around him. He shook the gun side to side quickly throwing up a wall of lead. Two Tinnies got hit and fell into the river. Lance Corporal Jack felt a thump in the middle of his chest and the smell of burning flesh immediately filled his nose. Rifleman Alex looked over his shoulder just in time to see Lance Corporal Jack slump backwards with a smoking hole in the middle of his chest. \"Stanley, cover me!\" Rifleman Alex barked over the fire as he crab walked backwards to Lance Corporal Jack's limp body. He fired a burst over Rifleman Stanley's head striking one of the advancing Tinnies in the leg. He leaned over Lance Corporal Jack's body and listened for a heartbeat. Nothing. He swore and mounted the L7. \"Keep your head down!\" Rifleman Alex yelled as he fired off a continuous stream of fire. It wasn't the most accurate but it produced the desired effect. The Tinnies tried to bob and weave their way around the fire but no amount of fancy moves could have saved them. They toppled over like dominoes as they got closer. \"What is that?\" Rifleman Stanley asked. Rifleman Alex turned the L7 towards the other bridge and froze. One of those walking tanks were pointed right at them. \"Run!\" Rifleman Alex screamed as he picked up his LMG and went to jump off the train. He was about to jump when he noticed Rifleman Stanley wasn't behind him. He looked back and saw the marksman struggling to untangle his tactical vest from a protruding piece of the train. Rifleman Alex repeated every curse word he had ever learned as he ran back to Rifleman Stanley. \"Come on! Come on!\" Rifleman Stanley pleaded. Rifleman Alex pulled his combat knife out of his boot and started cutting off the straps. Rifleman Alex looked up just as the Tinnie tank let loose a salvo of 16 missiles. Knowing the end was near, he covered Rifleman Stanley's body with his own and screamed. Rifleman Anton watched the missiles streak and slam into the train. The train was blown clear off the tracks and was thrown amongst the combatants on the other bridge. His immediate thoughts were of Stanley, Alex, and the other soldier. \"You sons-of-bitches!\" Rifleman Anton screamed at the top of his lungs as he stood up and shot at the Walking Gun. Rounds pinged harmlessly off the Walking Gun but he did manage to drop a few of the Tinnies working to reload the thing. The Tinnie manning the gun kept its head down as more of its allies fell. \"Hit it with your LAW!\" Corporal Willis shouted as he slid next to Rifleman Anton. Rifleman Anton nodded and unslung the rocket launcher. He lined his sights up on the Walking Gun and prepared to squeeze the trigger. The Walking Gun looked little more than a shiny box supported by four ant like legs. The only weapons it seemed to carry were 8 rocket tubes on each side. \"SOD OFF!\" Rifleman Anton screamed as he jerked the trigger. The back blast threw up a wall of smoke behind them and a fountain of flame erupted from the front. The 66mm rocket hit the Walking Gun just as it completed its reloading cycle. The 66mm high explosive anti tank rocket ignited twelve of the sixteen rockets loaded into the Walking Gun. The Walking Gun and about six Tinnies disappeared in a raging fireball that shot up twenty feet into the air. \"Cease fire! Cease Fire!\" Lieutenant Erin yelled running up and down the line. They all held their breaths waiting for the smoke to clear. A universal feeling of relief was felt all around when a light wind cleared the bridge and revealed nothing; nothing except for one Tinnie struggling to move with both its legs blown off. Lieutenant Erin's eyes grew wide with the thought of a prisoner. \"Someone go bring me that Tinnie!\" Lieutenant Erin ordered pointing at it. Four men scrambled from cover and dragged the Tinnie back. Everyone crowded around the wounded Tinnie filled with curiosity. \"Fuckin ugly bugger.\" Rifleman Eric noted. He was right. It was one of the officer Tinnies. It had three legs but two of them were blown off. Its skin was light brown and reminded the men of wet canvas. It eye was just a slit with something constantly running back and forth along it. \"Kind of looks like ya mum.\" Rifleman Kyle replied with a sly grin. Rifleman Eric shot a look at Rifleman Kyle that could have froze the Sun before returning his gaze to the Tinnie. \"So this is what killed Alex.\" Rifleman Anton said spitting on the Tinnie. \"Is it alive?\" Rifleman Andrew asked. As if in a response to the question the Tinnie jerked to life. Half a dozen men filled the Tinnie with enough lead to drop an elephant. What looked like water poured out of dozens of holes all among the Tinnies body. An explosion on the other bridge drew the men's attention. \"Get those men on the radio.\" Lieutenant Erin ordered slightly annoyed. After several minutes the rifleman with the bulky radio just shook his head. \"I ain't gettin nothin, sir.\" the rifleman said with a frown. \"Damn. I know they are still alive. You can still hear the shooting.\" Lieutenant Erin said as he turned to Corporal Willis. They all knew what was coming. \"Take your section and go check up on them. If everything is okay then radio in. If things are FUBAR then still radio in.\" He then turned to the radioman. \"Rifleman Justin, go with them. You're their connection with us. Don't die.\" \"Yes, sir.\" The pimply faced rifleman said. Corporal Willis ordered all the men to fall in a circle around him. \"Okay mates. The game plan is simple. We are goin over there and see if they are okay. If they are we can come back and watch em interrogate the Tinnie but if things are a bit sticky than we are stayin. Our prime goal is to protect Rifleman…\" \"Rifleman Justin Dunks. Nicknames Too Tall.\" the radioman said with a shy grin. \"I see why.\" Rifleman Kyle said looking up at the two and a half meter tall kid. Corporal Willis shot him an icy glare. \"Our prime goal is to protect Rifleman Justin here. Without him if we do get blown to bits they'll send another section to get killed too. I prefer that not happen. Roger?\" \"Roger.\" said Rifleman Anton. \"Roger.\" Rifleman Andrew. \"Roger.\" Lance Corporal David. \"Roger that.\" Rifleman Kyle. \"Roger.\" Rifleman Eric. \"Roger, Roger.\" Rifleman Justin. \"Okay, mates. Let's go check up on our boys. If there are any Tinnies we are going to blow them to Hell. For Alex and Stanley!\" Corporal Willis said turning towards the other bridge. \"For Alex!\" Rifleman Anton shouted pounding his chest. \"For Stanley! Rifleman Andrew barked nodding his head. \"For Jack!\" Rifleman Justin shouted making a fist. \"Okay. Now let's move before the fight is over.\" Corporal Willis ordered. The men filed in behind in and they started jogging. It was true; they all wanted to get back in the fight before it ended. A plume of flame shot up in the middle of the bridge signaling the fight was very much still going on.[Chapter 5] \"I'm convinced that the infantry is the group in the army which gives more and gets less than anybody else.\"- Bill Mauldin London, England August 11th, 2011 Corporal Willis' heart was thumping in his chest as a stray burst from a Tinnie flew over their heads. It was nowhere close to hitting them yet it still put the fear of God into him. Major Flemming saw them approaching and motioned them to his position. \"Thank God you blokes are here. Our radioman got crushed by a fuckin train. Things are bloody FUBAR over here. The Tinnies have more than half the bridge and we are taking heavy casualties. The Challengers are supposed to be here in about twenty minutes with infantry not far behind. Can your men support me?\" Major Flemming said once they all ran over. \"Roger that.\" Corporal Willis said turning towards the men. \"Rifleman Anton, take your LMG and set up on the right side of the bridge by that tractor. Rifleman Andrew you accompany him. Rifleman Eric, Kyle, and Lance Corporal David I want you on the left side. I want intersecting fields of fire so intense the crabs from a flea couldn't get through it. Rifleman Justin, you and I are gonna stay with Major Flemming and keep in contact with the armoured support. Oi?\" Corporal Willis said making a quick map on the concrete with a few rocks. \"Oi!\" was the unified reply. Corporal Willis nodded dispersing the men. They darted from one piece of cover to the next praying they wouldn't get hit. They were careful to step over the numerous wounded as they made their way to the middle of the bridge. Rifleman Anton found the tractor with ease. There was just one problem. A Tinnie stood on the driver's seat pinning down men barely five feet away. He stopped, dropped to one knee, and pumped six rounds dead center in the Tinnie's chest. The invader fell backwards still firing its gun in the air. \"Good shot.\" Rifleman Andrew said as he darted past him. Rifleman Anton nodded and set up his L110 on the padded seat of the tractor. He had to crouch a little to get it to work but he could manage. Rifleman Andrew sat with his back against the exposed engine block leaning over from time to time to take shots at the advancing Tinnies. \"Cover me.\" Rifleman Andrew said as he stood up and pulled the pin to a grenade. Rifleman Anton temporary abandoned his burst fire method and put up a wall of suppressive fire. \"You're covered!\" Rifleman Anton yelled over the firing of his own weapon. Rifleman Andrew nodded in acknowledgment and let go of the spoon. He threw the grenade overhand and watched it arc through the air and land behind a group of five Tinnies taking cover behind a bright red double decker bus. It bounced twice before rolling to a stop right at the feet of the Tinnies. They scrambled from cover and directly into the crossfire of Corporal Willis' section and other soldiers from 2nd Rifles. They were mowed down like blades of grass but not without some return fire from other Tinnies. A stray round smacked into the engine block of the tractor spraying the still standing Rifleman Andrew in the face with a dark green liquid. The first thought that ran through Lance Corporal David's mind was, shit Andrew's hit. When he saw Rifleman Andrew rubbing his eyes and Rifleman Anton squat down to help him flush his face with water from his canteen he let himself sigh in relief. A flash of fire that lanced past his head brought him back around. He brought his rifle up to his shoulder and put two rounds in a running Tinnie about fifty yards away. The Tinnie spun around and fell. It started to lift itself up when a grenade rolled right under it. The concussion threw the Tinnie ten feet in the air before it returned to the bridge in a mangled heap. He would have to buy whoever threw that grenade a pint or two at the pub when this was all over. If he lived through this however. Rifleman Kyle had the barrel of his L129A1 poking through a broken car window. He leaned against a car behind him allowing him to be comfortable in a semi-sitting situation. The Tinnies were coming almost as fast as he could pull the trigger; key word almost. He had his sights on a particular Tinnie that he had fired half of a magazine at and hit nothing. The little bastard was cunning taking cover and waiting for him to move on to another target before moving again. He clipped the Tinnie's shoulder as it slid behind the tractor Rifleman Anton and Rifleman Andrew was behind. It fell backwards and didn't get up for a bit. He went to move his rifle to get a better shot of the Tinnie when the barrel got caught on the seatbelt. He yanked it a few times not getting any results. As the Tinnie peeked his head over the tractor's seat Rifleman Kyle yelled, \"Marshal!\" An explosion muffled the sound of his voice and distorted it beyond recognition. \"This shit burns!\" Rifleman Andrew screamed wiping the last bit of coolant from his eyes. Suddenly his ears were ringing and bits of his friend were all over him. He blinked a few times staring at the bloodied pulp that was once Rifleman Anton Marshal. A Tinnie was standing on the seat aiming its graphed on weapon at him. He grabbed the alien's deadly extension and pulled it ground. The Tinnie was a lot heavier than he thought and took a lot of force to pull him off the seat. As the Tinnie lost its footing and fell, a round from Rifleman Kyle's rifle zipped through empty air that the Tinnie had occupied only a second ago. Rifleman Andrew tore his bayonet from its sheath and stabbed the Tinnie in the weirdly shaped head. It let out a high pitched wailed and pushed Rifleman Andrew off of him. He was launched fifteen feet in the air coming down hard behind a large piece of concrete. \"Cover me!\" Lance Corporal David barked as he bolted forward towards the Tinnie. It was just getting up when he launched himself at the alien knocking it back down. Lance Corporal David's new rifle skidded a few feet coming at a rest under a car. \"You son of a bitch!\" he snarled as the Tinnie rolled over on top of him. He felt the squishy remains of his former section mate underneath him. It only fueled his rage. The Tinnie raised its graphed on weapon and went to bring it down on his head. Lance Corporal David jerked his head to the side not a moment too soon. The Tinnie left a dent in the concrete where Lance Corporal David's head was. \"Should I shoot?\" Rifleman Kyle asked frantically. He had the Tinnie's head dead center in his sights. \"No! You saw how some of em explode!\" Rifleman Eric barked firing a few bursts from his rifle. It seemed to be a never ending wave of Tinnies. He looked back at several other 2nd Rifle soldiers and yelled, \"Cover us! Make sure no Tinnies sneak up on our arses!\" He darted forward with Rifleman Kyle not two steps behind. He ducked his head holding on to his helmet with one hand and keeping a firm grasp with his rifle as he heard rounds crack past his head. Corporal Willis had taught him a trick during one live fire exercise in the Scottish Highlands. If he heard a crack than take cover because a bullet just zipped past you but if you heard a whizz then still take cover because the enemy is shooting in your general direction. At the moment it sounded like Rifleman Eric and Rifleman Kyle was in a microwave while someone popped popcorn. Rifleman Eric heard a wet thump and a scream right out of a horror movie. He didn't stop running but he looked over his shoulder. Rifleman Kyle was on his side clutching a steaming pile of intestines in his hands and screaming. \"Help!\" he screamed. \"Help!\" His voice got more high pitched and ten times as desperate. \"HELP!\" Rifleman Eric let his L85A2 hang limp on its sling and slammed into the Tinnie with his right shoulder driving the alien clear off of Lance Corporal David smashing its head into the side of the bridge. Lance Corporal David was up on his feet almost immediately with his Browning Hi-Power cocked and aimed. Rifleman Eric had his rifle aimed at the alien. The Tinnie flipped over on its back and stared up at the two men. It made no attempt to raise its weapon; it just looked back and forth at the species it had been sent to wipe out. \"The piss do we do?\" Lance Corporal David asked panting heavily. \"I don't know.\" Rifleman Eric murmured. Then the wails of a dear friend lifted above the chaos of combat. \"I don't wanna go, mum! I have to stay here! I can't leave these guys!\" Rifleman Eric didn't wait for orders. He kicked the bayonet in the Tinnie's head driving it deeper and pinning it to the ground. The Tinnie began to twitch violently and make high pitched squeals. They both emptied what was ever left in their magazines into the alien silencing it for good. As they loaded magazines into their respective weapons, they heard a strange noise. It wasn't any noise they were familiar with. The closest thing they could place it to was the buzzing of bees. To make it worse it was coming from above them. They both looked up at the same time. \"What…the…fuck…are…those?\" Rifleman Eric stammered. \"I have no bloody idea.\" Lance Corporal David replied as multiple shadows passed over them.[Chapter 6] \"Rest is as valuable to a soldier as food and ammunition. No army can go for any prolonged period of time without some sleep.\"- Anonymous London, England August 11th, 2011 The FV4034 Challenger II rolled over a car crushing it like a tin can. It didn't do it in slow, jerky movements like he'd seen in the video games he grew up playing. The sixty something ton tank flattened the German made Volkswagen like a tin can in one fluid motion. The mean faced tank commander stood in the commander's cupola using his L37A2 Machine Gun to steady himself. The tank ground to a halt making the convoy of eleven other tanks stop. The mean face tank commander looked down at Corporal Davis, Rifleman Justin, and Major Flemming huddled together and shook his head. \"Sergeant Hank Manson; First Armoured Division, Seventh Armoured Brigade. The Desert Rats at your service.\" the tank commander said hopping off the turret. \"I thought the First Armoured was stationed in Germany.\" Major Flemming said. \"Our brigade was on leave. Then these bloody Tinnies decided to pop up. Don't believe me check out me patch.\" Sergeant Hank said showing off her shoulder patch. Just like he said the patch had a black background and a brown rat on it. \"Wait you're just a sergeant?\" Corporal Willis inquired. \"Oi. Why?\" Sergeant Hank asked. Corporal Willis did a quick count of the tanks tailing Sergeant Hank's and came up with a total of twelve tanks. \"So you're a sergeant and you command three companies?\" Corporal Willis asked. \"We just came from the Northern Defensive Line. Tinnies are hitting us hard up there. We're just here to pull you buggers out of the mud and go back. The Fortieth Commando Brigade just landed at Heathrow and are coming here via heli.\" \"We're not getting pulled off the line?\" Rifleman Justin asked with a hint of despair in his voice. \"Are the Tinnies kicking our arses?\" Sergeant Hank asked in a voice that sounded more like a mother telling her child that he was doing something wrong instead of an experienced tanker. \"I…I don't know.\" Rifleman Justin replied. \"Well we are getting our arses kicked. I lost six tanks and almost all of my infantry. So yes the Tinnies are kicking our arses and no none of us are getting pulled off the line.\" Sergeant Hank spat. Rifleman Justin looked like he wanted to just curl up in a corner but instead he just took a step back. An uncomfortable silence followed before Major Flemming broke it. \"How long are you blokes going to be supporting us?\" \"Until the cavalry arrives I guess. Or until the RAF comes to sink the bridge.\" Sergeant Hank said as he scrapped something off the bottom of his boot onto the tank tread. \"Wait the RAF is coming?\" Corporal Willis asked surprised. \"Yeah. Passed up a few of their Tornados when we passed through Heathrow to rearm. They ain't much use right now cuz they don't have any bombs to drop. They're flying em in though.\" Sergeant Hank said sounding bored. \"What I'm wondering is why didn't you guys blow the bridge up. Don't ya'll have any explosives?\" \"Not enough to make the bridges come down. But never mind that. How long until those bombers come over us?\" Major Flemming asked. \"Piss if I know. Go ask a pilot.\" Sergeant Hank replied rather harshly. \"Well if you did not notice, sergeant, we are short of qualified pilots right now.\" Major Flemming retorted putting emphasis on the younger man's rank to show he was in command. \"Sorry if I'm a bit agitated but I watched those Tinnie fucks wipe out an entire platoon of infantry and there wasn't bullocks I could do!\" Sergeant Hank yelled. Major Flemming drew himself up to his full height and stood a hair's length from Sergeant Hank. Major Flemming was two feet shorter than the tanker but he had a good thirty pounds on the younger man. \"You two stop it! The bloody hell is wrong with you? We're being wiped out by aliens from God knows where and you two are fighting each other? What kind of sod all shit is this?\" Corporal Willis said stepping in between the two men. \"I lost over half of my unit!\" \"I don't give a shit. We took losses too. Everyone has taken losses. This is a war. People are going to die. It happens.\" Corporal Willis said trying to put it as nicely as possible. Sergeant Hank opened his mouth to say something but a loud buzzing sound filled the air. All of the men looked up at the sky and saw something they could have never expected. Rifleman Justin stepped back and tripped over a severed arm. When the radio on his back hit the ground it started jumping to random channels. \"All Tinnies in our sector are dead. We're good people. Wait…what in the world are those? \"Oh my God they're everywhere!\" \"More Tinnies are landing! We're being overrun! Hel-\" \"This is Typhoon Six-Two Callsign Raptor! My wingman just got blown out the sky! What's happening?\" \"Fast movers inbound! Take cover! Ahhhhh!\" \"Tell all the helicopters to turn back! The HMS Ocean just got sunk by Tinnie aircraft!\" \"Sir, I don't know what to call them! Aircraft, planes, spaceships? I don't know! All I know is they are EVERYWHERE!\" \"Get the men to pull off the bridge. We're leaving.\" Major Flemming said. \"We can't leave.\" Corporal Willis protested. \"Why?\" Rifleman Justin asked. \"The Tinnies can't cross this bridge.\" Corporal Willis replied. \"I'm not dying for no bridge.\" Rifleman Justin said. \"Is it worth the risk?\" Major Flemming asked. Corporal Willis just nodded and put another magazine into his rifle. \"Make sure the men are well dug in. Anything that can sink a helicopter carrier has some big guns. Get those tanks deployed alongside the river and tell their commanders to be ready on those machine guns. I don't think cannon can take out whatever they have.\" Corporal Willis said in the same calm voice as he always had. That is why the men loved him. He was calm no matter the situation. \"I'm going to take half of me tanks and reinforce the other bridge. We'll be splitting up or firepower but it'll help make sure we don't get surrounded.\" Sergeant Hank said as he climbed up the hull of his Challenger 2. \"Good plan. God speed.\" Corporal Willis said. Once Sergeant Hank was in his cupola he put on his tanker's helmet and looked at the three men. They all had that tired and worn look in their eyes. They looked like they were about to collapse at any moment. Major Flemming saluted smartly and barked, \"For Queen and Country!\" Sergeant Hank saluted too and said the same. With that his tank lurched forward closely tailed by five other tanks. Corporal Willis looked at Major Flemming and cocked his head towards the bridge. \"You better be right about this.\" Major Flemming said before jogging off to alert the men.[Chapter 7] \"If we lose the war in the air, we lose the war and lose it quickly.\" — Field Marshall Bernard Montgomery London, England August 11th, 2011 \"You ever wonder what's up there?\" Jennifer asked. Her Cockney accent that she so desperately tried to hide was really coming through right now. Rifleman Andrew loved it but for some reason Jennifer hated the way it sounded. They were back in the field near Hexham. Jennifer was lying next to him with her head on his chest. He opened his mouth to say something but no words would come out. \"Like someone up there wondering what it's like down here.\" Jennifer said. Her Cockney was really coming on thick now. Rifleman Andrew opened his mouth and tried to speak but again no words came out. It was like he was having a one sided conversation. \"I sure hope we do.\" Jennifer said with a smile. Her Cockney was the strongest he'd ever heard it. He tried to scream but he couldn't make a sound. \"Andrew!\" Jennifer screamed. Her voice was full of panic. Rifleman Andrew began to panic. Jennifer had only cried his name out once like that. It was when they were broken up for a few months. He saw her at a party and they started talking. Her pissed up boyfriend saw and was about to hit her. She called his name out just like that. The boy's fist never touched Jennifer. He ended up being thrown out a window. \"Andrew, please get up!\" Jennifer cried. Andrew wanted to scream at the top of his lungs but he just couldn't. \"Please are you okay? Answer me, Andrew!\" Andrew wanted to cry. He hated hearing Jennifer sounding like this. He wished he could just tell her that everything was going to be okay. The scenery around them changed. The moon morphed into a glowing ball of fire and the fields around them burst into flames. The stars in the sky were now replaced by flaming objects hurtling towards the ground. He looked over at Jennifer to find some form of safety in this hellish landscape. What he saw frightened him. The all beautiful Jennifer was now a burnt skeleton. \"ANDREW…WAKE…UP!\" Rifleman Andrew Webster's eyes snapped open. The first thing he saw was the blacked face of Corporal Willis. The section leader's eyes darted about looking for targets. Something darted past his field of vision in the sky. It went by so quickly he couldn't tell what it was. The ground vibrated as something exploded. He tasted a salty metallic fluid in his mouth and he felt it running down the corners of his lips. \"Bloody hell you're alive. Get up!\" Corporal Willis shouted over the gunfire. He held out his hand and Rifleman Andrew took it. With a quick jerk Rifleman Andrew was on his knees next to Corporal Willis. \"Grenade out!\" someone yelled. Rifleman Andrew didn't see who threw the grenade but he did see it drop a group of Tinnies running right them. Corporal Willis reloaded his rifle and looked at Rifleman Andrew. \"You good to go?\" Corporal Willis asked. \"Ye-\" was all that was able to come out of Rifleman Andrew's mouth before Corporal Willis threw him to the ground. He fired off two quick burst taking out a Tinnie crawling up the railing of the bridge. \"Let's go!\" Corporal Willis barked as he jerked Rifleman Andrew up by the collar. They ran hunched over towards a hastily built barricade manned by a few soldiers. Rifleman Andrew jumped when one of the three surviving Challengers fired its main gun into one of the Walking Guns at the far side of the bridge. The explosion was spectacular and rattled Rifleman Andrew's brain inside his head. \"When did we get tanks?\" Rifleman Andrew asked. \"Why are those wounded still here? Come on get it moving!\" Corporal Willis yelled completely ignoring Rifleman Andrew's question. He had more important things to worry about. \"Oh God! Oh God!\" the younger man screamed. \"Don't let me die! Please. I'll do anything!\" \"Calm the fuck down!\" Rifleman Eric yelled trying to calm the young soldier down. He remembered his face but not the name. He did a quick check on his dog tags; Rifleman Steven Jeffery. He looked at the gaping wound in Rifleman Steven's belly and almost vomited. A loose knot of intestines hung out. It looked like uncooked black pudding he ate as a child. He'd stumbled across Rifleman Steven trying to push his own intestines back in and he decided to try to help. \"You're going to be fine.\" Rifleman Eric lied. \"I can't feel anything. What's going on? Is it bad?\" Rifleman Steven said in quick succession. \"Stop talking.\" Rifleman Eric said curtly. He'd have to find a way to stop the bleeding. If he didn't Steven would bleed out fast. \"Incoming fast movers!\" someone yelled. Rifleman Eric instantly threw his body over Rifleman Steven's to try to provide some form of cover. He heard the uncanny buzzing and felt the heat wave from several explosions. When the buzzing faded away he looked around to see if any Tinnies were near. None. Good. \"You okay, kid?\" Rifleman Eric asked. No answer. \"Kid?\" Rifleman Eric looked down at Rifleman Steven and saw his own reflection in Rifleman Steven's lifeless eyes. Rifleman Eric just shook his head and moved on to the next wounded soldier. \"Take this.\" Lance Corporal David said as he shoved a L85A2 into Rifleman Andrew's arms. \"Thanks.\" Rifleman Andrew said. He looked at the rifle for a moment like he didn't know how to use it. Much like a child examined a brand new toy. \"Another wave of Tinnies incoming. Get ready people.\" Corporal Willis said. \"You okay, son?\" Lance Corporal Willis asked Rifleman Andrew as they kneeled behind a line of sandbags. \"Yeah.\" Rifleman Andrew replied. \"Okay. Keep it up, mate. We're winning.\" \"Are we?\" Rifleman Andrew said solemnly. Lance Corporal David looked over at Rifleman Andrew and was about to say something when a flurry of Tinnie bullets zoomed over his head. Lance Corporal David looked down his ACOG scope and got a Tinnie in his sights. He squeezed off a quick three round burst. Two rounds hit the Tinnie in the chest while the last hit it in the head. The Tinnie stumbled forward before tripping over the body of another dead Tinnies. It didn't get back up. He then sighted a Tinnie who was jumping from car to car. He fired two bursts at the acrobatic Tinnie. The first missed its intended target but caught another Tinnie knocking that one off the bridge. The second burst caught the Tinnie in the groin area immobilizing it. \"More Tinnie fast movers inbound!\" someone barked. Lance Corporal David got low to the ground and hoped and prayed he wouldn't get hit. He'd made it too far to die. \"Fuck!\" Corporal Willis exclaimed as the last Challenger burst into a spectacular array of flames. The sixty something ton tank was thrown on its side like a toy lorry. He was now in the upstairs room of a café overlooking the bridge with Rifleman Justin and Major Flemming. \"We got bad news people.\" Rifleman Justin said. \"What now?\" Corporal Willis asked with a deep frown. \"Fortieth Commando ain't coming. Their helis were taken down a few klicks from here.\" Rifleman Justin said after taking a deep breath. \"Well we're buggered now.\" Corporal Willis said as he looked down at his boots. \"Contact whoever is left on the other bridge. We're falling back. Forget this bridge.\" Major Flemming said. \"You sure, sir?\" Rifleman Justin asked hesitating. \"That's an order soldier.\" Major Flemming confirmed. Rifleman Justin looked at Corporal Willis. \"He's in command. Give the order.\" Corporal Willis said. Rifleman Justin nodded and lifted the receiver to his ear. He almost threw it down when a loud, wailing, screeching sound came through the other end. It was like someone dragging their nails across a chalkboard. \"What the piss?\" Major Flemming yelled as he covered his ears. \"I don't bloody know!\" Rifleman Justin replied. \"Turn it off!\" Corporal Willis barked. Just as he did one of the Tinnie spaceships hovered in front of one of the café's windows. Rifleman Justin realized the Tinnie spaceship looked like a mechanical wedge of pie. \"Get down!\" Corporal Willis screamed. A split second later the Tinnie ship fired its two main weapons. Great bolts of energy tore through the room putting holes in walls and destroying anything in its way. Rifleman Justin threw himself on the ground and found himself laying on top of Corporal Willis. Corporal Willis just lay there gritting his teeth. Major Flemming took too long to hit the deck. A single bolt of white energy hit him square in the chest. A millisecond later he was splattered all over the café room. The only trace of him left was the blood and ribbons of meat that littered the room. \"Take that thing down! Take that thing down!\" Rifleman Kyle yelled as he fired at the Tinnie ship with his L129 to no effect. One soldier shouldered a LAW and prepared to fire. Before he could a round took his head clean off. Rifleman Kyle pivoted on his heel and took the Tinnie down with two well-placed shots. He ran over to the dead soldier and moved the dead husk off the LAW. He picked it up and brushed the blood and bits of meat off of it and aimed at the Tinnie ship that was still firing into the café. The solid thump in his shoulder told him the rocket had cleared the tube. The muffled boom told him the rocket hit something. He tossed the now useless tube over his shoulder and watched as the Tinnie ship went side to side in a drunken fashion. A secondary explosion blew the Tinnie ship in half sending one part of it flying into a building and another coming right at him. \"Shit!\" Rifleman Kyle screamed as he ran towards the bridge. He had two options. Either stand still and be crushed or run towards the Tinnies and get shot. He figured either way he would die. Better to go out like a hero. \"He has the idea!\" Lance Corporal David yelled when he saw Rifleman Kyle run past him screaming like a banshee. He withdrew his bayonet from its sheath and secured it over the barrel. \"Men!\" Lance Corporal David barked. \"Sir!\" the fifteen or so surviving men replied. \"Fix…SWORDS!\" Lance Corporal David shouted. He used that order because in the Rifle Regiments of the British Army, the term was used when their flintlock rifles carried sword bayonets and it survived until today. The sound of bayonets unsheathing almost overwhelmed the sound of the incoming Tinnie fire. \"It's been an honour to fight with you all, mates! Second Rifles…Charge!\" Lance Corporal David yelled. He hopped over cover and screamed as loud as his lungs allowed him to. He was joined by the remains of 2nd Rifles. If they were going to die, they were not going to just sit there and let the enemy pick them off. They were going right up the enemies' arses. The fifty or so Tinnies hesitated to fire as the small contingent of men rushed towards them. They knew the humans were stupid; but not stupid enough to openly charge them. The Tinnie delay allowed the men of the 2nd Rifles to close in with the Tinnie mass. \"Time for you to get off MY island!\" Lance Corporal David screamed as the first Tinnie came into his bayonet's reach. A staggered line of men slammed into the Tinnies ranks marking the first bayonet charge by the men of the 2nd Rifles in the unit's recorded history.[Chapter 8] \"I had a bayonet, they didn't.\"-Medal of Honor recipient Walter Ehlers' reply to a question asked by his friend about why he assaulted a German mortar position manned by nine German troops using only his bayonet London, England August 11th, 2011 Rifleman Kyle thought he was really going to die as he rushed headlong into the Tinnie mass. He felt strange though. He wasn't scared like he was before. Well he was a little but not like before. He felt completely at ease as he ran towards certain death. In matter of fact he never felt so at ease with himself as he was right then at there. There was only one thing that bothered him; the Tinnies hadn't blown him apart yet. He didn't waste his chance. Rifleman Kyle fired his last two rounds into a Tinnie's chest making it fall over like a toy soldier. He dropped his L129 and pulled out his Browning Hi-Power. He emptied an entire clip into a Tinnie dropping it. As he reloaded he heard a sound that sent a chill running up his spine. He looked over his shoulder and saw whatever was left of 2nd Rifles charging with bayonets fixed. So he wasn't going to die alone. \"Time for you to get off MY island!\" Lance Corporal David screamed as the first Tinnie came within his bayonet's reach. He thrust the pointy attachment of his rifle into a Tinnie's chest and twisted it. The Tinnie let out a shrill screeching sound and tried to swipe at Lance Corporal David. He easily ducked it and shoved the Tinnie back. Another Tinnie thrust forward with its gun like appendage missing him by mere centimeters. Lance Corporal David batted the Tinnie's arm to the ground and slashed at its head. When that produced no visible results Lance Corporal David resulted to fighting dirty. He kicked the Tinnie in its right knee joint breaking it and send the Tinnie down to one knee. Lance Corporal David pulled his Browning Hi-Power out of its holster with his left hand and delivered a single bullet to the Tinnie's head. The back of the Tinnie's head splattered outwards putting that one out of commission. Two more Tinnies came charging at him. He fired off the rest of the magazine missing most shots but killing the two aliens in the end. He'd have to learn to shoot with his left hand later if there was a later. He reholstered his pistol and went towards the next Tinnie. It was on top of a fellow soldier pounding the pour buggers face in with its gun. He thrust the bayonet into the back of the Tinnie's head and lifted with all his might. He didn't know how he did it but he lifted the Tinnie over his head and smashed it into the bridge. He was surprised the bayonet didn't break or snap. He turned back around to see if the soldier was okay. His head looked like someone took a hammer to a watermelon. Disgusted, Lance Corporal David turned around. He turned around just in time to see a Tinnie about to bring his bulky arm/weapon down on his own head. Rifleman Andrew threw all his weight into the Tinnie that threatened his fellow section member. The Tinnie, caught by surprise, was thrown off balance and was sent skittering to the ground. Rifleman Andrew landed right on top of it and didn't waste a moment. Despite how much it hurt he punched the Tinnie in the head again and again to keep it stunned. Rifleman Andrew thought he might have broken all of his knuckles in his right hand when Lance Corporal drove a knife into the Tinnies head silencing it for good. \"Thanks, mate.\" Lance Corporal David said as he quickly helped Rifleman Andrew up. Lance Corporal David couldn't help but notice how sweaty and beaten Rifleman Andrew was. His left eye was swollen shut and looked like a plum. The normally pale kid seemed almost white now. \"No problem, sir.\" Rifleman Andrew panted. Not a second after Rifleman Andrew said that Lance Corporal David threw him to the ground and crouched at the same time. A Tinnie bolted past them missing by a full foot. Lance Corporal David pivoted on his heels and lunged at the Tinnie's back with his bayonet. The bayonet went right through the Tinnie's back and out the front. The Tinnie struggled for a bit before going limp. Rifleman Andrew got up ignoring the fierce burning in his lungs. Three Tinnies came running at him. His grip tightened on his rifle as he yelled, \"Is that all you got, mate!\" The Tinnies didn't slow down. He sidestepped one just to be shoved to the ground by another. His bayonet tripped one up sending it to the ground. Lance Corporal David grabbed a L85A2 off the ground and emptied what remained of the magazine into the two standing Tinnies. Rifleman Andrew was on top of the next Tinnie not a second later bashing its head in with a tire iron that lay on the ground. Rifleman Kyle fired the last round of his Browning Hi-Power into a Tinnie's leg crippling it. He grabbed his entrenching tool from his thigh and tore it free from the Velcro pocket that held it. He hit a Tinnie in the neck with it nearly taking off its head. The Tinnie, with its head dangling by a few strands of stringy stuff, swung wildly. It took Rifleman Kyle some effort to dodge all of the blows. He was just so tired. The last of the Tinnie's blows grazed his right thigh sending a jolt of pain running through his leg. \"If you wanna touch there you at least gotta buy me dinner first!\" Rifleman Kyle bellowed as he put the serrated edge of the entrenching tool into the Tinnie's chest. Suddenly he felt a crippling pain in his right arm. He let go of the entrenching tool and grabbed at his shattered arm. A Tinnie kicked him in the chest sending him flying several meters. As he skidded across the ground he felt all of his ribs break. He came to a rest by the hood of a police car. He just looked up at the sky as fluid filled his chest cavity. Something important was punctured. He coughed up blood sending flecks of the stuff all across his face. Something important had to be punctured. Corporal Willis looked at the scene on the bridge in horror. His fellow soldiers in the 2nd Rifles were getting slaughtered. There were just too many Tinnies. His men were out there getting killed and there was nothing he could do. He looked over at Rifleman Justin. He was curled up under a desk crying and saying he wanted to go home over and over again. The kid had had all he could take. He was lost for now. He grabbed Rifleman Justin's rifle and all the magazines he had with him. Rifleman Justin didn't even seem to notice. Just as he stepped out the door he ran into someone he'd never expect to run into at a time like this. \"Hugh?\" Corporal Willis asked bewildered. He had to be dreaming. Something like this just didn't happen on the battlefield. \"Yeah.\" The man wearing a battered uniform replied as he slung a L85A2 over his shoulder. Corporal Willis could just barely make out the 40th Commando's unit patch on his shoulder. Fifteen men behind him were just as beat as him. They all looked tired and worn out. Like they haven't been able to just sit down and relax since this all began. \"Long time no see, brother.\" Colonel Hugh Westmorland said with a tired smile.[Chapter 9] \"I am your worst nightmare. I have conquered fear. I have come to terms with terror and pain is my best friend. I will come from the sea. I will disappear without trace. My brothers will lay down their lives for me as I will for them. I am that which protects the realm. I am that which protects my people. I am the one who serves not only my God, Queen and Country, but my squad, my team, my friends, and my family also. I am their protector. I am their knight. I am your worst nightmare. I am a Royal Marine Commando.\"-Royal Marine Commando Slogan Printed on a Recruitment Poster London, England August 11th, 2011 Three Hours Earlier Along the Northern Defensive Line \"Hold the line! Hold the line!\" came the piercing screech in Second Lieutenant Hugh's earpiece. He wiped the sweat from his head with his sleeve and peaked around the scorched Challenger 2 that blocked the intersection. About a dozen British soldiers were running towards him heading to the fall back position at St. Pauls Cathedral. In the back of his mind he knew the Tinnies weren't far behind. His platoon sergeant, Sergeant Andy Roche, slid into cover next to him. \"What's the situation?\" Second Lieutenant Hugh asked curtly. He was still looking around the destroyed vehicle watching as the last British infantrymen ran past. They'd failed to hold the bridge against the alien onslaught and now it was up to his platoon to hold them back. \"Everyone's fine. Well as fine as a man can be knowing that their country is being invaded by fucking aliens.\" Second Lieutenant Hugh looked back at Sergeant Andy who was smiling. His face said cut the shit and give it to me straight. Sergeant Andy got the message real quick. \"We're as ready as we can be. We have plenty of ammo and good fields of fire. The mortar section is standing by for a fire mission.\" \"Good. Give them these firing coordinates. If I yell 'Zulu, Zulu, Zulu' on the radio I want them to throw as many high explosive rounds at these coordinates as they can.\" Second Lieutenant Hugh said. He reached under his body armour and pulled out a scrap of paper. Sergeant Andy took it and gave it a look over. \"These grid coordinates are our position, sir.\" Sergeant Andy said glumly. He looked at Second Lieutenant Hugh and saw he was just staring at his rifle. \"I understand, sir. Too bad the boys manning the mortars won't get the satisfaction of plastering us and the Tinnies. We won't let them get that far.\" Second Lieutenant Hugh did smile this time. \"I'm going to check on that heavy weapons detachment. They've been having some problems with the fifty cal.\" Sergeant Andy checked to make sure he was clear and bolted off. Second Lieutenant Hugh thumbed his radio piece connecting him to the FOB at Heathrow. \"King this is Rook. We are in position and awaiting orders, over.\" \"Roger that Rook. Orders are to hold position and defend the area against hostile forces. Repeat orders, over.\" \"Hold position and defend area against hostile forces, roger. Interrogative: will we have air support, over?\" \"Affirmative. A squadron of Typhoons are on stand-by at FOB loaded with GBU-16s. They can be on station in ten mikes, over.\" \"Roger that. Rook out, over.\" Second Lieutenant Hugh took his finger off the button cutting off his line with the FOB. Suddenly the harsh report of the fifty cal broke the eerie calm. \"Sergeant Andy report!\" Second Lieutenant Hugh barked into the radio. He could hear Sergeant Andy breathing heavily and shouting at a section leader to keep his head down. He looked up at the building that the HMG and Sergeant Andy were holed up in. \"Multiple Boxes incoming!\" Sergeant Andy yelled using the nickname for the Tinnie Walking Tanks. \"I see three…no four Boxes heading towards us! They're accompanied by a heavy contingent of Tinnies! Estimated strength a full company! Keep your fucking head down Joe! Sir, we're outnumbered and outgunned here! I said keep your fucking head down!\" Second Lieutenant Hugh peaked around his cover. In the distance he could see the hazy outline of the Boxes in question. The tracers from the .50 led him right to it. He couldn't see the Tinnies though. \"Sergeant, where are the Tinnies?\" \"At the foot of the bridge. We're hammering em with the fifty but they're coming in thick.\" \"Okay keep doing what you're doing. I'm calling in mortars.\" \"Roger that, sir. Give em 'ell.\" Lance Corporal Jerome Taylor was three hundred meters behind the rest of his platoon dug in to the right of St. Pauls Cathedral. His section's four L16A2 81mm mortars were housed in a semicircular firing pit that was separate from the rest of the defenses now surrounding the church. Despite the distance all of them heard the distinctive sound of a fifty caliber machine gun hammering away. \"You have the mortars lined up? he asked his mortar mate, Marine Mickey Loomis, as he slung his L22 carbine over his shoulder. The L22 was almost the same as the L85A2 but much, much shorter. Kind of like the Yank M-16 and M4. \"Fifteen high explosive mortars ready to be fired and fifteen more on stand-by.\" Marine Mickey replied lining up the last of the mortar rounds next to the stand. His L22 sat on the edge of the dugout. \"Good. Now since you're new and everything let's just go over the basics.\" Lance Corporal Jerome said crossing two muscular black arms across his chest. \"I hand you the mortar, you yell clear, you drop the mortar down the tube, and then we both turn away.\" Marine Mickey replied holding up one finger for each step. \"Good and you keep your mouth open when the mortar fires because?\" Lance Corporal Jerome trusted the kid but he was just that, a kid. He was fresh out of specialist training and joined the unit a mere two days ago. He was scrawny as a stick and at the moment he didn't have his helmet on so his longer than regulation bright red curly hair stuck out in every which way. \"So I don't get me nose cleaned out by the pressure wave.\" Marine Mickey said tapping his freckle covered nose with his pointing finger. Lance Corporal Jerome nodded approvingly. The radio on the edge of the firing it suddenly sparked to life. \"Sledgehammer this is Rook One! Fire mission! Barrage of high explosives at grid location delta three! \"This is it, kid!\" Lance Corporal Jerome whooped as he took his position next to the mortar and started adjusting the elevation of the mortar. Marine Mickey was already on the other side straightening up all the mortars. \"Round!\" Marine Mickey barked pulling the pin and handing the HE mortar to Lance Corporal Jerome. He took it and held the round above the opening of the tube. \"Fire for effect Sledgehammer! I repeat; fire for effect!\" \"Round out!\" Corporal Jerome yelled as he dropped the mortar down the tube and immediately turned away and closed his eyes. He felt the concussion in his chest even though he was facing away from the weapon. The sound, combined with three other mortars firing, left his ears ringing. He stood up and held out his hands for another round. \"Good effect Sledgehammer! Keep it coming!\" Marine Mickey was slower to react but after a few seconds stood up and handed another armed mortar to Lance Corporal Jerome. He had to stifle a laugh when he saw Marine Mickey's face. A thick glob of almost grey snot covered Marine Mickey's upper lip and dribbled down his chin. \"I forgot to open my mouth.\" Marine Mickey mumbled just before ducking down again. This time he didn't forget to open his mouth. Sergeant Andy watched triumphantly as barrage after barrage of mortars ate up the Tinnie infantry. He fired a few rounds in the general direction of the Tinnies hoping he hit something. The Tinnies were too far to fire at accurately but you never knew if you could hit them if you didn't try. His radio squawked to life in his ear. \"Andy, I need you to take some men with Javelins and take out those Boxes before they get closer. Those things can do way too much bloody damage and I need them dead yesterday.\" \"Roger that, Le f tenant. I'll have those fuckers wishing they never came here.\" Sergeant Andy replied confidently. He knew that Second Lieutenant Hugh made him platoon sergeant because he could rely on him. He was not going to let his friend and platoon leader down. Sergeant Andy looked around the room. \"Pippin, Marcus, Michael, and Cortez with me.\" Sergeant Andy said pointing to each man as he called their name. \"We're going Tinnie hunting.\" The four marines hefted their FGM-148 Javelins on their backs and followed Sergeant Andy down the stairs. Once down he ran half way across the street to where Second Lieutenant Hugh was taking cover behind a tank. The Tinnie's were now in proper rifle range and the men of Third Platoon were now giving them hell. The Boxes though were standing ominously out of range. Either the Tinnies had never heard of combined arms or they had supreme confidence in their infantry. Second Lieutenant Hugh pointed to the ruins of a building to their left. \"Take positions over there. I have another section over there already and they report they are taking heavy fire. Your mission is two pronged. Primary mission is taking out the Tinnie armour and secondary is supporting Section Delta. Understood?\" \"Understood, sir.\" Sergeant Andy said nodding. He turned back to the three marines behind him and relayed the plan. \"Marine Pippin, give me your Javelin. You'll use your el-One-Ten to suppress the Tinnies. Oi?\" \"Oi.\" Marine Pippin Sheldon said as he shrugged the launcher off his shoulder and handed it to Sergeant Andy. He slung the weapon on his back with a ummph surprised at how heavy it was. He turned back to Second Lieutenant Hugh who was trying to clear a jam at the moment. \"Wish me luck?\" \"I wish you'd go where ordered and slot those Boxes before they turn us into piles of bones.\" Second Lieutenant Hugh said still struggling with the jam. \"Easy as pie, sir.\" Sergeant Andy said with a smirk. He turned towards the four marines again. \"Time to earn that unit badge!\" he barked. Sergeant Andy checked to see where the Tinnies were once and bolted off. Even with the extra forty-six pounds on his back he ran like a sprinter. The four marines weren't far behind. Okay you probably noticed two things; the change in characters and the lack of action. I changed the characters and went back a few hours to show just how fierce the fighting along the NDL was and to show just how the 40th Commando went from there to meeting up with the remains of 2nd Rifles. The lack of action is to let you get to know the new characters a little. Trust me this company of Tinnies is little more than a scouting party for a much,, much larger force. The action will pick up in the next chapter and increase in tempo from there. Also I noticed a small mistake in the chapter before this. I put Colonel Hugh instead of Second Lieutenant Hugh. Not sure how I did that but it is meant to be second lieutenant. ","Summary":" \"Two possibilities exist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terr"},{"Movie":"World War Z","Title":"Before The Infection","Author":"ShadowAngelxx","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10922683","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I pulled the trigger falling on to my knees as the pain followed slowly through my bones. I felt the hard breath of my brother come close to me, he hugged me. My brother dragged me in to the van as tears fell down my check on to my legs I couldn't take it no longer, My family my sister what next my brother. I pulled my self up from what I just said and pulled my self together. \"Come on then Alfie get in the van\", My brother shouted desperately I shouted in fear to go now but he wouldn't listen, we saw Alfie grabbing the bags and Oliver. He thew the bags in at the back and dropped Oliver into my brother's hands, Alfie slowly sat down and started the engine. The van had a full tank of petrol, so we gladly drow down mellow lane. We saw thousands of those things, I could never understand how this happened I thought to my self, untill I heard a bang, we hit a lorry which was curved around the entrance to safety. We were stuck, we curved our car around and turned the other way on to the grass were we could slowly slip passed it. We banged into the trees and then we were clear we cheered in joy until we saw something. It was one of thoese things he sat in front of are car and he just kept snapping his teeth together we rolled back and then forward smashing his body in to pieces, blood splattering on are windscreen. Alfie stopped the van and jumped out, to wipe the windscreen. After waiting about ten minutes we was on the roll again. We started driving down the road intill we got off the motor way. I thought about the room what was locked, I shouted and told them to listen. \"Remember that room what had blood leading into it\", everyone's face dropped and in shock Alfie turned around. \"What are you doing there's properly nothing in there \", my brother pointed out. My eyes followed the road and looked back at Alfie. \"There's no point going now its like 78 miles away\", I stated We drove on till we saw something, it was flashing green and red. Me and Alfie got out of the van. We got closer infill we knew what of was, a police car. \"I thought police cars are apposed to flash blue and red\", my eyes followed on infill we looked inside it. There was a suitcase in there and a massive bag which was pretty much looked full. We pulled the handle of the car to see it was unlocked, we swung open the door and lept inside. \"Alfie see if there's some fuel or something I will check the bags\", I ordered from inside. I looked in the massive one first to see it was only a bag full of weapons, my eyes grew wider when I opened the second one. The suit case had had had... I pushed my self back to see there was a arm in there. My eyes shock forward, then it moved I screamed in fear as only my voice followed it more. A man shouted down from behind. \"Stop what your doing\", the man budged his shotgun closer to my chest and ordered me to get out. I lept out of the car, to see Alfie on the floor I budged a little closer to him, but the man just moved his gun closer to me. I got closer and then bang... First part I always make short but I hoped you enjoyed and please tell your friends this is my first book on Wattpad. What I made years ago. Name:Love-Chloexx thanks so much and bye xoxoxoxox[Chapter 2] The man pulled the trigger, but before the bullet reached me Alfie flew in front of me. I cried in fear as Alfie hit the floor my bones shock as I looked at the man. I walked up to him giving a bleeding look into his eyes, he budged back. I puched in the chest, and again and again but before I could get another hit. He headbutted me, I fell to the ground with a crash. That's when something crept up behind him. My brother I snapped my head side ways before the man could notice him, my brother shot down and kicked him in the legs giving me the second chance I could take to beat the shit out of him. \"Fuck you\", the man spittered blood at me. I put my shoe against his chest and with power I pushed it down against his chest drowning him in his own blood. I ran back towards Alfie to see he was...gone. I lept backwards and sat up giving a moan in grief for his death. \"He was a great man\", I looked down at his corpes. We all walked towards the van to notice something we haven't even gave those things a name. We sat down in the car and thought for a momment. \"What about walkers\", I pointed out the window down at Alfie. \"Great, how come you always call me bro or brother but never James\", my brother coughed My eyes widend from the the day I lost my parents. \"How co...\", my brother stopped talking and started the engine. My thoughts grew terrifying and my eyes closed thats when I started searching through my thoughts. My thoughts grew around Alfie and Oliver, I pushed my fist against the window. A crack in the window apeard beanth my eyes, my brother looked. \"Why did you do that\", James grew strongly I sat back and frowned like a six year old getting told off, my eyes blinked in terror as we drove along the road. The road was destroyed so we had to drive on the pavment for safe measures. When we finally got of the disaster we turned left to Marrow road it was covered in blood my eyes grew strongly as I thought about the people who died here. I turned away to look at my brother and then I felt a draft which made me look at something. My eyes glowed white and made me feel something that I havent felt in along time...love. I blinked in a second so see an army base. My eyes welled up from the things they could do, help us or even save us from this horrible world. We got closer to see a fire loads of bodies were spread out from the entrance to the exit. My eyes widened from the point thee might not be any help. We stopped the van just outside, my brother locked Oliver in the back with some blankets. My brother walked to the back of the van and opened the back. There was a bag full of guns that James took from that car back at the motor way. \"Wow look at these guns\", James knows every gun out there so that was a great start to a horrible day. There was a Glock 17 and 31 there was alot of handguns. There was a Colt LE901, a SIG SG 716 and a Colt M4 Carbine. My eyes widened from the exciment there was, we were ready. We walked forwards with guns in are hands, when we reached the gate. We jumped over, before we could hit the ground we could see no one was here or were there. There was millions of tents just sitting there. We went on to check I went right and James went left. I unzipped the tent and walked in to see there was a bed and a box, I searched it. There was a torch which I took because it could be useful and there was a uniform it looked like a army uniform. I looked in the rest to see it was the same, a hour past and we met at the start again. \"How come theres a torch and a uniform in every box\", I pointed to one of the tents. My brother shudded his shoulders and pulled me forwards to the main office. The door was border off and on the side of the building it said 'Infected do not approach or open this door' my eyes opened to see the army couldn't even handle this stupid shitty apocalypse. My breath stormed away to the sound of a groan. \"Looks like were going in\", James said mentaly \"Are you Fucking insane\", I stormed off behind him \"We have to its are only choice and we have guns\", my brother pointed in the far distance. We budged the planks off the door and kicked the door open. Shooting a way out, we shot them in the heads untill one mangled through and attacked me. He jumped on me pushing my handgun to the side leaving me struggling, I punched it in its face and kicked him back but before I could roll away it jumped I put my food side ways stopping it from biting me. Its neck was trapped against my foot I reached to the side to grab my gun, but my foot slipped. \"Shit\", my mouth opened in shock I pushed the walker off with force, pulling my self up of the floor grabbing my gun with power, I shot it right in the middle of its head. James finished the rest, I fell to the ground taking a breath, at the same time my brother handed me some water and some packed lunch he made when we was getting ready. We started munching down starving and thirsty but before I could finish I had an eerie thought that someone else was here... I hoped you enjoyed. Check out my Wattpad account Name:Love-Chloexx Thanks so much and don't forget to tell your friends xoxoxoxo[Chapter 3] My throat dried up to the sound of a door opening. We hid under a table which was near to the door what opened. I coughed silently but it didn't work out. The person peaked it's head under the table to see us both snuggleing. \"Ha, what you doing under there? No wait let me guess... your kissing\", it was a woman. She had long blonde hair and she had brown hazelnut eyes and she was wearing a dress. I jumped out from under the table and smiled at her dress. \"I fucking love your dress! By the way, what's your name?\", My happyness grew stronger. \"My name is Sophie and thanks\", she turned slowly so I could admire her dress \"Hey, can you just speed this up rember we have a baby in the van that's getting really hungry\", James reminded me, struggling to look away from her dress. \"So, you are going out then?\", she stated. Our eyes opened in shock from what she said and I turned around to look away. \"Ehhh no, she's my sister\", James angrily moaned. She nodded, then she walked up to the front door and shut it. \"What are you doing\", I said. \"Just shutting the door so none of those things walk in\", she moaned kindly We sat down at the table while she explained her story. \"So the army are against us the survivors\", I shockly said \"Yes true\", she leaned down and grabbed a bag which I didn't notice before. \"Here\", she gave me the bag. With eerie I opened the bag there was a braclet which was curved with tiny charms. \"Hmmm...thanks\", I looked down at the charm slowly studying it. She smiled and then with a surprise she opened her mouth. \"CAN I COME WITH YOU\", I fell off my chair in surprise of what she said. \"Sure but we have to go know\", I sat up and turned around to walk out through the door, but when I opened it. There it was standing there like it was a dummy I shut the door quickly and sat down against it. \"WHAT I DONT WANT TO DIE\", Sophie screamed loudly \"Shut up\", James wispeared She shut her mouth and hid under the table like a seven year old playing hide and seak. I pushed a chair infront of the door to stop the Walker from pushing in. I looked through the empty window to see there were more than one. I took a breath and fell to to my knees but before I could relax Sophie and James ran out through the back door. My eyes followed them into the dark ally way which made my eyes ake from the wind. My head started spinning slowly then faster every second that past in this world. My eyes closed in a blink of the wind passing out onto the floor banging my head against the wall, painfully feeling the pain as the Walkers flowed past me... Thanks so much. Check out my Wattpad Name:Love-Chloexx Tell your friends xoxoxoxoxo[Chapter 4] The Walkers flowed past me like I wasn't there like I was the wall its self. My eyes opened onto the middle of the street slowly picking my self up I heard something. The sound came from down the street it sounded like someone maybe my brother. I lifted my self off the floor till I noticed I sprained my foot. \"Fucking hell why now\", I sat up and turned around to look at the charm which was now attached to my hand. I walked down the street to notice the van was gone, my brother and Sophie I took a deep breath to notice blood on the floor. I saw more movement down the street I followed the road to see who they were. The man had black short hair and the other man had blonde hair. My eyes opened wide to notice they were both bit, I looked forward and stared at the blood dripping on the floor. My head turned around slowly, luckily still having my gun on me. I shouted them to look at me and then whitout looking I pulled the trigger twice. Shooting then both in there forehead. My eyes welled up but before I could make my self clear there was something or someone moving closer and closer to me. I took a step back and turned around I felt the hard breeze of the wind come closer and closer, flowing the same speed as the things walking up. I tried to run but my legs wouldn't move which made me think that I wanted to see who it was my eyes sank down to the ground. Getting closer and closer I decided I should start walking. I got closer to see it was a gang off men, swifting slowly side to side thinking they can survive this planet. My eyes gazed at them as the turened around to daca me. \"Who the Fuck are you\", he pulled his fist to my face. I rolled my eyes and kicked him in the face. She pulled his face to his hands waiting for the blood to run. \"Stupid bitch, why the Fuck you do that\", he lifted his head at stared fully red into my eyes like he was about to murder me. I steped back but for I could run he grabbed hold of me. \"Lookes like a runner boys, what should be do with her!\" He lifted an eyebrow I spited in his face to prove he has no right at all. \"Let go of me\", I demanded \"No why should I\" \"Well I'm tougher than you\", I smiled arkwardly \"Ha\" he laughed and pulled me higher casing me to about murder him. \"You wanna see\", I pulled my cost high knowing he can't block it without dropping me. My fist pushed forward knocking him backwards casing him to fall flat on the floor. \"G...ge...get her\", he lifted his hand and gained them directions where to go, so they can block me. I dodged a couple of them before losing my touch they took hold of my arms and my legs so I couldn't get lose. I struggled but it wouldn't do, I couldn't get out of this situation... Thanks so much./Please check my Wattpad account :Love-Chloexx O'I hoped you enjoyed and please tell your friends. xoxoxoxoxoxo[Chapter 5] My eyes followed the man, I didn't know where he was taking me. My legs sore from the ground whilst he dragged me against the floor. \"Looks like she is finally awake\", his eyes beemed at mine. I growled furiously before kicking him. He threw me on the floor and started to talk angrily. \"You stop that or we are going to have a little fall out\", he growled even more. I lifted an eyebrow to meet with his, he was staring at me like I wasn't even here. He stared blankly to see he wasn't even looking at me but something behind me. I turned around slowly to notice it was a WALKER. I sat up and jumped onto my feet feeling a little tipsy from when I passed out earlier. I looked around to see the group had vanished, my sight turned blurry again. I fell in a second, dreaming deeply and then in a click I went. My eyes swallowed deeply as I drept about something which made me turn sides quickly. I woke up in a back of a van I sat up to see my brother and Sophie. They were sitting there like some murder has just killed someone. My eyes followed the road leading it as James swirled against the road turning left. I skidded to the other side of the van making James turn around noticing something. \"She's alive\", my brother shouted in surprise I lifted myself up wondering what has happened. \"What do you mean I'm alive\", I pointed out. \"When we found you, were dead\", his eyes narrowed mine. My eyes opened in shock, until I noticed the gun wound. \"We had to take all the bullet out\", James said nervously I pulled my T-shirt down and sat back to see if there was a bottle of water. \"So what happened\", James looked down to my stomach \"I don't know, I met with a gang of people and they just dragged me away\", my eyes started to narrow his. My brother snorted making a sound which I couldn't take. We reached the south what looked like a whole new beginning, there was trees every where. This was England not the rainforest my eyes stared through the front window staring blindly making myself believe there is maybe a cure... Thanks so much./Please check out my Wattpad :Love-Chloexx O'I hoped you enjoyed and please tell your friends. xoxoxoxoxo[Chapter 6] My eyes followed the road to see trees and flowers my eyes turned golden when I saw animals. I lifted my self up and grabbed some sandwiches which my brother makes every morning. \"So what do you think\", James asked unconcerned \"Well I think it's FUCKING AMAZING\", I shouted back My eyes sparkled to see Sophie still sleeping, with Olivia wrapped up in her hands. My brother started the engine and drove on passing the trees and farms. \"There should be a little cottage up the road, and the good thing is theres a town just a couple of miles away\", James stated I fell back thinking of what we could do there without these monsters. (Why has this happened I must be the reason if I can't get infected, how come I keep passing out) I got knocked out of my thoughts when I heard the engine turn off. James got out of the van grabbing everything at the back, making Sophie finally wake up and follow. \"Were here\", James smiled I helped him grab the rest and jumped out. My mouth dropped open to see how beautiful it was I couldn't believe my eyes. We walked up to the front door to see it was locked. James lifted one leg and then in a click it was open. We grabbed the bags and threw them inside. There was four beds which will come in handy. A colossal fireplace, a table which was spaced out in the middle of the room and finally a kitchen. A hour past till we finally got settled in, Olivia was asleep on the smallest bed and Sophie was making tea. \"What you think\", James lifted an eyebrow \"It's wonderful\", my eyes started to glitter Sophie ran behind me with three cups of tea,\"here you go\", Sophie furiously gave us them. \"What's a matter Sophie\", I sounded worried I looked around to see something out in the distance it was one of those things a Walker. My heart started beating quickly and faster and faster making myself feel dizzy my sight turned blurry and then I was gone. James P.O.V Zoe fell to the ground I lifted my self up from the table and flew to Zoe. She fainted again my eyes welled up I sat up and pulled her over to the bed until I heard something bang against the door. I slowly looked out through the window and then I fell leaning against the bottom wall slowly making sure they don't see me. \"What's happening\", Sophie wispered My voice disappeared when I heard another knock that's when I knew we had to get rid of them. Here you go and thanks so much...I hoped you enjoyed xxx Please check out my Wattpad :Love-Chloexx THANKS SO MUCH XOXOXOXOXOXOX[Chapter 7] Sophie's P.O.V \"OMG WHAT'S GOING ON!\", my face blew forward as the Walkers stumbled towards the door. James lifted his Glock high and I held my knife with it. This was stupid he had a GUN why the fuck would I go out there with a knife what doesn't even do half as a gun would. My eyes rolled forward and within the same time he pushed me out FIRST. You got to be fucking kidding me suriously what's the point am going to die first. I lifted my knife slicing one head off in a second my mouth widened. \"Ha see that, you stupid piece of shit!\", I spitted straight on to it making my self feel tougher. He rolled his eyes but fluttered with excitement I could tell he was impressed. Before I could look up and do a trick one jumped straight clean onto me without even making a sound it pulled me to the ground. \"Ouch ow ow ow\", my voice turned darker as it pealed his eyes down to my skin. I pulled over trying not to be scared or anything but then it just jumped back on to me. My eyes rolled as I heard it's finally groan, he shot him right in the skull. \"You alright\", he grabs my hand leading it to a arkward momment \"Yeah, I'm fine thank you\", I pulled my arm away from his. I pulled my self up and jumped to the side to notice there were more of those stupid things, I couldn't believe how this happened I thought he said it's the country side there shouldn't be anything here. James P.O.V I saw Sophie stare at the sky blankly, that's when I pushed her. \"Why did you do that\", she smiled making me feel she had a thing for me. She wasn't even mad at me for doing it, she just smiled I could definitely tell she liked me. There were still more of those things coming closer, I shot a couple and left the rest to her. She was fit I could say that she was good at fighting but I could tell she wanted a gun. We finally finished killing them, we walked back inside the house. Zoe was still asleep and so was Oliver. I turned around and locked the door pulling chairs and box's to block those things from coming in. I also pulled a blanket over the massive window with the curtains closed so no light comes through and draws them. I fell onto the bed closing my eyes speaking a truth in my dreams. I woke up early waiting for the smell of something special BREAKFAST. Zoe walked up to me with a plate of waffles my eyes gazing at them. \"Here you deserve it, for saving our life's last night\", she pointed at the plate and them dropped it into my lap. Breakfast in bed was always my favorite even now it would be the best. Sophie was at the table with Olivier eating, Zoe waked back to the table to eat hers. The table was against the door, when we blocked the door last night just in case those things stumbled in. When we finally finished we tidied up, by moving furniture back to the original place. We made our beds and grabbed our guns ready for hunting. Zoe had to stay here and babysit Olivier while me and Sophie went hunting for food or even supplies in the town a couple of miles back. We decided we should walk and save the petrol, we left the cottage and went walking down the road. We walked about a mile until we saw a rabbit finally food. Sophie ran into the woods and hunted it, about ten minutes later she came out with her hands covered in blood and a dead rabbit in her hands moaning about she didn't want it on her dress. Passing it to me I wrapped it in a plastic bag and shoved if in my back pack. We started walking down the road until we could see the town it was small but it had alot of shops and houses all cramped together. We walked down the road to the closest house, we could tell this town wasn't warned about this. Sophies P.O.V The first house had a lot of useful things like torches, water, food everything. There was a chemist which I had to investigate and alot of general shops, which was just full of more food and water. I had completely picked clean everything bags full, I even picked up a new dress and for the rest just some normal boring clothing. My eyes peeled the woods as we walked back waiting if another rabbit would come and enter, I always wanted a pet rabbit. Nothing even appeared on the way back not even a sound of a tree swaying against another. We finally reached home waiting for a breath we packed everything away in the cupboards and the wardrobe. We sat down and took a breath while Zoe made us lunch, I luckily picked up some baby formula while I was searching the shops back in the far end of the town. So know Olivier didn't have to eat mashed up food anymore. We finally came to a reach where we can finally relax and enjoy a hot sunny day, well the English weather was kinda shit but today was hot. Olivia was back to a sleep again, enjoying the sun go down I made my self another tea to get me dreamy and then I after I would read a boring book and just fall asleep. Which happened well, James was last to go to sleep because he had to move everything again like to block the door and everything. My life was a dream I fell asleep and made my dreams come to a beautiful place, my job my family well it was a perfect dream... Thanks so much, and don't forget to check my Wattpad account :Love-Chloexx THNAKS SO MUCH XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO[Chapter 8] Zoe's P.O.V I woke up to the sound of Olivier crying I could tell this is going to be a horrible morning. James was rocking Olivier slightly edged at the scene I pulled him out of his hands and rocked him probably. \"Thanks, didn't get any sleep last night he was crying\", he's eyes closed furiously but after I just pushed him on the bed. \"Go to sleep then, I'm your older sister for a reason\", he closed his eyes and fell asleep just in a click. Oliver was also tired I just put him on bed and left him to be. Sophie was at the table fully awake. \"Why aren't you asleep\", I moaned in a gesture with my hands. \"Ohh I had ear plugs I found them in the left drawer at the side of the bed\", she kindly whispered like it was a secret. Sophie's P.O.V I sat up and walked through the front door I grabbed the Glock at the same time, turning around to make sure no one saw me. I sat on guard waiting for any of those things to stumble through but I guess it was a lucky day. My thoughts grew bigger, why is Zoe so special. Maybe she is the case of this defeated world or maybe she has something else to plot with it. I couldn't let her be the person I wanted to be special and I want a real gun not a stupid handgun. My eyes widened as I sat there, there was a Walker coming closer and closer. This is my chance I pulled my gun up , pulling the trigger before my eyes. The Walker shot down blood splattering everywhere thank God its not on my new dress. My face scowled at it from the distance I peered my face at it. You stupid little bitch I fucking hate this we take turns to save Olivier and we have to work together and I'm terrible at that. I walked back inside and put on my jacket ready for the cold to spread. My eyes gazed at the sky ready for the clouds to apear. I walked back in until it started raining I signed and sat down at the table. James poked me and smiled delightly I smirked proving I was kind of childish. \"Fine I'll go you cry baby\", James said sarcastically My eyes peeled down at him as if I was going to murder him. A couple of hours past til we wanted to go, we decided a couple of days ago we should leavex soon and then just grab everything and leave. As so we did we packed up and jumped in the van and left waiting for a chance to find something. Maybe, maybe a connection waiting for us to find it, a cure or even a chance to end this thing... Maybe this was the end or the beginning... Opps this was kinda a rushed chapter I have been trying to edit a little but I had a test coming up and I had to revise for it, but I will try and make it better the next chapter more understanding and try and not to rush it. Any way I hoped you enjoyed this chapter and remember to follow me on twitter name on my account, hoped you enjoyed and peace out ✌ DONT FORGET TO CHECK MY WATTPAD ACCOUNT. Name:Love-Chloexx THANKS SO MUCH XOXOXOXOXOX[Chapter 9] Zoe's P.O.V 2 weeks we've been waiting for a opening or even a cure. It's been years and I'm kinda getting sick of it trying to find something. \"Okay so where we heading\", I asked anxiously \"Well I think we should head for London\", James asked back \"Why\" \"There's a science centre there, so I thought they might have found a cure\", he answered back The car skidded of the gravel road making me tip over, nearly doing a front flip. \"DO YOU FUCKING MIND\", Sophie sat up nearly hitting him. The reason we left is because it was getting so hard to live without the cure, so we thought we should look for it. Sophie agreed with the plan but James didn't he thought it was stupid. But now he thinks it is a great idea. \"Shit we best not have a flat tire again\", James opened the door so he could have a look. \"Yep fuck me\", James grabbed everything and started walking. \"Where do you think your going\" \"I'm walking there, that van is a piece of shit\", he answered We all grabbed our stuff and followed him, I carried everything because Sophie wanted to carry Oliver so she wouldn't carry everything. I couldn't be bothered to walk 300 miles, it was going to take forever. \"We've got a week left of food so we have to hurry\", I smirked. About 59 miles back there was another car but it also had a flat tire. We walked down a lot of empty streets, fire everywhere and body's. I kept slipping on blood that's how bad it was. I went flying the first time and the second my face was on the floor. \"Are you alright\", James lifted an eyebrow I nodded in laughter, crossing the lake of blood. We crossed a lake and a couple of farms, what were empty completely. James continued to walk as we had a rest which made me and Sophie fall back a couple of miles. \"This is Why I hate him\", I sighed \"Well your lucky I had never had a brother or a sister, and your lucky to see them\", Sophie made her speech \"Don't you dare talk about HER\", I growled. Sophie walked away so she could catch up with James leaving me alone for a couple of minutes. At London... We finally arrived at London, to look up to a dump. The place was completely trashed top to bottom. Cars everywhere and rubbish to, I used to love London. There would be shops full of amazing clothes and shoes, and look at it now. I missed London I wish this never happened. Sophie grabbed everything and picked her self a house, what I thought was stupid. We wanted to stay here for a bit while we investergate the science lab. But first we wanted time relax, are legs were killing us. So we spent a night in a house, sleeping and having a talk night... THANKS SO MUCH. Don't forget to check my Wattpad :Love-Chloexx THANK YOU XOXOXOXOXOXOX[Chapter 10] Sophie's P.O.V We spent a coupe of years in London, it was peace full. We could do what we want, it was so peace full I couldn't notice if it was the apocalypse. It's been 5 years straight and still no cure, I've been wondering if they might find one. We've been growing food, and searching London top to bottom. So we thought we might find the cure our selfs, I know it sounds crazy and all but it isn't. So we had to get to Paris, on every radio we tried it would come up with a message. \"The...re c#a\"'mp j:ust u.p P#$,aris\",.the radio stopped. \"Did you get any of it\", James asked unconcerned \"I think it said something about a camp near Paris\", Zoe left the room to fetch something \"Where you going\", I smiled but failed to get her attention \"I'm having a coffee, I feel like shit\", Zoe laughed \"Make sure you make me one\", I chocked on the air she nodded at me and walked off, leaving me alone with James sitting on a sofa. \"So we have to drive up to Paris\", I moaned \"Yes\" \"Yeh but we have everything here, so why leave\", I frowned \"We have to so we can find a cure\", James questioned me. \"What and leave this behind\", I walked off having a tantrum The next day we packed up, we found a massive lorry not far and thought it would be use full. So we put everything in the back even the sofa. We had to drive far on a drive way, get a boat what's going to be hard. I've never been to France so please I don't know how to get there, please comment me if you know how... It was a long journey, I with this was gone. I've lost my parents my fucking dog. It's not far, I could be in America by now if this didn't start. I could be famous. We talked all day about out real life's before this and I've been wondering how it started. 6 Years ago... \"Please hand me that\", the scientist pointed at the sharp knife on the table. He was searching a body what was bit on his neck and also his arm. \"Okay can you hand me that jar\", he pointed again at the table. A groan appeared behind him, lifting a sound of footsteps. Lowing as the body got closer. \"Mr trown please stop moving and get me that jar\", the scientist demanded \"Sir I think I think you should look behind you\", he ran away nearly tripping over his own feet. \"Huh what?\", he cocked his head to the side. He failed to run as he dug his teeth in his neck, spilling all the blood on the floor. The other man couldn't get out as the other scientists locked the door not letting any thing come out. \"Let me out, please let me out!\", he cried louder and louder. He pulled down to the floor rocking, all crunched up into a ball. He turned around to a horrible death as the body snapped his teeth on his neck... OMG thank you. Don't forget to check my Wattpad :Love-Chloexx Thanks so much that you have read this far xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo[Chapter 11] 6 Years Ago The man flinched a second later as he drowned in his own blood. Now there was 3 infected people walking around. The test subject, was named Ryan. He was 26 years old and had the infection for over 2 weeks. The infection spread over America spreading all over the rest. Leaving terror and horrifying deeds, the government got forced to leave and find a cure for it. But the government didn't care, and left everyone for dead. The scientists all died of starvation some vomited from it and some didn't. Hundreds of people died after that, they escaped to the outside world. The man named Ryan, was found in a cave. Full of blood, no one actually knew what happened. They just know that's it been out there for a very long time. The infection started 11 years ago but they managed to block it out, by putting fences up. It did well until Ryan got a little to carried away. Back To Present... Sophies P.O.V \"I with this would go away\", I moaned until they finally gave me my breakfast. \"Oh shut up\", James replied First foot in and then the seconds, we looked around for a while after. It was massive this place, if you mist something I guess it would matter a lot. We was here, Paris... I love this place, it was always on the news for it's amazing shops. But that didn't matter any more we needed to find the scientist... We looked around for ages, pretty much it took us a week to find it... \"It's massive\", I frowned James laughed and then he walked inside, it was bigger inside. I was scared and actually I didn't want to his inside... James swung open the second door, and went in first. Me following second and Zoe following last with Olivier in her hands. I couldn't wait to find the cure... Thank you. Don't forget to check my Wattpad :Love-Chloexx Thanks so much xoxoxoxoxoxoxox[Chapter 12] Finally the second I find him, I knew we could be the hero's. \"So where do we start\", James laughed as he opened one door on the left. We started walking down a long hallway, it looked amazing. It looked more as a hospital than a private laboratory. \"It looks huge\", my eyes widened in shock. She nodded and walked off somewhere safe, to keep Olivier safe. Zoe fell asleep, somewhere safe. Leaving me and James to search, it was going to take forever. I searched up stairs and the third floor, while he searches the ground floor and the basement. I walked upstairs, opening a door. It was a kitchen, a massive one. \"Ewwww it stinks in here\", I threw my hand over my face, it wasn't a kitchen but a butcher room. There was blood everywhere, on the sides even on the wall. Maybe they experimented on things. I walked forward clutching down on to the floor, making sure no one saw me. Just in case there was someone here. I looked through everything, the draws and even under the counters. I sat down to rest, letting my self breath. James P.O.V I looked through the draws, finding hundreds of weird messages. Loads of notes appeared, saying weird things. They were documents, from all the patients they had. DOC NO.1 June 4th 2009 Young man, 20 in age, has blue eyes. Lives in London. Has no medical uses. Passed away, treated with death from cure. DOC NO.2 December 13th 2013 Young lady, 16 in age, has hazel eyes. Lives in London. Has no medical uses. Passed away, treated with death from cure. A tear dropped, as I fell on to my knees. They used young people for slaves. So they could find the cure. These people were sick, they don't have the cure at all. I threw the papers back into the draw, feeling a draft behind my neck. Something or someone threw me backwards. Throwing a knife at my throat, whispering something. \"Who else is with you? What do you know? ANSWER ME\" I turned my neck slowly to come in face with a man in a white coat. He was a scientist that worked here. A second later I was tied up to a chair, facing him. \"Who else is here?\", He threw his hands up mentally I shuck my head, closing my eyes. Wishing we never came here. \"ANSWER ME\" I looked away, drifting away as he started walking up stairs. I heard footsteps, I could tell Sophie was trying to hide. Sophie's P.O.V I heard someone walk up stairs, it couldn't have been James he was searching down stairs. I took a leap and hid behind a weird looking statue. \"Please please don't find me\", I whispered time my self. He threw open the door what was on the left, being surprised that he hasn't found me yet. \"Hello, come out wherever you are\", he laughed, he walked around the room creeping. While he was doing that, I crawled to the stairs. Going backwards to make sure he hasn't seen me. When i finally got to the last step I saw James sitting there. I walked up to him, undoing the rope. \"Wheres Zoe\", I whispered \"I don't know\", he replied I walked around slowly to see her on the floor asleep, without Olivier. I shuck her. \"Where's Olivier\", I frowned. She leaped up searching her eyes everywhere, she couldn't find her. \"I don't know, she was here a minute ago\", she started to cry. \"I think the scientist took her\", I started to hug her, so I could calm her down.

Nothing came through for a moment. I questioned if I should hang up and call her back, until I heard a sharp intake of breath. \"But that's in two days,\" she calmly replied. \"Yeah, I know. Go ask your parents. Then tell me their reply. Tell them I'm taking you. Then you call Melina and tell Katie when she gets home. Go ask them...NOW!\" I demanded, nearly seeing her flinch at my new found anticipation. But she finally sighed and replied; \"Fine.\" I heard her bed creak as the weight of her body shuffled around. I could visually see her swinging the door open and sprinting down the stairs. Very faintly, I could her scream to her parents; \"Hope invited me to a One Direction concert this friday. Can I go?!\" Oh, my god, she is such a spazz! I thought. I waited a few minutes before deciding to hang up, only then did she come running back in. \"So what'd they say?\" I asked, crossing my fingers. \"They...\" she sounded as if she was gonna cry. \"They said... YES!\" I squealed. \"Now call Melina and wait for Katie to get home!\" \"Okay! Call Maddy and Noelle!\" \"No shit...\" I facepalmed. And by the sound of her giggle, I knew she'd known I'd facepalmed. \"Call me after you call Melina. Kay?\" \"Fine. Talk to you in like a half hour,\" she laughed. \"Yeah okay,\" I smiled. \"Bye.\" I heard her phone click as she hung up. I paused, recentering myself before I called Maddy. She didn't answer on the first ring, as she usually did, instead she picked up on the third ring. \"Yeah, Hope?\" she asked, clear exaustian in her voice. \"I got six One Direction tickets for this Friday. Emily's coming. We're inviting Melina, Katie and Noelle. Join?\" I said, coming straight out with it. I could just see her caramel colored eyes lighting up as she heard the sweet words pouring out of my mouth. \"Lemme go ask my parents,\" she said, trying to hold back her excitement. \"Okay.\" I heard her door creak open as she quietly slipped out of her room. A few moments later she came back, giggling and clearly smiling. \"They said 'yeah' as long as I had a ride to and from the concert.\" I smiled. \"Don't worry. I'll take you both ways.\" I paused. \"Sounds a bit...dirty.\" She laughed. \"Kay see you Friday. At your place apperantly.\" \"Kay. Now go get a good night sleep. You'll be needing it to keep awake so you don't get trampled on the concert.\" She yawned. \"Night love.\" \"Night.\" She hung up, leaving me in an eerie silence. I took a deep breath and called Noelle. She answered right away. \"Emily beat you too it.\" I groaned. \"Fuck her.\" \"She knew you were going to say that so she told me to ask you 'when? where? how hard?'\" she chuckled. \"My parents said yes by the way.\" \"Well good. I better call her back then. Bye love.\" She giggled. \"Bye.\" One Direction was mine and Emily's savior from the pits of depression. They're music connected us with the people around us on a whole new level. Eventually, we made Melina, Noelle, Maddy and Katie obsessed with them. It helped a lot with our confidence knowing people actually liked talking to us. You see, Emily and I are...well, we don't necisarrily fit in. Katie is Emily's younger sister, she's smarter so she skipped a year, so that's why she's in our grade; she was better liked than Emily. But when she brought her friends Noelle, Maddy and Melina to our table to eat with us, they actually hadn't run away. Like all of the others. Instantly, we all became best friends. My phone rang my ring tone \"Chloe\" by Emblem3. Emily. \"Yes?\" I answered. \"They all can come. Katie came home as soon as you hung up,\" she laughed. \"We're all meeting at my place,\" I said. \"That's what I assumed so that's what I told Melina, Katie and Noelle.\" I nodded my head against the phone. \"Whale, I'll see you on Friday. Get rest. Try to sleep through tomorrow.\" She yawned into the phone, making me pull head away from the speaker. \"G'night and talk to you on Friday.\" This time it was I who hung up first. I yawned and glanced at the clock; midnight. I have to rest to keep my stamina up during the concert. \"Night self!\" I yawned.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: Emilys Pov I stared at my reflection in the mirror. Three hours to the concert; ten minutes to get ready. Ugh. My dark green hair was tossed around my head, looking like someone had just taken a leaf blower to my head. Ugh again. I took a brush and slowly and, as gently as I could, ran it through my hair. Finally, it came to my normal straightened hair with a poof in the back. I stalked to my room. Rummaging through my closet, I was bombarded by rounds of excited jumping hugs. Katie. \"Katie. I'm trying to get ready. Just gimmie like five more minutes. Gosh. Leeeeaaaveeeee!\" I snapped. I turned around. She was standing there in her 'I love Liam' shirt, shorts, thigh highs and she had a bandana on her head, wrapping around her brown hair. She whinced. \"Fine. I'll be in the living room waiting alone.\" \"Kay be down there in a moment.\" As I rummaged through the closet I felt someone else enter the room. My dad. \"Be careful tonight. I don't want you two to get hurt. Look after her. Okay?\" he asked moving the hair away from my eyes. \"Yeah. Mhmm.\" \"Emily I need a straight answer on this.\" \"Yeah I know. Seriously dad I'll watch out for her.\" \"Good. Love you.\" \"Love you too Dad.\" As he closed my door I turned back to my closet finally spotting the perfect shirt to wear. I pulled it over my head while walking to my drawer to find some pants. Shorts and fishnet leggings would do. I pulled them on and walked down to the living, grasping Katie's arm and pulling her out the door. \"Bye. Be back later!\" I yelled. I slammed the door closed and pulled Katie in the direction of Noelle's house, picking her up with us. I let go of her arm as we approached her walk way. Before we even reached her doorway, she came running out, jumping and yelling. \"Ready?\" I asked. She nodded enthusiastically. I gripped her hand and Katie's as we walked in silence to Hope's house. Noelle was wearing her brown hair up in a bun with a green bandana around her head. Her shirt was the One Direction logo and she had on skinny jeans. Fishnet gloves ran up all the way on her arms. Once we reached Hope's, we raced each other to the front door. Yeah, I know. I'm so supposed to act all rebel and not give a fuck about anything just cos I look emo. But, no. I have a special small spot just for my little sister. She meant the world to me and if anything ever happened to her, I would die and I wouldn't be able to move on in my life. That's how much I loved her. Hope swung the door open as soon as Katie's knuckles rapped against the wood. Melina and Maddy appeared behind her. Hope was wearing a red beanie that covered her wavy black hair, her white One Direction shirt was over a black long sleeve undershirt. She wore skinny jeans with a belt that hung low and chains that hung to the side. Maddy wore a British flag shirt with One Direction shorts, black leggings, one fishnet glove was on her right wrist. Her favorite color; black. Her caramel colored hair was tied back in a tight pony tail. Melina wore skinny jeans, a shirt with the boys face on them, gloves, a small jacket and her hair was in a tight bun under a beanie. \"Ready guys?\" I asked, nearly bouncing where I stood. \"Yeah!\" they replied together. \"Get in the car and Emily and I will meet you there!\" Hope said. \"We need to find my CD's.\" Everyone nodded. Hope pulled my arm and yanked me into her room. I immediatly began looking for her music. \"Here's one!\" I called from under her bed, tossing it to her as I sat up. \"Oh here's the other one!\" she called. We raced back to the front door, closing it behind us and locking it up. We climbed into the car, me sitting in the passanger seat. I put in the first CD. Up All Night. For the whole three hours, we listened to both CD's twice, all the way through. Once we pulled into the parking space, we all struggled to get out of the van. We rushed to the line, standing around being the seventifith place in the line. I started jumping in my spot. My first concert ever. For any kind of band. I'm glad I get to spend it with my five best friends.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three: Hopes Pov Once inside we found out seats, trying our hardest to not get trampled by other Directioners. We sat there...waiting. Waiting for our idols to walk on stage. Finally, after twenty gruelling minutes, they did. It started out normal, they were goofing off on stage, girls screaming, throwing things like bras and carrots up on stage. They were singing Little Things and it was on Louis' part. He was turned to our row. Sitting in the front of concert costed me a lot of money. Or at least my mom. She paid for the tickets, as long as I listened and did as told for a year. So, everything was normal until...I heard a blood curtling scream coming from thirteen rows behind us. I turned to Emily. \"What is that? What's happening?\" She, being taller than me, stood on her tippy toes and glanced at the row. Her eyes grew wide and her chest began to rise and fall rapidly. \"What is it?\" Katie and Noelle asked. \"Z-Z-Zombies! And they're headed this way!\" Soon we heard more and more screams as the apparent zombies filled the room. I turned to Emily, seeming to send a telepathic message to her. \"The boys! Get the boys!\" All six of us jumped on stage. I turned around scanning the crime scene. Thirty or so Zombies were attacking the young innocent girls in the rows behind our seats. I watched as one girl was bitten directly on the neck. Her body began to spaz, jerking itself in unnatural ways. \"Quickly!\" I turned around at the sound of a scream. Niall. A female zombie was cornering him, his back was already pressed against the wall. I did the only thing I could. I grabbed a mic stand and ran to the Zombie. \"Get away you bitch!\" I yelled, smashing it over her skull. Niall looked at me bewildered. Emily stood up, calmly shouting over the noise. \"Boys follow me if you wanna live. As cliche as it is. Follow me!\" she shouted. The boys' bassist started following her when a zombie jumped up and bit him on the arm. He fell on top of her, crushing her with both the zombie and his weight on her. I grabbed her wrist and yanked her out from under them. I turned to the boys. \"Do you wanna die?\" They shook their heads. \"Then follow, ya cute idiots!\" Harry grinned at me. Emily grabbed Niall and Louis hand, pulling them towards the back exit. Katie took Harry's and Liams. Noelle took Zayns and Joshs. Melina, Maddy and I grabbed the mic stands, taking the lead and the rear of our group. I opened the back door, quietly. I waved them through the small opening of the door. \"Lead them to my car,\" I whispered to Emily. She nodded, understanding where to take them. I joined them once I knew everyone was out. Everyone was sitting in the car, Harry in the passanger. I sat in the drivers seat and started the car. Suddenly...SMASH. A zombies head shot through the back window, right next to Emily and Niall. I took the mic and smashed the zombies head, knocking her outside. \"Drive! Drive! Drive!\" Louis shouted. I punched the gas and we shot out of our spot, crashing into different small family cars. \"We need to get out of town,\" I said. \"No shit!\" Katie and Liam said. They were holding hands quietly, huddling together, frightened with the scene that was playing out before them. I drove, rapidly, trying to get us out of town. We were all quiet, barely speaking the only thing to be heard was the window whistling by the window. \"Can you cover that up?\" Noelle asked. \"I'm cold.\" \"Yeah, Emily could you put that peice of cardboard against the window?\" I asked trying to calm down my breathing. Emily nodded and did as asked. \"Who are you guys and how did you do all that ninja shit back there?\" Zayn asked. I chuckled at the irony. \"I'm Emily, U.S. assassin and long distance combate speicalist. Age sixteen.\" Emily said sticking out her hand. Each boy shook her hand. \"I'm Maddy, U.S. assassin and weapons speacalist. Age sixteen.\" Maddy smiled. Zayn stared at her shocked. She giggled. \"I'm Noelle, U.S. assassin and explosives speicalist. Age fifteen.\" Noelle said proudly. Louis whistled and winked at her causing me to chuckle. \"I'm Katie, U.S. assassin and strategy speicalists. Age fifteen.\" Katie said pushing up her invisible glasses. Liam chuckled and grabbed Katie's hand. \"And what about you miss badass?\" Harry asked looking at me. I laughed at the nickname. \"Hope is the name. Short distance combate is the game. Also U.S. assassin. I'm sixteen.\" I smirked. Harry laughed. \"Oh my god...\" Emily whispered. I looked at what she was pointing at. It was one of those things it was eating a little girl. \"Katie, Noelle don't look.\" \"That is vile...\" Niall gagged. looking away. \"Where do we go?\" Emily asked, huddling close to Niall. \"Somewhere far from here. We need to get out of here! Now!\" Harry snapped at me. I turned and snarled at him. He smirked at my anger. In silence, not wanting to draw attention to ourselves, we drove, until Maddy broke the silence, humming Don't Stop Believin'. Melina joined in, then Katie and Noelle, then Niall, Zayn and Louis, then everyone else. We sang road trip songs until we saw building lights. I told everyone to hush and quietly look out the windows. Zombies strolled past us, casually, not even paying attention to us, as we pulled into a store parking lot, one that looked completely empty, we decided to split up. Emily, Maddy and I would go into the store with Zayn, Liam and Josh. \"On my mark...GO!\" I shouted. We jumped out of the car and raced to the store. I scanned the area. Almost everything was still here and in tact. We had to act fast to get what we needed. \"Zayn and Maddy go get the medicine. Hope and Liam go get the drinks. Emily and I will get the food. Meet back here in ten minutes,\" Josh instructed. Maddy and Zayn ran off in the oppisite direction clutching hands, as they raced to get the medicine. Liam and I ran to the non-parishable drink aisle to grab our supplies. I glanced back and watched Emily and Josh sprint off to get food. \"Gatorade. Soda. Water. Juice. Anything to keep us hydrated and awake,\" Liam said to me, grabbing one of the abandoned shopping carts and shoving three gatorades into it. I reached above me as far as my small body could go. I ended up grabbing a Dr. Pepper bottle, Fanta and Root Beer. Five gallons of water and a gallon of juice. We rushed back to our spot as new families and people rushed into the store, bumping into us. Emily and Josh came back first. We waited anxiously for our last party to arrive. Finally, after five agonizing minutes Maddy and Zayn appeared. We ran back to the van nervously avoiding any contact with the new mob that just swarmed in. Melina opened the door and waved us in. \"Quickly, before anyone hurts you!\" she yelled. I started shoving things into the back, all of our snacks, drinks and medicine. \"I grabbed a couple of flairs and guns,\" Emily said. \"Good. We're going to need them,\" I said. Maddy, Katie and Noelle stood guard in the back with me as I put our small belongings in the car. Emily and Melina in the front. Suddenly I heard a scream. \"Run!\" a lady yelled running past me. \"What's wrong?\" Katie asked calmly to the lady. \"The-The-The Undead! They're coming!\" she sceeched. As she said that, monstorous roars sounded around the parking lot. Emily and Melina came running around the back. \"We need to go!\" they screamed. I jammed the last of our supplies in the back of the car. Grabbing a gun from Emily, I closed the the trunk and ran to the drivers side. Emily sat in the back aiming her gun out the good window. Noelle took down the cardboard and aimed her gun out that window. Katie, Maddy and Melina aimed their weapons out the back. I put the key in the ignition and started the car, only...it didn't start. \"Fuck!\" I hit the gas again as I turned the key. \"No. Not now. Why now?\" A zombie hit the window next to Niall, sending him flying backwards. He screamed, sounding close to a girl causing me and Emily to look at each other and start giggling. Emily pulled her gun to the zombies head and fired. He fell instantly. I tried again with the car. Finally, it started, my heart beating rapidly as we peeled out of the lot. I turned to the rear view mirror and watched helplessly as little children and their parents were bit and infected by whatever this is. I turned back and kept my eyes on the road.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four: Emilys Pov I abrupty woke up as someone's head planted itself on my shoulder. Blonde fluff was flying my face as we raced past and out of DC. I glanced at my phone. One a.m. I removed the heavy load from my shoulder and crawled over to Hope. \"Mind if I have a go?\" I asked, yawning slightly. \"No. You're tired. Go back to bed,\" she snapped, yawning too. I shook my head, refusing her demand. \"Let me drive. I'm fine. I rested enough and I can drive the rest of the night. Let me drive dude.\" She sighed, finally giving in at the thought of sleep. She pulled over quickly, climbed out and climbed into the back. I climbed over the seat and strapped myself in. I watched in the mirror as she pulled herself over to Harry and rested her head on his stomach. He made a little sound of \"oof\" as her head put its weight on him. I turned back to the road as someone joined me, sitting themselves in the passanger seat. Niall. \"So how'd you guys become assasins?\" he asked, turning his attention to me. I jumped slightly. No one had ever asked me this question so when this cute blonde boy asked me all I could get out was; \"My parents.\" I paused, gaining the courage to tell him. \"All our parents. They raised us to be assasins.\" \"Why?\" he pushed. \"Cos...umm. All of our parents, except for my dad, work for the same assasins company. Both companys work together to make sure their assasin hit is not on any parents around us. I-I've never really killed anybody. But I've injured. So...this'll be a first for me.\" He paused, putting his hand on mine; \"It's okay. You'll get through this.\" He paused again. \"We all will.\" For an hour or so Niall and I talked about the most random of things before he finally asked; \"Who do you like most out of us six boys.\" he laughed at my reaction to his question. \"It's moi right?\" I giggled. \"Well you're all really nice...but uh...Shit!\" A zombie peeled onto the road with a huge SUV, gaining on us. \"Get everyone up! Hurry!\" Niall started screaming and banging things together, waking up our cranky companions. \"Get ready for impact!\" he screamed. I pushed the gas pedal to the floor speeding our small van up. The SUV was already too close. It's bumper knocked into our rear and we rocked forward. Melina and Maddy screamed before they got up and grabbed their guns. Maddy hit the wind shield of the SUV hopefully killing the zombie. But the car kept coming, tailing us and nearly hitting the van. \"Hold on!\" I yelled. I turned into the forest that was next to us, the zombie still following. I made a sharp turn near a tree and barely missed it. I hit the pedal and went flying up onto the road again. \"It's still coming Emily!\" Niall screamed rushing to the back of the car. I turned to the side mirror. Sure enough the van was still gaining. I turned back into the forest, driving down a dirt road, trying to come close to the trees as much as possible with hitting and damaging the car. The radio turned on as someones voice came through. \"Please stop. We're with your parents' assasins company. They've asked us to come and retrieve you. Please slow down,\" they said. So I slowed to a stop, grabbing the gun that I had next to me and I climbed out of the van. Hope, Melina, Maddy, Katie and Noelle climbed out slowly, with the guys right behind them, guns raised. The SUV stopped and someone slowly climbed out of the drivers side. A kid, looking not to much older then me or Hope climbed out. He was wearing skinny jeans, a blue stripped undershirt with a white shirt over it and orange suspenders. His black hair covered his eyes and bounced as he slowly walked towards us. Slowly and more loudly another young boy about the same age as us climbed too. He had blonde hair with a bandana, dark skinny jeans, orange shirt and gloves that went up his arms. His gages were clear even from where we stood. The first guy held his arms up as if for surrender. As he walked towards us I could see he had piercings too. Snake bites to be exact. \"We're not gonna hurt you,\" he said. I jumped when he started talking. I drew my gun as he got even closer. \"That's what they all say.\" \"Right before they decide to chop your head off,\" Hope finished. The first guy kept getting closer and closer to us, creeping his way towards me. \"I'll shoot!\" I snapped. \"No you won't,\" the second guy spoke for the first time. \"You've never shot and killed anyone before.\" \"Jace shut up,\" the first guy snapped. The second guy, apperantly named Jace, flipped his partner off. I turned to Hope, she had the look of I-know-you-from-somewhere on her face. \"If you could please, come with us, we can get you off this country and we can get you somewhere safe,\" the first guy said, making my head turn to him. He was only a few feet away from me, nearly at the tip of my gun. \"Kade I wouldn't get to close to her. She might actually shoot!\" Jace laughed. I reared to him. \"Shut up!\" My sudden movement gave Kade enough time to come up from behind me and snatch my gun from my arms. \"Please trust us,\" he said while taking the amo out of my gun. I gulped. \"Look out!\" Harry shouted. I turned to see a huge group of zombies racing towards us, snarling and foaming at the mouth. \"Quickly get in the car!\" Kade yelled pulling me towards the van. Niall and the rest raced closely behind us, jumping into the van as our ride was bombareded by the killers. \"Floor it!\" Jace yelled to Kade as he climbed in. Kade started the engine racing out of the forest. We barreled out of the forest as the zombies chased after us. \"Where are we going?\" Maddy complained. \"To the base. We're going to send you to a naval boat that's out on the sea. Getting you away from land,\" Kade said. Kade glanced at me through the mirror. I nervously looked away and rested my head on Nialls shoulder. \"Get some sleep,\" Jace demanded. \"You're gonna need it.\" I kept my eyes out on the road, keeping my heavy head on Niall's shoulder. \"You should get some rest,\" Kade said to me. \"I've had enough rest,\" I snapped. \"Don't get bitchy with me I only wanted you to sleep,\" he chuckled. \"You're not my mom. Alright? Got it buddy?\" I snapped again. He laughed. \"Yeah I get it.\" I turned my head back to the window and stared out at the world that raced by. \"So where were you going if we hadn't caught up to you?\" Kade asked. \"To the base. You're glad we didn't shoot you by the way. We would've been happy too,\" I sneered. He chuckled. \"That was some pretty good driving you were doing.\" I blushed shifting my hair to hide the fact that I was. \"H-How long until we actually reach the base?\" \"Three and a half hours,\" he smiled into the mirror. I nodded at him and turned my attention away from him and onto Niall. His head was on my stomach. I reached down and very gingerly started stroking his hair, brushing it back out of his face. Soon my eyes lids grew heavy and I struggled to keep them open. Soon I fell asleep. My dream started like this. I was running down a dark alley, trying to run away from...something that was chasing after me. Yet I didn't know what it was. All I heard was snarling and...and...screaming. Oh, god the screaming. It was Hope's unhuman screech as something caused harm to her. Then it was a male scream. I couldn't tell who it was. I turned around and saw gunfire. Some one was shooting down Hope. Hope'd been infected and was now a zombie. Tears flooded over my eyes. Where was I? What was going on? And who was responible for my best friends loss? All these questions flooded my mind, repeating themselves, reverberating off the walls of my brain. Someone grabbed my arm. It was Kade. \"Run!\" he was saying. Even though I couldn't hear him. He yanked me forward, at the desperate attempt to get me out of there. I was terrifyed. I had no idea what was going on. Suddenly there was a searing pain in my left leg as something bit it. A zombie. My grip loosened in Kade's hand. I fell, body going into a spaz. Then, I glanced up at Kade as he desperately tried to heal me. But all I could see was food. Food. Like a fat kid towards a cheeseburger. I opened my mouth and then... BUMP. I was jerked awake as my head hit the wall of the car. I shivered. I realized where the postion of the car was. We were in the parking lot of the base. I got up and crawled over to Hope, shaking her awake. She sat up, angry that I woke her up. Before she could start arguing I told her about my dream. She sat there listening intently until I finished. \"Do you think it'll come true?\" she asked after I'd finished. \"It might. So where ever it is, we cannot split up. Any of us. Jace, Kade, you and I. We just can't,\" I said, coming close to tears. \"How do you know if the other male was Jace?\" she asked. \"I-I just have a feeling. No matter how much they protest...we have to stick together.\" She nodded. \"Everyone get out!\" Jace yelled. \"Well isn't he a little ray of sunshine,\" Maddy groaned. Everyone got out of the car and were rushed to a nearby boat. Once on we were shown to our room. Girls in one, boys in the other. Jace and Kade next door to us. Great. \"Girls. I'm General Lee. No not the one from the Civil War,\" he chuckled. \"I need two of you to go to Nova Scotia.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter Five: Hopes Pov Before I knew it, Emily and I had raised our hands, unvoluntarilly. \"Good. Girls come join me in twenty minutes and I will explain what we have to do,\" the General said. He bowed to us and walked away. \"What did we just do?\" Emily turned to me. \"I-I have no idea,\" I stammered. Kade and Jace walked into our room, panting. \"We just got chosen to go to the Zombie war with you.\" Kade smiled at Emily as Jace said that. I glanced at Emily; she looked almost disgusted, but Kade didn't seem to take the hint. I almost came to a sneer. They left leaving us in silence. Niall and Harry came in a second later, embracing us in a hug. \"I'm so sorry,\" Harry nudged into the crook of my neck. He was tall, like a giant, compared to my small frame. So tall, he towered over me. \"Just promise all of us that you'll make it out alive and not in critical condition.\" Emily and I turned to each other, sending a message to each other, using only our gaze to comunnicate. \"We'll try,\" we both finally said. They smiled at us. Kade and Jace poked their heads in. \"Time to go,\" Jace grumbled. Kade grabbed Emily's hand and Jace grabbed mine, pulling us towards the main quarters of the ship. The General smiled as we entered. \"Welcome...to our main 'building', if you will, aboard this beautiful ship. In here, we monitor what is happening in our world. At the moment, not much.\" \"Not much?\" I gasped. \"Not much is going on?! There are people dying because of some...some sickness that was created most likely by us human beings!\" I bawled my hands up into fists, barely able to hold back my hatred toward this...hypocritcal bastard. \"You didn't let me finish my sentence. But I can't really now because I've lost my train of thought.\" He glared at me. \"In less then an hour, we will launch you to an island near Nova Scotia. You then be will transported to main country. Your job is to get any information for the military base already there. And yes there are zombies already.\" He paused, sucking in a breath of air before continuing. \"Another plane is already on their way there. You'll meet them on the boat waiting for you to get there to depart. Go back get as many things as possible, but it's far more likely you won't need anything. Weapons will be supplied and please...be careful.\" He put his hand on my shoulder, closer to my chest than my comfort zone would allow him. \"Go back to your headquarters and inform your fellow family/friends. Someone will come and get you when the plane is ready.\" With one last glance back at me and Emily, he left. With only an hour to go, we raced back to our rooms to tell everyone. When we got back, the boys were sitting with the girls. Zayn with Maddy, Liam with Katie, Josh with Melina and Noelle and Louis. \"What'd they say?\" Katie asked, clear tear streaks. \"We're-we're leaving in an hour. We're going to Nova Scotia. Another plane with older men is flying to the island as we speak. We're supposed to meet them there,\" Emily said, tearing up. She walked over to her little sister and brought her into a big hug. \"I'll-I'll be back soon.\" She started crying, tears making a steady stream down her face. She turned to Maddy. \"Please. Keep her safe. I want to know that she'll be okay.\" Maddy nodded, slowly, taking Katie's hand. \"Katie do as Maddy says. If she says be careful be careful. Understood?\" Emily asked. \"Understood,\" Katie smiled at her sisters over protection. Harry spoke up first out of all of the guys. \"We wanted to say...uh thank you.\" \"For everything,\" Liam added. \"Without you we would all be zombies.\" \"Poor Paul...\" Louis sobbed. All of the guys looked solemn for a moment. \"For our gratitude,\" Zayn said. \"We're singing you a song,\" Niall and Josh finished. Louis started, Zayn joined in, harmonizing with Louis. Niall and Liam began singing. Josh started tapping his thighs, hoping to create a beat. Harry began singing. His rough voice sang I Won't Give Up by Jason Mraz. Tears came into my eyes as they worked their way through the song, voices not breaking once. \"That was absolutely lovely,\" Emily said pulling Niall into an Emily hug. He awkwardly hugged her back, kissing the top of her head. \"You'll be fine.\" He cooed. She must've been crying because when she pulled away he had a clear wet mark on his shoulder. A soldier knocked on the door behind us, scaring me. \"The plane is ready.\" Kade and Jace were behind the young soldier, eyeing us carefully. I turned to grab Emily when someone attacked me with a kiss. Harry. His warm lips were pushed against mine. I looked past him and saw that Emily and Niall were gently kissing too. Harry pulled away almost as quickly as he had started. \"I'll see you in a few days. Okay?\" he asked, makng the puppy dog face. \"You promise?\" I nodded, not trusting my voice. The soldier pulled on my arm, yanking me out of the door. Emily struggled for the last bit of their kiss as the soldier grabbed her arm and yanked her away from Nialls touch. Four more soldiers were waiting for us outside of the hallways. One gripped my arm, the others gripped Jace's, Kades and Emily's. When they let go of us to let us on the plane, there were small purple/red marks where they were holding us. \"We will be reaching Nova Scotia in about three hours,\" someone said over the planes intercom. I sighed and said to everyone who was around me. \"Hi. I'm Hope. Welcome to hell!\"[Chapter 6] Chapter Six: Emilys Pov I awoke when someone came over and jostled me awake. I hadn't even realized that I'd fallen asleep. It was Jace. He was yelling something at me, but I couldn't quite make out what he was saying. I tried reading his lips; \"Get up it's time!\" that's what he was saying. Hope grabbed my hand and pulled me, while snapping something at Jace. As I became aware of my surroundings I was sort of able to make what she had snapped. Something like; \"I got it ya dick weed.\" I was pulled to the small boat that would take us to the main island of our destination. I took Hope's hand and pulled my hair over my eyes, trying to hide the fact that I was crying. We met up with our other group that consisted of three men and several army men. We didn't say anything as we got on the boat. I sat in silence with Hope in the farthest corner we could find. We hadn't said anything until one of the older men from the other plane came over and asked a simple question; \"What brings you young ones here?\" Hope turned him and eyed him skeptically, testing him to see if he was actually wondering. She turned to me and nodded. \"We're trained assasins,\" I said calmly. He looked stunned for a moment. \"You're really young to be an assasin.\" \"Our parents are trained ones. They made us to be like this. Trained killers,\" Hope said, pausing. \"Now if you don't mind me asking...what's your name exactly?\" \"Kennedy...yours?\" he answered calmly, not flinching at Hope's own attitude. \"Hope. That's Emily,\" she answered smiling. He chuckled. \"Your names don't really fit with your...style.\" I smiled. \"We get that a lot.\" He chuckled again. \"And you're not offended by it?\" \"Nope. Like she said 'we get that a lot'. Which means by now we've gotten used to it,\" Hope laughed at him. He grinned. \"What are your specialties?\" \"I'm long distance. Hope's short. That's why we work so well together,\" I informed, smiling up at him. \"Well that'll definitely come in handy out on the field,\" he said. I giggled and Hope acutally cracked a grin. We hit land only a few moments later. Jace and Kade came over and told us our plan that the military had told them to do. We got off the boat, stepping into the rain that was now coming down like golf balls hitting a car windshield. So in other words. Hard. We were thrown guns and handed gear. \"On my mark,\" one of the soldiers said. \"Go!\" We raced out, stealthy and quiet. Suddenly, one of the guys from the other plane, started panicking as soon as we stepped out. He tried running back up but he slipped and shot himself in the face. I gasped and Hope tightened her grip on my hand. The sound of snarling sounded around us. Suddenly, a zombie shot himself out of the dark and gloom. As quietly as I could I squealed. The military started firing causing more zombies to come out of no where. I turned to Hope. They're attracked to noise. I wanted to tell her before she started firing. \"No! Hope don't!\" I shouted as quietly as I could, but loud enough so she could hear me. \"They like the noise!\" She stopped firing. Someone grabbed our arms and pulled us into safety. \"Hey guys!\" someone said. \"Welcome to the new world!\"[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven: Hopes Pov \"We can't exactly pin point where the actual infection started. But, with today's technology, we figured it had to be around the...Amazon Rainforest,\" some blonde girl said to us. We all looked at her, wild look in our eyes, studying her. She must've understood our questionable stares because she said, \"Gosh where are my manners. I'm Raini. You are?\" We all hesitated, but finally the man, Kennedy, spoke up. \"I'm Kennedy.\" He shot a sideways glance at me and Emily. \"I'm-I'm Emily,\" she said quietly. \"Hope,\" I stated proudly. Soon, everyone in our little group had shared their names. Although I couldn't remember the names after they were said. There was an awkward pause as we waited for someone to start speaking. Emily turned her attention away from the group and slowly walked over to a locked door that baracaded by heavy objects. \"What's in here?\" Emily asked, breaking the silence and causing some people to jump. \"Oh uh...\" Raini looked like she was having trouble looking for her words. \"In there is our uh...first one we caught.\" \"'First one'? You mean there's more?\" I asked. \"Yes. Didn't you see the one's outside genius?\" Jace snapped at me. I turned on my heals and glared at him, anger boiling up inside of me; \"What I meant when I asked it was 'Is there more inside this building'?\" \"Oh yes,\" another male chimed in. \"Plenty more. There is at least...over...twenty of them, waiting for us in that hall.\" Emily turned to him. \"And who might you be?\" \"I'm Riley,\" he said aiming a million dollar smile in her direction. She glared at him. She held his gaze for a long moment before, still staring at him, she said; \"Can we open it up?\" Raini jumped at the question. \"Wha-why would you wanna do that?\" \"To examine them of course,\" Kennedy said walking over to Emily. \"They'll attack,\" Riley said. And if on cue, when he said that, a zombie smashed itself against the door, moving the chairs and making Emily and Kennedy fall. \"See?\" Riley said. \"Why can't we get them out?\" Kade asked. \"They're to aggresive. They'll attack and we'll loose more than enough people to them. Our final answer is 'no',\" Raini said, straightening her back as she spoke. Emily looked like she was about to blow up, but then suddenly, the zombies broke out. Time seemed to slow down as people were getting bit and hurt. Soldiers shot at the zombies. Emily had fallen to the ground getting crushed under three different men. She looked up at me, tears filling her eyes as the immense weight of the men pushed her against the floor. Kade and I raced to her side, grabbing both of her wrists and yanking her out as fast as we could. With all the zombies coming fast at us, we watched helplessly, as the undead bit at our team mates. Raini and Riley and three other people were struggling against their zombie captors. Jace grabbed Emily's arm and yanked her to a plane. I turned around, scanning for anyone who survived. Kennedy came running out of the building zombies chasing after him. I took aim and fired. I fired at the zombies that were desperately trying to get to us. I remembered what Emily had said. As I shot I noticed more and more zombies poured out of the darkness and ran after us. Great. I noticed something. Every time I shot the zombie in the leg or any other part that wasn't the head, it seemed to just fall and in within a minute, heal itself. I needed to aim for the head. That would be my best bet. I aimed and again. Fired. This time I got him square between the eyes. He stopped moving and then...fell. He was...dead. Or at least completely dead... Kennedy grabbed my arm and pulled me into the ready-to-depature plane. We tried to shut the end of the plane before any zombies could get in. Too late. Zombies started piling up as we started to pull out of the airport. I shot at their heads. \"No!\" Emily screamed. \"They like the noise!\" Kade and Jace turned to her. \"What do you mean?\" Kade asked her. \"When we first got off the plane,\" she started. Before she could continue, she was interuppted by a zombie that was slowly walking over to her. She grabbed her gun and fired. She shot him right above the ear. \"Hey look. Miss Goodie Too Shoes just killed someone,\" Jace sneered. She flipped him off and began again. \"When we first got off the plane, the guy fell right? He shot himself in the face. It caused a lot of noise. Soon zombies started appearing out of the gloom and attacking us.\" \"But what about in the building? We weren't making any noise,\" Kade said. \"But they knew we were in there. And when they put into their holding cell, it had caused a lot of ruckus. They already were wriled up by the time we got there,\" she said. We lifted off the ground. My stomach sank into the deep part of my gut as we reached higher and higher into the sky. \"Where are we going now?\" I asked after a moment. Kennedy got up and went to the cockpit to ask the pilot something. A moment later he came back and grabbed our arms. \"Get the parachute-pack on!\" he demanded at our looks. \"Why?\" I demanded. Kennedy opened up the rear door and jumped. I grumbled. Why do we have to jump? I pulled the parachute on my back and strapped myself in. I hesitated. \"I don't think I can do this!\" I called to Emily over the howling wind. Jace stalked over to me, grumbling something about me being a pussy, took my hand and jumped. As I plummeted to the fast approaching water, I started panicking. \"J-Jace! I-I can't swim!\" I nearly screeched. He pulled open my parachute and then he pulled open his. He turned to me. \"You can't swim?\" I had to calm myself down before I decided to speak again. \"Y-Yeah I can't swim. I never learned how. I mean I can stay afloat but I can't completely swim.\" He sneered at me. \"Wow. Just...wow.\" I flipped him off. Kade and Emily flew down. Emily was wrapped around Kade, holding on desperately for her life. \"What happened with your parachute?\" I called out to her. \"The zombie jumped on top of it and started tearing holes in it,\" Emily answered. \"Kade caught me so...\" Noticing them together, made me wonder if they ever had a chance. I would never tell Emily that. She'd kill me. Something flew past them, making them rock, Emily nearly loosing her balance. I glanced in the direction that it had come from. Birds. A whole swarm of birds, headed our way. \"Look out!\" I called. The flock of birds dove our way, hitting and pecking at us. Emily huddled close to Kade, pulling on his shirt to keep her from falling. He wrapped his arm around her waist and brought her as close as he dared to his body. I smiled. The last bird flew past and smacked Emily square on the back. She groaned in pain as she nearly went tumbling out of Kade's grasp. \"Emily. Hold in there. We're almost there,\" I called to her. She nodded her head, clearly trying to hold back small tears. \"Brace yourselves!\" Jace yelled. I glanced down, noticing how close the water was. \"We need to get the backpack off so it doesn't pull us under!\" Kade called. He was whispering something to the now shy-and-quiet girl that he was holding onto. She nodded at whatever he was saying to her. He held up his hand making a \"three\" with his fingers. He was counting down for her to jump and into the cold water below. Kennedy was already down there, watching us intently. \"Come on!\" he was saying. \"Come on you can do it!\" Emily landed next to him, barely making a splash. Kade went after her. Then Jace. I counted to three, then I unstrapped myself from the backpack and dove into the freezing water below.[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight: Katies Pov Waiting to hear from my sister and knowing she's okay is one of the worst feelings. Hope, Jace, Kade and Emily left a little less than twenty-four hours. The worst part was that I couldn't have gone along with them. Emily would've never let me anyway. She loves me to much, even if she didn't show at times. I slowly sat up and examined my surroundings. Liam was lying next to me, quietly sleeping, his back turned to me. I rested my head back on the pillow and tried to close my eyes. Liam turned to face me. His sleep face was still on. His big brown eyes, stared into mine as he pulled me in close. I wrapped my arms around his chest, sobbing into his shoulder. \"It'll be fine. You'll see her next week for sure. I promise,\" he ran his hand through my hair, combing through the knots. He lifted my chin, making my eyes reach his. \"She'll be fine. Have faith in your sister.\" He gently kissed my cheek, sending excited chills down my spine. I nodded though. He lowered his pink lips to mine as pulled my body as close as he could. He gently kissed me, making the pain for the possible loss of my sister, bearable. It wasn't the hot, hungry, I-want-you kind of kiss. It was more like it'll-be-okay kind of kiss. Sweet but still hot. He pulled away after a moment, panting for air. \"I'll always be here, right next to you, every step of the way,\" Liam smiled, kissing my cheek again. \"I love you.\" He yawned, closed his eyes and then he was asleep. \"I love you, too, Liam.\" I kissed his ear, rolled over and fell asleep. Emilys Pov It was dark out. I couldn't see five feet in front of me and I couldn't see my feet in the water. I felt like I was isolated. That's why I was panicking. I was struggling to keep my head above the water. Knowing I only had a little way to go, I used all my energy to get to shore. Finally, I felt sand beneath my feet. I gasped as something swam past my toes. A small tadpole. Now a small group of them. Baby frogs. Tadpoles. Swimming freely between my toes. Not a care in the world. Nothing to bother them. No responsibilities until they get older. I was jealous of them. I crawled up onto the slightly wet grass, laying on my back, desperately trying to catch my breath. I pulled out my cell phone. I purposefully put it a plastic bag to keep it from getting wet, from situation like this. \"Fuck. No bars!\" I nearly yelled out in exasperation. Standing up, I raised it above my head, still getting nothing. I started walking away from our small group of only five, trying to get a signal of some sort. Half way to the tall mountain, I finally recieved one bar. I pulled it down to my eyes and started dialing Katie's number. She picked up instantly. \"Emily?\" she asked. She sounded as if she just woke up but was still crying. That was probably what was up at the moment. \"Yes. Katie, tell eveyone we're okay. We're little ways away from Missouri. Are mom and dad with you yet? And everyone elses families with you yet?\" I asked, trying to rush it out. She sighed, once she realized it was me. \"Mom and Dad, Hope's family and Melina's family all made it on our boat. We were informed that Paul made it out and Maddy and Noelle's family are on the other boat. We don't know about the boys' families yet. All except for Josh and Zayn. Their families are on a different boat as well. Louis' had very little contact with his family. Apperantly his mom has been...turned. Lottie and them are hiding in their flat for the time being. Someone's going to get them. Liam, Harry and Niall's families are...MIA.\" Even a thousand miles away I could tell she was trying not to cry. \"I'll try to call you as often as I can Katie. You don't call me. Kay? I could be like in the middle of a zombie infested area trying to fit in then all of the sudden ring. I'm dead. So don't call me. Let me call you,\" I demanded. \"Okay.\" She paused. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too. Now tell everyone we love them. Bye baby,\" I said, trying not to cry. \"Bye,\" she said before she hung up. I stuck my phone back in the now slightly wet bag and crammed it back into my pocket. I walked back to my group, quietly, making my way back through the dark. \"Emily!\" someone called my name. \"Emily! Where are you?\" \"Shh. Are you stupid?! She said they're attracted to noise. Be quiet!\" Hope's clear voice whispered harshly. \"What am I supposed to believe someone who's never killed anyone before?\" Jace's voice came in next, clear sneer in his voice. \"What is it with you and killing?\" Hope snapped again. \"It doesn't matter if she's killed anything or anyone before, it matters if you shut up and listen.\" I giggled quietly. I scanned the trees looking for one to climb up. I found a giant oak, the nearest branch; right above my head. I grabbed it and swung up. I got to another branch, slightly higher than the first. Finally, the four wonderes came into view. Kade and Kennedy were trying not to laugh at the bickering going on between Hope and Jace. They looked so cute together. Oh boy, don't tell her. She'll send me to the zombies. I lept to another branch now diretly over them. I crawled to another branch below, right above Kade. I fell to my stomach and dangled my hands over the edge, trying with all my might to reach down and tap on Kade's head. Without falling of course. I wrapped my legs over the top and let them dangle on the other side as I swung myself down. I was right above Kade now. The tip of my hair, skimming the top if his head. I reached my hand down and tapped him. He jumped and looked up. He grinned wildly at me; \"I found our little monkey.\" Hope and Jace turned to the direction of Kade, glancing up slowly as they saw me swinging in the air. \"I just called Katie.\" Hope's eyes lit up. \"What'd she say?\" So I explained to her who survived. At the mention of her family, she nearly started to break down into tears. As I finished, Kennedy turned to me. \"So you rescued a band before you thought your family?\" I opened my mouth in shock, disgusted by his horrible aqusation. \"No. The first thing I thought of was my sister. She was with us. Then I had trouble contacting my family so...\" Kennedy didn't flinch at all. After a moment of awkward silence he said to me; \"So how do we get up in one of these trees so we can sleep?\" I gripped Kade's strong hand and pulled him up. \"Like that.\" I took Kennedy's hand and pulled him onto the branch once Kade was on a different limb. Jace was next, grumbling something about how he wasn't wimp or some whiny shit like that. Hope got up on the same branch as me and hugged me tightly. \"Thank you. For everything. I needed the extra confidence today,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks. She sniffled and started climbing higher and higher into the trees. Kade called me over once everyone was asleep. He patted the spot next to him which was wide enough for me to fit in. I awkwardly crawled over to him and sat down in the spot he told me to sit in. Before he could say anything I said; \"What do you want?\" He chuckled. \"Nothing, I just thought you could keep watch with me.\" He wrapped his arm around my shoulder. I didn't nudge it off though. Honestly, I was freezing and Kade was dry enough that he was actually warm. \"So why are two teenage girls out here in the middle of no where; two teenage girls that barely know to fight without guns?\" he asked. I rested my head on his shoulder. \"Why do you ask that question? You know the answer to it. I mean you do what are parents are...don't you?\" I stared up into his eyes, looking for the answer. Looking for hope that maybe...we will get out of this okay. But all I saw were two beautiful green eyes, staring back at me. \"Yes I do. I just felt like I needed to ask you, in case there was something different.\" I smiled. \"No. You just wanted to talk to me. For no apperant reason. Don't lie to me,\" I smiled. I got up and swung to a branch above him. I did as I did before. I wrapped my legs around the branch and made myself swing down. I was upside down and he was sitting there staring at me, green eyes, big with excitment. He stood up and looked into my eyes. He smiled as I swung myself down to the branch he was on. Compared to me, he was kind of tall. Just by a small amount, but in a fight he'd have an advantage. I pulled up my shirt, knowing the other advantage he had. He laughed quietly. I swung to a branch diagonally above him. \"Come get me!\" I whispered, winking at him. I swung to another. I turned back and watched him hesitate, but only for a moment before he jumped to the branch was just on. He was on the same branch as me now. I stood up and spread my arms open and then...I fell. But not for long. I twisted my small body around and gripped a limb before I could hit the ground. I shot up onto another tree and nearly lost my balance before falling into the arms of Kade. How he got over here so quickly? Beats me. \"That's was awesome,\" he smiled, pinning his smile at me. \"We learned how to do something like that without falling. Especially falling into a cute boys' arms,\" I blushed. So we stood there for a moment, me in his arms and him trying not to let us both fall. He slowly brought his lips down to mine, surprising me. The kiss was sweet and compassionate, showing how both of us were scared but more afraid to show it to the others. He broke after a minute or two and said ; \"We should probably get soom sleep.\" He took my hand and brought me back to the branch that was big enough for the both of us. I rested my head on his shoulder and sighed. \"Night,\" Kade said. He kissed me again. A kiss that seemed to promise a tomorrow. To promise our family. And to promise love. \"Night,\" I yawned. I closed my eyes and fell asleep.[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine: Kades Pov The night came through uneventful. No attacks of zombies and no one trying to kill us. Surprisngly. Emily was currled up in my arms, resting her head on my lap. I brushed her loose strand of hair out of her face. She rustled in her sleep, turning over in my lap but still not waking up. Jace climbed over to us. \"What the hell is this?\" he snapped. I made the \"shh\" sign with my fingers. \"She's still sleeping.\" Hope followed Jace, landing as far away as she could from him. \"Well...well. Look what we have here,\" she laughed. Emily rustled again, moving more frantically, as if she was trying to get away from something. Abruptly, she sat up. Hope looked at her, confused. \"What was it?\" \"Get Kennedy,\" Emily whispered. \"Now.\" I jumped slightly, never hearing this tone of voice in Emily at all. Hope did as told, obviously knowing something that I or Jace didn't know. \"What is it?\" Jace asked. I turned to him, making sure I had heard him correctly. Not one hint of sarcasm or a sneer was in his voice. Hope came back with Kennedy, balancing all three of them on the same branch. \"No...\" Emily said. \"All of you get off the-\" It was too late. Their branch began breaking and eventually it broke, sending all three of them scrambling on the ground, desperately trying to catch the breath that had left their body. \"Oh, my god!\" Emily squealed. \"Get back up. Hurry before they-\" Again she was cut off. Hissing and snarling sounds reverberated over the small valley. Hope's eyes grew wide as she realized what Emily was trying to tell her. Very quickly, Hope ran to a tree and started scaling it, almost like a ninja. Oh wait... Jace and Kennedy didn't have as good luck as Hope. Emily scrambled up and ran down to the closest branch she could find that almost reached the ground. \"Hurry!\" she called to them. Jace was first to reach higher than the zombies. They were coming at her and Kennedy so quickly, they barely had time to react. Emily went tumbling out of the tree when the zombies barrled towards her and Kennedy. \"Emily...\" I gasped out. I jumped down to the lower branch and raced over to help the two victims. But, Emily was already up on her feet, racing to another tree. I watched as Kennedy smacked away the zombies that were coming at him. Once he knocked away enough, he got up and ran towards a low treebranch and struggled to get up. I turned my attention back to Emily. She was low on a branch aiming towards the zombies heads. One fire. Dead. Two fired. Dead. Three fired. Dead, dead and dead. I grinned at her as she aimed so skillfully at our attackers. I jumped onto one of many zombies and sliced his head off. Whoa. I was never able to do that before. I jumped off of that zombie and stabbed another on my way. Whoa. That wasn't possible before today either! What is happening? In less than an hour we killed most of the zombies. Ninety-five percent. The other five percent were lying their sprawled out slowly healing themselves. \"We need to get out of here!\" Jace said. \"No shit!\" everyone nearly screamed, causing Jace to cower. \"Oh no...\" Emily whispered. The ground beneath us rumbling, yet we didn't know what from. \"Get to the trees!\" Hope called, dragging Jace's stubburn body. Kennedy got up to the tree first. He gripped Emily's forearm and pulled her up. Me on her tail. Hope and Jace were across the path on the other set of trees. \"Meet at the top of the mountain!\" Hope mouthed to us. Although I didn't get that at first. What I thought she said was; \"Me and him tonight the mountain.\" Emily understood though as she nodded. Jace and Hope began leaping and leaping from the different trees, never stumbling once. \"I'm going first,\" Kennedy said. Without debate he jumped higher to the next tree. Leaving me in the dust, Emily sprang after him, quickly catching up. I jumped once she was ahead of Kennedy. He slowed down for me to catch up to him. \"I should of just let her go first...\" he panted. I chuckled. \"That's my girl.\"[Chapter 10] Chapter Ten: Hopes Pov \"Why are you such a dick?\" I asked Jace once everyone was eating our dust. \"What do you mean?\" he asked as he jumped to a higher limb. \"Oh you know what I mean,\" I snapped. \"Always making snarky combacks and picking on Emily. Why is that? Is because she's the weaker link? She's most ignorant?\" I challegend him. He paused, gritting his teeth together to keep from biting back at me. \"I pick on Emily because...\" he paused, looking for his words. \"Look I don't try to pick on her. It's just my attitude. That's all. I don't try to be mean, it just happens. And no it's cos she's ignorant, which she is, it's not cos she's the weaker link, she's definitly not weak, that's for sure. None of those reasons. I promise.\" I glared at him and scoffed. \"What? Do you not believe me?\" he snapped, glaring back at me. \"And you're just getting this?\" I asked, laughing sarcastically. \"Look,\" he stopped in front of me and grabbed me by my shoulders. I tried squirming to get out of his grasp but he held me firmly to my spot. \"I act like this because I've lost to much. Yes cliche I know. Whatever. My parents were murdered when I was three, Kade was two.\" He paused. \"And if you're wondering why Kade and I don't look like brothers, we're not. He was adopted. Anyway, our parents were murdered while we were still young. We were forced to live with our uncle who ran into drugs when I was twelve. Ever since then I've had to grow up really quickly. And believe me it wasn't fun. So I'm sorry if I sound like a dick. I just can't let Kade see me cry or he'll start getting all...question-y.\" I paused, releasing my gaze from glaring to utter compassion. \"I-I-I'm sorry Jace, I didn't mean-\" \"Of course you didn't mean it, no one ever does. It's always 'I didn't mean to' or 'I didn't know'! It's always the same!\" He turned and started climbing again, but I caught onto his ankle. \"Then this time it'll be different. I'm sorry I put a label on you before I got to know you. That was very...silly of me. I didn't want hurt you or cause you any emotional pain-\" \"Nothing causes me pain anymore...\" he trailed. \"I don't show to much emotion except hate and sarcasm.\" I approached him slowly, taking his hand as I came closer. I wrapped him in my arms and hugged him. He hesitated, not sure what to do, but finally he gave in a hugged me back. \"I'm sorry,\" I mumbled into his chest. \"It's fine,\" he smiled. \"We should probably get going before our friends see us.\" I chuckled. \"Okay.\" \"Race?\" he smiled down at me. For the frst time he actually cracked a grin. I smiled. \"Okay.\" I readied myself to race. \"Ready...set...go!\" I sprinted off and darted through the tangled mess of branches. Jace close behind, right at my heels. Crackling noises sounded below us as more zombies raced passed us. Gun fire echoed through the valley. My first thought was they're dead. But when I saw Emily sprint up across from us. \"What is it?\" I mouthed. \"Hunters. Survivors!\" she replied mouthing the words. Jace tapped me on the shoulder. \"What did she say?\" I sighed. \"She said 'Hunter. Survivors!' so...\" \"Oh.\" Was all he said. Kennedy and Kade appeared behind her, Kade gripping her hand to help steady himself. She didn't seem to notice or care. \"Where to now?\" she mouthed. I turned to Jace. \"Where to now?\" He paused, mapping Missouri in his head. \"There should be a small opening with a camp ground. Maybe some more food.\" He gripped his stomach. \"That good?\" \"Perfect.\" I turned back to Emily mouthing what Jace had said to me, only slightly less detailed. She nodded when she finally understood what I meant. Gunfire rang through the valley again. This time it was closer. Judging by the amount of time the echo took to get here, we only had about a minute before they spotted us and started firing. \"Go!\" I shouted. Emily and I sprinted first, escaping the cursed area with the Missouri hunters drawing near. Jace and Kade next. Then it was Kennedy. More zombies raced past as they heard the new delicious noise. Ew. Snarling, hissing and totally deadly zombies zoomed past us, barely noticing us at all. I looked to Emily. She'd seen them too and had stopped to make sure they didn't hear her or Kade or Kennedy. Jace didn't obey and he kept going, still very cautiously though. Emily blew our seceret call that only we understood. No one else was aloud to know. It was a five note melody, simple but effective. I turned to hear once Kade and Kennedy had passed her. She pointed that she was going higher into the trees and looking for help. Before she could even start climbing something shot at her, grazing her arm. She groaned in pain as the cut started a steady stream. She ripped some frabic from around her waist and quickly tied to her arm. She glanced over in the direction of where bullet had come from. Her eyes grew wide. I glanced that way and watched as twenty or so hunters strolled our way. They shot again but this time at me, barely missing my leg. Emily pointed up, indicating that she was gonna climb. I thought to myself that, that might be the best bet for me too. We'd catch up with the boys in a few minutes. I reached and used all the strength I could and pulled myself up. Climbing higher and higher into the big oaks, making sure to keep sight of the hunters, Emily and the boys. Emily blew our whistle again, pointing to the east. A small mall sat in the middle of everything. Convieniet. To much to be exact. Kade suddenly shot through the trees, appearing on the same branch as Emily. \"What's up?\" he mouthed. I pointed down, as the last of the hunters walked past us, three lingering behind to make sure everything was safe. Emily gasped and started climbing down through the trees. Kade grabbed her arm. They obviously started arguing because they were flailing their arms and Emily had a look of anger on her face. After a moment, Emily'd won. Woo. She climbed down, standing as low as she dared, still blocked by some branches. \"Excuse me sir?\" she asked. One of the tall boys turned around and glanced at her, smiling. \"What do we have here? A small damsel in distress maybe? Do you need help down?\" The boy walked over to her, reaching his hand up. She grabbed at her belt and pulled out her small gun, aiming it towards his head, right between the eyeballs. Jace appeared next to me, grinning. \"She might actually kill someone.\" I began glaring again. \"Wh-Whoa whoa there. Now hang on,\" the boy said. \"What's your name?\" Emily looked like she was going to punch the guy, which I hoped she did eventually. \"Annabel.\" She finally answered. They boy looked puzzled. \"Judging by the way you hesitated to answer, I'm guessing your real name is not 'Annabel'.\" The boy sneered at her. \"So tell me your real name, Little Miss Cutie.\" \"I'm not cute, first of all,\" Emily challegened the guy. \"Second, it's Emily.\" She rejected the guys hand by spitting in it. \"Yours?\" The guy whiped his hand on his pants. \"Luke.\" \"And you're other two?\" Emily snapped. \"Tyler and Zach,\" Luke pointed to the two guys behind him with their guns drawn, both aimed at Emily. \"This is awesome,\" Jace whispered into my ear, lips brushing over the skin. ' I watched helplessly as she made the stupid choice to jump down from her branch, nearly a few feet away from her competitors. \"What brings you out here?\" Zach asked. He was a scrawny looking boy that a bigger attitude. Black hair covered his brown eyes, sunburned skin was hidden tightly under his armor and a set of knives were tied around his waist. \"I'm a trained assasin. Specialty; long distance.\" She started circling around them. \"You're an assasin?!\" Tyler scoffed. \"Prove it.\" Emily was now reaching the area where Zach stood. I was hoping she'd see the knives and prove it to them that she was indeed an assasin. She seemed to have read my mind because before the three boys knew what happening, Emily had grabbed three knives out of Zach's belt and chucked them at a zombie, bird and a squirrel. Zach and Tyler looked astonished, Luke looked utterly unfazed by it. Emily stalked back over to face Luke. \"Belive me now?\" she snapped. He paused. \"I believe you're actually some weakling who didn't know she could do that.\" He was walking forward making Emily back up and press her back up against a tree. Why was she making herself seem vulnerable? Jace and I might've been wrong, she might be our weakest link. Luke had her cornered now. I looked straight into her eyes and saw what she had planned for the three boys. \"What is she doing?\" Kennedy asked as he joined me and Jace. \"Yeah, what is she doing?\" Kade and Jace asked at the same time. I grinned wildly. \"Just watch.\" Luke put his hand at the edge of her shirt, playing with the fabric in his hands. \"And you know what stupid weakling girls get when they're out on their own?\" Luke sneered. \"Do they get candy?\" Emily asked, giggling like a stupid blonde. Man she was good at acting stupid and scared. \"It's a type of candy. It's long-\" \"Ooh, is it a uh...king sized chocolate bar?\" \"Not as wide. Close in size.\" \"Hmmm,\" she honestly looked like a stupid blonde, acting like she was actually interested in this. \"Lollipop?\" \"Not as...round...\" He reached for his zipper. Letting his pants fall to the ground, he inched his way towards her. \"Are we going to play dress up?\" This time she almost sounded like a two year old. Her gaze landed on me as she pretended to be interested. She winked. I was growing nervous. \"What's taking her so long?\" Kade asked, jealousy creeping into his voice. I began shaking as Luke reached for the bottom of her shirt again and pulled it over her head. He put his arm over her shoulder as she giggled absent mindedly. Tyler and Zach looked just about ready to get in on some of the action. I started fidgeting on the branch causing it to start shaking. Luckily they didn't notice. Luke brought his lips close to Emily's about to press them together until...Luke was flipped over and his back smacked against the tree. She grabbed Zach's wrist and flipped him over sending him flying to another tree. Tyler was her last victim, she twisted his arm over her shoulder and flipped him onto his back. She took a knife from Zach's belt and stabbed it into Tyler and Zach's foot. Both of them screamed in pain as the blade passed through the bone. She slowly walked over to Luke. She put each foot on one side of Luke's foot. He went to get up until she stabbed the knife into his left boot. He grunted with new found pain. She leaned down and said; \"Am I stupid and weak now?\" I watched as his eyes scanned her body as she leaned over him, waiting for the answer. When she didn't get one, she dug the knife farther into his boot. Finally Luke panted out; \"No. You're not stupid.\" \"Good.\" She grabbed her shirt and before she put it on, she walked into the middle of the three. \"Oops...did I do that?\" She then pulled her shirt on over her head and walked back over to Luke, grabbed his gun and left. He stuck something in her boot but I couldn't tell what it was and it was so quick I couldn't be sure that he actually moved. Emily walked over to the other two and took their guns. \"Thanks for the presents!\" she giggled and started skipping off, jerking her head at me, signaling me to follow her. We met her at a small cabin that looked like the cafeteria to a camp. Which I'm pretty sure it was. Kade whistled at her as she beant over to get the blood off of her shoes. \"Shut up,\" she snapped. \"I can do same thing to you, too.\" \"Oh please, but do it completely naked next time!\" Kade winked at her. When did this happen?! She slapped playfully across the face as he made fake in-pain noises. I pulled her aside once the guys were away, taking a break, eating lunch and practicing new moves with Kennedy. \"So when did you and Kade 'happen'?\" I asked her while nibbling on a dry carrot stick. \"What do you mean?\" she asked as she plopped a potato chip in her mouth. \"Like start 'firting' with each other,\" I said. She made an 'o' shape with her mouth. \"Last night. I couldn't fall asleep so I was up with Kade for a little while. He snuck two quick kisses and that was it.\" \"Oh is that why you were all over his lap?\" I said, trying to hide a grin at her reaction. \"Wait...what?\" she sounded surprised by remark. \"You heard me...\" I giggled. \"But that was n-not why I was in his lap, I must've fallen into his lap while I slept.\" We paused for a few minutes, watching the guys train with Kennedy. \"Did Jace tell you who murdered his parents?\" Emily asked slowly and shyly. I jumped. How did she know that Jace's parents go murdered? As if she was reading my thoughts she said; \"I had a dream he was going to tell you. And it ended it before he told you. Then it started with the zombies chasing after us.\" \"Oh no, he didn't tell me. Did your dream tell you that Kade was adopted?\" \"Yeah. Kade woke me up saying I had a worried/questionable look on my face.\" She sighed and took my hand. \"I also had a dream of Gemma, Louis' siblings and Greg and his wife making it to our boat. Liam's family just after them. Everyone made it. That's great, isn't it?\" She looked into my eyes waiting for an answer. \"That's amazing. Wait no...more than amazing. It's...OneDerful!\" She smiled up at me. \"And one more thing. Tell Jace to wear a condom.\" I looked at her shocked. \"Huh?!\" She grinned up at me. She turned her attention back to the boys. \"What do you mean 'tell Jace to wear a condom'?\" I got up and moved in front of her, nearly choking on my carrot stick. She started laughing her Emily laugh that involved not being able to breath and snorting. \"It's not anytime soon. You guys get married. At least I hope you do. No name pun intended either.\" She took a deep breath. \"Do me a favour and look at their aura's for me.\" I looked at her like 'are you crazy?'. She nodded, so I used my concentration and glanced at their aura's. Jace: Red meaning, in his case, energy, strength, anger and fear. Orange meaning, courage. Pink; love. Kade: Red meaning in his case, energy, passion, fear and strength. Blue; loyal. Pink; love and friendship. Kennedy: Red; Strength, ego, passion, energy. Orange; self-control and thoughtfulness. Yellow; optimisc, happy and friendly. Pink; love, sincerity, friendship. \"Jace is mostly red with a hint of pink and orange. Kade is mostly red -mainly passion- with a hint of blue and pink. And Kennedy is mostly red, pink and yellow with a hint of orange.\" \"Wai-wait. Kade has mostly red-passion?\" she asked. I chuckled. \"Most likely towards you. -cough-\" \"Great.\" Kade and Jace came strolling over to us, sweat stains dripping down their shirts. I could tell Emily was having a hard time from drooling over Kade. So much in fact that she had to get up and leave. Kade went and followed her, mumbling something I couldn't understand. \"Wanna come patrol the surroundings?\" Jace asked me. \"Yeah sure,\" I answered. He took my hand and we walked down to edge of the forest. \"What's up with your friend?\" he asked climbing a tree. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"I mean, she squirms in her sleep as if she's...figuring something out.\" I paused. Should I tell him? He looked at me expecting an answer. \"She uh...\" I cleared my throat. \"She can see the future in her dreams.\" \"Explain a dream...\" he said to me. I took a moment to study him to see if he was actually interested in this. \"For one thing the zombies earlier this morning.\" He nodded his head. \"She had a dream that you told me about how your parents were murdered.\" He jerked his head towards me. \"Really?\" he asked. I nodded my head slowly. \"Okay. I believe you.\" I didn't tell him about him and the condom that Emily had said to me. Phew.[Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven: Nialls Pov Harry was sleeping next to me, with his head at the other end of the bed. Before I knew what I was doing, I crawled over to him and tapped his ear. He moved in his sleep and sat up slowly. \"What is it Niall?\" he asked, rubbing his eyes. Man did he look like a little kid. \"Should we call Hope and Em?\" I asked quietly. \"Katie said we shouldn't. That they could being danger at any given moment and we had to wait for them to call us,\" Harry said, taking my hand in his and squeezing it tight. \"I-I know it's just, I miss both of them sooo much. I have to know if they're okay.\" Harry made my head rest on his shoulder as he gently brushed my hair out of my face. \"Please, baby. It'll be okay.\" Baby, when did this happen? I thought. He layed back, with me following. My head was on his chest, rising and falling with every breath he took. Something tingled inside of me as his lips made contact with the top of my head. I looked up and smiled. \"Nialler?\" Harry whispered. \"Yeah, Haz?\" \"Kiss me,\" he whispered, sitting up again. \"What about manag-\" \"Managment is most likely a zombie, Paul never stopped us from expressing ourselves!\" he nearly came to a shouting whisper. \"Yeah I know but-\" \"But...?\" I sighed and quickly brought my lips to his. He jumped slightly and bit my lip in the process. \"Sorry,\" he muttered against my lips. \"It's fine.\" I pressed my lips harder against his, grabbing his hand and entwining my fingers with his. I pulled away after a few minutes. \"Please, don't stop,\" Harry mumbled. So again, I brought my lips to his and kissed him passionately. Our tongues colliding as I pushed mine in his mouth. He sighed as I rubbed my hand over his chest. \"Wait Niall,\" Harry mumbled in between kisses. \"What?\" I asked, sitting up and breaking away. \"We can't do it here, we'll make to much noise,\" he grinned at me. I laughed. \"We will won't we?\" I nipped at his ear and grinned as he shuddered under my touch. \"Will you guys shut up already. I mean we know you're in love but seriously!\" Louis mumbled somewhere from under our bed. I looked at Harry as he shot a sideways glance my way. I started snickering as Harry flipped Louis off. After an akward moment, Harry embraced me with a hug. So in return I gave him a Horan-Hug. I leaned back onto his pillow. \"Some day soon, my lovely Niall. Some day soon.\" I rested my head on his chest and fell asleep. Kades Pov \"What are you doing in here?\" I asked Emily. She had her back turned to me and she was breathing hard. \"I-I'm getting a snack,\" she said, moving away from the fridge as I came closer. \"Seems like you're trying to avoid me.\" I paused before continuing. \"What's wrong with your friend Hope?\" She snapped her head up and she looked at me. Her eyes scanned my body and I could see that she was trying to control her emotions towards me. \"Nothing's wrong with her.\" She said after a few moments. \"Then why was she staring at us as we were working out?\" I asked, clearly getting her attention. \"She obviously knew something that us guys didn't know. Typical girl. \"Oh, you noticed that.\" She turned away from me, mumbling something under her breath. \"Yeah I did. What was that about?\" I inched my forward quietly, hoping she didn't hear me. But she moved away just as I was about to grasp her hand. \"She can uh...\" she clear her throat. \"She can uh...read aura's.\" \"Aura's?\" I asked. \"Yeah. They're like this little mist that goes around people's body that only certain people can see. They shimmer all different colors and mean all different things.\" I paused, now interested. \"What was mine?\" \"Red, blue, pink.\" \"Meaning?\" \"Red means passion, blue means loyal and pink means love and friendship, in your case. It's different for everyone.\" This time she actually turned and faced me. \"What's yours?\" I asked. \"I don't know. She hasn't read mine lately.\" She sighed. \"She's probably already told Jace this, but...I can see the future in my dreams.\" My eyes widened. \"Really? Give me an example.\" \"Well this morning with the zombies. I knew they were coming.\" she paused, \"I also had a dream that Jace told Hope, while in the trees, that your parents got murdered and that you were adopted.\" My face turned beet red. \"You were two and Jace was three.\" She turned away from me again, her shoulders shuttering, as she tried to hold back tears. \"Don't cry,\" I said finally, walking over to her and resting my hand her shoulder. \"It never bothered me so I don't why it should bother me now.\" \"Wait, you're not bothered by your parents getting murdered?\" she snapped at me causing me to jump back. \"No, about me being adopted,\" I said calmly. \"But that's not what I'm crying about. I'm crying about the loss of your parents. Even if I didn't know them. So really, that's the first thing you think I'm crying about?!\" she snapped again, walking forward, challenging me with her eyes. \"Oh, my god, guys are idiots!\" She slammed her drink down at the tabel that I hadn't realized she had grabbed. She went for the door until I grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her into a kiss. She struggled against my hand, trying to free herself from the kiss and my grip. But every time she removed her lips from mine I only jammed mine back against hers. I shoved her up against the wall, as she squirmed to get free from me. \"Why do all the sudden you hate me?\" I asked. \"I-I...It's a girl thing okay?\" she snapped at me. I tapped my tongue against her lips, looking for an entry, only she didn't give me any, so I forced it in her mouth. I moved away from her lips and trailed the kisses down her neck. She whistled a five note melody, something that she and Hope used as a signal. I moved my lips back to her mouth, trying to get her to stop. Suddenly, the door burst open and Hope came running in. She saw the squirming Emily, pushed up against the wall as I held her hostage. \"Jeez I know you want her but I didn't know you wanted her that bad.\" She raised her hand and pulled at my hair, jerking my head away from the girl against the who was desperately trying to catch her breath. She got up and started running, I watched helplessly as she ran to the woods, scaling the trees with ease. \"Do that agian and I will cut you,\" Hope snapped. She let go of my hair and stomped out of the room. After a moment, when I knew she'd left the perimeter of the building, I got up in search of Emily. I watched as Hope walked back over to Jace and grabbed his hand. Whoa. My brother, actually holding a girls hand. She must've made him go straight.[Chapter 12] Chapter Twelve: Emilys Pov I swung branch to branch, tree to tree rushing to get as far as possible from Kade. I was high above the ground, watching zombies stroll by without a care in the world. How they hadn't turned my way when I started sniffling, was a mystery to me. I saw someone below, hopping through the branches, desperately trying to find someone or something. It was a girl, about maybe, eight or nine years old. She was hopping through the trees, shooting arrows at the zombies that passed by. I got down and started my way towards her. \"Hey!\" I whispered. She shot an arrow at me and I swiftly dodged it. \"Oh, sorry,\" she said. \"I didn't mean...\" \"It's fine. I've had training dodging things like that,\" I smiled, sitting myself down on the branch in front of her. \"Training?\" she asked, sitting down with me. \"I'm an assasin. So...a ninja in a way, without all of the black gear and stuff.\" She looked at me, smiling. \"So what's your name?\" I asked. \"I-I'm Dylan,\" she said. \"Where's your family?\" I asked. She gulped. \"Kaitlyn, my sister, was at a friends house, when the zombie attack started. She came home a zombie,\" she took a deep shaky breath, \"and she started attacking us. She bit my mom and I watched in horror as she shifted. Then my dad was gone, leaving me at home with the two zombies in my house.\" \"Wait, so your dad just...left you?\" She nodded her head slowly. \"I've been having to fend for myself. I'm just lucky I take archery classes.\" She paused, her brows furrowing. \"I forgot to ask, what's your name?\" \"Emily.\" She smiled for a brief moment then she frowned again. \"I'm guessing you're going to leave me all by myself like the other group did.\" I frowned at her. \"Now why would I do that?\" \"Cos I'm sick. I have cancer,\" she started sniffling. \"No. I'm not gonna leave you, even if you have cancer. I'll take care of you.\" I paused. \"How old did you say you were again?\" \"Thirteen.\" Whoa. Boy was I off. I thought she was eight or nine, now I have a thirteen year old proving my wrong. Whoa, just whoa. \"And by the looks of how far you actually went up in that tree and how far you're in this forest, I'm judging that you're running away from someone, most likely a boy,\" she smiled. \"Okay. Tell me, what did he do?\" \"How can you tell it's a guy I'm running from?\" I asked. \"I can sense things about people. So this guy...what did he do? Did he cheat on you? Did he kiss you without permission? Did he touch you in-\" \"Okay I get it,\" I laughed. \"He uh...he uh...kind of kissed me without my consent so yeah...\" \"Ahh.\" she smiled. \"So is sensing something about someone like a sixth sense?\" I asked. \"You can say it like that. So yeah, I guess so.\" I hesitated to tell her, debating whether or not she could be trusted. \"I-I-I can see the future in my dreams and my best friend can see aura's.\" \"Wait you have other people here, besides this mystery boy you don't to tell me about.\" \"Yeah, over in the little camp area!\" I pointed across the path and out of the forest to the small camspite sitting there. She paused, taking my hand. Then she smiled at me, showing her white covered in braces. \"So...tell me about this 'boy' of yours.\" Kades Pov I heard her voice, not clearly. She was talking to someone. As she came into view I could see that she was talking with a girl. The girl had blonde hair that came down to her shoulders, entrancingly wild blue eyes, olive skin, freckles that splashed across her face and a bag of arrows hanging over her shoulder. She had be around, eight to the lastest, ten. They were talking about something. As I drew nearer I could tell they were actually talking about someone. \"So...tell me about this 'boy' of yours,\" she small blonde girl said. \"Well uh...\" Emily paused looking for words. She glanced around at the ground, her shoulders shuttered. She looked like she was ready to sneeze. And she did, a loud sneeze. Oh shit. The zombies that were on the ground, glanced up at her and started snarling. \"No. Not now!\" Emily screamed. She grabbed the girls hand and ran through the trees, desperately trying to get away from the zombies chasing after her. The small girl took out her bow and shot down at the zombies. One, two, three down as she expertaly shot them through the head. But this only made the zombies seem angrier. Emily glanced around trying to find an escape route. She glanced up and saw me. She nearly stumbled out of the tree. The small blonde girl looked in the direction Emily was looking in and grinned. She turned to her and asked, \"Is that the boy?\" Emily slowly nodded in response. They jumped down to the ground as I finally working up the courage to chase after them. \"Kennedy! Hope! Jace!\" Emily panted. She repeated their names until finally Kennedy came out of the cafeteria. Emily pointed to the zombies behind her signalling at them to shoot. She ran past the building as the zombies gained on her. I followed knowing that we'd have a better chance at survival if we ran to the trees. She took the small gun out of her belt and shot down zombies. \"Hope and Jace! Where are you?\" \"Over here! Hurry!\" Jace appeared in a van, big enough for all six of us. Hope swung open the door and we climbed on in as we started peeling out of the camp. \"Wait!\" I called. \"What about Kennedy!\" Emily and the blonde girl turned around. \"I-It's too late,\" the frail blonde girl said. I glanced back in the direction that Kennedy was in. She was right, it was too late for him. He was sprawled over the grass as the zombies came in and attacked him. I watched from where I sat, watching as Kennedy finally got bit on the neck and stopped moving until his body gave in to the change. I turned to Hope. A steady stream of tears rolled down her cheeks. Emily had a stone mask plastered on her face, not daring to say anything. After an hour or so, Hope finally noticed the shivering frail girl sitting with Emily. \"Who is she?\" Hope asked, a defensive tone creeping into her voice. Emily jumped. She'd been staring off in space for the last fifteen minutes. \"This is uh, Dylan.\" At her sudden movement a tear strolled down her face. \"She was uh, wondering through the forest because her sister and her mom are zombies and her dad left her without any warning.\" She wiped the quiet tear off of her cheek. \"She's thirteen and she has cancer.\" Hope jumped at the word cancer, obviously a memory tickled the back of her mind. Jace stayed quiet the whole time. \"She's good at archery, though, so she is useful,\" Emily added after a moment. That got the attention of Jace. \"Really? Has she killed anything?\" Hope slapped him and grumbled. \"Actually, I have, and don't think I can't kill you, buddy. Okay?\" Jace smirked but he nodded. \"So what's your names?\" Dylan asked pointing to us. Hope glanced at me and Jace. Emily spoke for them. \"Hope. Jace. Kade.\" She said my name with a hint of venom hidden somewhere in there. Although, I knew deep down inside, I knew she didn't hate me. What's wrong with girls? I sat in the corner, staring out on the road, keeping watch for any zombies that felt like attacking. \"Do you know where we should go?\" Dylan asked me. I looked past her, Emily was asleep resting her head on the cars seat. Jace and Hope were singing in the front seat, quietly but loud enough to know that they were. \"I honestly don't know. Some where over seas would work though.\"[Chapter 13] Chapter Thirteen: Emilys Pov The dream was horrifying. Blood, blood and more blood, sprayed from the different zombies. You'd think that zombies aren't supposed to have blood. Ooh but these zombies failed the logics of zombie nature, if there is such a thing as \"zombie nature\". Anyway, I was walking- no running- through a field of infected people, trying to get away. Where was I? Dream-Me looked around at the surroundings. Some shopping center in a dry, arid state. Kansas? No to populated. Nebraska? To far north. Texas? Maybe. Oklahoma? Most definitly. I read all the signs as I raced past different thrift shops and cafes. I finally neared the entrance of the actual center. Utica Square. In Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was right. Tulsa sounded familiar, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I turned and became face to face with an oncoming zombie. He was tall, olive skin, deep green/hazel eyes, Justin Bieber hair cut, brown hair. I finally rememberd why Tulsa sounded so familiar and why this zombie was harder to kill. I became choked up as he drew nearer, now nearly on my heels. I had to kill him before he hurt me. Him and his little sister, who was snarling right behind him. I had to get my gun and kill him and her. Tears poured from my eyes. Why? Why did it have to end this way for one of my old friends? Why? I had trouble getting the gun out of it's holster. Suddenly, he bit my hand. No! I shot the gun at the two zombies before taking out my machete and slicing my hand off. I screamed out in pain. Wrapping it in the fabric, I gritted my teeth as I dressed the pouring-with-blood wound. Zombies, appeared, working their way towards me. My world became dizzy, black and white with gray in the middle. Suddenly, strong hands came and swooped me up. I took a last glance around Utica Square and then...I passed out. I awoke with a start. \"Jace. Where are we?\" I asked crawling over to him. \"Tulsa. Why?\" \"No. We need to get out of here!\" I became choked up barely able to get the words out before I started crying. \"Why? Tulsa has the closest airport.\" Jace grumbled. \"Just don't go to Utica Square, pleaaseee!\" I groaned, holding my wrist. \"D-Did you have a dream or something?\" Jace asked. I was right, Hope did tell him. Before he could say anything else I started explaining him what the dream as about. \"You know the zombie in your dream?\" he asked before saying anything else. \"I do, but I forgot his name. But his sisters name is Ginny. That's all I remember!\" I rubbed my wrist again. \"So can we please steer clear of the Square?\" He nodded his head. I took a deepy shaky breath and said; \"Thank you.\" Katies Pov I sat quietly on my bed, waiting nervously for a call from my sister. Finally, she called. \"Guys. Shh, it's Emily!\" I answered right away once everyone was quiet. \"Hello?\" \"Kate?\" she asked. \"Yeah. Where are you?\" \"Oklahoma. Tulsa to be exact. That's why you're so clear,\" she chuckled. I went tense for a moment when she mentioned Tulsa. That's where a friend lived. His name started with an R. Uh...Ryan? Riley? Ricky? \"What are you doing in Tulsa?\" I asked. \"We're trying to catch the last flight out to go to Jerusalem. They have a wall their that's been keeping the zombies out.\" Even from here I could tell she was smiling. \"Is Maddy there?\" \"Yeah.\" \"May I speak with her?\" she asked, clear annoyance now creeping into her voice. I handed the phone to Maddy and said; \"Emily. For you.\" She understood and took it from my hands. \"Hello?\" she asked as she got up and left the small room. \"Where are they?\" Josh asked. \"Tulsa, Oklahoma, they're going to be flying to Jerusalem to talk to whoever is in charge there. They have a wall there that has kept the zombies out of their city for several days now.\" \"Wait does that mean,\" Louis started. \"We might move to Jerusalem?\" Zayn finished. \"Not particularly. But it might be likely that we do,\" I said. \"Can I speak to Emily next?\" Melina asked. \"Can't,\" Maddy said, coming back in, \"She was entering a zombie-zone. She'll send some pictures if she can. That way you can show the general.\" As if on cue the General came strolling into our room. \"Is everyone doing fine?\" Everyone glanced at each other and nodded. \"Good, there's some people that would love to see you,\" the General smiled. Paul slowly peeked his around the corner, along with the Campbells, Inversos, Devines and Maliks. Everyone started crying all over again. \"There's still more,\" the General said. More people squeezed into the tight space. O'Connells, Olveras, Cunninghams, Harry's sister, Gemma, the Tomlinsons, Greg and his Wife and the Paynes. Everyone was here and everyone was a family again. Or at least part of a family. Mom came over to me, holding Bella in her hands. \"Where's Emily and Hope?\" Hope's mom, Thommy, came over at the mention of her daughters name. \"We just off the phone with her. They're in Tulsa trying to catch the last plane and make it go to Jerusalem,\" Maddy spoke up. \"Who are you again?\" Dad asked her. \"Maddy. Emily told me to watch over your daughter while they were gone,\" she took a breath. \"She also said she saw you coming in a dream. She wanted me to do this to both families.\" Maddy took my parents' hand and Thommy's and wrapped them in a hug. \"That's from the both of them.\" Mom and Dad nodded. Thommy's shoulders shuddered as she broke out into a sob. \"Oh,\" Maddy added. \"Emily said, if they didn't make it with some limbs attatched to their body, don't be surprised.\" Our mom gasped at this comment. \"She's very brave,\" Dad stated quietly. \"And she loves us.\" I took in a deep breath shouted over the noise. \"Three cheers for Emily and Hope!\"[Chapter 14] Chapter Fourteen: Hopes Pov \"Turn left here,\" Kade demanded. I was driving now, racing through the zombie filled streets as they started slowly chasing after us. I veered into the left lane and crashed into the gate of the airport. \"Hey what are you doing?\" a police car chased after us. I hit the break and stopped as fast as I could. I got out of the car and ran to the policemen. \"We're here with the military. Please we need a plane!\" I demanded. \"Look out!\" Dylan called. She knocked an arrow into her bow and shot at a zombie as it came towards the cop car. She knocked another one into her bow as she ran over towards. \"We're getting on your last plane. Bye.\" the cops didn't have to argue before we shot off down the runway to catch the last plane as it borded. We jumped on the luggage conveyer belt. as it started closing up. I pulled Jace and Dylan up into the cargo hold. Kade jumped up at the last second and grabbed Emily's hand on the way. She grumbled something after Kade had left go of her hand. \"What's wrong?\" I asked her. \"I hate him at the moment.\" She dusted herself off before she walked to the cargo hold door. She cursed. \"Locked. Looks like we'll be in here a while.\" I groaned. Kade quietly stalked over to me. \"Jace...\" he paused. \"Jace is gay.\" He kept going before I could protest. \"Believe me. But...I saw him hold your hand yesterday and surprised me. I think, he could be going straight for you.\" He grinned. I blinked in surprise. \"Jace-Jace was gay?\" \"Yeah. But it seems to be changing. Changing for you,\" he grinned. I blushed. \"Well. I guess that's kind of cool.\" He left chuckling, going to go sit down on someone luggage. I turned to Jace. I'd never be able to look at him the same. Jace was gay and he was going straight just for me. I smiled. I walked over to him and sat down on the floor, patting the spot for him to join me. He hesitated, but only for a moment. I moved some of the suit cases around I made us a little fort, to help us keep our privacy. The jet engines helped a lot. \"What?\" he asked, paranoia creeping into his voice. \"You didn't tell me you were gay,\" I said, trying to mask the sadness in my voice. \"Yeah...I know. I'm sorry I didn't tell-\" I cut him off. \"I also know that you might be going straight for me.\" He blushed. \"I might be. I don't-\" I cut him off again as I quickly kissed him on the cheek. He blushed again, smiling though, as I pulled away. Before I knew it, his lips were tightly agaisnt mine. His kiss tasted sweet but protective at the same time. Someone kicked at the suitcases, sending all of them down to the ground. \"See,\" Dylan called. \"They weren't talking.\" Emily grinned shyly, chuckling quietly. Kade was awkwardly rubbing the back of his head and Dylan looked just straight out disgusted. All of them were laughing silently at the postion me and Jace had fallen into absent-mindedly. He was lying on top of me, pressing his chest into mine. I had no idea that I'd fallen into this postion with him. He kissed me again in front of everyone before deciding to get up. \"Oh, my god!\" Dylan yelled. \"What?\" I asked, panic creeping in my voice. \"Someone packed a laptop,\" she opened it up. \"And it has no password!\" I laughed. \"What are you gonna do on it?\" \"Watch One Direction. Duh!\" she laughed back at me. Emily and I exchanged glances. \"Count us in!\"[Chapter 15] Chapter Fifteen: Emilys Pov I was now sitting in the corner, alone, trying to fall asleep against the sound of the jet engines. Kade quietly planted himself next to me. I turned away from him, staring into the dark corner. I wasn't in the mood to talk to him, or really anyone, at the moment. \"What do you want?\" I asked finally, realizing he wasn't going to be leaving any time soon. \"I want to say, I'm sorry, okay?\" he paused. \"I thought you meant you were sad about me being adopted. That's why.\" \"That's the first thing that comes to your mind, though?\" I asked, glaring at him. He moved my green hair away from my eyes, staring into them intently. \"I can tell you're not really mad at me. You're curiousty is just turning it into anger,\" he blinked breaking the trance he had somehow put me in. I nodded, not really believeing. \"Hope should've added ego to your aura, only then would it be more accurate,\" I snapped. I got up to leave but he pulled on my wrist and brought me to sit back down again. \"No. Please don't leave.\" He still had a grip on my wrist, keeping me in place. \"What are you waiting for?\" I snapped when he didn't say anything else. \"For you to say, 'apology accepted',\" he cocked his head to the right, not much, just slightly. I scoffed. \"What's out there is out there, sorry doesn't fix it. So no, apology not accepted.\" I got up again and this time he wasn't trying to hold me back. \"Please?\" he asked. I turned around to face him, his eyes had gone big and his was making his lip quiver. He looked like a little kid. I couldn't give in to him. \"No.\" He gripped my wrist, loosely, letting it come almost completely out. He brought it up to his lips and kissed it gently. \"Please?\" he asked keeping his eyes away from mine. \"No. Sorry still doesn't cu-\" He interupted me with a gentle peck on the lips. \"Please?\" I nearly melted, again, desperately trying to keep my knees from giving out. I sighed. \"Fine. But I'm not done being angry at you.\" He looked in my eyes again. \"Lies. You're done.\" I grinned. \"Okay maybe I am.\" He chuckled. \"Maybe I should just do that every time you're mad at me.\" I raised my eyes brows at him. \"No. I'll be melting all the time then.\" \"Guys! Shut the fuck up!\" Dylan called from over by the door. She glanced under the door frame, listening as much as she could. She came back up, eyes wide in terror \"T-There's a zombie and we're loosing altitude over Jerusalem, I mean that's kinda good but we're going to die!\" She started sobbing at the fact of death. \"I mean its worse enough that I have cancer and my death bed is like staring me in the face. But I don't wanna die now!\" Hope and I went over there and hugged her. \"You will not die today.\" Hope cupped her face in her hands. \"Jace, get the door open!\" I yelled. He glanced at his brother as they both barreled to the door, smacking it with their shoulders. They had to do it twice more to get the door to open. As soon as the door had opened all the way, the wind came whistling into the cargo hold. It whipped our hair around and nearly sucked us out of the plane. I quickly grabbed Dylan's hand and Hope's and pulled them to one of the farthest seats away from the gapping hole. Hope strapped herself in and helped me get the terrifyed Dylan strapped in herself. At the last moment I strapped myself in. I looked over at Kade and Jace, hopping they did the same. They looked at me and both gave a thumbs up. \"Brace yourself for impact,\" the pilot said over the speaker. At the sound of those words, I jammed Dylan's head down and mine as well. Hope followed, Kade did the same but Jace didn't. \"Jace put-\" I was cut when the plane hit the ground, rocking us back and forth. Jace's head was shot down into his lap against his will. Dylan gripped my hand and started screaming. \"Please!\" she sobbed. \"Please let me be fine!\" The plane skidded to halt about a mile down from it's impact. I was thrown back against my seat and tossed forward and thrown against a window, hitting the side of my face. I weakly sat up and touched my nose, it was bleeding but not bad. I looked over at Dylan and Hope. Dylan stared out at nothing, clearly shaken up. Hope was conscious enough to stand up but then fall down, so she stuck to just sitting. Kade was struggling to get a tree limb off of his lap. His face pale and it had a small tint of green. As if on cue, he turned away from me and through up. Sexy. I looked around for Jace. \"Jace?\" I called out. \"Jace?!\" \"Where-where's Jace?\" Hope asked as if she hadn't heard me calling for him. I walked over to her. \"I don't know sweetie.\" That got her up to her feet. Slowly she started walking forward, wobbling and swaying as she adjusted her legs. She walked out of the burning hole on the side of the plane. I followed her to make sure she would be okay. A few zombies lingered around the crash. Now we really had to find Jace. \"Jace!\" we called out. We rounded the end of the plane where Hope decided to she would through up all over her combat boots. \"Sexy,\" I whispered. We finally made it back to the gapping hole, only to see Kade gone, leaving Dylan alone, firing aimleslessly at the few zombies coming after her. Since it seemed like I was the only one capable of not falling on their face, I took out my gun and fired. I fired at the three zombies that were sprawled on the floor with an arrow through their heart. I walked over to Dylan and grasped her hand. \"Come on sweetie,\" I cooed to her. \"We'll find them.\" I guided Hope and Dylan to the infirmary in the near buy airport in Jerusalem. As soon as I knew they were in good hands, I went back to get Kade and Jace. \"Kade? Jace?\" I called out around the plane, desperately trying to get them to hear me. \"Kade?! Jace?!\" I stomped my feet in frustration. \"Over here!\" I heard someone yell to me from deep inside the plane. I scrambled deeper and deeper into the plane, hopping to find Jace and Kade. I did indeed find them. \"Help me get him out,\" Kade had silent, not noticed tears rolling down his cheeks. Jace was sprawled across the luggage bags that had been thrown from the back, to the front, then the back again. His leg was clearly twisted in an unnatural way, obviously broken. He was unconscious, but he was breathing and that's what kept me from falling to my knees and start throwing a tempertantrum. I gripped his left arm as Kade pulled on his right. Slowly but surely we got Jace out of the luggage without waking him or hurting him further. \"How did he even get back here?\" I asked Kade as we were caring him to the infirmary. \"His seat buckle came undone and with the force of the impact he was thrown forward and then back again then he slid out of the isle, unconscious by that time and the wind must've pushed his limp body to the back of the plane,\" Kade sniffled. Once inside the hospital, we sat and waited for them to finish checking up on Hope, Dylan and Jace. Kade and I sat in awkward silence for a little while before he said; \"Sorry for leaving Dylan.\" He gripped my hand. \"But thank you for helping me get Jace out of the plane even if I did leave her.\" I turned to him and smiled. \"It's fine, just tell us where you're going next time. Kay? And you're welcome.\" I pressed my lips gently to his cheek, right directly on the bruise. He winced as pain shot through his cheek, but he smiled, carefully. Hope strolled out of the room, obviously better. He wrist was in a guard and her wounds on her face were bandaged. Dylan walked behind, shyly, making her way towards us. Tears ran down her cheeks. \"What'd they say?\" I asked her. \"And are those happy tears or sad?\" \"Happy.\" she said. \"They told me...when this is over and if I survive through it, any hospital in the world will help me with my cancer.\" She beamed up at me, through the tears and pain. I smiled. \"That's...amazing.\" I looked at Hope. She was trying hard not to cry. She mumbled something and my eyes grew wide. \"I'm so sorry Cameron...\" The image of a smiling boy flashed before my eyes. She whiped her eyes and looked back at Dylan with a smile. We waited in silence, sitting with each, trying to get rest. This wasn't the time for us to be delayed by anything. We needed to take action, asap. The only problem was... Jace's leg.[Chapter 16] Chapter Sixteen: Nialls Pov It was so wonderful to hear that Emily and Hope were alive. I was so overjoyed that, right in front of everyone, I decided I would kiss Harry on the lips, which made him jump. \"So you finally came out of the closet?\" Gemma said cocking an eyebrow at her brother. Man they looked so much alike it wasn't even funny. \"Gemma, I've been out of the closet for a while, just I was too... scared to tell you and Mum I guess,\" Harry embraced his sister in a one arm hug. \"So, brother,\" Greg said to, wrapping me in a hug. \"I'm so glad you're safe. I just... miss Mum and Dad, so much. We're all we have left.\" I became tense, I hadn't realized that our parents had... turned. \"Greg, are they-they really zombies?\" He looked at me, somber look in his eyes. \"I'm afraid so.\" He said. \"Gemma was the only one of Harry's family. We have no clue where Lux and her family is.\" I choked up and turned to Gemma. \"Do you know where Lux is?\" She smiled. \"Of course. She was over at my house, I was babysitting, when the whole zombie shit started. So, of course, I had to grab her. She's in my room, napping.\" Harry's face lit up. \"Please can I see her?\" She nodded and took my hand and Harry's, leading us down the hall. \"Here.\" We peeked our head in, glancing around the room, looking for baby Lux. \"Hawwy!\" a baby voice called. \"Uncle Hawwy!\" A steady stream of tears rolled down his face. She walded over to Harry and lifted her arms in the air. \"Up!\" she chanted. \"Up. Up!\" So, to please the little child, Harry picked her up and embraced in a giant hug, burrying his face in her small neck. He pulled away and said; \"I love you Lux.\" \"I wub you too, Hawwy!\" Hope's Pov I looked around to see everyone asleep. Quietly, I got up and went to the 're in an empty warehouse on the outskirts of Jerusalem. We had to wait until morning to ask for access into the holy city. I stared at myself in the mirror. Images flashed in my eyes. A boy with longish dirty blonde hair ran down the hospital hallways after a black haired girl and a brown haired. \"Hope, Emi wait up!\" the boy called turning a corner. The little girls giggled and ran into a room. \"Hurry up Camie!\" they yelled. I stared at myself before falling to my knees. Hot tears streamed down my face and I sobbed into my hands. More images flashed. \"Cameron look what we bought you!\" a thirteen year old light brown haired girl called as she and the dark haired girl walked in. \"What is it?\" the boy asked curoiusly. He smiled as the dark haired girl walked up to him and kissed his cheek. \"THIS!\" she shouted, as they shoved a big white teddy bear in into his face. He laughed at the girl. \"Stop I dont want to remember! Please just stop!\" I begged trying to stop crying. A hand gently landed on my shoulder causing me to jump in suprise. I looked to see Dylan smiling at me sadly. \"What's wrong?\" she asked. I sniffled. \"Uh...nothing. It's just...\" I studied her for a moment, wondering if I should tell about Cameron. He was Emily's brother. They looked exactly like each other, almost twins, except that he was a year older than both of us. \"It's just...you remind of Cameron, Emily's brother. He was killed by uh...\" I sniffled. \"Cancer. And so when you said you had cancer it just...brought back memories. You just remind me of him so much. You know minus the being a girl part.\" She chuckled. \"Well I can tell you another thing we have in common.\" \"Yeah. What's that?\" \"I like girls too.\"[Chapter 17] Chapter Seventeen: Katies Pov I was asleep, with my head resting on my moms stomach just like I was a kid all over again. Bella was wrapped in my arms, her head nestled just under my neck. I kissed to the top of her head and started stroking it carefully. She looked up at me and nudged her head against my chin. Even at the age of two years old, she still acted like a freaking kitten. Suddenly, I got this feeling in my gut like something was wrong. So I moved the grumbling Bella out of my way and got up, searching for the sign of trouble. I peeked my head behind the neighboring curtain. It was a girl, younger than me, thirteen maybe, fourteen at the lastest. \"What's wrong?\" I asked the girl. \"M-My mom and dad and sister a-all got attacked by these h-horrible things. Pale eyes,\" she shuddered. \"I-I was only able to s-save my bunny.\" She moved her arms from where she was holding a small animal. It was brown and white with black pok-a-dots. \"His name is Lucky. I guess it's a pun now.\" She shrugged her shoulders. Suddenly, curiosty shot into her eyes. \"W-Who are you?\" I slowly walked over to her. \"Katie. My sister is on the mission to find out what is wrong with the zombies. Her and her friend.\" She sniffled. \"She's found a new friend Dylan, her friend Kade and Jace.\" I paused. \"Who are you? Not to be rude.\" \"Candy,\" she sniffled again. \"W-Will you...\" she paused clearly hesitating. \"Will you uh...go to sleep with me?\" she paused. \"At least in the same room?\" I grinned, walking farther into the room. \"I will.\" Jaces Pov I woke up to the sound of talking. Hope and Dylan sat across from each other, sharing tears and laughs. Kade lay with an unmoving body on his stomach, obviously Emily. I sat up and quietly crawled over to Hope. I thought back to our conversation last night. Yes I was gay. But Hope sparked something different in me. What was it? I don't know. All I know is that I was attracked to this beautiful young women. She was enchanting in a way I couldn't explain. \"What are you guys doing up already?\" I asked groggily. They both turned to me at the same time, eyes piercing into my skin. \"I-I woke up to early. I was crying and Dylan was cheering me up. That's all,\" Hope said to me. She grasped my hand and kissed me gently on the cheek. Dylan made a gagging noise at our contact. \"Hey, you'll be doing this when you're older.\" \"Not with guys at least,\" Dylan mumbled. I looked at her confused, but it finally started dawning on me. I made an 'o' with my lips. Hope grinned at me and Dylan socked my in the shoulder playfully. I glanced out the window. \"Uh guys...\" Hope and Dylan stopped laughing and slowly got up walking gracefully, without a sound, they crept to the window. \"My, god!\" Dylan whispered. I walked over to Kade and shook him awake. \"What?\" he moaned. \"Get up!\" I panted. \"Zombies! We need out of here!\" \"But we were only in here for less than twenty-four hours!\" Kade groaned. Emily rustled on Kade's stomach. \"And...\" Kade added, yawning. \"You're only seeing zombies cos we're on the outskirts of town.\" I glared down at him, yanked his arm up and dragged him to the window. Different scenes played out before us. Horrible scenes. The zombies somehow got over the wall, making it crumble to the ground. Kade's eyes shot open. \"Oh, my god!\" he whispered. \"G-Get Emily! Now!\" Hope snapped at Kade. It took him a moment before he actually started moving. \"W-Where are we going to go?\" Dylan asked turning to Hope, tears rolling down her face. She paused, watching as the zombies bit and tore at the innocent people, taking in the horrendous scene. She turned to Dylan and said \"We need to get on a plane.\" Kade brought a limp Emily over. \"She's unconscious. She must've hit her head to hard on the floor when I got up.\" \"Well we need to go,\" I snapped. We smashed open the double doors, waving Kade through who had Emily now over his shoulder. Luckily, we were close enough to the airport that we were some of the first people there. I gripped Hope's hand as she gripped Dylan's. We boarded the plane nearly getting killed by the many that struggled to get on the plane. We all tried our hardest to sit closest to each other. Once strapped in, we waited to take off. Zombies climbed aboard and we struggled to keep them out. Kade, being closest to the door with Emily, desperately tried to keep from screaming, so he wouldn't draw attention to himself. \"We are now ready for take off!\" the speaker said, shutting the doors shut as a last family struggled to get in. The planes engine started and we strolled down the runway as zombies grabbed the wings and struggled to get on board. Finally, we lifted off into the sky. I rested my head back and closed my eyes. Soon, I'd fallen asleep.[Chapter 18] Chapter Eighteen: Emilys Pov In my dream, I wasn't myself, instead I was Hope. And actually, it wasn't a scary nightmare. It was actually...quite pleasant. I mean for a dream at least. Anyway, Dream-Hope was dancing down a beach side with a guy. A guy I couldn't see. As he twirled Dream-Hope around I finally spotted his face. Jace. It was Jace she was dancing with. Something glinted off his ring finger. I didn't even have to study it long before I knew what it was. I knew they weren't quite married yet though. Something told me they weren't. \"I will marry you, by the way,\" Dream-Hope said, bringing her eyes up to meet Dream-Jace's. He grinned childishly and smiled. \"Good. Cos otherwise...\" \"Otherwise...\" He grinned. \"I'd have to kidnap you and make you marry me.\" He kissed her gently on the lips. \"Don't forget...I am an assasin...\" Jace grinned cockily at her. \"But you can't kill me can you?\" Suddenly the dream shot forward in time. It was Jace and Hope still but they were in a room. I knew what was going to happen and I didn't want to watch it, I wanted it to stop otherwise I'd throw up in my sleep. Just ew. But of course the small scene played out before me because I had no control over it. Then it fast forwarded again. Hope was lying a hospital bed, screaming in pain as the doctor told her to breathe. Just breathe. A small baby appeared in the doctors' arms. Dream-Me stood next to Dream-Hope as she started crying, gripping my hand tightly. And now the dream fast forwarded again. This time there were three small kids running around Hope's ankles. Names popped into my head. Hiro. Echo. Whisper. Oldest. Middle. Youngest. Then...the dream stopped and I was in complete darkness. I went to open up my eyes and sit up but I couldn't. Oh god. It was like that...a long time ago. When I fell and I hit my head. I was unconscious, trapped in my own mind. I'd be this way for a while. No telling when I'd be able to wake up. Do da do. Boring time to be in my head isn't it? An eerie thought crept into my mind. What was happening outside? Where was I and what were we doing? Was I still in the warehouse, left behind from my friends? Or was I somewhere safe? A meadow without worries. What was going on? I then started hearing noises. Was I creeping back to reality? It was screaming. Screaming towards what? Wake up stupid body! I willed myself to open my eyes. I finally became aware of my surroundings. A zombie was obviously on the plane. But where? I turned around, Hope, Jace, Kade and several other people were baracading the curtains with the suitcase. Hope turned and saw that I was awake and instructed some... guy to come over and make sure I was okay. \"W-Who are you?\" I snapped at the guy as he went to touch my knee. \"I'm Kennedy's brother, they sent me here cos they knew he died. I'm Xavier,\" he took my hand. \"Get up hurry!\" THUMP A suitcase fell, making a dull thump as it hit the ground. \"Run...\" Jace said. \"Run!\" Hope unbuckled Dylan and made her get away from the curtain as far as possible. I tried to get mine off but it was jammed. \"Help!\" I called. Hope took her knife and sliced the buckle off. \"Well, great now I can't sit here,\" I sighed. \"But thank you.\" Dylan took my hand and brought me under the seat. It was a tight squeeze but I managed to fit. Hope sat across from me and Kade and Jace sat on the seat, protecting us. Xavier was running to the cockpit. He came back a moment later, saying they wouldn't do anything about it. Jace got angry, obviously and snapped; \"Well, Kade and I will lead the zombies into the cockpit and trap them there, also making them eat the fucking loosers in there.\" Hope looked up at him and grinned. Jace gripped the reluctant Kade's elbow and dragged him to the cockpit. \"Dylan!\" Jace snapped. She jumped. \"Y-Yes?\" \"Get ready to shoot some mother fuckers!\" Kade grinned. It was my turn to smile. I gave him the ugh-you-are-so-stupid look. He only winked. I watched as Dylan slipped in behind the zombies, tip toeing, trying not to make noise. Kade and Jace made so much noise it was hard to keep your ears open. Dylan shot the zombies down so quietly and so quickly that the arrows weren't even visible once she shot them. The standing zombies were tossed into the cockpit, just barely squeezing past Jace and Kade. They ran back in time as the plane started it's decent into the water. I started rising as the alttitude around us increased putting pressure on my ears. The plane the hit the water and I smacked my head on the under part of my seat. Luckily it was cushoined. Water came rushing in as the zombies spilled out and struggled to stay afloat. I was underwater now, struggling to get out from under my seat. Hope had slipped out with ease as the water engulfed her. She pulled herself over to me and took my hand, tugging me out from under the seat. My shirt ripped as I swam tugging her to the only exit; the gaping hole in the front of the plane. Dylan was sitting there, well really she was floating there. Small drops of blood seeped out of her nose. I swam over to her, breathing deeply as I regained my breath. I grasped her wrist and yanked her to the opening that was growing dark as we sank to the bottom of the of the ocean. \"We can't go that way! It's too far down!\" Hope shouted to me, pulling herself up on the seats to the back of the plane. Where was Jace, Kade and Xavier? Already above water and out of trouble. She went back to another hole that was wide enough for us to get through but we'd have to suck in our gut. I shoved the limp Dylan through and squeezed myself through. I was out of the plane, watching as it came closer and closer to the rocks. I had to get Hope out. I gripped her hand, while still holding on to Dylan. I pulled and pulled until Hope was finally free. I swam pulling them to the surface, gasping for air as we float there, weak and tired. \"Put your hands up!\" someone said. We were face to face with a hull of a ship. \"Please...don't hurt us!\" I whimpered.[Chapter 19] Chapter Nineteen: Kades Pov \"Who are you?\" someone asked once a blinding light was shot into my eyes. I groaned. \"I'm-I'm Kade. Kade Sanders,\" I answered, wincing against the light. \"Who are the others?\" a different person snapped. \"T-They didn't tell you?\" I smirked. \"We're interogating them in the other rooms,\" the first person said. \"You're lucky. You're not getting as worse as the others.\" I paused. They were playing at an angle here. \"Where are these rooms located?\" \"Next door,\" the first one spoke up again. \"They're getting beaten.\" I smirked. \"Wouldn't I be able to hear them?\" They hesitated. \"B-But the walls are too th-thick for you to be a-able hear them.\" \"Judging by your stutter, good sir, I can tell you're lying.\" They looked at each other. One was a scrawny boy with black hair that covered his face, sun burned skin shown under his tshirt, his hair covered his brown eyes, still, and he still had his knife belt, missing three. The other was red head, with freckles that sprayed across his face. Green/hazel eyes were hidden behind glasses. I looked at their feet, sure enough, one foot was bandaged on each of them. The one that Emily had driven the knife into. \"Where's Luke?\" I asked once they hadn't turned back to me. They jumped at the question, almost like they weren't expecting me to know who they were. \"Yeah, I know who you are. Where are you really holding them?\" I got up from my seat and walked over to them as they drew their guns, aiming them towards my chest. Zach, the black haired one, spoke up first. \"They're being held captive, being watched by Luke.\" Great, teenage pervert watching over three helpless girls and two, probably beaten to a pulp, guys. \"Are they all in the same room?\" I asked, backing away from them so they would lower their guns. \"Girls in one. Boys in the other.\" Tyler said. \"So...can I go back to my lovely cell?\" I sneered. They were reluctant to bring me to the cell and I didn't try anything knowing I didn't stand a chance against them, with the all the weapons they had on them. But Zach gripped my shoulder, roughly. I was surprised for how much power this one scrawny kid had. He guided me down to the bottom of the boat. I passed the cell where the girls were, Luke was inside, coming to close the three that were pressed together tightly against the wall. Dylan had tears coming down her eyes, Hope sat quietly batting away Luke's hands. Emily wasn't doing anything, which worried me, it looked like she didn't mind being touched by this loser. I was shoved into the cell with Jace and Xavier, but before Tyler shut the door, I lunged. I took a knife from a stunned Zach and stabbed him in the stomach. I did the same to Zach. They both died without a word. \"P-Please!\" Dylan screamed. \"Don't hurt me!\" I got back in time to see Dylan get thrown across the cell and smack her back against the wall. I had to keep my anger from getting the best of me. Jace was having a hard time doing the same. I took the bloody knife and chucked it into the cell, grazing Luke's arm and making it land in the wall above Emily. I didn't have to worry about Hope. She had Dylan by the hand as she tried to get her breath back. Luke turned and looked at me. \"Lookie here.\" As he moved away, I could see why Emily couldn't fight back. I hadn't seen her eyes earlier but now that I could them, I could see that they were closed, she was unconscious and this sick-o was touching her while she was knocked out. \"Hey!\" someone called behind me. \"Get away from my daughter, you bitch!\" It was a guy. I turned around and came face to face with a person that looked a lot like Dylan. \"Dad?!\" Dylan snapped. \"I thought you left me!\" \"I did,\" he looked solemn. \"I took this boat out once I left you. It's your Uncles. Then these three-highjacked me. How we ran into each other?\" He paused. \"I don't know.\" Dylan didn't seem to believe the old man and neither did Hope. \"What?\" he asked. \"Daddy you left me!\" Dylan snapped. \"You left me to fend for myself. I was out in the woods for...three days! I'm starving still, I haven't had any proper food in...less than twenty for hours!\" She paused, taking in a breath. \"Not only that, I have cancer for fuck sake!\" Her dad looked taken aback when Dylan cursed. Luke had time to get up and walk over to Emily and grab her limp body. I grumbled and ran into the cell, punching him in the face. Her body fell onto the deck with a dull thud. \"Do. Not. Touch. Her. Again. Understand?\" I snapped, grumbling into his face. I exited the cell after Hope and Dylan, locking Luke in. \"Wai-Wait! What happened to Zach and Tyler?\" Luke snapped at us. Shouting over my shoulder, I snapped; \"I killed them!\"[Chapter 20] Chapter Twenty: Hopes Pov Three hours sailing and all we could hear from below deck was the wails and complants of Luke, demanding being let free. Dylan was still mad at her dad, she said to me that she was never forgiving the fucktard. I had chuckled at that. Kade had fallen asleep with the still unconscious Emily lying on his stomach. She was breathing, so it was a sign of life. Jace was sitting over in the corner, sharping a shard of wood with a piece of glass. \"So what is your dad's name?\" I paused. \"Besides...'Mr. FuckTard'.\" She looked up at me, anger flashing in her eyes. \"Arthur. Arthur West.\" She sighed. \"Nickname; Artie.\" I made a fake gagging noise. \"Gay!\" She giggled. \"I know.\" After a moment of sitting there I asked; \"When did you find out that you had cancer?\" She winced. \"Uh...about a week ago. So I'm not that far along.\" I sighed. \"Good. It just means that we can get you treatment faster.\" \"Look out!\" Jace ran over and jumped on top of me and Dylan, just as wave toppled us over. I gasped, gripping on the side of the boat as it flipped under water and resurfaced. Kade was awake now and surprisingly Emily wasn't. She was sopping wet as it dripped onto the floor. \"What is going on?\" Arthur asked. I couldn't answer because another wave struck the side of the boat, knocking Arthur out of the water and under the boat. \"Dad!\" Dylan yelled. \"Well...\" That was the last time we saw Arthur, as his head slipped under the water. What was happening, was the question that still hung in the air. \"What is happening?\" Jace asked as if he read my mind. \"It must be some freak storm!\" Xavier yelled over the sound of another wave. \"Or...\" Dylan trailed looking off in the directions the waves were coming from. Zombies. Thousands of zombies floating and kicking wildly trying to swim away from something in the water. Probably our boat. But wait... If there are zombies swimming from something...where is the land and where are they heading. \"Look for land!\" I yelled. \"But we're in the middle of no where...\" Kade said. \"If the zombies are floating here, there has to be land someone nearby keep a look out!\" I snapped. For an hour, we sailed away from the zombies, still getting slightly hit from their waves. But finally, we reached land. \"Where are we?\" I asked once we caught out breath. \"And what about Luke?\" Jace asked. \"What are we going to do about him?\" Kade asked, finishing Jace's question. I'd totally forgotten about Luke. He was probably unconscious because of the hit from the waves. Either that or he was dead. Out of no where, Emily sat up and screamed. \"Run!\"[Chapter 21] Chapter Twenty-One: Emilys Pov They didn't even have time to question before I got up and started running. If they didn't start running soon, they would all be Zombie food. They were coming from the ocean. A few stray zombies heard our noise and were following us for the last hour. Yes I felt all the waves that hit and tossed the boat around as if it were some new toy. I just couldn't wake up because of the nightmare I was having. I turned back to them, none of them were following me. \"Guys!\" I whined. \"Zombies are coming!\" I stopped running. \"Guys?\" Hope got up and walked to me. \"We don't see any zombies love. We can't run because there's no proof.\" But I was about to be proven one-hundred-percent! Dylan screamed as the zombies lunged at us, diving over Dylan. She looked at them confused. I took Hope's hand. \"Believe me now?!\" I snapped. I started running, running towards anything that meant safety. A tall building came into view I ran up to it while more and more zombies started piling up after us. I tried the door. Locked. Window. Open. I climbed on the through and helped Hope. She helped Dylan squeeze through the small window. Jace and Kade made it but Xavier had a hard time suqeezing through. He just barely made it before a zombie nipped at his hand. Without thinking I took my machete and sliced his hand off. He screamed in pain and the others looked at me with awe. \"Are you crazy?!\" Kade yelled at me. \"Yup.\" I replied. I took the fabric off of his shirt and wrapped it around the wound. Taking the sort of wet bandages, I wrapped them on his stub as I desperately tried to get the bleeding to stop. After about, thirty more pieces of fabric and about yards worth of bandages his bleeding finally stopped. I gave him a painkiller and he drifted off into oblivion. \"Okay...how'd you know that he wouldn't turn into a zombie if you cut the limb off?\" Dylan asked, trying not to through up. \"I had a dream,\" I said. \"Whoa...gettin' all MLK on us,\" Hope said. I laughed. \"But seriously I had a dream that I was running through Utica Square and I had to cut my hand off because it got bit. And in my dream I didn't turn after that.\" I shrugged. \"So I guess it was just...a guess!\" They stared at me shocked. Something came over. Realization. I wasn't going to get hurt in Utica Square. We were going no where near it. It only showed me that dream because I knew, somehow, that someone was going to get bit and I needed to act quickly. Ohhhh! But we needed to get out of here. Xavier needed to wake quickly or we were all going to die. I was pacing back in forth in one corner, hair covering my face, hiding the tears and distress. Someone cleared their throat and I had to quickly wipe away the tears from cheeks and I had to rub my eyes to keep them from getting too puffy. I looked up. It was Xavier with Kade helping him stand up. \"I wanted to say thank you. I would be a zombie now if you hadn't... reacted so quickly. Thank you.\" Xavier looked pale with a hint of green, but it seemed as if he wasn't ready to give into puke. Understandable. As I examined him closer, I noticed how much Kennedy and Xavier looked alike. \"You're welcome. And...if you don't mind me asking...are younger or older than Kennedy?\" I asked. \"Younger...by...three years, I believe. I'm twenty-three,\" Xavier smiled kindly. I nodded him off and began pacing. Only until Kade came back again and embraced me in a hug, startling me. \"Kade...squishing me.\" He squeezed my still, bodies pressing together tightly, chests smashing against each other, hearts beating in sync. Ugh...so cliche. But only it was the truth. He finally let go, breathing rapidly as we both tried to gain our air back. Before I could gain to much, his lips jammed agianst mine, making my heart race even faster. He pushed me up against the wall and brought my leg up around his waist. He made the worry of leaving this building vanish, but only for a moment. \"Eww!\" Dylan called. \"Get a room!\" \"Technically,\" Kade said against my lips. \"This is a room!\" \"I mean your own room!\" Dylan snapped. I chuckled and left his lips. I hadn't noticed I'd been shivering, I only realized when Kade pulled his warmth away from me. \"You're cold?\" he asked. I nodded, showing him the tear in my shirt. He took over his white over shirt and stuck it on over my head. It was long and wide on me but it worked. \"Thanks,\" I smiled. \"Now about that room...\" he whispered tauntingly into my ear, nipping at it. I got the tingles running up and down my spine, but I resisted the urge to say yes, instead, I slapped him. \"What was that for?\" he winced. \"For making me want you.\" I started walking away from him, away from our corner and I made my over to our small group, worry creeping itself back into my body. \"Okay, we need to get out of here... like now.\" \"Why?\" Jace asked while reapplying Xaviers bandages. \"Cos. We need to find us a plane.\" \"Oh yeah we've had so much luck with planes in the past week,\" Dylan sassed. I turned and glared at her. \"Okay how about a helicopter?\" They turned and looked at each other, than almost in sync Hope and Jace said; \"I guess that's fine.\"[Chapter 22] Chapter Twenty-Two: Dylans Pov I was lucky to have my dad dead. Sorry to say to all you Daddy's-Girls out there. But my dad was a dick. D-I-C-K, dick. He was barely around at all, drank, smoked and we had a clue that he might be cheating. Might. Although we couldn't know for sure. He left my mom with barely enough money to get it through the week. We lived in a small one bedroom apartment. We barely had enough to even move our pinky toe. To make it all worse, I got cancer. Bills started piling up, mom, dad and Kaitlyn started blaming it on me. So in a way, I was glad everyone had died. As we drove as quickly as we could out of the small town that we had crash landed on, we sat in silence, barely talking. Emily had her phone out snapping pictures at the zombies that were racing to catch up with us. How I wasn't scared? Surprising, I know! RING RING It was Emily's phone, her ringtone playing 'They Don't Know About Us'. \"Katie!\" she snapped angrily. Putting it on speaker she shouted; \"Everyone can hear you now so...\" \"Is that a good thing?\" I finally heard Katie's voice for the first time. \"In a way,\" Kade laughed. \"I can finally meet the sister of beautiful Emily.\" Emily glared at him as if to say not-in-the-mood. \"Was that...Kade?\" Katie asked struggling with his name. \"Yup. And I'm an angel!\" Hope smiled at the phone. \"Hopie!\" Katie squealed. \"Hey Katie...?\" Emily asked. \"Yeah?\" \"Face time me, now,\" Emily smiled at the phone. \"Okay.\" She hung up. \"So she gets to see the band of misfits?\" I asked. Emily turned to me, gentle smile forming on her lips. \"No. She gets to see our group of friends.\" I smiled even though it's overly cliche. Minutes later, Katie's smile was showing through the screen with a girl next to her. \"Who's that?\" Emily asked. Katie glanced over at the girl, as if she hadn't realized she was there. \"This is Candy and her bunny Lucky.\" The small animal appeared in the screen at the sound of his name. Katie beamed at me. \"You must be Dylan.\" I blushed. \"Emily's told many great things about you.\" \"Let's see if you can guess the others,\" Emily smiled. She turned to the phone to face the driver. Kade. \"Uh...\" Katie struggled. \"Kade?\" Emily beamed. She rotated the phone and moved it to Jace. \"Uh...\" she paused. \"It's Hope's boyfriend...\" \"Whoa whoa wait ... you told her he was my Boyfriend?!\" Hope tackled Emily, making the phone fly out of her hands and into mine. Once landed, Katie said, \"It was Jace btw.\" I grinned. Candy was lying down, sleeping, her head on Katies lap. She was a strawberry blonde, olive skin, three piercings on her ears, nose piercings and she had a small brown and white bunny with black spots. \"Where's her family?\" I asked, noticing that I still had time as Hope and Emily restled like little girls. \"Dead. Everyone in her family were turned,\" Katie sighed. \"My parents are taking her in.\" I nodded. \"Katie!\" Emily yelled, laughing as Hope began tickling her. Katie smiled as I turned the phone to Emily. \"I'll talk to you later Kate!\" she laughed. \"Tell mom and dad I love them!\" Once Katie hung up I said out loud; \"Candy is cute.\" Then I covered my mouth like I just shared one of my darkest secrets. Which I kind of did. Kade, Emily and Xavier looked at me like wait-you-are-lesbian? I nodded my head like you-idiots-did-not-know? \"Well, there's something new,\" Xavier said. I smirked. We drove until we reached somewhere in the middle of now where. \"We have to go on foot from here. No roads from here on,\" Kade gripped mine and Emily's hand helping us into the grass. \"Guys,\" Xavier said, \"Welcome to the mountains of lovely Nepal!\"[Chapter 23] Chapter Twenty-Three: Hopes Pov \"My feet are killing me!\" Dylan panted. \"We're almost there!\" Xavier yelled over his shoulder. \"Where are we even going?\" I whined to him. \"A world famous researh facility,\" Xavier replied, slowing down, letting us catch up. \"They're going to help us figure out a cure. They say they have zombies locked in another part of their facility. They're doing research on them. They say, the sick are almost immune to the zombies. The zombies pay no mind to them. They just hobble right past you without a care in the world.\" Emily and I exchange glances. Zombies held captive and nothing went wrong. Zombies that walk right past you when you're sick and don't even bother checking you out. Maybe we could find a cure or something inside the building. We trudged a mile more until I saw a tip of a gray building. \"There!\" I shouted, skipping forward, \"The building! Right there!\" I ran forward, Emily and Dylan on my heals. \"Be careful!\" Xavier yelled. Once at the gate we we hit the 'call' button to speak to someone. \"Who is this?\" someone said with a light english accent. \"I-It's Hope. Hope Cunningham. Trained assasin; specialty; short distance. I'm here from the US. Military. Uh...I'm here with five other group members. Kade and Jace Sanders, A.W.T., Assasins We Trust, Emily O'Connell trained assasin in Long Distance and Dylan West. She's an ally, but she specializes in Archery.\" There was a long pause as they debated whether or not to let us in. Finally, after ten gruelling minutes, the gate opened and we quickly strolled on in before they could change their minds. Once inside we were rushed to showers and given new clothing and our old clothes were burned. Kade looked a little sad to see his clothing go. \"Why did we have to do that?\" Dylan demanded. \"You might have infections on you from the zombies. Now kindly get dressed into your clothes and meet me and the other doctor in the main room in fifteen minutes,\" a young looking docotor said to us three girls. He was quite handsome actually. Boyish face with a hint of stuble under his bottom lip, hair that's natural color was brown but he'd dyed it blonde, two piercings in his ear, nose piercing and a tattoo on his left arm. I couldn't quite make out what it was. A saying or symbol, I just couldn't tell. \"Excuse me,\" I said. \"Before you go sir. What is your name?\" He smiled. \"Damen.\" And before I could ask anything else, he left, while leaving the burning smile in my memory. \"Uh-uh,\" Emily said breaking me from my trance. \"He's too old for you!\" I turned to her, disgusted look on my face. \"I wasn't-I mean, I'm not crushing on him.\" I crossed my arms over my chest and trudged to the small bed that held my clothing. All of it was the same, except for the jacket. Mine was red, Emily is blue and Dylan's is green. Gray sweat pants and white tank top were the basics as you clearly could tell. Boots were a pure white and not-so-surprisingly they were in our sizes. Fifteen minutes wasn't up yet, we still had ten minutes left. Emily started humming a song. Can you guess from what band the song came from? ... One Direction. The song? Save You Tonight. I joined in with the beat and both friends' eyes lit up like a fire. Joining in, I noticed even Dylan had a very beautiful voice. We harmonized singing more than one One Direction song. So many in fact that we lost track of time and some guard had to come in and get us. \"Come on ladies, you're late,\" the guard gripped my elbow and Dylans shoulder, leaving Emily to trail behind. We were gathered in a small room, full with cameras and monitors, watching as zombies strolled down different corridors. \"Where is this?\" Dylan as behind me. \"Section D. Someone was infected over there and it spread rather quickly, but since we've been quiet, they haven't really bothered us.\" The female doctor, that must've been with the guys, removed a sheet a glass container. \"He escaped before we could baracade the door that blocked the Section D from the rest of building. It was a tall creature, fuzzy brown eyes, brown/black hair and zits. Obviously he was very young. The Doctor walked over to the Tv in the center of the room and clicked 'Section D' with the remote. \"This is what it looks like at the moment. Their actually quiet calm if they're not disturbed.\" \"So what do you need us to do?\" Jace spoke up. \"What makes you think we need you for something?\" the guard that escorted us to this particular room, asked. \"Well,\" Kade began. \"You wouldn't be showing us these important details if you didn't need us to do something.\" The female doctor beamed at Kade and Jace, clearly not angry at them. She was more-or-less amused by them. Which irked me in an unexplainable way. \"Yes indeed though, I do need something from you,\" the Doctor said. She smiled at the small group. \"I need four of you to go to Sector D and we need you to retrieve a medcine, any medicine, and then we can test it on someone to see if it works.\" She paused, taking in a breath of air before continueing. \"So...any volunteers?\" \"I-I think Hope and Emily should go,\" Dylan whispered. \"I mean ... they have more training then probably anyone here. You should've seen them while they-\" She was cut off by Emily who was panicking. I took her by the shoulders and stared deeply into her eyes. \"Emily calm down. Dylan is right, we have to be part of the group.\" She shuddered as her hazel eyes became red and blotchy, but she finally gave a huge sigh and said; \"I know.\" I turned to the female Doctor and said; \"Count me and Emily in.\" She gave a small smile and turned to the guys. \"And for the 'wimpy' boys ... ?\" Kade and Jace exchanged a glances. \"Did she just really call us 'wimpy'?\" Jace asked after a moment. The Doctor chuckled. \"I only call you that because the girls have already chosen. Normally it is the other way around.\" \"Doctor...\" I started. \"Call me Olivia,\" she beamed at me. \"Olivia, when do we actually ... set off into our little ... journey ... I guess,\" I asked. \"Once the boys finish selecting their team members,\" she grinned at them. Xavier, Jace and Kade glanced at each other. \"Jace and I will go,\" Kade smiled at both of us. \"Great. After your exams you will be escorted to the main door that seperates the living from the dead,\" Olivia said with a stern look on her face. It was amazing how well she could change her look from I-am-really-happy-woo! to be-careful-otherwise-you-will-die in just a second. I decided at that moment there was something off about her. I could not and would not trust her.[Chapter 24] Chapter Twenty-Four: Emilys Pov So after the full body search, check-up and properly designed outfits, we set off for our designated drop off area, escorted by five guys and the two Doctors, Doctor Olivia and Doctor Damen, whom Hope was nearly drooling over. \"Good luck girls and boys. Remember, if you ever need help, look to the cameras and do a quick nod of the head,\" Damen said, gripping Kade and Hope's shoulder. \"You will do great and try to grab a vaccine that isn't that deadly, they should have labels on them. Oh and the vault you need to look for is 'D 339'. The code is twenty-three seventeen,\" Olivia had me and Jace by the shoulders. \"Good luck!\" they both said. They guards quietly unbaracaded the doors and opened the double them up, waving us four deliquents into the zombies infested halls. Butterflies crept into my stomach as we walked farther and farther and farther away from safety. Once out of ear shot Hope said; \"I don't trust Doctor Olivia.\" She felt it too? The way she had changed her attitude so suddenly on us was a sign of ... something ... something I couldn't explain. \"I felt it too,\" Jace said, speaking what Kade and I thought. \"We cannot trust this ... 'special' character,\" Kade said, speaking what we all thought. I went first, since, I was the fastest, I could slip past them quickly enough without being noticed. I tip-toed down corridors and waved them through as we easily made our way through the maze of halls and doors. Only twice did we have to stop and make sure the zombies were not watching. That was until Jace fell, shooting his gun against the wall, making a loud explosion sound as it echoed down the hallways. \"Oh, great Jace! Just what we needed!\" Hope shot at him. He flipped her off and we ran down the hallway. \"There!\" I pointed to a sign that read Vaults 201-300 left, Vaults 301-400 right. So I turned right, racing ahead of them as fast as I could to make the way was clear. I saw the vault, right ahead of me. Only I didn't see the glass and I ran straight into it. Hope, Jace and Kade came up behind me, snickering. So I flipped them off and reminded them I had a gun. I unlocked the vault and ran inside, urging the door closed as a lone group of two zombies passed by us and watched us intently. Once they realized that we were human they walked our way. Great, just great. \"What do we do?\" Hope asked, shivering against the extreme cold tempurtare in the room. I took a syring and jammed it into my arm, not caring what the consiquences would be. All three of them looked at me worry in their eyes. \"What?\" I snapped, taking another syringe and stabbing it into Hope's arm. She groaned as pain shot through her arm. I looked to make sure the weren't deadly. I took two more syringes labeled undeadly. I jammed them into Kade and Jace, both of them protesting at the sight of the needles. Ha. Wimps. We waited. We waited until we could barely wait anymore. We passed the time playing truth-or-dare or guess-the-number-in-my-head. For an hour. It was an hour of pure boredom, until Jace said; \"I've had enough.\" Hope gripped his arm and brought him in for a kiss. Even though, yes I was sixteen, I still found it awkward to be around someone who was kissing. \"Hey wait...\" I said, thinking of something suddenly. \"How old are you?\" \"Seventeen,\" Kade said. \"Eighteen,\" Jace said. \"Sixteen,\" Hope and I both said. Jace took a deep breath and asked; \"Are you ready to see if it worked?\" We all exchanged nervous glances but nodded. Jace hit the button to release us and he watched as the zombies, moved closer and closer to the moving door. I closed my eyes, gritting my teeth, waiting for them to start attacking. Nothing. Nothing happened. I opened my eyes. The zombies had walked right past us. They were sniffing around the vault, chattering their yellow teeth. Very quickly we ran out of the freezing cold and shut the door behind us. Without knowing, I jumped in Kade's arms and slammed my lips against his, not caring who was watching. We did it! We figured out a small disguise. Something that would buy us time to come up with a real cure to this ... infection that was growing throughout the world. I was so wrapped up in celebrating that I hadn't noticed that none of us had grabbed any vaccines. We needed to grab at least like ... two million more. So we opened the vault and quietly slipped past the two zombies. Hope grabbed two cases, I grabbed two, Jace and Kade being the over achievers, they grabbed four ... each. Ugh. Men. We made our way back to the door until we were stopped by Dylan and Xavier. He quickly demanded he be injected. I stated that it might take a while and he said he didn't care. So I took a shot and jammed it into his arm. \"What's happening?\" Jace asked Dylan. \"Olivia and Damen, they got so overjoyed by the victory that they went around shooting people shouting We need to get the medicine all for ourselves!\" Dylan grabbed my hand. \"We have to go before they-\" \"There they are!\" Damen yelled, psycotic craze in his eyes. We ran out of the back door, barely making it out without getting shot by the two maniacs that were now chasing after us and our supplies of illnesses. They chased us down a hill and over a bridge until we finally reached our abandoned van. \"Ya know,\" Damen said slowing down behind us, and gripping Olivia's arm. \"I knew ... it would end this way ... for ... Olivia!\" He took the gun and pulled it to her and then ... bang ... she was gone. \"I'm so sorry Sarah. Maggie and Mikey.\" He took the only gun he had left out of his pocket, raised it to his head and ... Bang ... he was gone too. Hope ran over to his dead body. She started to take of his shirt. I stared at her in disbelieve \"Hope this is no time to stare at the dead guys abs.\" Jace tensed when I said that. \"I'm not. Im just need to know what it said...\" She replied. We all staried at her confused. Hope stopped moving and tears came to her eyes. She silently got up and ran to jace nugging him tightly. Now we were really confused. Kade and I walked over to see what she was looking at, it was a tatoo on his shoulder. It said 'crazy or not love is love and even if the world shoots us in the back i will always love you'. Kade hugged me and I hugged him back.[Chapter 25] Chapter Twenty-Five: Noelles Pov \"Really?\" Katie said over the phone. Her eyes lit up. \"Guys!\" She started shouting around the cabins, banging on the different cabins' walls and waking the different families up, but of course she got curses and hate stares from the different families. \"What?\" Paul said, rubbing his eyes. At the top of Katie's lungs she shouted; \"THEY FOUND A CURE FOR THE ZOMBIES!\" \"Wait what?\" I asked, astonished by this new information. And it got the attention she was seeking from the families. People began wooping and hollering. \"Are you lieing to us?\" a mom said, making everyone go quiet. \"No.\" She snapped, taking her phone from behind her back. \"My sisters on the phone. She can tell you.\" She was lucky it was face time, otherwise no one would believe her. \"Is this some cruel joke?\" a Dad asked. Emily shook her head, showing the cases of syringes. \"But those'll just make us sick,\" a women said. So Emily began explaining how it wasn't exactly a cure, but it was a disguise from the zombies. \"But we won't cures!\" an older boy said. \"Look,\" Emily looked she was about ready to starting hitting people. \"Fine, we just won't give anything to your family because a disguise isn't good enough. We'll let your family get turned into zombies because, disguise isn't good enough, I need a cure all for myself!\" She paused. \"News flash fucktard. We can't find one. So you're just gonna have to fucking deal with it. It's either a disguise or you get eaten by the man eating creatures.\" She turned away from the camera picking something up. \"This ... good sir, is what you'll turn into if you don't DEAL WITH IT!\" It was a zombie it had glassy eyes and green moldy looking skin, it's hair was matted in different directions and his teeth had turned even yellow-er than before. But, it worked. It shut up the complaing and bitch-y family. \"Noelle. Katie.\" Emily said. \"Go tell the General and bring me with you. Kay?\" \"But what about zombies,\" I whispered. \"Don't worry, we're flying to America, we'll tell the general where when we get there. Now hurry before we actually high jack this helicopter,\" Emily smiled. So Katie and I exchanged glances but we casually jogged down to the deck, running now, trying to find General Lee. \"Yes girls?\" he asked once we found him. \"Dylan, Hope, Kade, Jace, Emily, and Xavier all found a disguise so that way we could hide from the zombies,\" I said, panting, gasping for air. \"See,\" Katie said, raising the phone to the generals eyes. He grinned at the sight of the group of people, but he was more-or-less staring at the girls. \"Well, then,\" the general started. \"We shall through a huge party for the return of the wonderful and brave group. Guys will ask the girls and what should the theme be?\" He gripped Katie and I by the shoulders bringing us closer together. She and I exchanged glances. \"Something that involves dresses.\" Katie laughed. \"But nothing to formal. Like no ball room dances just kind of like ...\" I struggled hard trying to find the word. \"Like ... a prom. Nothing to fancy.\" \"Excellent, a week from tomorrow we will throw a party for the return of our extraordinarry team!\" I grinned and turned back to the phone. She was gone. She must've had to go. \"Way to go Hopie and Ems,\" I smiled. Emilys Pov Of course Xavier and Jace flew, they demanded it and we didn't seem to put up a fight, we were too tired to argue. Except I couldn't fall asleep. I was staring out of window, watching as Pacific Ocean flew by below us. I watched as dolphins leaped out of the water and gracefully landed back in, rarely making any splashes. I was texting Katie. It took a while for it to send and for me to get one but that didn't matter as long as I had contact with her. She was telling me how the general was expecting to throw a party next week. Awesome. Great. Wow. Bleh. Guys ask girls was what she just texted me. I glanced at Kade, hoping he wasn't reading over my shoulder, nope, his head was just on my shoulder and he was fast asleep. Who do you want to ask you? It took the long time to send it too her and I know would have some free time before she replied. I tapped Jace on the shoulder, he jumped at the sudden contact but he said into his headset; \"What Emily?\" \"How much farther?\" I said into the headset. Jace paused, checking the many gages on the front board on the helicopter. \"About ... fifteen more miles or so until we reached California.\" California. Now that is a state I hadn't heard about in a LONG time. The people around us, my family, Hopes, Noelles, Maddys, and Melinas family all had to be relocated to DC. I didn't want to move and I put up a fight but ... of course we moved. I decided I would just stick to texting Katie and playing games, with myself. That was until Kade woke up. \"Where-where are we?\" He asked yawning. \"Fifteen miles from California,\" Jace answered him for me. \"Oh and please no 'making-out' with the head phone set on. Please?\" Jace now whined and I could hear Xavier chuckle into the microphone. Kade grinned cockily at me. \"Dude, there are no promises for that.\" I laughed, taking his headset off as he took mine off. Our lips collided for a moment before he looked at me and said; \"Will you go to the dance with me?\" I looked at him both anger and shock filling my eyes. \"You were looking over my shoulder.\" He grinned at me but he nodded his head. \"So will you?\" Butterflies crept into my stomach and I hestitated to answer him. He took my hand and kissed it gently. \"Let me rephrase that then,\" he cleared his throat for a dramatic effect. \"Emily, my darling, will you please, make me the happiest guy in the world and go to the dance with me?\" I turned away from. No guy has ever asked me to anything before in my life, so this was new. It was always Katie or Noelle or Melina or even Maddy, never me or Hope. But I turned back to him and met his eyes. I finally decided and said in my most regal voice that I make; \"I would be delighted to attend with you.\" He grinned and slowly brought his lips to mine, smiling the whole time. \"Ew, really next to me, great way to wake up,\" Hope groaned. Kade jumped over the back of the seat and dragged me along with him. He definitetly had something on his mind. What was it? I can only guess. He leaned back, making my head rest against the farthest back corner of the helicopter. \"Kade,\" I mumbled, while he was still kissing me, forcing his body onto mine. \"We-we can't do it hear, to many witnesses.\" He pulled away, realization in his eyes, but he grinned when he realized something; \"But they can't hear the noise we make.\" Heat ran up my cheeks as I knew what he meant. But I resisted his temptations towards me. \"Please. Not here.\" I moved away from and climbed back over my seat and restrapped myself in, but this time, I was sitting in the middle, next to Hope who was on my right and Kade, who had crawled back over the seat and now was sitting on my left. And Dylan to my farthest right. I hadn't realized that Katie and texted back and Hope was using my phone. Hope turned to me. \"A dance huh? I doubt Jace'll ask me.\"[Chapter 26] Chapter Twenty-Six: Hopes Pov We finally, after a long grueling flight, it was only lucky that Xavier went to flight school, we landed in California, and yes it was a long time since we lived here. We had to relocate because my mom had a hit on her from a different assasins company, not Emilys dads though. It's just lucky that the person who had to kill her, got killed himself. It's kind of ironic. \"Where should we go?\" Dylan asked. \"Well ... \" I started. \"Since there is a dance, I'm assuming we should ... get the proper attire.\" I winked at Emily and she instantly knew what I meant. \"You mean we should ... rob a clothing store?\" Jace asked. \"Dude, we'll get to see girls in possible short show-off-your-boobs dresses. Yes that's exactly what they mean,\" Kade said, giving Emily a sideways glance. I sneered at Kade but I grinned at the way Jace blushed. \"Meet back here in, this spot, in ... lets say ... three and half hours,\" Xavier smiled. We all agreed. \"Ready,\" I said. \"Steady,\" Emily grinned. \"Go!\" Dylan sneered. We girls raced to the nearest Papaya, Hot Topic and Forever21, which were conviently placed almost exactly across from each other, that and Payless. We had had no idea where the guys went only that they went away from us. \"First we should call them and get everyone sizes shouldn't we?\" Dylan asked finally as we strolled around Papaya. They're weren't many dresses in there, mostly shirts and shorts, we grabbed a couple of those and shoved them in a bag. Something growled behind us and we jerked around. Several zombies slowly made their way over towards us. We were all injected with the vaccines, but we all tensed, standing still, frozen in place. The zombie approached us and we held our hands behind our backs, crossing our fingers. I closed my eyes, gritting my teeth and and holding my breath. A moment passed and I opened my eyes, the zombies was walking slowly out of the store. It hadn't even noticed us, not even glance our way. We let out a sigh of relief, glad to see that they had moved on. Emily whipped out her cell and punched in Katie's number. \"Emy? Where are you?\" she gasped once she saw the surroundings. \"Papaya! What-Why are you Papaya?\" \"To get dresses for the party. Go ask everyone that we know, what their sizes are,\" Emily said, once Katie shut up. Katie hesitated but she nodded and walked around, gathering the girls into one room. \"I'll text you sizes. Bye.\" And then the line went dead. \"Bitch,\" was all we said. \"So ... \" I said, turning to Dylan. \"Any girl you have your eyes on?\" She seemed flushed for a second. She sighed heavily and warily. \"Candy. She's pretty.\" Emily smiled a little. She sat down in the middle of the room. I didn't have to glance at her to know she was crying. Dylan and I exchanged glances. But suddenly I couldn't see through my eyes anymore and I shuddered into a kneel. Dylan sat in the middle of us and sobbed as well. We cried until our heart ached with the loss of people we barely knew or people who had affected our lives. Cried until our heads ached from the lack of water. Cried until we couldn't cry anymore. Emily was the first to get up and help us to our feet. She wiped the tears from our faces and smiled. \"I love you guys.\" She met our gazes with full confidence. She sniffled but her smile remained. You could hear her phone vibrate and we all jumped to the new sound. \"Okay.\" Emily said, her voice still a little shaky. She showed us the sizes. \"Oh god, Candy. Katie that Candy is lesbian. Okay... who told Katie that I was lesbian?\" Dylan eyed us skeptically. Emily raised her hand shyly and blushed. \"I just knew that Candy was lesbian. That's all.\" Dylan blushed, not looking hurt or mad at all. I broke the awkward silence and said. \"Shouldn't we just grab random amounts of dresses and take them with us? Ditto with shoes?\" They looked at me. \"We're so stupid!\" Dylan gasped. \"You're such a genius Hope!\" She playfully punched my shoulder and started shuffling through the clothing. I grumbled and joined them. \"Oh! Oh!\" Emily jumped for joy as she read something from her phone. \"What?\" I asked. \"Niall and Harry are officially dating! Omf!\" she cheered, showing me the text. \"It happened last night when they were caught \"snogging\" in the corner!\" she squealed and then took a few clensing breaths and calmed down. We left the store with three bags, surprisingly enough. We walked into Forever21 and took as many dresses there. \"Who do you think will ask you?\" I asked out loud. \"I don't know,\" Dylan shrugged her shoulders. \"I'm thinking of asking Candy though.\" Emily and I exchanged glances. \"Good.\" \"Hey!\" someone shouted. \"What're you doing here?!\" I turned gasping at a survivor. \"Who are you? We came from a mission from the military. How have you surivived?!\" I snapped. \"Joey. Joey Castro. I survived by locking myself in the workers lounge. We had weeks of food supplies. My four year old sister is with me. Hanna come here.\" A shy looking girl came from behind him. She was a blonde haired girl with green eyes, freckles scattered all over her body and a pink tutu-dress on. She looked a lot like her older brother. Hanna walked over to us, looking me square in the eyes. \"If you're weally fwom da militawy then you will save us from dis bad pwace.\" \"Come with us,\" Dylan said firmly. \"We need some more supplies and then we have to wait for the copter. In the mean time, we have to inject you with a disguise. It won't kill you. Only protect you.\" The girl looked in my eyes and I saw hope. She smiled showing me a front-toothless-grin. She giggled quietly and took my hand. \"Thank you for coming to our wescue.\"[Chapter 27] Chapter Twenty-Seven: Emilys Pov This new addition to our group wasn't as bad as we thought. He was silent most of the time, but she was giggling and smiling with Hope and Dylan as we rummaged through the different dress and shoe stores. \"Do you have any guys that came with you?\" Joey asked me when his sister and the rest were farther away. \"Yeah. They're getting men suits and stuff,\" I replied. \"Once we were finished we were supposed to call my little sister and then send up flares.\" \"Shouldn't we find any survivors?\" he asked me, anger flaring in his eyes, but he kept his tone calm. \"Huh, I guess we should then.\" I turned to Dylan and Hope. \"I'm going to go take him to go search for anymore people.\" Hope nodded and handed me a gun and a few knives. They nodded us off and we went on our way. \"So ... who are you guys?\" Joey asked once we were out of earshot. \"Oh. I'm Emily. The blonde is Dylan and Hope is the black haired girl.\" I glanced up at him and saw that there was sadness. He nodded solemnly as if he was trying to wrap his mind around it. As we walked into a JCPenny we walked around the store looking in rooms only running into no one. We grabbed a couple more items, shoes and jewlery. As we exited and walked out into the courtyard we heard a faint \"help!\" We glanced at each other and we began to run to the sound of the voice. \"Carly?!\" Joey called. \"Joey! Hurry!\" the voice called again. \"Who's Carly?\" I asked. \"My sister. We're twins. Please we need to help her!\" he was faster then I was and he dragged me to another shop. It was a Red Robins. \"Joey. Joey. Joey!\" she rushed. \"Hurry! They're almost here!\" We burst into the dining room and saw her huddled in the almost-completely-closed freezer. She glared at me until she found her brother. He realized he didn't have any weapons. \"You good with a gun?\" I asked. He nodded, shrugging his shoulders slightly. I threw him the gun and turned back to the zombies, closing the space between them and Carly. I took the knives from my belt and tossed one of them, hit the nearest one to her in the back of her head. I threw the last of the of knives hitting the rest in the neck or on the head. \"Joey!\" she ran out of the freezer and embraced his brother in a bear hug, nearly knocking him back and off of his feet. \"Carly. I'm so glad you're okay!\" he paused. \"What're you doing here anyway?\" \"I-I came to get you and g-go back to our house. Where's Hanna?!\" she asked. Joey wasn't lying when he said Carly looked like him. He was tall, dirty blonde, blue eyes and splashed freckles. Carly was tall, strawberry blonde, hazel eyes and a lesser amount of freckles. \"Who's she?\" she snapped, turning to me as if she just noticed me. \"Emily. She saved Hanna and me. Give her the shot.\" He restrained Carly, pulling her arms behind her back. \"What are you -\" I took out the syringe and stuck it in her arm. She groaned with the pain and Joey had to hold her up to keep her from falling on the new pile of zombies. \"How-how-how come they didn't notice you when you-you-you walked in?\" she asked, stuttering over a few words, still clearly shaken. \"And what was that?\" \"They didn't notice cos we're sick. They somehow sense that we're sick so they pay no mind to us. I don't know how it works. I stuck in an illness that isn't to fatal but is enough to hide you from the zombies. It should work in about fifteen minutes or so...\" was all I said. I tried to rush through it so we could get out of there quicker. She smiled her thanks. \"Let me show you to where the guys after we're done searching the stores. And I'll introduce to the rest when we boared the 'copter.\" They nodded and we left the restuarant. We entered an abandoned movie theatre, we grabbed snacks and drinks shoving them into the popcorn bowls and grabbing some of the carts that had somehow made there way to movie theatre. I heared a moan, a moan as if someone was in pain. \"Helllppppp.\" I hurried around the small building busting into theatre s. Under a seat was a little boy. \"Oh my...\" I gasped, covering my mouth. This boy looked exactly like Cameron. Our Cameron that had died of cancer a few years back. Tears threatened to spill over my eyes as memories flooded back into my head. I didn't have to time relive them because the boy cried again. \"Oh my god, sorry.\" I knelt down by him and looked at him. His leg was trapped under the seat and wedged between the two. \"How-how did you know we were here?\" I asked, squeezing his leg out of between the seats. He groaned again and grit his teeth. \"You're really loud.\" I grinned a little. I was surprised by how calm he was and how mature he'd been when I questioned him. His name is Cameron. Ironic. He was six today. His Mom was a Naval Officer and his dad had taken him to the movies. His dad hid him cos he led all of the zombies out of the movie theatre. He'd been here, living off of the food that he could reach on the ground. His brother was no where to be found. \"What's your brothers name?\" I asked after a few minutes. \"Isaiah Daniel. He came with us too. He left wiff my daddy.\" The little boy was wrapped in my arms holding onto my sleeves of the long shirt that Kade had given me. \"Look who we found!\" Carly called, waving us over. \"Isaiah!\" Cameron screamed. \"Broder!\" Isaiah glanced up and smiled. \"Cameron!\" Cameron wriggled in my arms and turned his head to see his brother. \"Where'd you go?\" Cameron demanded. \"I had to hide. Dad was ... gone. He left us. I never came back to find you cos I thought you were dead.\" He paused. \"Happy Birthday Bro!\" I gave Cameron to his brother and fought to told back the tears. Cameron winced as he shifted his position in his brothers arms and started crying along with his brother. \"Thank you.\" Isaiah embraced me in a hug and pulled away, smiling through his tears. \"You're welcome. Oh and before we go we have to give you something.\" I pulled my two more syringes out of my pocket and explained to them how this would help and protect us. I poked it and pushed it into their skin until the two were empty. I quickly threw them away and sighed. \"It should start to work in about fifteen so we need to be careful with you too.\" With Cameron in Isaiah's arms, we checked through a last shop. An Old Navy. We grabbed jeans and shoes, some hats, for those of us who like to keep our hair under lock, aka, Hope. When we went to leave and were standing in the doorway, when an arrow wized past Cameron and Isaiah. \"Back inside!\" I snapped. They rushed back inside, Carly and Joey hesitating before running back inside. I stepped out into the open and glanced at the roofs of the many buildings. \"Come out bitch!\" I snapped. A shy frail girl stepped out into the open holding a cross bow in her hands. I grimaced when I recognized who it was. \"Emily!\" she gasped out before I could respond. \"Yeah. You're Zoe right?\" I asked, before she could get another arrow into her weapon. A boy walked up behind her, holding a gun with a silencer. \"Zoe,\" he took her hand and kissed her cheek. \"Who is that?\" Zoe turned to him, flushed face and no expression. \"Don't you remember?\" she asked. \"Remember alllooonngggg time ago those two girls that we used to hang out with. She used to talk about all of these girls and two main ones came over. Their best friends. You always got in fights with both of them because you liked them. Then suddenly they vanished.\" Her voice hardened and her eyes became scary. \"They left us and we had to forget about them. Don't you remember? Landon, please say you remember.\" Landon. That's his name. He was a tall fully freckled, black hair, brown eyes and very pale skinned boy, from here you could tell he had major piercings. Zoe, was a beautiful mocoa colored girl with deep brown eyes, the biggest smile, long luscious brown hair and three or four earrings. Landon's eyes were now on me as he struggled to remember me. He finally grinned sadly. \"Emily?\" I had to restrain a sigh but I nodded. They hopped down off the roof, one after another. \"How'd you remember me?\" I asked Zoe. She simply smiled. \"The day that we had to go get our memory erased, I never went. They didn't even check too, so you stayed in my head. I forgive you by the way.\" \"Look out!\" Carly called. Zombies shot out of the store and ran straight for Zoe and Landon. Zoe got out her weapons and shot, but, Landon was over run and pushed against the wall. \"Help!\" he called, brown eyes filled with terror. Zoe raced over to Landon, shooting down three zombies, but there still were too many. He shot down a few more and was almost out of the way when more zombies shot out different buildings. I grabbed Zoes hand and yanked her into another room, shutting the door behind her. \"Landon!\" she called. I turned back to him and went to grab his wrist when the zombies bit his arm. He screamed rolling his head back. His eyes shifted color and his skin paled. He opened his mouth to snarl at me but his face contorted into confusion. He sniffed the air, then sniffed behind me, I stood frozen. He smelled Zoe. I raced back to the door that I locked her in, grabbing a syringe out of my pocket and swung it open and closed. \"Help me ... baracade ... the door!\" I demanded at the group. They nodded immediatly and started planting things in front of the door. I walked away from the door and walked to Zoe. I hugged her for a moment then I took the syringe and jammed it into her upper arm. She winced, taking in a sharp breath of air. \"Now,\" I said. \"We have to wait fifteen minutes before we can make our great escape.\"[Chapter 28] Chapter Twenty-Eight: Zoe (flashback) I sat down on the couch, switching the tv, trying hard to fight back tears. My family was forced to forget my many best friends. A tear escaped down my cheek and I had to grit my teeth to fight them back. The only reason why I didn't go was because I faked being sick. My parents drove together to their agency to get their brain washed. Yes I know that they were all assasins. I only knew cos Katie told me when I was younger. She trusted me enough to tell me. It was kind of like Wizards of Waverly Place where Harper knows that Alex and Justin and Max are wizards and she's not allowed to tell anyone else. I was Harper and they were Alex and Justin and Max. I chuckled, almost amused by that analogy. They would never be able to remember them and I couldn't remind them. I could get in trouble. So much trouble that I could get killed just for it. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. I sat silently for a few moments, lost in my thoughts of how they left. Apperantly, another company, a third one, had a hit on Melina and they immediatly had to move, getting anyone out of danger out of way. I grumbled. Why had they left me? How come they didn't trust me. I heard a knock at my door and I groaned. I grunted to stand up and walked to the door, wiping away the last of the tears. \"Who is it?\" I called. \"Landon!\" He paused. \"Can I come in?\" I sighed quietly. Landon was like an annoying older brother, slight stuble and at the time only two piercings. I opened the door and let him in, planting myself back on the couch. \"So ... what're you doing here?\" I asked, trying to sound nonchalant. \"I-I wanted to ask you uh something.\" He nervously rubbed the bak of his head. He grinned sheepishly at me and took a few deep breaths. \"Uh. Would you like to uh ... gooutwithme.\" It came out in a jumble. I was actually taken aback by his words and I had trouble finding an answer. The reason why he must be asking me was because of the brain wash. So I just took a deep breath and nodded. \"When would you like to go?\" I'd asked him. \"Uh how about tomorrow. Three pm, we'll see a movie or something.\" I nodded again biting back tears. That single memory brought it's way to the front of my head and tears it brought with it, threatened to spill. I didn't even like Landon. At least not that way. I'd been going out with him for about a year and a half and I was trying to break up with him, but I never could find the courage to. And now, because of me, he was a zombie. A single tear rolled down my cheek and I had to bit my lip to keep from sobbing. \"Are you okay?\" Emily asked me, question in her gaze. \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" I embracd her in a hug again and sobbed silently into her shoulder. \"Should we go now?\" Carly asked, tugging on Emily's shoulder to pull her away. \"Yeah. But Zoe's not quite done, so we need to be careful around her.\" She took my hand and told me to put an arrow in my crossbow. We exited. Time seemed to slow down and worry crept into my body. Zombies big and small raced past us, ignoring the small group that was calmly walking in the opposite direciton. Finally, after ten gruelling minutes we found the other small group, pages in hand, flares in their grips. No one seemed to have noticed me and I was glad for that. \"You ready?\" the girl Katie asked us. Emily turned to all of us, keeping her gaze on me the longest. \"Yeah, we're ready.\"[Chapter 29] Chapter Twenty-Nine: Hope Flying back wasn't comfortable. About fifteen people were cramped together in a single plane. An army plane, so it didn't have any seats whatsoever. We were all cramped into the backpart, guys on one side, girls on the other. Hanna being the exception, being able to walk around and talk to people. As long as she was careful. Emily was in her corner, crying with Dylan and Zoe, Dylan was only crying because Emily was crying. I wanted to join them but Carly and Joey were being normal brother and sister and annoying each other as best as they could, so I was stuck with baby sitter duty. Jace and Xavier were fast asleep and Kade was trying to get some sleep. Cameron and Isaiah were playing what they could of iSpy. I watched intently as the different groups entered their own little world and seemed to have vanished from reality. Exaushtion crept into my eyes and threatened to make me close them. And I did. When I woke up, someone was shaking me. Hanna. \"Wake up. Wake up, we landed. Wake up! C'mon pretty girl wake up!\" Hanna was desperately, trying to get me to move. I sat up and realized that that was the best sleep I had in a while. No dreams, just relaxation. I smiled. \"C'mon! Hope we landed on the ship! People want to see you!\" Hanna was tugging me up. Someone wanted to see me? I slowly made me way off the plane and stepped shakily out onto the ship. Almost immediately, I was embraced in a round of hugs. First my only brother, Jason. His eyes were red and puffy and he had a huge smile on his face. \"Hope! I missed you so much. I love you. I'm so glad you're home. I will still be your one and only Bubba!\" Jason was sobbing into my shoulder. Skylar and Melanie and Kenny, my adopted uncle, were next, burrying their faces into my stomach. Then Kayla and Deedee and John, my other adopted uncle. When they pulled away, tear stains were streaked across my dark shirt. My mom was next, same with my Dad and step-mom. I stood there for a long time, embraced in a sob filled hug. Then my grandparents. When I broke away, I could see that Emily and Katie were embracing their parents in a hug. And when I looked closer, I could see that Candy and Dylan were included. An angry cat was sitting like a parrot on their dads shoulder. Bella. That was the best. Families reunited with everyone. People drank. Cheered. Danced. All in all, they partied... and hard for some people. By the time night came, everyone was too tired to stay up past nine. So once we injected everyone with an illness and we set our destination for the nearest, slightly secluded, island or land mass. Jamaica. That's where we're headed. The party, though, would be on the boat. Or at least I'm thinking. As I sit here with Jace by my side, we talk about our adventures, standing on a tall stage, telling small kids, teenagers and adults alike of our struggles. We went into detail. Well, detail that wasn't that horrific. It seemed to play out like book. Chapter after chapter of the struggles we had to go through. It seemed to play out like a movie, that streamed from our mouths. It entranced everyone entirely. The story was even told from Zoe's point of view. Even Joey, Hanna and Carly. Isiah and Cameron's. Everyone was fascinated. Question's were asked. Answers were given. By this time, it was late, probably ten oclock. Jace and I were walking together along the edges of the boat. The boat was waving back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Rocking like a babies crib trying to get it to sleep. Coaxing it to close its eyes. We weren't saying anything just holding hands and walking. \"Hope?\" he said after a while. \"What?\" I asked, turning to face him. \"W-Will you got to the uh\"-gulp-\"dance with me?\" His eyes twinkled in the light. His blue eyes bore into mine as they pleaded for my answer. Of course I had to say yes. I didn't want to go with anyone else. Even if he/she was realllyyyy hot! \"Duh!\" Our lips locked onto each others. He titled me back, using his arms for support. One hand on my waist, the other on the back of my neck. Footsteps approached and we abruptly pulled away. Two figures emerged from around the corner. Two females. Both holding hands. We stood still for a moment. It hadn't seemed like they'd seen us. \"Candy?\" a girl said, turning to the to the other. \"Hm?\" Candy replied. It must've been Candy and Dylan. \"I know...this is kind of... cliche. The scenery I mean. But...\" she took a few breaths to calm herself down. \"Will you go to the dance with me?\" You could hear Candy inhale sharply from where we stood. She didn't answer. Instead she looked at her feet. Oh please say yes! Please! I ship you! I screamed into my head. \"Yes.\" Candy looked up again. \"Yes Dylan, I will.\" The two shadows combined into one. \"Aw...\" I mumbled. \"Ew.\" Jace turned away to look at me. I slapped him playfully. The two figures walked towards us, closer and closer. \"Hope?\" Dylan called out. \"Did you just see that?\" \"Yeah and-\" \"And I wish I didn't see that,\" Jace interuppted. \"Don't be a little fuck okay?\" I snapped. \"Yeah I saw it. It was cute.\" Jace grumpled, hitting me back. \"Oh,\" Candy said. \"I guess we'll see you later then.\" \"No,\" I said. \"We'll see you. You two will be wrapped up in each other.\" Pink rose to Candy's cheeks and amusement shot through Dylan's eyes. \"Oh,\" Dylan sneered. \"We know.\" Candy waved good-bye as Dylan pulled her away, towards the cabins. My eyebrow was raised when they turned the corner and out of sight. Jace glanced at me, his eyebrows raised. \"What?\" I laughed. \"It's cute!\" He chuckled, swinging his hand forward to take mine. \"C'mon,\" he whispered into my ear. \"We have to get going anyway.\" \"What for?\" I looked up at him. \"Don't we have to go to bed?\" I blushed. \"Yeah. Don't try anything other wise I'll stab you...with a spoon...that's plastic...and rusty.\" He looked at my puzzled. \"How on earth does plastic get rusty?\" \"I make it...\" His chuckled flitted around us as we walked towards the cabins.[Chapter 30] Chapter Thirty: Jace A week flew by fast and we were busy getting everyone settled in Jamaica. Yes we had to kill a few zombies. More like a hundred few zombies. It wasn't a perfect fit but we made it work. It was like being cramped in a sports arena with a bunch of sweaty and icky people. People had to share houses or apartments. They had to get new jobs. Schools. Construction. Our presidant was killed so in a few months to a year we would elect a new one. One that would get everyone back on track in the world. At the moment, everyone was getting ready for the dance. Mostly the teenagers though. Busy getting themselves ready for the big event tonight. I was dreading this though. Not because I was going with Hope, I was nervous because over the past few days of wondering aimlessly around the boat, I noticed my ex-boyfriend was on the ship. Ryan. Ryan Cline. He was the first guy I ever kissed. I lost it to him. He was tall, dark tan skin, brown hair, some acne and bright blue eyes. It gave him a surfer dude look. I was scared for what he'd do at the dance. Seeing me with a girl. I sighed. The girls were no where to be seen. I think that Emily and Hope had pulled them away to get ready for tonight, avoiding any labor that had to do. Lazy. Kade, One Direction, Joey and I were stuck with moving the bricks from a destroyed temple on top of a hill and moving it to a truck. \"Woo!\" someone called. A female. \"Work those muscles Josh!\" another female called. Cheering floated down the hill and danced around us. We glanced up, wiping the sweat off our foreheads. \"Woo Kade! Lookin' mighty finneee!\" a girl drawled. And there they were. Sitting together in a military truck in, what they could use, bathing suits. I grinned and when I glanced at the rest, they had a sneer or a hungry grin plastered on their faces. \"What are you doing?\" Liam called. Katie stood up. \"Getting ready to go swimming!\" She danced in her spot, jiggling her chest slightly. \"Where's the nearest beach?\" Zayn asked. \"Cos we're totally in.\" Josh smiled at Melina. Kade was standing there quietly, breathing deeply. Is this what being straight was like? Drooling over a pretty girl, hoping to get lucky? It felt...great though. Hope was sitting there, watching me, grinning like a maniac. Normal. \"When can we go?\" I asked, grinning back at her. \"Soon,\" she replied. \"But for now...\" Maddy smiled. \"We wanna watch you work!\" Emily finished. Zoe, Dylan and Candy kind of sat there awkwardly. Joey too. Wondering what they should do. \"We'll meet you down there,\" Zoe smiled kindly. \"I'm taking Candy and Dylan and claiming our spot.\" Us guys nodded. No problem. The tires squealed as they pulled away from us, cheering like idiots the whole way. Man...girls. Kade still hadn't said anything and neither had Joey. \"What's up with you two?\" Niall asked. \"Nothin,\" Kade said casually. \"Yeah...nothing,\" Joey sighed. I shrugged my shoulders, brushing it off and got back to work. Ten or so minutes later the girls were back, watching from the truck, leaning over the hood of the car. \"Oooh Jace no wonder Hope likes you!\" Emily called. Heat rose to my cheeks and I coughed to hide my laughing. Hope punched her in the arm and laughed. Kade socked me in the shoulder and I rubbed it, stifling a wince. \"Oh don't be such baby.\" Kade laughed and stalked off to gather more bricks. Katie and Maddy got up from where they sat and stalked over to Liam and Zayn, giggling when they got there. \"What are they doing...?\" Hope murmered. Nothing. They just wanted to give them a hug and say thank you. I don't know what for just... thank you. \"You done yet?\" Melina whined, shuffling around on the hood. \"We still got like twenty or so bricks to go! Does it look like we're done?\" I snapped. She glared at me. \"Maybe we can help?\" Emily got up off the truck walking towards the pile of bricks. \"You're going to help with the bricks?\" Kade asked. She turned to him, stepping into his personal space. \"Yeah. Duh.\" She threw it up in the air, watching for a second as it hovered above her head. As it started it's decend she flipped over. The brick hit the ball of her foot and she sent it flying to the back of the pick up truck. Joey looked at her, shock running across his face. \"What?\" she laughed. \"I am an assassin. Duh.\" She scoffed and picked up another brick, chucking it this time. \"Dude, we never saw this while were out there!\" Kade laughed. \"Uh, I did fucking like jump from tree to tree like, I don't know, a fucking ninja!\" I laughed at the remark as she flung another one into the car. \"You going to help or just sit/stand around like a bunch of pussies?\" she sneered. I grumbled picking one up and walking it down to the car. Something zipped past my ear and landed on the pile just before I set mine down. I turned. Hope stood there looking innocent and trying not to laugh. After setting it down, I raced up the hill and tackled her to the ground. I kissed her to keep her from screaming and laughing as I tickled her. She soon ran out of energy and was panting under my tough body, trying to gain her breath back. I pulled away. \"You done?\" she panted. \"You done tryna get me killed?\" I asked, smiling as I stood up. \"Nope.\" She jumped up and rocked back and forth on the balls of her feet. She raced back to the car, my hand in hers. Everyone joined within a moment and we all headed towards the beach.[Chapter 31] Chapter Thirty-One: Emily It was night. Fourty-five minutes until the dance. Us girls were doing the last bit of our makeup that best matched our dresses. I was wearing a dark blue dress with gold trim on the torso, a zipper down the front, dark blue lace didn't dare touch the silk so it wavered around it and fell slightly longer than the silk, that went down to around my knees, boots hugged my feet and framed them. My hair was down and it fell loosely around my shoulders and to my mid back. The dress itself had a breast support so I didn't have to wear a bra or cups for that matter. A necklace hung just above my breasts. Something I stole that I thought was pretty. A silver chain with a heart at the end. Hope was wearing a ruby red strapless dress with a gold belt just under her breasts, it went to her ankles and flitted around them, she had on gold flats with a small bow on them, her hair was straightened so it was long and flawless, a black bracelet clipped to her wrist and stayed there, a gray beanie was flat on her head. She too didn't have to wear a bra or cups. Zoe had on a light blue strapless dress that had a darker blue pattern on it, it came from the right side of her breasts like vines that extended down to her legs and on the edges of the vines were sparkly blue flowers, her brown hair traveled down to her mid back, dark blue flats hid her feet from view. A necklace hung around her neck. A gold chain with a half heart that had the word \"forever\" printed across it. Candy had on a strapless light pink dress, it had a pattern on the torso but nothing on the silky dress. It looked like mine except pink. It had a flower around the waist it was large and bulky but it worked with the small and short dress. Candys green eyes were hidden under some dark makeup, but the way she put it on, made her eyes pop! Her strawberry blonde hair was in a french braid going down the left side of her head. Gladiator-type sandals sat on her feet, dark pink, almost matching her strawberry blonde hair. Dylan had a long green dress that went down to her feet and when she walked she kicked it up. But it was at the perfect length that she didn't step on it or tear it. In the middle of small breasts was a silver design that helped them stay up. Her blonde fell around her shoulders and frizzed in the heat, but it looked pretty. Black sandals were strapped to her feet. Carly had a single strap dress that hung over her left shoulder, it was black for the torso and it went high-to-low from the left-to-right, it was blue. Black boots hid most of her legs and feet. Her strawyberry blonde hair was in a loose ponytail and a rose clip was in her hair. Three or so earrings clipped to her ears, a bracelet clung to her wrists, a necklace clipped around her neck and went to her stomach. My sister had a vibrant pink high-low dress that was, as like most of the dresses, strapless. It had a sparkly silver/gold around the waist that supported her small chest. Gold flats complimented her skin tone perfectly. Her brown hair was in a french-braided bun put together by a single clip and a beanie wrapped up and held her hair down. Her earrings were a gold to go with her shoes and her studs were pink. Maddy wore a coral pink, frilly high-low dress that was, of course, strapless. The dress had to two silver belts, one right under her chest and the other just above her waist. Her shoes were a black high heel with silver flecks. An anklet clipped to her ankle. Gold. Three bracelets clipped to her wrists, jingling as she moved. Melina wore a vibrant purple dress that was strapless. The breast area was a sparkly purple that looked like purple diamonds, a bow wrapped around her waist, out of the middle of the bow was a darker violet and raced just passed the edge of the dress. The dress itself finished just above her knees and floated and finished there. Noelle was in an a light orange dress that had one sleeved that went over her right shoulder. The chest had white pok-a-dots across it. The sleeve had a white band on the top and on the bottom, across the waist. It was sort of a like a high-low dress but now quite. It was a flowy dress that flitted around her calf. White flats only exposed the tops of her feet. And that was our band of little miss fits. The military car that we had to drive in to get to the arena sort of ruined the whole \"regal\" kind of look. The arena itself was huge. Basically, it was a large courtyard with makeshift walls. In the about seven days we had they built an almost circumference of a football arena. It was huge. The main headquarters for the general and the new President was on the far east side. A large area was set up as the dancing area for the different couples and teens. A smaller area, but still pretty big, was the kid area, complete with slip-n'-slides, jumpy houses and other jumping, sliding or water related carnival games or slides. The adults had to report to the back. Either chaparoning, looking out for the younger kids or going to report to the general to help. Even on a night like this everyone was stressed. A sigh was released from my mouth as we pulled up and guided out. The guys were in another truck, following closely behind us. Hope and I waited impatiently to Jace and Kade to emerge from the car. Jace did, but not yet Kade. Confusion brushed across my face. Jace must have read my emotion because he said, \"Kade was late to the truck so he has to walk here\"-sigh-\"He should be here any moment.\" My hand found it's way towards my forehead as I facepalmed. \"I can stay here with you, while you wait for -\" Hope began. \"No.\" I cut her off. \"Go on. I can wait for him myself. I'm a big girl now.\" I paused. \"Did I just quote that band-aid commercial?\" Hope and Jace shared a glance then broke into laughter. A grin spread across my face as I thought about it. I did shove them ahead of me, watching as the continued to laugh, then disappeared into the ginormous line that was starting to build up. It was a line for multiple things, carnival tickets, food and just to get in. I was standing there for maybe ten more minutes until someone grabbed my waist, hauled me over their shoulder and carried me to the line. Immediately, on reflex, I launched myself over their shoulders and landed on my feet and got down into the splits and knocked my \"attacker\"s feet out from under them. When he let out an \"oompf\" I got to my feet and started saying. \"Kade! I'm sorry! I thought it was someone else!\" The guy below me was smiling, staring up at me as I gripped his forearm and pulled to a sitting position. He chuckled. \"Even in a dress, you still can seriously hurt someone.\" My eyes went wide. \"D-Did I hurt you?\" He laughed now. \"No. I'm saying\"-sigh-\"nevermind.\" I glared up at him. \"Fuck you, ya know that right?\" His eyes twinkled at the thought and I slapped him on the arm. His hand found mine and our fingers interlocked. A blush spread across my face as we joined the rest of the small community in the line to get into the arena. \"You ready?\" Kade whispered into my ear. One look at him and I knew what he had planned tonight. I didn't know if I wanted to. Didn't if I'd allow him. But eventually I smiled up at him and nodded.[Chapter 32] Chapter Thirty-Two: Hope Jace and I stayed by the entrancing, waiting patiently for Emily and Kade to come in. I wanted to make sure that Kade didn't bail on her. He didn't. Eventually, Jace lured me to the dance floor, which was actually grass, not a floor. But whatever... We talked. Most of the time. We swayed and jerked and twisted to the beat, bumping into each other eventually but laughing it off and continuing. The songs began turning slower and slower and we both glanced at each other awkwardly. \"C'mere.\" Jace pulled me into his arms. My head rested on his shoulders and his chin rested on mine. It seemed only days ago, which techinically it was, that we were complete strangers. Angry and bickering at each other, eventually realizing we sort of liked each other. He finally worked up the courage to ask me, but I also knew something was troubling him. So I decided to come out and ask him. \"What's bothering you Jace?\" He tensed, then sighed. \"My ex-boyfriend is here.\" He looked at me. \"And I'm worried he might ... try to hurt you.\" I grinned. \"I appreciate the thought but you do know I am a trained assasin.\" A grin popped on his face. \"I know but -\" He was interupted by a Carly and a guy I didn't know. Brown hair, deep tan skin, blue eyes, slight acne. A typical surfer. Jace tensed. I had a feeling this was his ex-boyfriend. \"Hey, Jace.\" the kid glanced at me and I inhaled sharply. \"This pretty thing your girlfriend?\" Jace blushed beet red. \"Y-Yes.\" Jace stuttering? What? Whoa. \"You gonna introduce us?\" I glanced up at Jace, urging him forward. He cleared his throat. \"Ryan meet Hope. Hope, Ryan.\" \"Whoa wait,\" I said. \"Ryan? Ryan Cline?\" He glanced my way again. \"Do I know you?\" I sighed mentally. \"Uh, sort of. We went to middle school together.\" \"Oh.\" was all he said. There was an awkward pause as no one spoke. Until I broke the silence again. \"So are you and Carly...together?\" He nodded, grinning down at Carly. \"Three years now.\" He kissed her deeply then said. \"Well, it was nice seeing you Jace. Hope you and your girlfriend...'hit it off'.\" He paused. \"Huh. I made a name pun. Bye!\" Jace turned to me and pulled me into a hug. \"Sorry you had to meet him.\" I blushed. \"It's fine Jace. Really. I've known him since-\" He broke me off with a kiss. A deep kiss that started out nice, sweet, innocent. Then it got hungrier and his hands started roaming my body. It felt weird. This being the first guy that has ever taken an honest interest in me. His hands found my chest and I pulled back. He blushed, glancing down at his feet. \"Sorry. I-I didn't mean to do anything stupid.\" I giggled. \"It's fine.\" He slight smile crossed his lips and he looked up at me. \"So...what now?\" I shrugged my shoulders. Involuntarily, my feet moved forward, closing the space between us. My lips re-met his and embraced each other, my arms around his neck, his around my waist. We swayed back and forth, back and forth to the beat. Our lips pushed together, showing and expressing our passion for one another. Two figures emerged. Kade and Emily. Drunk. Or at least a little tipsy. \"Uh, Emily I thought you didn't drink.\" I took her hand. \"I don't. Kade made me. Ugh. Peer pressure. I've only had one. I'm just acting like this, hoping to scare mom and dad.\" She stood up straight, sucking in air as she swayed. She grinned. \"Kades the one drunk.\" As if on cue, Kade turned to us and burped for a sweet welcome. Jace slapped his hand to his face. \"Why am I partially related to him?\" he mumbled. \"I'm taking him home, then possibly coming back, depends.\" She tugged on his hand and pulled him towards the exit. I shuddered. \"Ew, I hope she can take care of herself.\" Jace facepalmed again. \"I hope he doesn't act like Kade and falls asleep as soon as he's home.\" ","Summary":" Chapter One: Hopes Pov \"Guess what?!\" I screamed to best friend, Emily, over the phone. \"What?\""},{"Movie":"Prom Night","Title":"Strange and beautiful romance","Author":"dog-tooth","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5903483","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prologue She drove up to her house and parked her car on the road outside, noticing that her mother's car was already parked in the driveway. Before entering the house she took a mint from her purse and started munching on it, so that it would disguise the smell of alcohol that was on her breath. That seemed to be all she'd done in the past two weeks, drink. It distracted her, made her numb. When she opened the door to her house the first thing she noticed was how quiet it was. The television was on but there were none of the normal noises of chatting and people moving around. She walked in slowly, the alcohol having made her slightly tipsy and slightly incoherent. She was about to call out her mothers name but something stopped her. Whether it was the thought of being caught smelling of alcohol, or the feeling that was something was wrong she did not know, but either way doing this might have saved her life although she did not know this yet. She threw her jacket on the sofa and turned off the television which seemed too loud in the silence of the house. Slowly she looked around thinking that maybe they were out, but then she remembered that she had seen her mothers car, and she would not have been able to get anywhere without it. They lived too far out to be able to walk anywhere. Walking over to the stairs, she heard a sound from above. A loud crash followed the sound. She proceeded cautiously up the stairs feeling the first feelings of doubt settle in her stomach. First she went over to her little sisters bedroom, expecting her to be sitting on the floor and playing with her dolls like she usually did but she wasn't there. The light was on but there was nobody in. She then went to her bedroom deciding that maybe they had gone out in her mother's car in a rush, and that was why all the lights were on, but deep down she knew that this was not the case. Then she heard the crash again. She realised at this point that all of the sound was coming from her mother's bedroom. She heard a scream from within and took a quick step backwards just as the door came crashing open. The scream that was just about to come out of her mouth was stopped mid flow when she saw her mother being dragged out by a man in a baseball cap and dark clothing. He paused as he saw her and her mother looked up at her with frightened eyes. Her mother was covered in blood and Rae could tell that she was hurt by the way that she winced as he struggled with her. With a quick move of his fist he threw her to the side. She didn't get up again. Rae's breath was coming out in short gasps now. She wanted to see if her mother was alright but she could not move. She could not see the mans face as he walked towards her, as it was covered by shadow but then when he was almost in front of her he looked up and this time she managed a scream. She had to cover her mouth to hide the hysteria that was spreading through her. His face was twisted and contorted in a mixture of love and anger, but all the same she could still recognise him. It was Richard Newman.[Chapter 2] Richard The first time they met was in his art class and he knew that it was love at first sight. Her name was Rae Simone Delaney and she was seventeen years old. She had looked so fragile and dejected sitting there all by herself that he could not help but feel pity for the beautiful girl that was sitting in front of him. He was most amazed by her pale skin, so white that it almost looked transparent, and her bright green eyes. Her light blonde hair complimented her skin tone, but at the same time it made her seem even more pale and delicate. A sudden urge overcame him to reach out and touch her skin, to see if it was as smooth as it looked. He knew that it was forbidden; he wasn't stupid. She was a student and he was her teacher. He should have known better, but he could not help himself. During the first lesson that he had with her, he did not speak to her, instead choosing to watch her from a distance whilst helping other students. He noticed several things about her just by observing her. First that she was a very good artist. The drawing of a rose that she had completed was of a very high standard, and he could even go as far to say that she was the best in his class. Second was that she was very modest and shy. When one of her class mates complimented her on her drawing she simply blushed and mumbled thanks in reply. He also noticed that nobody bothered to start a conversation with her despite the fact that there were several people sitting on the same table as her. The final things that he noticed were the pale pink, almost unnoticeable scars that adorned her lower arm and wrist. Although she wore a grey long sleeved shirt, when she drew her sleeves would rise up slightly revealing the marks. To him it was a wonder why nobody else had noticed them, but looking around he started to think that maybe they had. The guy that was sitting opposite kept giving her little looks that made Richards teeth grind together. The guy was looking at her as if she was some kind of freak. He barely made it to the end of the class, without going over there and hurting him. It would not help if he got into a fight with one of his students on his first day at work. That night when he got home all he could think about was Rae. The way her eyes narrowed slightly as she concentrated on the art work before her. The way her hair fell in front of her face, almost as if it was a curtain hiding her from the rest of the world. He wanted to get behind that curtain. He wanted to find out who that shy, beautiful girl really was. He wanted her, and he would stop at nothing to get her. For him it was starting again and he was helpless to stop it.[Chapter 3] Rae They hated her at school, she knew it. Everyday that she came to school she started to notice it more and more. It had started with cupped hands and whispers whenever she walked down the corridor, but it had slowly changed into more. Now when she sat in lessons people would give her funny looks and stare at her arms. Once someone had even grabbed her and tried to pull up her sleeves so that they could see her marks. Needless to say she lashed out at that person, therefore getting herself into trouble which was rather unfair. However it did mean that she got the rest of the day off school so that she could go home and continue reading her books. However the situation at home was no better then at school. In fact it sometimes felt like it was worse. She lived with her mother, father and her little sister Louise. To the outside world they may seem to be a normal family, but they were in fact the complete opposite. Her father had depression whilst her mother was an alcoholic. However her father's depression was something that was linked with her mother's alcohol problems. Whenever her father had one of his 'bad days' her mother would usually start drinking, almost as if she was escaping from both of there problems. These days would always end in an argument between her parents, in which plates and glasses would be thrown and one of them always ended up hurt. Once her mother had even scarred her fathers hand when she had thrown a glass plate at him. When herself and Louise were younger, and these days came along, they used to hide upstairs together and play card games so that there parents wouldn't get angry at them. But that was then, and things had changed. Now that Louise was fourteen she had started going out with her friends as a way of escaping home life. It wasn't so easy for Rae. Rae found it difficult to find friends, especially after the 'incident' as it was so commonly called. This meant that she was usually at home when her parents argued, which also meant that she received the brunt of there anger. They had never gotten violent towards her, but they verbally abused her, and she often had to watch whilst they threw things at each other in front of her. The books that she read at home were the only release that she got from the arguments and her life in general. She also enjoyed drawing, although she did not rate her skills very high. And that was what she was doing now, drawing that is, although unfortunately it was in school and she was surrounded by the bunch of morons who were also known as her class mates. I've decided that this is all I'm going to write until I get at least one review as I don't see the point in continuing if nobodies reading :) If people like it then just post a review and I'll happily continue. x[Chapter 4] This chapter is dedicated to 'Bianca Mora,' 'stillstanding13' and 'Nekomimi XD.' Thanks for reviewing! The next chapter should be up later on. Peace o/ Rae The rose that she was drawing looked bland and lifeless, so she picked up the red watercolour pencil and tried to make it look more realistic. Art was the only lesson that she enjoyed because it was a time when she could absorb herself in her work and finally relax. However today they had found out that there old teacher Mr Farrow had resigned after finding out that his wife had cancer. Instead we had a new teacher, whose name was Mr Newman. She soon found out that Mr Newman was quite a strange man. Throughout the lesson she found his eyes seemed to be constantly flitting back to her, and although it crept her out she ignored it, choosing instead to concentrate on her work. It wasn't that Mr Newman was ugly in anyway. In fact he was extremely good looking. He had dark brown hair which was pulled up into a small ponytail. She guessed that it would fall to his shoulders when loose. His face was angular and his eyes were warm brown. He was tanned and she could tell that he had muscle underneath his shirt. She, however, found it hard to guess his age. From a quick glance alone she would say that he could not have been more then twenty five, but as the lesson progressed and she looked at him more, she thought that perhaps he was older then that. After all he had lines on his face that no man under thirty would have. She realised that although he was looking at her a lot, she also seemed to be doing the same to him, so she started to block out the surrounding area, instead concentrating on her drawing of a rose even more then before. She soon became entranced in the rose she was working on, the rest of the sounds around here fading out into an unimportant buzz of meaningless. However after a few minutes she felt a sharp pain on her leg and she looked up, her senses coming back to her in a swirl of colour and sound. The sharp pain came again and she looked under the table to see that the guy sitting opposite her had just kicked her. She looked across at him and scowled, but he only smirked back at her. She did not many peoples names in her class, let alone this annoying idiots name in front of her. From past experiences she had learnt that learning people's names was pointless, as she would never get close enough to anybody to care. When he tried to kick her again she angled her chair so that instead of kicking her he kicked the chair leg instead. She smiled as he grunted in pain. A soft Irish voice sounded from in front of her. \"Is everything okay?\" She looked up sharply to see Mr Newman leaning over the desk in front of her. She was startled by his proximity and the way that he was looking so intently into her eyes. Up close she could see every line and crevice on his face. His jaw was so sharp. For some reason, in her minds eye she pictured him reaching out to touch her and she mentally recoiled. Pushing away from him slightly she finally managed to get her thoughts together to form a coherent reply. \"It's fine. He just accidentally kicked the table.\" He looked quickly at the jerk opposite her, but his eyes quickly switched back to her. His eyes were disbelieving and the way that they were staring at her made it seem as if he was trying to communicate something to her. She just couldn't work out what. She tried to smile at him, but she was sure that it turned out more like a grimace. However he left with a nod of his head, going to help someone else. Resisting the urge to sigh a sigh of relief she picked up the red watercolour pastel and continued colouring in the petal of the rose, the voices of the other students fading back to an insignificant whisper. She only came 'back to earth' when she saw that everybody around her was packing up. The bell must have rung without her realising it. She swiftly picked up her art work and placed it in the cupboard along with everybody else's work. Mr Newman was walking around and picking up peoples watercolour pencils, so she left them on her table and walked towards the door. At the same time Mr Newman walked past her. She could have sworn that he moved closer to her, his fingers twitching, almost as if he wanted to reach out and touch her. She walked out of the art room that day feeling spooked and confused.[Chapter 5] Richard When Rae left the art room that day he already missed her. From that first meeting with her, he already imagined there future together. He knew that it was not right to be thinking like this, but the thoughts were so strong that he was hopeless to resist them. Maybe he was crazy or maybe he was just a man who fell in love easily. Either way he wanted her more then anything else. He did not go home straight after school that day, instead staying in the art room and admiring the work that she had left in the cupboard. He loved the fact that she had a talent for art. It made him feel like they had something in common. It was a good starting point for him. When he did eventually leave, he did not go straight home. Instead he drove around a bit, trying to collect his thoughts. He even attempted to forget about her by blasting some loud metal through the speakers, but even the angry lyrics of System of a down could not erase her from his memory. Some of the lyrics even reminded him of her, reminded him of things that he wanted to do to her. He closed his eyes briefly against the thoughts. Reaching his home, he was almost disappointed as he saw the same bland and lifeless house that he had gotten so use to seeing. Even after fifteen years of living there he still felt no attachment to it. The walls were white and boring. He never had the time or the effort to paint them. Ivy grew up the side, and there were weeds in the small front garden His existence seemed petty, but he knew that she could change that for him. Once inside he reached towards the cabinet that had saved his life on many occasions. He poured out a big glass of vodka and lay down on the sofa. He did not turn on the television. He did not want to be distracted from his thoughts about the beautiful girl. The drink burned his throat, causing him to sigh in pleasure. The swirling mass of thoughts in his head gradually started to settle down as he drank glass after glass of vodka. The alcohol always had a different effect on him, then to other people. It made him think better, instead of making him incoherent and drunk. The alcohol soothed his brain, making him relaxed. If someone was to look on his life from the outside world then they would assume and state that he was an alcoholic because of the amount of alcohol that he would consume. Sometimes he could get through half a bottle of vodka in one night. However he did not think of himself as an alcoholic. Despite the vast quantity of vodka and whisky that he would consume, he did not feel addicted. He could have easily given up, yet sometimes his thoughts would get so bad that the vodka was the only thing that he could cling to. It was the only thing that was real. It made the bad thoughts go away. Vodka was something that he had drunk from an early age. His father had often willingly given him a glass of two when he was in a good mood. However the good days were rare. His father had been a depressed alcoholic, and although Richard had promised that he would not end up like his father, he felt himself slipping ever closer. Not to the alcoholic part of his father, but to the depressed part. That was how he often referred to his father, in two parts. They were the only bits of him that he ever got to see. When he was depressed he would both lash out and hurt people around him or he would just sit in the corner and cry. When he had drunk alcohol he would be more happy, and would often talk to Richard or if he was lucky give him presents. Despite this, Richard preferred his dad when he was depressed. His father did not know him, so when he did attempt to talk to him he would often ramble on about things that happened in his life, instead of truly trying to understand his son. Richard hadn't realised how good alcohol could make you feel until he started drinking it regularly five years ago. He sighed again as the clear liquid slipped and burnt down his throat. All of a sudden a haziness and sleepiness overcame him, and he felt the glass slip from his fingers and fall to the carpet with a soft thud. His eyes slowly closed and sleep surrounded him.[Chapter 6] Sorry about the wait. I was busy with ... stuff. Haha. This chapter's quite short but I'm getting to a good bit! Hopefully the next couple of chapters will be up quicker. Thanks again for the reviews. X Rae Rae had had several art lessons that week, yet she still had not gotten use to Mr Newman. He was always staring at her, and his eyes were so intense that they made her feel awkward and uncomfortable. She was however good at blocking out people around her, which meant that she still enjoyed her art lessons. However things at school seemed to be getting harder and harder for her. A week after her first art lesson with Mr Newman, three girls 'ambushed' her as she walked home from school. She had seen all of them around school, so she recognised there faces, but she did not know any of their names. They were often talking about her, and trying to trip her up as she walked around school. All three of them had dirty blonde dyed hair, with there skirts hitched up to there thighs. There faces were plastered in make up, and they had so much fake tan on that they looked orange. They were typical sluts. Of course she did not voice this out loud, instead choosing to try and walk past them as they sat on the wall. Nevertheless they stood up, standing in front of her in a line so that she couldn't walk past. She avoided looking any of them in the eye, instead staring at the ground at there feet, as she came to a stop. However a sharp blow to the jaw caused her to fall backwards. She gasped in pain as she held her chin in her hands. Looking up she saw the three of them smirking down at her. A surge of anger went through her and she stood up, her fists clenched, intending to punch one of them back but they advanced towards her again. Instead of getting punched again she took a step backwards, trying to avoid them. \"You gonna hit us?\" one of them asked, her voice brittle and nasal. Rae didn't answer her question, instead taking another step back. \"Aw. Look. She's scared of us,\" the same girl said again, causing the other two to shriek in laughter. Rae realised that she was the one who was in charge. She therefore assumed that she was the one who had punched her. \"I'm not scared,\" she said defiantly, trying to keep her voice calm. Her jaw was still throbbing and aching. The three of them stepped forward as one, and the girl who was in charge reached forward and grabbed Rae's hair, pulling hard. Rae cried out, more from the shock of it then the pain. Her fingers scrabbled desperately at the girls arm, trying to stop the girl from hurting her, \"Let go of me!\" \"Look at the freak trying to get away,\" they laughed, \"I thought she'd enjoy the pain.\" She felt hot tears start to fall down her cheeks; despite the fact that she knew that this would only make them even more riled. However she was saved from being hurt anymore when footsteps started coming towards them. The girls let go of her hair and started to run away. However Rae knew by the look in their eyes that they were not finished with her. The footsteps continued round the corner and she gasped when she saw who it was. The man stood before her, his face filled with concern and his hair blowing slightly in the wind. \"Mr Newman?\"[Chapter 7] Richard Richard had been keeping an eye on Rae ever since he had first met her. After all she was so fragile that he was continually scared that somebody would hurt her. He had heard and seen that people in the school seemed to have something against her, although he could not for the love of him think why. She was perfect in every way. However one day when he was in the staff room he listened into a conversation that two staff members were having about Rae. Richard did not know what there names were as they worked in different departments, but the conversation that he overheard chilled him to the bone. \"... bullying seems to be getting worse, but she still doesn't talk to anyone about it,\" they were saying when he first started to listen in. \"Well, it has to be expected. Her father's depression is getting worse, and as for her mother. Let's just say that whenever I've seen her at the supermarket, it's often hard to get a sensible word out of her. That alcohol is ruling her life. They both need help if you ask me.\" This had made Richard grind his teeth together. He did not care that they were talking so harshly about Rae's parents. It was more because of the thought of Rae having to live at home with parents like that. It reminded him of his childhood, and it made him feel sick to his stomach. He did not want her to live like that. However the conversation had continued, \"Maybe they all need help. I know that after Rae tried to kill herself they made her see a physiatrist, but maybe she needs long term help as well.\" Richard's mind had shut down after this. She had tried to kill herself. His beautiful Rae had tried to kill herself... Suddenly it all seemed to make sense. The marks on her arms, the way that people would give her strange looks. He'd had to get up and leave the staff room, and sit in his car for a while afterwards. His thoughts were a mess. The words that the two teachers had said kept spinning round and round in his head, until he thought that he was going to be sick. What kind of things must she have had to live with if she tried to kill herself? He eventually did return to school for an art lesson with some sixth formers, but his head was all over the place and he could not concentrate. He could tell that some of the students were giving him strange looks but he did not care. When he left school for home that day he knew that he was going to have to do something. He would make plans, and he would somehow save her from the mess that she was in. That was why when he found her it seemed like it was almost destiny. He had been driving slowly down the road, trying to keep his thoughts on happier things, when he heard a woman shouting. Whoever she was she sounded like she was in pain. Not one to ignore a damsel in distress he immediately parked the car and walked towards the source of the noise. A smile almost went to his face as he recognised Rae. However before the smile could completely fill his face the more intelligent part of him saw that she was sitting on the floor, and was holding her chin as if in pain. He also saw that there were three girls running away. His facial expression immediately turned to one of concern. He took a step towards her, every bone in his body resisting the urge to run towards her and wrap her up inside his arms. She must have heard him coming because she turned around and looked up at him, her face filled with confusion. \"Mr Newman?\" This decided it for him. He walked forwards until he was in front of her and then knelt down. \"Rae? Are you okay?\" he asked. He so badly wanted to reach out and touch her. Her voice was shaky. \"I-I'm fine.\" His eyes searched hers and he could tell instantly that she was lying. He could also see that she was starting to look scared, so he spoke to fill the uncomfortable silence that she no doubt would be sensing. \"What happened?\" She did not speak for a moment and he could tell that she was mulling something over in her mind. When she finally did speak her voice was decisive as if she had made her mind up about something. \"I tripped and knocked my chin on the ground.\" He frowned down at her. She wasn't very good at lying. If she had not been looking so scared right now then he would have reached down and checked her injuries, but he did not want to make her any more frightened. Instead he stood up and reached out a hand. She took it albeit hesitantly. The first thought that went through his mind when he touched her was how cold she was. The second thought was that this was the first time that he touched her. He was going to treasure this moment. She let go immediately once she was on her feet, but although the contact was only brief it made his heart race in his chest. Neither of them said anything for a while and he could tell that like him she was thinking about something. He was however thinking what would constitute being a caring teacher. After all he did not want to seem too forward with her. \"Would you like a lift home?\" he asked eventually. Her eyes widened slightly, and he wondered if he had been too forward. Shockingly she eventually nodded after some thinking. \"My cars up there,\" he said, indicating up the road. She nodded and together they walked up the road, although he struggled with not staring at her.[Chapter 8] I know that this is another short one, but I find it a lot easier to write chapters for Richard then for Rae. I promise that I'll try and get some more about her in the next one though. X Rae Five minutes after the incident with the three girls and Rae was sitting in Mr Newman's car. As she sat there she wondered what had possessed her to get in the car with him in the first place. When he had found her on the floor she had felt scared and confused. He freaked her out so much, and it just seemed to sum up her day in general that he of all people would find her. After he had asked her whether she had wanted a lift home, she had automatically wanted to say no, but the more she thought about it the more sensible it sounded. Although the girls had run off they might wait for her and try to hurt her again, and she didn't think that she could handle anymore. She was both physically and mentally exhausted. So when Mr Newman had asked her she had said yes, and that was why she was now sitting in his car. They had driven up the road to a petrol station so that he could fill up the car, and at the current moment he was inside paying. To pass the time she looked around the inside of the car, trying to find as much as she could about him. There was no child seat in the back so she assumed that he had no children. There were also no cigarettes or rubbish on the floor, which was rare in a man's car. She assumed that he either didn't use his car or he was just a very tidy man. She went for the latter. Her eyes went back to the front however as she saw him come out of the small shop, and walk back towards the car. He smiled at her as he stepped back into the car and slammed the door shut behind him. She did not bother to try and return the smile, and his eyebrows furrowed slightly. \"Where would you like me to drop you off?\" he asked. She thought about it for a while. \"Could you drop me off at Horsham Avenue?\" she asked. He nodded and started up the car. Horsham Avenue was not where she lived (although it was only a few streets away from her road) but she had several reasons for not wanting him to drop her off outside her house. The first was that she did not want him to know where she lived. Despite the kindness that he was showing her, he still scared her slightly. She knew that it was slightly irrational and paranoid of her, but she would sleep a lot better at night if she knew that he did not know where she lived. The second reason was that she was scared that her parents would ask who he was. Her parents knew that Rae did not have many friends and if she was dropped off by Mr Newman then they would immediately be suspicious. Of course she would tell them the truth and say that he was a teacher, but she had a feeling that they would not believe her. Overall it would be better if she was not dropped off in front of her house. As they drove she gradually noticed that he was listening to music. She smiled slightly as she noticed that he was listening to slipknot. \"You listen to slipknot?\" she asked, her voice revealing a hint of amusement. He looked at her and she saw that he was smiling widely back at her. \"Yeah. I love bands like that.\" She nodded almost knowingly. 'Interesting,' she thought to herself.[Chapter 9] Yay. I'm on a roll tonight :) I might be able to put up another chapter before I go to bed tonight... although I should be doing my art coursework... *shuffles nervously* Richard Richard found it slightly comforting to have Rae sitting in the car next to him. She smelt of roses and cherries and he discretely inhaled it as they drove. He had always hated sitting in his car with the seat next to him unoccupied. It made the whole car feel hollow and made him feel personally lonely. With her there, however, the whole car seemed to be filled with light. When thinking this he realised how strange it was, but he could not help the way he thought. He knew that he was not normal after all. Although she had given him an address when he had asked, he knew that it was wrong. The way that she had paused before answering was a giveaway. She was a terrible liar. However this was one of the things that he liked about her. He liked knowing when she was lying or not. It made him feel even closer to her. When she had asked him about the music that he was listening to, he felt even happier. He had not known that she had liked Slipknot when he had put in the CD. It was just a coincidence that she did. On the other hand the more he thought about it, the more it seemed like destiny. They must be made for each other. Although they had been driving in silence, it was not the awkward silence that he was used to when around her. It was more comfortable. However he knew that he had to ask her what had happened back there. \"What really happened before I found you?\" he asked. Her eyes instantly went to her lap. \"I told you what happened.\" \"Well I don't believe you.\" She looked up at him and scowled slightly. He resisted the urge to laugh, knowing that it would only anger her. She could not look angry even if she tried. She was too beautiful and good hearted for that. She sighed when she saw that she figured that he was not going to say anything. \"It was just some girls.\" He expected her to continue but she did not, so he waited for a while until she scowled again and continued. \"One of them punched me in the jaw, okay?\" He struggled to control the anger in his voice. \"Why?\" he asked. \"They... they don't like me. No one does.\" The words that she spoke were simple, but her voice was tragic. His heart clenched in his chest and once again he had to resist the urge to comfort her. He wanted to drop the subject, not wanting to hear her sad voice again, but she had just started talking to him and he did not want her to clam up again. \"Do you know who they were?\" He did not expect an answer so he was not surprised when she stated that she did not know there names. However he saw that she was telling the truth this time. He thought about the question that he had asked and changed it. \"What did they look like?\" This time when she said that she did not remember he knew that she was lying. He did not pursue the matter anymore. They sat in silence again for the rest of the journey. Although he had made sure to go the long way, all too soon they were at Horsham Avenue. \"Is this okay?\" he asked, trying not to betray the sorrow in his voice. She looked up and down the road, only confirming his thought that she was lying about where she lived, and then nodded. She reached forwards and opened the door but before she got out she turned around and looked at him. \"Thanks for the ride Mr Newman.\" When she stepped out of the car she waved to him and he knew that he was expected to drive away so that she could continue walking home. He did not disappoint. As he drove away he stared at her small figure in the rear view mirror, until he had to turn the corner. He continued the drive home to his house, surrounded in a deep sadness. The smell of her perfume still lingered, but instead of comforting him, it instead intensified the loneliness. When he did eventually reach home, he automatically went to his trusty liquor cabinet. Instead of taking out the usual bottle of vodka he instead searched around for a bottle of whisky that he had had for a few years now. When he found it, instead of pouring himself a glass he opened the bottle and took a big gulp straight from the bottle itself. Tonight he needed to be on best form. After today he needed Rae with him even more then before. Tonight he had plans to make.[Chapter 10] Rae When Mr Newman drove away she could see him staring at her from his rear view mirror, as she waved. It seemed stupid to her that she was waving, but she knew that it was expected of her. As she started the short walk home, she realised that she was slightly intrigued by Mr Newman. He had been listening to Slipknot who just so happened to be her favourite band. She could not however see whether it was a coincidence or not. After thinking this she realised that she sounded paranoid. It was not as if Mr Newman was stalking her and he could not have known her favourite music. Just because she thought that he stared at her a lot did not mean that he was crazily obsessed with her. She realised that she was at her house and she stopped. A sudden urge to flee overcame her as she looked up at the place that she had called her home for so long. It was not the house itself that scared her though. It was more about what was waiting inside. Because it was a Monday she knew that her father would be in one of his bad moods, which was a reason why she was so wary of going in the house. However she knew that she could not wait outside all night so she walked up to the house and opened the door, trying to keep herself calm. She did not call out, knowing that if her mother was hung-over then she would not appreciate it. Instead she took off her jacket and hung it on the coat hook, before taking slow and quiet steps towards the living room. Although she did not want to see her parents at the present time, she knew that they would get angry if they did not see her. When she entered the living room the first thing that hit her was the smell. Vodka. Vodka was her mothers poison as she so often put it. Mixed in with the vodka was the stale scent of puke, Her mother was sitting on the sofa, her bleached blonde hair draped in front of her face in big wet clumps. She looked around expecting her father to be there, but he was not in his usual place on the sofa. She walked closer to her mother, until she was standing above her. \"Mum?\" she asked softly, not sure whether she wanted her to wake or not. All the same her mother did stir. Rae touched her mothers arm, flinching slightly at how cold she was. To warm her up she turned on the electric fire that sat in the middle of the living room and placed it in front of her mothers bent form. Her mother lifted her head up slightly and smiled a lopsided smile at Rae before her head flopped back down and she settled back down in her drunken stupor. Rae sighed softly before leaving her mother and closing the living room door softly behind her. She was worried by this point. Her father must be in a really bad mood if her mother was this drunk. However she knew that she could not go to her room before she knew that her father was well. She found him in his study, staring out of the window at the cars and people below. \"Dad?\" she asked, her voice just above a whisper. Expectedly he did not answer her. He didn't even react to the sound of her voice. \"Dad. Come on. You need to get up.\" She wanted to touch him so that he would react, but she was scare that he would lash out as he so often did. \"Go away,\" he said, so softly that she would've thought she'd imagined it if not for the moving of his lips. She contemplated what to do for a brief moment, but soon came to the conclusion that it would be best if he was left alone. Nevertheless she left the door open so that if he needed her she would hear him. When she got to the room she resisted the urge to collapse on her bed. The events of today had exhausted her both mentally and physically. She needed to relax her mind and at the moment sleep scared her. She was certain that she would have bad dreams. Instead she sat down at her desk and took out her notebook filled with drawings. Turning to a blank page, she picked up a pencil and pressed the pencil hard into the paper so that it was now blunt. Sharp pencils were so much more difficult to draw with. She was not sure what to draw so she placed the pencil against the paper and let her mind wonder. Strangely the first thing that came to her mind was Mr Newman's warm brown eyes. She felt a slow blush spread up her cheeks as she thought about his intense gaze. She was still confused about what to think about him. He was very handsome, she already knew that, but he was so much older then her. It was most certainly wrong to be thinking about him. After all he probably had no desire for a seventeen year old school girl. She realised how pathetic she was and placed her head down on the desk, trying to stop her thoughts. When she finally did lift her head from the table a wave of anger consumed her as she looked at what she had drawn. Before her lay a roughly drawn picture of Mr Newman's angular face. She crumpled it up quickly and hurled it into the bin, before throwing herself on the bed and trying to stop the sobs that overwhelmed her.[Chapter 11] Just thought I'd thank everyone for the reviews :) So... thanks! You guys rock! o/ Richard That night he got drunk as usual, although it was on whisky instead of vodka. He preferred the taste of vodka, but the whisky burned his mouth more and kept him awake. He stayed up late that night, planning things that he was going to do. Sometimes he would write things down or make a phone call, but most of the time he sat there with the bottle of whisky in his hand, occasionally taking a mouthful of the fiery liquid. In the background he was playing some Slipknot as it now reminded him of Rae. He thought it strange how such a nice and sweet girl could like such violent music, but he still liked the fact that they now had more then one thing in common. When he felt the effects of the alcohol start to slowly work its way through his system he stopped drinking and started to concentrate on the pieces of paper in front of him. The first was a map of America with all of the main roads labelled. He marked several of the routes that he was planning to take. The second was a list of numbers of his old work colleagues. He had only circled three of them though, as these were the only ones who had offered to help him. The third piece of paper was a flight ticket for one. No return ticket was needed. The final and most important piece of paper did not hold anything but an address for a small town in Texas. This still needed to be confirmed. He mulled over these four pieces of paper for a while, as well as a small notebook filled with notes until he was certain that he knew what to do. By this time the alcohol had slowed down his system enough so that he could close his eyes and gradually drift to sleep. He was awoken abruptly by the sound of the telephone ringing. He reached out blindly, his eyes still half closed against the harsh sunlight streaming through the window. Remembering that he had placed the phone on the kitchen counter last night, he stumbled blindly over to the counter and picked it up. \"What?\" he rasped. He coughed, clearing his throat and repeated his question. \"The house that you wanted. It's all sorted now.\" These simple words made Richards heart jump with joy, even through his hung-over state. He hung up not needing to say anything else to the man on the phone. They had made a mutual agreement which meant that they now both had what they wanted. His smile lessened slightly as he realised that his head was throbbing and every sound seemed amplified. His throat was dry so he poured a glass of water from the sink and gulped it down quickly, taking a handful of aspirin with it. His mother had always warned him about the effects of taking to many over the recommended amount of aspirin but he had not listened to he when she was alive, so he was damned if he was going to listen to her advice when she was dead. For the time being the aspirin did nothing to help his head, but he knew that it would eventually kick in. \"Shit!\" he gasped as he saw how late it was. He only had half an hour to get ready for work. He ran around like a mad man (which was an analogy that he seemed to use a lot) trying to make himself look presentable. The stubble around his face wasn't too bad today so he did not bother shaving. Also he was not sure whether he would be able to shave without cutting himself in the shaken state that he was in. The alcohol always seemed to have that effect on him the morning after. When he was dressed in the cleanest and least rumpled shirt and trousers that he could find, he ran out of the door (locking the door behind him) and unlocked his Land rover. He threw his bag in the back and started up the car, reversing wildly out of the driveway. He shoved several mints and sucked on them as he drove to school. Despite the rude awakening and the fact that he had been forced to rush, he knew that today was going to be a good day and it would all be because of Rae.[Chapter 12] Rae That night Rae could not get to sleep. After she had managed to drag her mother to her bed, she had wrapped a blanket around her father knowing that he was not going to move. Even though she was exhausted, she lay up in bed for a long time, only having her dark thoughts as company. She knew that if she did eventually drift off to sleep the dark thoughts would manage to get into her dreams as well. Instead of laying there and trying to sleep, she figured that she would find something to help her sleep without giving her the nightmares. When downstairs she looked through some of the medicine cupboards but there only seemed to be sleeping pills. She thought about taking some of them, but they had no dosage use on them so she left them, just in case they were dangerous. However when looking in the small cupboard by the television she found a stash of her mothers alcohol. Her eyes lit up as she realised that she could kill two birds with one stone. If she drunk enough then not only would the bad thoughts go away, but she might eventually pass out as well. She took a couple of bottles of her mother's cheapest sherry upstairs with her along with half a bottle of chardonnay. She had quite a job to carry it without making any noise, but she made it to her bedroom without waking anyone up. Deciding to start with the sherry she took a hesitant sip straight from the bottle. She'd drunk alcohol occasionally when she had been in the mood, but this was the first time that she had tasted sherry. She usually preferred to drink beer and cider. However she was pleasantly surprised when she tasted the sweet alcoholic drink. She took a bigger sip and smiled as it slipped pleasurably down her throat. Within a few hours she had drunk most of the sherry and all of the chardonnay, and she was feeling extremely tipsy. Her head was swirling with colours and a jumble of happy and completely random thoughts. At the moment she was lying on her bed and swinging her arms back and forth. She had forgotten why. She thought that the alcohol would have had a more depressive effect on her so she was pleased that it had instead made her deliriously happy. At some point in the middle of drinking the rest of the sherry she must have passed out because the next thing she knew her mother was shouting at her to get up. The noise echoed around her head, seeming to be three times louder then it was. She groaned and moved slightly, only to be overwhelmed by a sudden rush of nausea. Quickly she ran to the toilet, only just making it before she threw up. She heard the door open behind her, but she was too busy trying not to get her hair in the sick to notice. \"Rae!?\" She groaned as her mothers voice caused her head to throb. The effort of trying to lift her head up was too much so she left it resting against the cold toilet seat. \"What?\" she murmured. \"Have you been drinking?\" her mother asked. Rae giggled, \"What a silly question to ask.\" She was clearly still drunk. All of a sudden her head was lifted forcibly from the toilet seat and she was thrown backwards against the wall. If she had been sober then she might have realised that this was the first time her mother had touched her in a while, but she was to drunk to be thinking such things. She opened her eyes slightly, her vision blurry and distorted. However she could make out her mothers angry face looming above her. Rae wondered how her mother could look so steady on her feet after she had looked so bad last night. \"Why is it dark?\" Rae asked suddenly, after looking outside. Why would her mother have shouted for her in the middle of the night? Her mother's angry face turned to one of sadness and worry. \"It's your father. He's gone missing.\" Argh! It's another short one again. I'm sorry, I just can't seem to write long chapters. You guys must think I'm an alcoholic or something. All I seem to write about is alcohol, but I'm not obsessed with it. Honestly :) I just think some people can have an interesting relationship with alcohol. On a different note: all of my art coursework is due in a few days (Boo!), so I'm not sure when the next chapter will be up. I'll try and write as much as I can in my lunchtimes (as that's all I ever do anyway) and try and get some more chapters up as fast as I can. Anyway I hope you like :) X[Chapter 13] I've got the day off school today, so hopefully I can get up a few chapters :) X Rae After her mother had told Rae about her father going missing, she had instantly sobered up. \"Missing?\" she asked, her voice slow. \"What do you mean missing?\" Her mother had started shaking. \"After you put me into bed, I went to go and check on your father to see if he was alright.\" She held out a piece of paper to Rae, her fingers trembling slightly, and Rae took it. \"I found this on his desk.\" She read it, her eyes taking in the words desperately. 'I need to get out of this. They're watching me... always watching me. Maybe if I leave then they won't hurt you. Don't try and contact me. You'll just get hurt. I love you both. Robert x' \"What's this meant to mean?\" Rae asked. \"I don't know. His paranoia... it's been getting worse lately. He's been saying that there has been someone watching him, trying to harm him.\" Rae thought back to earlier on when she had seen her father staring out of the window. Maybe then he had been looking out for the person who he believed was out to harm him. \"What's the time?\" she eventually asked her mother. Her mother looked surprised at the change in conversation, but she answered her nonetheless. \"It's five fifteen am. When did you last see him?\" She thought back. When she was walking back to her room with the alcohol she remembered that the door had been closed, despite the fact that she had left it open on purpose. At the time she had not thought anything of it, but now it seemed important. Before Rae could answer her mothers question she had to ask a question herself. \"Was the door open when you went to check on him?\" Her mother thought about it. \"No, it was closed.\" \"Then the last time I saw him was at around eleven.\" Tears filled her mother's eyes. \"There's so much damage that he could have done in six hours.\" Rae didn't want to think about it. \"We need to call the police.\" \"No!\" her mother practically shouted at her, making Rae jump. \"We can't call them. Not yet. What if they take him away from us?\" Rae thought about it as well. \"We need to start looking for him then. If we haven't found him in a few hours then we need to call the police, okay?\" Her mother nodded and left the room, her body still shaking. Once she had gone Rae sat on the bed and buried her head in her hands. Why did everything always have to be so complicated? Yesterday had been bad enough and then she had to wake up to this. Half of her wished that she had more alcohol to drink, but the other half knew that she had to be calm if she was going to find her father. Luckily Rae always seemed to listen to her sensible side, so instead of drinking the rest of the sherry that she could see lying on the floor, she went downstairs and joined her mother. At the moment her mother was on the phone. She assumed that she was either talking to some of dad's old friends or another family member. Instead of sitting around and waiting for her mother to finish the call, Rae decided to go through her fathers papers to see if there were any clues as to where they could find him. Her father had a job, but he worked from home. Rae didn't know exactly what he did, but she knew that it was something to do with selling products over the internet. This was why when she looked through all of the papers; many of them were to do with internet sites such as Amazon and various sites that she had not heard of. After her mother had finished the call she helped Rae for a while. \"Have you called Leila's parents yet?\" Rae asked her mother as they worked through the documents. Leila was a friend of Rae's little sister Amy and that was where Amy was staying at the moment. \"I've called them, but I've told them not to tell Amy anything. Not until we know for sure that he's truly missing.\" The conversation ended at that and they worked in silence for a while. Eventually however they realised that they were not going to find anything by looking through his papers. Instead her mother picked up the phone again and started to call around, whilst Rae decided to take a more practical and heads on approach. She placed on her black jacket and zipped it up tightly, before leaving the house to search for her dad in the places where he usually stayed. While she walked up the road, she thought about all the places that her dad used to take her when she was a kid. It had been a regular thing that when she was little, he had taken her out every Saturday. Sometimes they would go to watch a movie at the cinema, or they would go swimming, but more then often they would end up at the park. It had always been there favourite location. But then her father had gotten depressed and paranoid and he didn't take her out anymore. He just used to sit at home and stare out of the windows for hours on end. Rae felt tears trickle down her cheeks, but she wiped them quickly away. She needed to concentrate on finding her dad, instead of feeling sorry for herself. An hour later and Rae had gotten nowhere. She had checked all of the places that her father liked to hang out, but hadn't found him. When returning home she found that her mother had also had no luck. \"You need to call the police, mum,\" Rae had said, the moment she saw her mothers disappointed face. She nodded sadly and walked back into the living room. Rae meanwhile decided to go and get something to eat and drink, despite the fact that her stomach was tense with worry. She fixed herself and her mother some toast and orange juice. However she only managed to eat a few bites before she felt as if she couldn't eat anymore. When her mother joined her, she didn't even touch her food, instead just drinking her orange juice. At one point she tried to sneak some vodka into her drink, but Rae snatched it off her and placed it back into the cabinet. The police arrived half an hour later. They introduced themselves as PC Beth Cooper and PC Jack Meadows. Rae could tell that they were doubtful as to why they had been called to this house. After Rae's mother had explained the situation to them both, PC Cooper asked if she could see the note. The note was handed to her almost hesitantly by Rae's mother. Once PC Cooper had read it, she handed it to PC Meadows and they both shared a knowing look. \"We'll start searching for your husband immediately Mrs Delaney, but you have to know that if we do find him, then he will probably need some psychological help.\" Helen nodded. She knew that this was going to happen, but she needed to be prepared. Rae walked with the police officers and her mother to the door, waving them off. Once back inside she told her mother that she was going to sleep, before walking off upstairs. She knew that her mother would start drinking, but at that present moment in time she did not care. If her mother wanted to drink then there was nothing she could do to stop her. Rae didn't realise how tired she was until her head hit the pillow. She knew that there was no way that she was going to go into school. Not after today. From downstairs she heard the phone ring, but by this point she was too sleepy to get up. Within a few minutes she was fast asleep.[Chapter 14] This one is really, really short I know, but I needed to add this small bit in somewhere and I felt that it needed to be 'told' by Richard. Plus I needed the next bit to be 'told' by Rae. X Richard It was the day after he had decided to go along with his plan, and everything was ready. The night before he had finished up the final touches, but for once he did not drink. His body had been shaking and aching from the lack of alcohol, but he had his reasons for not drinking. It meant that now he was not hung-over, which meant that he had a clear head. Everything needed to be thought out in perfect detail; otherwise he risked the chance that he would be arrested or something worse, something unimaginable. His mind went back to the task that he now faced. Everything was sorted and ready, apart from one little detail. He phoned a familiar number and waited until somebody answered. Her sweet voice sounded after only a few rings. \"Hello?\" He wanted to say something to her, but his Irish accent was too familiar. After he did not say anything for a while Rae repeated her question. \"Hello?\" He hung up, not being able to bare the sorrow in her voice. However it was not long now till they would be together. Pressing a few more buttons on the telephone, he dialled his friend. \"She's home. You can call now.\" After hanging up he placed the phone back in its handset, before picking up his rucksack. He made sure only to pack the barest essentials, as he didn't want his bag to be too heavy. Most of the stuff that he needed was at the other place anyway. His car was already parked and running round the back and he headed towards it. There was nothing that he could do now but wait.[Chapter 15] Rae When she first woke up, it took her a while to remember what had happened. When everything came flooding back she felt slightly overwhelmed. 'Fuck this' she eventually thought and got up out of bed. She was determined not to be in a bad mood today. She decided to have a shower as she felt dirty and she knew that it would help her mood. The scalding hot water helped to soothe her nerves. As the water cascaded down her back she felt her muscles began to relax, and she sighed out loud. Turning off the water, she stepped out of the shower cubicle and picked up a big white towel. She wrapped it around herself and went over to the wardrobe to pick out an outfit. She was unsure of what to wear. Not because she did not have any clothes to wear, but more because she didn't know what would be counted as suitable to wear today. She eventually picked out a light grey cardigan with a white tank top, along with a pair of denim shorts. When she was dressed she went downstairs to check on her mother and to get some breakfast. The sight before her did not surprise her. Her mother was laying on the floor in her own vomit. The room stank of whisky and puke, and it made Rae gag. \"Mum?\" she asked, walking over to her still figure and kicking her gently with her foot. Her mother groaned, but otherwise made no indication that she was going to move. \"For god's sake,\" she muttered, before placing her hands underneath her mother's arms and dragging her over to the sofa. Her mother made no attempt to help her, which only made it more difficult for her. Once she had eventually placed her mother on the sofa, she went and got a mop and bucket to clean the sick off the floor. She was just grateful that there floor was wooden and not carpet. After she had cleaned it all up, she decided that she did not want breakfast after all. Before she could think about what to do with her mother, the phone rang. \"Hello?\" she asked. Nobody said anything, but she could hear someone breathing. \"Hello?\" she asked again. A beeping sound indicated that they had hung up. She shrugged her shoulders and went back over to try and wake her mother up. However before she could even attempt to rouse her mother the phone rang again. She was in half a mind to ignore, but she thought that it might be important. She soon found out that it was. \"Is this Mrs Delaney?\" she was asked after she had said hello. \"No, this is her daughter.\" \"Oh, well this is DI Stone. We have some news about Robert Delaney.\" \"Have you found him?\" His voice faltered slightly, \"I think it would be better if you came down to the police station.\" Rae hesitated, looking down at her mothers limp form, \"Would it be okay if I was to come alone. My mother isn't feeling so well.\" It wasn't exactly a lie after all. \"Of course,\" he said, and she thought that his voice seemed slightly happier. She however ignored it, putting it down to her imagination. \"I'll be there right away.\" She hung up without saying goodbye. She wanted to find out what they had found out about her father. Hurriedly she wrote a note to her mother saying where she was going, before grabbing her bag and leaving the house. She thought about taking her father's car but she figured that it would be too much hassle, and anyway the fresh air would do her good. She was preparing herself for the worst after all. Because she was walking so quickly, she was not taking in her surroundings, which was why she did not notice the man following her until she had walked down several roads. Her first thought was that she was paranoid, but when she turned left the man followed her as well. As she turned another corner she looked back and tried to take in as much as she could about his appearance. He had on a baseball cap, and he was wearing black trousers and a dark blue jumper. However she could not see his hair or eye colour, without him knowing that she had seen him. Instead she kept her eyes to the floor and walked a little faster. However she soon realised that he had no intention of leaving her alone. She looked left and right, trying to see if there was anybody around who could help her, but the streets were deserted. She saw an alleyway ahead and was about to head towards it, when she saw another man come out from it. At first she was going to go and ask him for help, but he was staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. He was not here to help her. By this point she had given up on trying to act like she didn't know they were following her, so she started to run. Footsteps behind her indicated that they had started to run after her. She had lost all sense of direction, so she ran towards where she thought there was a main road. She just needed to find someone who could help her. However as she turned a corner a car came screeching towards her, stopping just in front of her. She was forced to grip onto the bonnet of the car to stop herself from falling over. She attempted to try and run away again but hands grabbed her roughly from behind. She kicked and struggled, trying to get free but whoever was holding her was strong. Another man came out of the car and walked towards her. She could see something sharp and glittering in his hand, and her first thought was that it was a knife, but looking closer she saw that it was a needle. She didn't know which one she would have preferred. As he got closer to her, Rae kicked out at him but another man reached forwards and grabbed her feet. She was sobbing as he pressed the needle into her arm and pressed down the plunger. Her whole body went limp as the cold liquid started to seep through her body. Her surroundings were becoming blurry and distorted as they carried her over to the car and placed her in the back. The last thing she saw before the darkness consumed her was a man's smiling face looking down at her, his eyes filled with a sense of achievement.[Chapter 16] Richard He received a call off of his friend after only ten minutes of waiting. They had taken less time then he thought. Starting up the car, he drove off to the place where they had arranged to meet. When he got her he could start his life again. He would be different. But he couldn't do it without Rae. The factory was dark and there were no signs of life. He had gotten there earlier then them it seemed. Before he got out of the car and met them he took the gun from the glove compartment and placed it into the waistband of his jeans. He knew that it was loaded as he had loaded it himself last night. He had been sure to wear a jacket, so that he could cover the bulge that the gun caused. When getting out of the car he did not bother to lock the door behind him. There was nobody around at this time of night to steal it anyway. He had been told to wait by the front door of the abandoned factory and that was what he did. A few minutes after he had been waiting, he saw the deep glow of headlights from around the corner. He stood more to attention and placed his hands in his jacket pockets. This way he could reach for the gun more easily if he needed to. When the car stopped in front of him, three men got out. He assumed that Rae must still be in the car. He walked up to the one man that he did know, his friend Jason, and shook hands with him. Richard had met Jason at work... well its proper name was community service, but Richard did not care about such petty differences. He was after all still 'working.' \"Is she okay?\" Richard asked. \"You can check yourself,\" Jason replied, indicating to the car. He leant in slightly and saw Rae lying in the back, seemingly unconscious. She looked paler than usual and she had huge circles around her eyes. However he knew that this was because of the situation at home, and not because they had done this to her. He wanted to reach out and touch her, to really make sure that she was okay, but he wanted to wait until Jason and his friends had gone. He nodded at Jason and reached into his rucksack for the money. As he handed it to Jason he noticed that the two men were armed, just like he was. Jason counted the money carefully, but seemed dissatisfied or uncertain because he flicked through it again and recounted. He looked up at Richard, his eyes narrowed. \"There's only two thousand here. Where's the money for the car?\" \"What do you mean the money for the car?\" Richard asked, his voice rising slightly. \"You're going to take away this car away as well. It cost me at least a thousand pounds. I'm not gonna let you take it away for nothing. So give me the fucking money.\" The two men next to Jason shifted slightly and there hands reached for there guns. \"I haven't got the money.\" Richard was trying to be calm, but his eyes were frantically flicking between the two men. Jason reached into the car and pulled Rae out. He put her unconscious form in front of him, and pressed the gun against her head. Richard lost it. \"Fucking let go of her!\" he shouted, and pulled the gun out of his waistband. He shot Jason twice in the head, and watched as he fell to the ground. The two men reached for there guns but they were too slow. Richard shot both of them head as well and watched as they fell dead to the ground. The gun fell from his shaking hands. There was blood everywhere. His first thought was to look after Rae, and he ran towards her, pulling her out from underneath the bloodied body of Jason. He cradled her against his chest and sobbed. She was covered in blood and he wiped a hand over her face, trying to get rid of as much of it as he could. Picking her up carefully, he placed her in the back of the car. He needed to be quick, in case she woke up. He needed to get rid of the bodies. Starting with Jason's body he started to drag him towards the warehouse, leaving a trail of blood. When he had been waiting earlier he had seen a large skip outside and that's where he planned to put the bodies. It took him longer then he had expected to dump all of the bodies into the skip, but eventually he did it. Before he could set alight to the skip, he knew that he had to somehow get rid of at least some of the blood on the ground. He looked in the boot of the car and was pleased to see that they had done what he said, and had placed some clothes in the back. Picking up a couple of t-shirts he tried his best to clean up the blood on the floor, before placing them into the skip alongside the bodies. He also took the spare petrol can that was in the boot and poured it on the bloodied bodies and t-shirts that now occupied the skip. Then he took a match from his pocket and threw it in, watching as the contents immediately set on fire. The air was filled with the smell of burning flesh and petrol. He breathed it in, making sure that he remembered this moment. When he walked back to the car, he saw that Rae was twitching slightly. He knew that this meant that within half hour she would be awake. Therefore he needed to tie her up. Taking the rope from his backpack he gently but firmly tied some rope around her wrists. He knew that this would hurt her when she woke up and struggled, but it could not be helped. She would thank him when she understood why he had done it. He was going to make her life better. Before he started the car, he kissed her lightly on the cheek. This day was going to change everything for him. Today was just the beginning. As he drove off he could see from his rear view mirror the flames flickering into the sky from his skip of burning corpses.[Chapter 17] Rae She could smell copper. Why the hell could she smell copper? When she tried to open her eyes she had to close them again because of the bright sunshine blinding her. What had happened to her? She thought back, past the confusion that fogged up her mind. She remembered someone grabbing her arms and the sharp prick in her arm. 'Shit.' A flood of memories came back. The man staring down at her, running away from the two men and then the car. The sharp pain in her side was proof of the car whacking into her side. She heard a noise from in front of her and she became aware that somebody else was with her. Her curiosity got the better of her, and she opened her eyes again, squinting against the harsh sunlight. It took a while for her eyes to get adjusted, but eventually she started to pick up on certain things. She was in a car. That much was obvious. When she tried to move she also found out that she was tied up. There was somebody sitting in the seat in front of her. As she looked down at herself she felt a wave of nausea run through her as she saw that she had blood on her t-shirt and shorts. Why the hell did she have blood on her? Whoever it was must have noticed her moving because they turned around and looked at her, despite the fact that they were driving. She felt a stab of shock run through her as she looked upon the person whose car she was tied up in the back of. It was Mr Newman. Her mouth tried to form words, but her brain seemed disconnected and she couldn't get them out. His eyes were carefully taking in her expression, and he seemed almost satisfied by her reaction. She struggled to get up without the use of her hands, but hissed in agony when a sharp pain went through her side. When he saw that she was hurt he pressed his foot to the brake and the car to a came sudden stop. She went flying forwards and ended up on the floor of the car. He got out of the car and opened the door, reaching towards her. She flinched and used her feet to push away from him, scared about what he was going to do. He was unpredictable to her now. She watched from a distance as his face fell. \"What do you want?\" she whispered to him. \"I want to help you.\" He looked so serious. She gave a humourless laugh, \"then untie me.\" He looked down at her and there was something in his eyes that made her think that he wasn't all there. \"I don't want you to escape. I love you.\" She stared back at him, her eyes wide with shock and confusion. \"You barely know me, how can you love me?\" His eyes grew dark, \"you'll understand soon.\" She didn't like the sound of that. He reached forwards and tried to grab her again but this time she was more prepared. Her foot lashed out and hit him straight in the face, causing him to topple backwards. While he had been talking to her she had managed to open up the door behind her. As she opened it fully she fell backwards onto the road below and she winced as the gravel dug into the bare skin on her legs. However she could see that he was starting to recover from the kick to the face so she quickly got herself up. It was considerably hard with her hands behind her backs but she managed. The moment that she was standing steadily on her feet she started running. A few times she almost lost her balance, but she kept going, the adrenalin shooting through her veins. There was nothing there for her to see. Nobody there who could help her. She was in the middle of nowhere, but she kept running in the hope that he wouldn't come after her. She was so naive. Thudding footsteps sounded behind her and she ran faster, her breath coming out in short gasps. Tears were falling down her face, from both fear and pain. Suddenly she felt rough hands on her back and she fell forwards. Her face scraped against the gravel on the floor as she fell and a warm wetness spread across her cheek. She was gasping for breath as he grabbed her and turned her over. His face was a mix between anger and concern. \"Now look what you've done.\" He reached forward to touch her face, even though she flinched away. His hands came away covered in blood. For a moment his hand disappeared and he reached into his pocket for something. When his hand came out it had a needle in it. She sobbed some more and tried to move away from him, but he grabbed onto her and held her still. The needle pressed into her arm, but before all of the liquid had even gone she had passed out.[Chapter 18] Richard 'He had Rae. He had the beautiful girl whom he had yearned over for the past few weeks.' These were the thoughts that he repeated in his head as he drove down the road. After she had kicked him in the face and tried to run away he had had no choice but to drug her again. Luckily she had not made him bleed and he doubted whether it would even bruise. It was more from the shock itself that he had fallen over. She was so stupid, running away from him that. He had not meant to hurt her anyway, but she had still managed to get hurt. And on her beautiful face as well. It was very lucky for her that she had not grazed her face too badly. Hopefully the pale, soft skin on her face would be perfect again in no time. He sighed deeply and looked at the unconscious form next to him. He had placed her there so that he could keep a closer eye on her. Her head was slumped over to the side and she would've looked almost peaceful, if not for the grazing on her face. He had tried to clean it up as best as he could, but he only had a small cloth that had been in the glove compartment. He knew that the marks on her face would cause him problems later on, but he could not think about that now. For now he needed to concentrate on the here and now. It would take him another four hours to get to the house in Texas, although he had already been driving for three hours. However after the attempt at an escape from Rae he knew that he could not afford to stop again. He just hoped that he could stay awake for that long. The road ahead was empty as he had made sure to take routes that many people did not know about. Sure, it took longer, but it meant they were safe. However he was getting slightly annoyed at the repetitive green and brown blurs of the trees that flashed past him. Next to him Rae fidgeted slightly and he knew that she had gone from the stage of being unconscious to the stage of merely being asleep. Although he did not want to see her frightened eyes he longed for her to wake up. It felt wrong, her being next to him without saying anything. He loved to hear her sweet voice. Half an hour later, her eyes flickered open for the second time that day. He smiled at the sight of her familiar green eyes. She looked around confusedly for a moment, but her eyes met his and he could tell that she was remembering what had happened. A soft groan escaped from her lips and he looked down at her worriedly. \"Rae? Are you okay?\" he asked. She looked up at him and her eyes seemed almost shocked. \"Of course I'm not okay.\" \"I'm sorry for what happened to your face Rae, but you shouldn't have run off like that.\" \"My face?\" she spluttered, her eyes filled with disbelief, \"What about the fact that you've taken me or kidnapped me or whatever the hell you want to call it? What about the fact that I'm fucking tied up?\" He looked down at her, his face filled with shock. She was angry, and that was the first time that he had heard her swear. For a while he thought about how to answer her, but he eventually found out that he did not know how. \"I need to get you away from them,\" he said, his eyes glued back on the road ahead. It wasn't answering her questions at all but she couldn't have been expecting that anyway. \"Mr Newman... I don't understand.\" \"Call me Richard.\" She looked at him, almost frustrated, despite the tears that he could see building up in her eyes. \"Alright, fine. I don't understand, Richard.\" He looked down at her and his jaw clenched. \"I'm taking you away, somewhere where you can't be hurt.\" \"I don't want to go anywhere,\" she whispered, \"I want to go home.\" \"To a place where you're abused by your mother and father.\" \"I'd hardly call it abusing,\" she replied, but she turned away from him and hid her face as she spoke. Sighing, he concentrated on the road and let her think for a while. He could tell that she was confused and angry and he had expected that, but he hadn't expected her to be so sad about leaving her family behind. \"Does your face hurt much?\" he asked to break the uncomfortable silence that had filled the car. \"Yes,\" she replied simply. He pressed down carefully on the brake and the car came to a slow stop. She looked up at him a question on her face, but he did not say anything to her. As he reached past her towards the glove compartment she cringed away from him, but he ignored her. He sighed an internal sigh of relief as he saw that there was indeed a first aid kit. \"I need to clean the graze on your face more thoroughly,\" he explained to her. She did not look happy at this, but she was sensible enough to know that the wound could get infected if not cleaned thoroughly Taking out an antiseptic wipe he reached forwards and held her face gently in his hands. She gave a gasp of pain as the wipe first touched her cheek but she was brave and did not make another sound as he cleaned away the remaining blood and grit from her face. As he worked he noticed that her eyes were kept down. She was too embarrassed to look at him. How sweet. Once he had finished he placed the wipe in a plastic bag and threw it into the backseat of the car. He looked in the first aid kit to see if there was anything else that he could use, but he did not think that a plaster or a bandage would be needed. It would probably be better if the air could get to the wound. Rae didn't say anything so he started up the car and continued driving. However just as he was about to reach forward to put on the radio she whispered a thank you. He did not reply to this but a small smile formed on his lips. Finally, he had done something right. As this is my first story and I'm new to this site, I was wondering if there was a specific amount of chapters that I'm allowed for each story. Or am I just being stupid by asking that? I'd be grateful if someone could let me know either way. On another note thanks for the reviews and the story alerts etc :)[Chapter 19] Thanks for the reviews and answers to my question. Here's another chapter. For some reason this took me a long time to write... not sure why. Also, I might be a bit slower in updating in the next couple of days and weeks because I have exams. Not good! Anyways, I hope you like. :) Rae She was trapped. The doors of the car were locked as were the windows, her arms were tied and she was too drowsy to do anything even if she could. Richard (as he had asked her to call him) scared her, she could not deny that. He seemed to think that he was in love with her or something. He was certainly acting very strangely. At the moment they were sitting side by side in the front of the car, as when she had woke up (for the second time) she found that she had been placed in the passenger seat. She assumed that it was so he could keep an eye on her but she wasn't so sure. After all who knew how a madman thought? It was only now that the drugs had started to wear off that she realised how surreal the situation was. Her arms were tied behind her back, her face was grazed and sore, and most surreal the man sitting next to her was completely calm, despite the fact that he had kidnapped her. Of course he was not the man who had actually done the dirty deed himself. Maybe he thought she would hate him more if he had actually taken her himself. However at the moment she couldn't hate him anymore then she already did. The anger that was scorching through her body was so foreign to her that she was not sure how to express it. At the moment however she was sorely tempted to hurt Richard in some way, but it would be extremely hard to seriously hurt him with her hands tied behind her back. So, instead she chose to sit there in silence and stare daggers at the road ahead. He must have noticed how angry she was because he kept quiet, which was an extremely wise decision. The silence was so taut and tense however, that after an hour of it she was the first to break it. She also had several questions to ask, although if she was going to be truthful to herself, she was scared to ask some of them. She thought of what question to ask first. \"Where are you taking me?\" she eventually decided on. When she asked it, he jumped and looked down at her. He had obviously grown accustomed to the silence. \"To a house,\" he said simply. \"A house,\" she repeated. He nodded. She had to bite down hard on her lip to stop the rush of anger that overwhelmed her. \"I've angered you?\" he asked, as he watched her. \"Yes,\" she replied through gritted teeth. His eyes were filled with concern as he looked at her, but this only made Rae even angrier. She was about to say something else to him but a phone started ringing. This didn't seem to surprise Richard as she thought that it might have, and instead he calmly took a mobile phone out of his pocket and placed it against his ear. \"Hello?\" he asked. Rae couldn't hear what the other person on the phone was saying but Richard kept glancing at her and agreeing what the person was saying. While he was busy she started to wriggle her hands about in an attempt to loosen the rope. She had to resist the urge to wince as the rope cut into her skin, but she was determined to get free. After a brief conversation he hung up and looked over at her, and she stopped moving her hands. His eyes were filled with guilt and Rae knew that the next thing he was going to say would not be good. She was right. \"I need to drug you again.\" \"No!\" she shouted at him, struggling against the ropes. His eyes were cold as he looked down at her. \"I can't let you see where you're going. It's either that or I put you in the trunk.\" Tears started falling down her cheeks as she thought about the overwhelming sense of helplessness she felt when she was drugged. \"I don't care where we're going, honestly. Just please don't make me go to sleep again.\" Despite the tenderness that he had shown towards her earlier, and the fact that he had said he loved her, his eyes were now filled with an anger that scared her senseless. \"You will do as I say,\" he said as he stopped the car. He got out of the car and came round to her side, yet instead of sticking a needle in her straight away like she expected him to do; he reached forwards and picked her up. She was so shocked by this that she did not struggle as he took her round to the back of the car. By holding her tightly against his body he managed to open the trunk of the car with one hand. Surprisingly gently he placed her on her feet, and she stood next to him and watched as he took out several items of clothing from the back. He then took out a knife from his trouser pocket and told her to turn around. She gasped a sigh of relief as the knife cut through the ropes and she moved her hands around a bit to get the blood circulating better. Richard stared down at her and his eyes said that if she moved he would not hesitate in coming after her. He handed her the clothing and told her to change into them. She stared at the shorts and long sleeved t-shirt that he had handed her. \"Now?\" she asked. He nodded and continued to stare at her. A slow brush crept across her cheeks as she realised that he expected her to change in front of him. She also realised that she was expected to change in the middle of the road. However she was glad to see that at least the road was empty. Seeing as he was not going to turn around she decided to instead. As quickly as possible she took off her bloodied clothes and replaced them with the clean ones that he had given her. All the time she was trying not to think about the pleasure that he was sure to be getting from this. 'I'm glad that I wore my nice underwear.' She blushed as that thought went through her head. What a stupid thing to think. When she turned around to face Richard she saw that he looked almost embarrassed and shameful of what he'd just asked her to do. However as he saw that she had turned around, his facial expression quickly turned to one of anger again. How quickly this man changed emotions... She saw that Richard now held a needle in his hands and she felt a shiver of fear run through her. She'd always hated injections and this was the third one that she'd be given today. Her hatred for him intensified. Although she thought of running, she quickly disregarded this stupidity. It was pointless trying. She would not run again until she was certain that she could escape from him. This time as he stuck the needle into her, he was gentler so that she almost didn't feel it. How nice of him. She stood there groggily for a moment as the drugs started to spread round her body, but soon they kicked in properly and she felt her feet give way beneath her. She smiled through the drugs as she felt Richards catch her. 'What a nice man' were the last words that she thought through her drugged state.[Chapter 20] Yes, I know I said that I'd take a while to update, but when I got home I just couldn't be bothered to revise, so I decided to write instead. What a rebel I am :) Richard \"When can you meet up Robert?\" he muttered angrily into the phone. \"I can meet you in around an hour. Meet me at the petrol station that we agreed on before, Kay?\" Richard thought that this was too late, yet he did not say this to Robert. He was after all helping him and without his help he would have nowhere to take Rae. \"Okay, see you then.\" Now that Rae was unconscious again he had taken the opportunity to get out of the car and stretch his legs, as well as sorting out the finer details of his plan. He hated to keep drugging Rae, especially as he knew that she was scared of needles but he had no choice. The call earlier had spooked him out and he had not wanted her to see him when he was angry. It had been the man who he had hired to keep an eye on how things were going back in Canada. Apparently the bodies had been found with traces of his hair still on them, which meant that they had instantly linked it to him. The bodies had been found still burning, only an hour after Richard had driven off, which meant that they had time to put out the fire before the bodies were completely destroyed. He would have laughed at the thought of somebody finding a skip full of burning corpses but his humour seemed to have waned slightly at the thought of being caught by the police. With the police now searching for him he knew that it was going to be much more difficult to look after Rae. Luckily for him though Rae's mother still hadn't reported her missing, although her father hadn't been found either. He didn't think that the police would link Rae's disappearance to him anyway, but he still wanted to get as far away as possible before they found out that she had gone. Now that he had phoned Robert and sorted out the details, he decided that he might as well start driving, as he wanted to reach the petrol station as soon as possible so that he could meet with Robert. It was convenient also that he needed petrol anyway, which gave him the opportune motive to stop. Before he started to drive off again, he looked back to check that Rae was okay. Upon seeing that she looked fine he started up the car and drove off down the road. An hour later and he was sitting in the small restaurant that was next to the petrol station, with Robert opposite him. They both had cups of black coffee in front of them. He had been forced to place Rae in the trunk a few miles up the road, but he knew that she would not wake up for another few hours. They would be in there new home when she woke up anyway. He still felt guilty though. However he was forced to leave his thoughts of Rae behind, as he had to concentrate on the conversation that he was having with Robert. Richard had met Robert a few years ago whilst doing community service but they had kept in touch. It was almost exactly the same circumstances in which he had met Jason, except Robert was an old man who had been caught using counterfeit money. And anyway, Richard was using Robert for a legal matter. Robert reached into his pocket and took out a small key ring which held only two keys. He handed it to Richard. \"Here are the keys to the house. There's both the back and the front key there.\" \"Thanks for this. You don't know how much I appreciate it,\" Richard said as he slipped the keys into his jacket pocket. Robert sipped his coffee before answering. \"It's no problem. The house is just sitting there unused, so I might as well let you use it for a while. Well, that is at least until you can get set up with your girlfriend.\" His bright blue eyes twinkled and he smiled warmly at Richard. Richard had been forced to lie to his old friend and say that he was going to live there with his girlfriend. He'd had to lie because he knew that Robert would eventually find out that there were two people living at his old house. It made sense if he lied to him now, so that he would not get suspicious in the future. Nodding his head, Richard took a large sip of his coffee. Right now he was dying for some alcohol but he would wait until Robert went before buying any. He had always scalded him for his drinking habits. Richard and Robert talked for another ten minutes about what they had gotten up to in the past few months (of course Richard had lied about most of the events that had happened) before Robert finished his coffee and stated that he had to get back to work. Richard thanked him again before watching as his friend walked out of the restaurant and got into his old, beaten up Volkswagen, before driving off. Before Richard could leave however he went into the petrol station and bought a small bottle of vodka. He was longing to buy a larger bottle and drink himself calm, but he knew that he could not drink that much whilst driving. Once he was back in the car and out of sight, he opened up the bottle and downed it in three large gulps. He felt the familiar warm, burning sensation spread through his stomach and throat, and a smile came to his lips. It was almost the first time that he had felt happy since he had started this all. Although he had been happy once he had gotten Rae, the emotion had soon faded as everything had gradually become more complicated. Plus Rae was always unconscious (albeit because of him) which meant that he could not talk to her, like he loved to do. He was in an awful lot of trouble and he just hoped that he could get out of it. \"Only half an hour to go and then we'll be in the house and everything will get better,\" he said aloud to himself as he started up the car and reversed out of the parking lot and back onto the main road.[Chapter 21] Thank you so much for the reviews! Special thanks to 'Beza J.', 'trickterstink' and 'stillstanding13' :) It's great to know that you all like my story so much. You guys give me the push that I need to write :) So once again, thanks! Rae When Rae first woke up she thought that she must have been in a dream. She could feel the soft sheets of a bed underneath her and she could smell waffles. Once she had opened her eyes that it was in fact not a dream, and that she really was lying on a white bed with the smell of waffles wafting around her. However the room that she was in was not hers, so she knew that everything that had happened before was still real. The room that she was in had cream wallpaper (covered in purple flowers) and oak furniture. There was a wardrobe, as well as a small desk and a chest of drawers. All of a sudden she didn't want to get out of bed. She wanted to lie in bed and pretend that none of it had ever happened. She wanted to pretend that she was back home with her mother lying drunk and passed out on the sofa. Anything was better then the truth that she was currently living in. She would have gone back to sleep, if Richard had not chosen that moment to walk into the bedroom. He had changed into different clothes and he was now wearing a bright red shirt and a pair of denim jeans. His hair was, as always, tied up into a pony tail. \"Ah, you're up,\" he said, a big smile on his face. \"I made you some waffles.\" He handed her a plate with waffles and maple syrup. She placed it on the desk next to her, not feeling very hungry. His face fell but she ignored him, instead choosing to stare blankly at the wall with her knees brought up to her chest. She knew that he had joined her on the bed, because she felt the bed depress slightly next to her. \"You have to eat,\" he said softly. \"I'm not hungry.\" Suddenly his face came into her view and she could see the dark look on his face. \"You'll be staying here for a while Rae, maybe even forever, so you better get used to being around me.\" \"What's to stop me from escaping? You can't keep me forever, don't be ridiculous.\" He stood up agitated at her words. \"Look outside Rae. You'll see.\" Every inch of her wanted to ignore him, but her curiosity got the better of her and she stood up and looked out of the window. However she cried out in anger when she saw several metal bars blocking the window. She stared angrily at him but he didn't react. \"Look outside,\" he repeated. She knelt on the windowsill and looked through the gaps in the bars. What she saw made tears of anger come to hers. There was nothing. All she could see were just grey pavement and a dark forest. \"No!\" she shouted. She jumped off of the windowsill and ran past Richard towards the door. She could hear his footsteps behind her but he didn't try to stop her. Quickly she found the stairs and she ran down them as fast as she could, before finding the front door and yanking it open. As she ran out to the front of the house, she had to stop as she took in the site before her. It was even worse then she had first thought. Her eyes scanned left and right, trying to find signs of any life, but there was nothing. She was surrounded by forests and pavement, nothing more. \"Where the hell are we?!\" she shouted at him, tears of anger still rolling down her face. \"We're in the middle of nowhere.\" His eyes shined with joy and all of a sudden she lost it. As she ran towards him she lashed out and started kicking and punching him. However she was still weak and clumsy from the drugs, and he easily stopped her. His fists made manacles over her wrists and he held them tightly against his chest. Despite the fact that she was sure to have bruised him, he was not angry. \"You don't understand, not yet, but you will soon my love.\" She started crying and shaking and he held her tightly against his chest, despite her struggling. \"It's okay. I'll make everything okay,\" he whispered into her ear, in a voice that was meant to sound soothing, but sounded more threatening. Eventually he let go of her and she took several steps away from him. \"Let me go,\" she pleaded. She was trying to make herself sound as sad and desperate as she could, and not surprisingly it did not take much acting on her part to achieve this effect. \"You want me to be happy, right?\" He crossed his arms, and she could tell that he was trying not to be effected by her tears. \"Of course, but I believe that in time you will be happy here.\" \"How could I be happy here!\" she shouted at him, her anger returning all to quickly. \"You've taken me away from everything that I've ever known!\" He didn't say anything but his hands were starting to shake, and she could tell that he was trying to stop himself from getting angry. If she had been in the right state of mind then she would have shut up, but after everything that had happened in the past few days she could not quell the anger that was rushing through her. \"You're a mad man and you need help. You must be crazy if you go around kidnapping people and expecting them to be happy with living with you.\" She gasped in pain as he slapped her hard around the face. His face, before being angry, was now filled with shock at what he had just done. Her hand went to her face and she held her cheek in her hands. \"Rae... I'm so sorry-\" Before he could see anything else she ran inside, and went back up to the bedroom. She slammed the door behind her and collapsed against it, before sliding to the floor. Her cheek felt hot and was stinging from the sharp slap that she had received from Richard. How could he have done that to her? She expected to cry, but no tears would come. He wasn't even worth crying over anymore. Footsteps sounded from outside, stopping before they reached her room. She knew it was Richard and she expected him to try and enter the room but after a while nothing happened and she assumed that he had gone somewhere else. The hate that she felt for Richard was so strong at the moment that it consumed her and she had to tighten her hands into fists to stop the rage that ran through her. The anger quickly transformed into terror at having to be in the same house as Richard. For several hours she sat there with her back pressed up against the door. Her slight form was shaking all the time.[Chapter 22] I know I didn't post anything yesterday, so here are two chapters to make up for it :) Richard How could he have hurt the girl he loved? He hated himself more then words could say. When he had gotten to the house with her he had thought that everything would change, that she would change him. He hadn't expected her to get angry at him. Could she not comprehend the love that he felt for her? He thought that it was pretty darn obvious that he loved her and just wanted to protect her. But when she had called him crazy he had just lost it. He had regretted it immediately afterwards, but by then it was too late to take it back. When she had ran upstairs he had followed, but he knew that he could not talk to her. She would only become more upset and agitated. So instead he sat outside her room, leaning against the wall. From inside her room he could hear her crying and he had to fight so hard not to go in there and comfort her. 'She hated him.' His breath was taken away from him as he thought this terrible thought. What if she did? How was he supposed to go on if she didn't even like him, let alone love him? Tears fell down his face as these thoughts swirled around his head. He was embarrassed that he was crying. Men should not cry, he thought to himself. That's what his father had told him. 'Crying is a sign of weakness and weakness is not an option. Never reveal that you are weak.' He could almost imagine his fathers face as he said these words to his eight year old son. Richard was at a loss as to what to do. He couldn't bring Rae home, not after everything that had happened. She would tell someone about him, and he didn't want to go to jail. Anyway he couldn't lose her now, not when he felt such strong feelings for her. Fuck this mess that he had gotten himself in. Fuck the feelings that he felt for the girl that hated him so. Fuck everything. He was so agitated that he went downstairs and searched through the cupboards for some alcohol. Luckily for him he saw that Robert also seemed to enjoy vodka as well, as there were several bottles in the cupboard. He didn't bother to try and find a glass, instead drinking straight from the bottle. As he drank he tried to stop the thoughts from whirling around his head by closing his eyes and gulping down as much of the vodka as he could, without being sick. His thoughts became so dark that he couldn't even think properly anymore. Her name kept going round and round in his head. Rae. He could remember the way that she looked at him with hate filled eyes. Rae. The way she looked at him with terror. Rae, Rae, Rae. He just wanted it all to end. He loved her so much but he didn't want to live if she wasn't around, and he knew that she would never love him. He stood up and stumbled towards the cabinet. His fingers pushed all the medicine aside until he found what he was looking for. Aspirin. Clumsily he opened up the lid and poured the pills into his hand. For a while he stared at them, not sure what he was doing. Did he really want to do this? Did he really want to die? His thoughts were such a mess that he couldn't catch hold of them to try and work them out. However before he could even decide a sudden wave of dizziness spread through him and he collapsed to the floor. The pills fell out of his hand and scattered onto the floor. While on the floor he reached around and tried to grab some of them, but only one was close enough for him to reach out and grab. Although he knew that it wouldn't do anything, he swallowed it anyway. \"Dammit,\" he whispered. He couldn't even attempt to kill himself properly. Could he do nothing right? He was lucky that when he fell he had kept hold of the vodka, so he continued drinking from it until the bottle was empty. Instead of trying to get up and get another bottle, he instead lay on the floor and waited for the alcohol to make him go unconscious. He didn't have to wait long.[Chapter 23] Rae Whilst she had been sitting on the floor, she couldn't help but wonder what Richard had been doing. She thought that he would have checked on her by now, and although she was grateful for this, she was also worried. She swore out loud at these thoughts. Why was she worrying about the man who had drugged and hurt her? On the table there still sat the waffles that he had made for her and although she was hungry, she couldn't stand the thought of moving. What if Richard was waiting for her outside? She realised how paranoid she sounded and decided that maybe it would be good if she moved. As she stood up she nearly fell over as her muscles tried to remember how to work. Eventually she could move normally again, so she slowly opened the door and peeked outside. He wasn't there. She took several cautious steps out and saw that he wasn't in the corridor either. She felt herself relax slightly. However she knew that he must be downstairs somewhere. When she got to the bottom of the stairs she saw that he was lying on the floor of the living room. An empty bottle of vodka lay next to him, as well as a scattering of white pills. 'Oh god!' she thought to herself. She rushed forwards and knelt down next to Richard's unconscious form. Her fingers went to his neck and she checked his pulse. Luckily he was still breathing. Carefully she turned him over and poked him gently in the stomach. \"Richard?\" she whispered. \"Come on Richard, wake up.\" He groaned quietly and swatted at her hand away. It was a start. \"Richard,\" she said firmly, \"Get up.\" Once again he groaned, but this time he started to move. She had to hold onto him before he fell back down again. \"What have you taken?\" she asked him. His eyes flickered open and he stared groggily at her. \"Rae?\" he murmured. \"What have you taken?!\" she asked him. By now her voice was almost at a shout. \"I only took one aspirin, sweetie. I couldn't get to the rest.\" He giggled at this. Rae breathed a sigh of relief as she realised that he was drunk and hadn't overdosed. It was wrong to feel relieved about this, she knew that. She should have been wishing him dead for all the things that he had done to her. Maybe she was the one who had mental problems. \"Come on. We need to get you up.\" Slowly, she lifted him up and started to drag him over to the sofa. Once he was on the sofa she grabbed a blanket from one of the arm chairs and draped it over him. He fell asleep almost immediately. Rae realised something in that moment. She could escape. This would be the only opportunity that she would get. For a while she had to think about what to do, but she eventually decided on a plan. First she had to see whether there was a car outside. She couldn't remember seeing one when she ran outside, but then again her mind had been had been preoccupied. When looking outside she saw that there was indeed a car parked in front of the house. However she had two problems. One, she didn't know where she was and two, she didn't know where the keys where. She decided to deal with the latter first. Surprisingly it did not take her long to find them, as she found them in the kitchen draw. It seemed that that was a rather stupid place to put them. Oh well. At least it made her life easier. However finding out where she was, turned out to be a lot harder then she had originally thought. First, she could not find a map. Second, she had been unconscious for the journey so she had no clue at all where they were. He had given her no hints as to where they would be going. Nonetheless she decided that she would just have to take a risk and drive around until she found someone who could help her. Before she left, she checked on Richard, just to make sure that he would not choke on his vomit whilst she escaped. She did not want him to die after all. She decided that it would be good if she had a coat as well, so she took the one hanging on the hook. She assumed that it belonged to Richard. Once she was certain that Richard would be okay, she walked outside and unlocked the door to the car. She was glad to see that she knew how to control the car, despite the fact that she had not yet received her driving license. Starting up the car, she noticed how low the petrol was and swore loudly. She just hoped and prayed that it would be enough to help her find someone who would help her. As she drove along the road she noticed that it was starting to get dark, and she started to panic slightly. What if she got lost in the dark? She tried her best to keep these thoughts to the back of her head. She wanted to concentrate on the positive. After she had driven for half an hour and still had not found anything, she started to seriously panic. To top it all off a flashing red exclamation mark kept flashing up on her dashboard, to tell her that her petrol was becoming increasingly low. Once another few minutes had gone by the car made a funny spluttering noise, before completely stopping. Her heart dropped. Now her worst fear had come true. She was stuck in the middle of nowhere and it was now almost completely black outside. Only now did she realise how cold it was, and how tired and hungry she was as well. She silently cursed her bad luck. Deciding that she could not do anything till the morning she scrambled to the back of the car and lay down. She just hoped that Richard did not wake up until late the next day, so that she had a chance to get away. She wrapped the coat tightly around her as a cold wind swept through the car and eventually fell into a fitful sleep.[Chapter 24] Richard He struggled to open his eyes, the alcohol running through his system making him want to stay quiet and still. He wondered what the time was as he looked blearily around the room. There was no sunshine shining through the windows so he assumed that it was night time. Gradually his bleary vision changed, and soon he could see clearly again. As he looked down at himself he saw that a blanket had been draped over him. Then he remembered that before he had been on the floor. How had he gotten to the sofa? Rae, he realised suddenly. Somewhere through his drunken memories he could remember her dragging him to the sofa. He decided that maybe he should check on her, so he walked up the stairs and knocked on the door to her room. When she didn't answer he knocked again. He didn't want to walk in without her permission, as she would just become either more angry or terrified of him. However after a few minutes of waiting outside her room, he decided that the urge to see if she was okay was stronger then the want to make her happy. As he opened the door and looked around the room he thought that perhaps he was still drunk and wasn't seeing properly. Rae wasn't in there. He even walked around the room and checked underneath the bed, just to make sure that she was hiding from him. Pretty quickly he realised that she was not in there. A small part of him was starting to panic by this point but he ignored it and attempted to look around the house. Once working out that she was not in the bathroom, kitchen or his bedroom, he knew that she had gone. Slowly and almost as if in a dream, he walked over to the door and opened it, only to see that the car was not where he had parked it outside. 'Fuck,' was the only thought that went through his head. He wasn't sure whether to be angry, worried or upset. He did know however that he needed to get her back. The car had low petrol and it seemed to be an especially cold night tonight. That and the fact that he did not want her to escape. Walking quickly over to the small garage that was attached to the side of the house, he pulled up the garage door and turned on the light. There was the other dark green car that he had not been planning to use. It was after all Robert's car and not his. However he had no choice, he had to get Rae back. He grabbed the car keys and started the car up before driving swiftly out of the garage. He did not need to bother locking up the house, or closing the garage door, because there was no one around to try and break in. Already he had decided that Rae would have gone right instead of left, because to the left there seemed to be only more trees and forests. Unfortunately for Rae it made no difference, because which ever way she turned she would be driving for up to two hours before she came even close to civilisation. As he drove he realised that he was already starting to become more sober. He wasn't even weaving as he drove at well over sixty mph down the road. After twenty minutes he came across the car. He could not see Rae sitting in the driving seat, but he assumed that she would either be in the back or somewhere near by. From out of the glove compartment he grabbed a flashlight and turned it on as he got out of the car, and walked towards Rae's car. Shining the flashlight into the car he saw Rae's slight form as she huddled up underneath a blanket. She was so wrapped up that he couldn't even see her underneath the many folds of the blanket. He tapped on the window with his flashlight, but she did not react. Trying the door he found that it was unlocked and he opened it up, before leaning over and lifting up the blanket. Too late he realised his mistake, as he saw the coat and various other objects that had been shoved underneath the blanket to make it look like a person. Before he could even turn around, something heavy and sharp struck his head and he fell forwards into the car. He almost lost consciousness but something was telling him that this would be stupid. While he turned over he saw that Rae was standing over him. Her eyes were wide and she looked shocked at what she had just done. \"Rae,\" he muttered, his eyelids starting to droop. \"Richard,\" she said sadly, and to hear her say his name was something that made his heart swell. \"Don't do it.\" He knew what she was going to do, and he couldn't cope with that. \"Please, don't leave me,\" he begged, and all of a sudden felt tears fall down his face. As she watched him cry, tears started falling down her face as well. \"You should have just given me a choice,\" she said softly, \"Maybe things would have turned out different if you'd just given me a choice.\" His voice was slurring as unconsciousness threatened to overtake him, but he carried on speaking nonetheless. \"But I love you, Rae. I love you!\" She leant forwards hesitantly and her lips pressed up against his ear. Just before he lost consciousness he heard the words that she whispered. \"Maybe I would have loved you if the circumstances were different, but this is wrong. It needs to end.\" Oh, oh, oh! I'm so sorry for leaving this chapter like this, but I'm writing the next chapter as I speak. :) Don't worry, I still have quite a lot more to add to this story. I was originally intending to end this story in another couple of chapters BUT I've just thought of a way in which I can make it longer and carry on writing. Yay :) xx[Chapter 25] You guys must hate me so much ~Hides from the abuse that is hurled at her~ but its really, really, really not my fault. I was unexpectedly 'thrown' (In a way I s'pose) out of my house so I haven't had access to my laptop for a fair few weeks. That and I've had to do a vast amount of revision for my vast amount of exams that are coming up. :) So I hope you'll forgive me, and I'll try and update more frequently. :) X Rae As Rae looked at Richards unconscious form in the backseat of the car, she felt slightly sick. She'd just knocked out a man twice her size with a rock to the head. Only fifteen minutes ago she had fully woken up from her fitful sleep. The first thing that had gone through her mind was that Richard would probably wake soon, and then he would come for her. She had been so scared of this thought that she had decided to take off her coat, and make it look as if she was sleeping underneath a blanket that she had found in the back of the car. That meant that if he did come for her then she would have a chance to escape before he could grab her. Her original plan had changed however when he had actually arrived. She had been hiding at the side of the road to when he had driven up. She hadn't anticipated the anger that surged through her at the sight of seeing him, which was why it had been a shock to even her self when she had picked up the rock and whacked it against Richards head. And now he was unconscious in the car. Her only problem now was what the hell was she meant to do? She couldn't just leave Richard in the car here. It was extremely cold out and she was scared that he would get ill, especially as no one would be able to find him. However she also knew that she could not go back to the house with him, because by that time he would have woken. She decided to compromise between the two. She picked up his legs, and after a lot of pushing she managed to get the rest of his body into the car. Then she took the coat and blanket and placed it over him. She estimated that he would be awake in around a few hours time, (or so she hoped) which meant that the clothes and blankets should be more then enough to keep him warm. She was scared beyond belief. What if he came after her again? Or what if she got lost and could not make her way to civilisation? However she knew that she could not stay in the car with Richard until he woke up. She wanted to get back home to her parents and sister. Also her father was still missing and she wanted to know if he was safe. It took her a while to build up the confidence to walk away from him and get into the other car. Starting up the car she took a deep breath before driving past Richard and the car. Taking one last look in the rear view mirror she took in as much as she could about the car and the surrounding area before driving off into the darkness.[Chapter 26] One year later Rae \"And how do you feel about this?\" Rae stared into the corner of the room while her Psychiatrists voice filled her mind. Always the same damn questions. \"How do you feel about this?\" Bad. That's how she felt about it. What else did they expect her to say? \"Oh, it was great. Everything that happened a year ago was so much fun. I can only hope that this year will be just as exciting.\" For a year she had had to deal with the constant questions that various medical people had asked with. That and the police who constantly pestered her. That dreadful night six years ago she had managed to make it home, not that it had been easy. Somehow she had located the local village, although to be honest after she had gotten off the never ending road that she had previously been on it hadn't been that hard. It had taken a long time though. For over an hour and a half she had driven like a mad woman until she had found the village. She'd never been so grateful to see houses and people, even if there weren't many of them. When she'd gotten out of the car she had almost kissed the ground at her feet. It hadn't been that hard to find the local police station but it had taken a fair few hours to explain everything that had happened. The police had been baffled. They were such a small police force that she was certain that the biggest crime case that they'd come across was the case of the missing chicken from the local farm. Of course the only thing they could think of to do was call the larger police station that was nearby. She was shocked to find out that they were still in California. It had seemed like they were in a completely different part of the world. \"Are you going to go and get him?\" she had asked with her voice quiet and almost forbidding. They'd replied that they'd already sent someone and it was at that point that she had fainted. When she woke up she'd been confused, thinking that she was still with Richard which was why it was a relief to find that she was still in the police station. \"You're safe,\" they'd assured her, but she'd been doubtful whether she'd ever feel safe again. They never brought Richard back to the police station, so she'd never had a chance to see if he was okay or not. At the time she had been glad of that small fact but a year later she was wishing that she'd had the chance to see him, just to check if he was okay. A few days later she had been reunited with her mother and sister but it had been far from a happy occasion. She'd only been missing for a few days but her mother had already called the police to report her disappearance. However she was told that her father had been found dead, apparently having committed suicide. What with this and everything that had happened in the past few days Rae had broken down. For weeks she sat in her room and refused to eat or talk to anyone. She was lucky that she had given her statement to the police before she had visited her mother because otherwise she didn't think that she would've had the strength to make it. She was told while in her state of depression and denial that Richard had pleaded guilty for what he'd done and had been put in prison. For how long Rae could not remember as her mind had been elsewhere when they had told her. At some stage she'd been given a Psychiatrist and had been forced to talk to her several times a week. Surprisingly it helped her, although she would not always tell the truth in sessions. She'd been asked what she'd felt about Richard and she'd said that she hated him. Simple right? Maybe not so simple. Sure, it was true that she hated him but that was not all she felt towards him. She hadn't admitted to the other feelings that she'd felt for him. Like the kindness that she felt towards him or the way that she frequently worried about him. However, a year on she felt as if she was finally getting somewhere with her life. Sure, she still had bad nightmares and had some bad days, but nowadays the good days outnumbered the bad. Together her mother, sister and her had managed to get through the death of her father and they were an almost fully functional family again. Her mother had cut down on the alcohol and had gotten a boyfriend (who she had just got engaged to) and together they had become a much closer family. Unfortunately she still had to attend the stupid sessions with her Psychiatrist. \"Rae?\" She was broken from her reverie by Penny (her Psychiatrist.) \"Hmm?\" \"I was asking you how you felt about your mother getting remarried.\" \"Oh, it's fine. I mean, he's a nice guy. I know he's gonna look after her.\" \"You don't think it's too quick for your mother to be getting re-married?\" Rae hadn't even thought about this which was why the question shocked her. \"No. If he makes my mother happy then who cares?\" Penny smiled at her, \"Exactly. It's good to know you feel that way.\" She glanced at the clock and closed the small book that she kept all her notes in. \"Looks like our times up. I'll be seeing you next Monday and you can tell me all about your prom.\" Resisting the urge to laugh Rae shook Penny's hand and said goodbye to her. Tonight was her prom night and she was surprisingly very excited. She didn't have a date but together with her friends they'd decided to go in a small group. All girls together and all that. It would be better that way. Tonight was the night that would bring together all the good things that had happened in the past year. If only she knew how badly things were going to go wrong. It's been a while since I've added to this story so if anything's wrong or if you have any criticisms then please tell me :) x[Chapter 27] Richard 'Oh, how the months had passed drearily by without his Rae.' Richard looked at the line that he had just written in his diary and immediately rubbed it out. It sounded like the start of some kind of love poem. However it was true. The months had passed drearily by without her. Despite the fact that she had escaped and called the police he did not blame her. Love was confusing. He of all people knew that. It was just going to take her a while to realise her feelings for him. Luckily for her he loved her so much that he was willing to wait until she started to understand her feelings and make sense of them. He just wished that he didn't have to be in prison. The people there were strange and vicious and he definitely did not belong with them. Sure, he was a murderer, just like many of his fellow inmates but his circumstances were different. He had killed for love, not for pleasure. Of course he had tried to explain this to the jury but they had not explained, simply calling him psychotic. What did they know? They knew nothing of love. They knew nothing of the burning desire that two lovers felt for one another. No one understands how he feels, only Rae, and even she was confused. Several times he had tried to post letters to her but they would not let him. They said that he was not allowed to contact her directly or indirectly. Were they intent on torturing him? It was bad enough that he was stuck in a prison, thousands of miles away from her, but to not be able to write to was simply torture. The feelings for her grew stronger every day. So strong in fact that he had resorted to writing them in a diary, just to let some of his thoughts out. One day he vowed to show it to Rae, just so that she knew how strongly he felt for her. Today, however, he had decided that he would set his plan to escape in action. He could not cope much longer in this hell hole. A world without Rae was a world that was not worth living in. That's why he had decided if his escape plan failed then he would kill himself. No point in living without her. His plan was simple. For several days he would lay on his bed, facing the wall, all the while ignoring any food that was left for him by the Prison Warden. Then he would kill his fellow inmate with one of the plastic knives. The words seemed cold to him when thought. However he personally thought that he would be doing the guy a favour. Every day he would complain about how hard his life was and how he couldn't wait to leave the prison. Well Richard would be doing that for him. Sure, he didn't think that leaving in a body bag was quite what his cellmate would be thinking of, but still. You can't get everything that you want in life, can you? Three days later It had worked! He had escaped. Surprisingly it had been easier then he'd thought. Once he had killed his cell mate he had placed him in his bed so that it looked like he was still there. It had been clever to place him there because it meant that it would take them a while to realise who had escaped. He'd then broken through the air vent and had managed to climb through until he had eventually gotten outside. The security guards had been so caught up in looking for his cell mate that they hadn't noticed him slipping past. He was now driving away in a car that he had 'taken' (so to speak), from a man who'd been driving up to the prison. Now he was driving towards California and he was on his way to Rae. Finally. He'd taken his diary with him, still thinking that he could show it to Rae. He was certain that she would be glad to know that he'd been thinking about her in his long stay away from her. Whilst driving he thought about how much she would have changed since he'd last seen her. A whole year had passed, long enough so that she could be a completely different person. Appearance wise he would say that she would have become curvier, or at least he hoped so. She'd been reasonably skinny before, probably from the stress of her family. He personally knew how stressful it could be, living in a home filled with abuse and anger. In a year she would've done a lot. By now she would've left college and moved on to University. He wondered at what she would have taken. Art maybe? He hoped so. Either way he couldn't wait to meet up with her again. They had so much catching up to do. When he met her again he knew that it was going to be different. She would love him, he was certain of it. And if not... well, he would just have to persuade her and help her understand her feelings. Otherwise what was the point... in anything?[Chapter 28] Rae Cautiously she stared at her reflection in the mirror, trying to work out whether she looked good or not. Her prom dress was pretty, she knew that. It had been bought a long time ago by her mother and she had only worn it once. Strangely enough it fitted Rae perfectly. The dress was black and fell just past her knees. It was corseted and laced at the back and she had made sure to tie it tightly. Her shoes were black and high heeled, with ribbons that twisted half way up her legs. She had tried to keep her make up simple by only outlining her eyes in kohl and putting on some light pink lip-gloss. As for her hair, she had left it down but had curled it so that it hung down in her back in shimmering golden curls. However she still couldn't work out whether she looked pretty or not. It was hard to look at herself through somebody else's eyes. Eventually she gave up trying to work it out and instead walked downstairs. As she walked into the living room, where her mother and sister were waiting, she was treated with a shocked silence as they looked at her. Her mother was the first to break the silence. \"Oh Rae. You look so beautiful.\" Tears of happiness were streaming down her face. When her mother hugged her, Rae herself had to hold back the rush of emotion that overcame her. \"You've come so far in the past year,\" her mother whispered into her ear, before holding her at an arms length and looking down at her. \"The dress fits you perfectly.\" Once her mother had let go of her, her sister came up and hugged her as well. \"You look so pretty Rae,\" she said. \"Thank you Louise.\" From outside came the beep of a horn which indicated that her friends were waiting for her outside. \"Ooh! Are you sure I look okay?\" she asked her mother. \"Yes! You look wonderful. Now go and have fun.\" She gave both her mother and Louise another hug before grabbing her small clutch bag and walking outside. As she saw the black limo waiting outside she had to cover her mouth to stop herself from screaming. She felt slightly hysterical. \"Oh my gosh!\" she cried out to her friends as she ran over to the limo and climbed inside. As she sat down and closed the door behind her, she was suddenly attacked by three screaming girls hugging her all at once. \"Rae!\" Rachel shouted at her, being the first to let go of her. Rachel's died red hair had been piled up onto her head in an intricate dress, and she was wearing a light green dress. \"Mind the hair,\" Rae said jokingly to Jess and both Jess and Sarah let go of her. \"You look amazing!\" Rachel shouted, as she looked Rae up and down. \"You too. In fact all of you look amazingly beautiful.\" \"It's good that we didn't bring any guys with us. They're not worthy of this beauty,\" Jess said jokingly, flicking her long black hair over her shoulder. They all laughed. Rae admired Jess's dress. It was deep red, incredibly short and was made from a material similar to satin. \"Ooh! Rae! Did you bring the mix tape?\" Sarah chirped in suddenly. Rae reached into her bag and took out the cd that she had spent all of last night working on. \"Of course. Here you go.\" Sarah took the cd from her and carefully placed it into the cd player. They all screamed, covering there ears as Leathermouth blasted out the speakers far too loudly. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry!\" Sarah said, turning the volume down so that they could hear each other again. \"I love your dress Sarah. Did you make it yourself?\" Rachel asked. Rae looked down at Sarah's dress for the first time and gasped. It was amazing. Sarah's dress was a deep sky blue with a silver border at the bottom. The fabric stopped well above her knee revealing an awful lot of leg. Covering the top half of the dress were over fifty fabric Roses that Rae assumed Sarah had made herself. Her dyed blonde hair had been kept loose and straight, but she wore a small flower clip to keep her fringe out of her face. Rae was amazed. \"Wow Sarah.\" Sarah made a small, high pitched noise which was meant to be her laugh. \"Thanks y'all. Yeah, I made it myself. My ma helped me though.\" \"It's amazing,\" Jess said, agreeing with what everyone else was saying. \"Hey, come on y'all. We're going to prom! Enough talk of dresses. Let's partaay!\" The music was turned up louder and they all started head banging along to the screaming vocals of Frank Iero. After a while Jess attempted to stand up and rock out, only to bang her head on the roof of the car as they came to a sudden stop. They all collapsed in there seats, giggling like mad women. \"No!\" Rachel shouted suddenly. \"We'll mess up our make up and hair. Stay still.\" They all froze mid giggle but the sudden attempt at being serious just made them laugh even more and once again they all collapsed in laughter. As Rae and her friends continued laughing, she realised that she wasn't laughing just at Jess falling over but at everything that had happened in the past year. Never before had things been so good for her and she couldn't believe it. She had three amazing best friends, who she loved more then anything and her life finally seemed to be working itself out. Right now, she had the feeling that nothing could put a dampener on her mood. A knock on the screen behind which the driver sat sounded and the music was turned down so they could hear what he said. \"We're here ladies.\" As one they screamed before giggling even more. \"Okay, calm it everyone. We need to look normal when we got out of this limo,\" Rachel said. She was always the sensible one. Rae took a deep breath before stepping first out of the limo as she was nearest the door. \"Ohmygosh!\" Rae said on one long breath as she took in the scene before her. The theme for the prom this year seemed to be celebrities because leading into the hotel that they had booked was a long red carpet. A bunch of people were outside, behind velvet ropes and were taking pictures of them. At the moment a spotlight was aimed at her and her friends as they stepped out of the limo. From behind her she could hear her friend's exclamations of shock. Rae looked at her three friends, standing in a line in front of the limo and smiled at them. \"Well, lets not wait around. Lets go in.\" She linked arms with Jess and she followed her lead by linking arms with Rachel, who in turned linked up with Sarah. As one they walked up the red carpet, there hips swaying in time and smiles on there faces. Rae didn't see Richard. Nor did she see the large smile on his face as he took in the beauty before him. \"Soon my love, soon,\" he whispered to himself, before disappearing into the shadows.[Chapter 29] Richard \"Oh, I'm clever, far too clever,\" he said to himself as he looked at the poster. 'Gradfelt University Prom' it screamed at him in bright pink letters. He felt incredibly happy at how well this was all turning out. It was almost as if it was fate. With the town only having one university nearby, it was not hard to work out that this was the one that Rae would be going too. What a coincidence that tonight was the night of the prom. It would be the perfect meeting opportunity for them. It had been surprisingly quick to reach the town where Rae lived. On the way he had been forced to steal some clothes from a washing line, as he had the feeling that he might stand out if he was wearing the bright orange prisoner clothes. As he drove to the town his only worry had been that she might have moved house. However, from the financial situation that her parents had been in before, he very much doubted that they would have been able to afford to move. Or so he hoped. When he'd driven up and parked a few blocks up from her road he'd clearly seen the dark blue car that belonged to her mother parked in the drive, and his shoulders had sagged in relief. He hadn't realised how worried he had been until he saw that she still lived at the same place. If she had moved then he would have no way of knowing where she was, and then he would have nothing else to live for. After he knew that Rae still lived at the same address he had then driven up to the local shop so that he could buy some much needed necessities such as food and drink. Outside the shop had been where he had found the poster and their fates had been sealed. There was no way that he could pass up the opportunity to see her in her prom dress. She would look beautiful. However the prom did not start for a while yet, which meant that he had a couple of hours to kill. The groaning of his stomach made up his mind about what he would do. Going into the shop he knew that he had no choice but to steal the food. The man whom car he had stolen from had had a wallet, but he did not have much money and Richard needed to save it for when he found Rae. He kept an eye on the mirror in the top corner of the shop as he slipped a mars bar, a packet of crisps, a bottle of orange juice and an apple into his jacket pocket. Luckily for him the person on the till was a teenager who was far too interested in the magazine that they were reading to even notice that he'd walked into the shop in the first place. Walking out of the shop he felt proud of himself. He'd never stolen anything before and he had to admit that it felt good. He had a feeling however that he'd be doing it a lot in the following days to come. When back in his car he grabbed the packet of crisps out of his pocket and tore greedily into the bag. For three days he had not eaten and he was starving. Within a few minutes he had finished the crisps, only to start on the mars bar and the orange juice. He decided to leave the apple for later in case he became hungry later on. He then drove back to his position a short while up Rae's road so that he could wait for her to come out. Now he had nothing else to do but wait so he sunk down in his seat whilst keeping an eye on the house. An hour later a limo came round the corner and stopped outside Rae's house. Richard sat up straight, assuming that it would be for Rae. He was proven right when she came out. His breath was taken away as he saw her for the first time in over a year. She was so much more beautiful now. Her hair had grown lighter and her skin darker. The black dress that she was wearing looked beautiful on her. It clung to her body, showing off the curves that she now had. \"Oh Rae,\" he whispered, every part of him wanting to run over there and touch her. He wanted to inhale the scent that he had missed so badly. Before these thoughts could overcome him Rae got in the car and the limo drove off. He waited a while before following behind. When he saw that the limo was about to turn into the road which led to Heathlands Hotel he drove away and parked the car in the car park nearby. As quickly as he could he ran to the building opposite the hotel and hid in the shadows. He watched as she stepped out of the limo along with three of her friends. However he was not interested in what they looked like. He only had eyes for Rae. He smiled as he took in the beauty before him. Soon my love, soon,\" he whispered to himself, before disappearing into the shadows. His plan was simple, but first he needed to find out if they had any rooms in the hotel. \"We have several rooms, sir. Would you be interested in any of them?\" The man at the desk of the hotel asked him. \"Yes please.\" \"Do you have any preference of floors?\" he asked. Before he could answer a young girl interrupted. \"Please can I have the keys to our rooms? Third floor. The reservation should be under Delaney.\" Richard had to look away from the girl, so that he could hide his shocked expression as he heard Rae's last name. \"Thanks,\" the girl said as she took the four sets of keys from the man. \"Sorry about that sir,\" the man continued, \"Which floor would you prefer?\" \"Third floor would be good.\" As he signed a fake signature on the paperwork he could not help but think how well this was all planning. With any luck he would be with Rae again tonight. \"Thank you sir,\" the man said as he took the papers back and handed him his key. \"I hope that you have a pleasant stay.\" \"Oh I will,\" he replied, a smile spreading across his face.[Chapter 30] Rae As one, they all gasped as they looked at the inside of main hall. Rae was amazed. Somehow it was even more impressive then the outside. They seemed to have stuck with the celebrity theme because as they walked in the first thing they saw was there faces on a giant screen. They laughed as they saw there shocked faces projected on the screen. The rest of the room had been made up like an L.A club of some sort, as there was a large dance floor in the centre, along with a raised platform. Lights flashed around them and the music was so loud that it seemed to make the room shake. Together they walked out of the way of the camera that was pointing at them and joined the rest of the crowd on the dance floor. \"I'm gonna go and get the keys to our rooms. Be back in a minute,\" Rachel shouted to them above the music. They nodded back at her, not wanting to shout over the music. For a while they danced together, and when Rachel came back with the keys she joined them. However, after a while they all became tired and decided to sit down. \"Oh crap,\" Jess said as she looked into the crowd, trying to hide her face behind her hair. \"What?\" Rae asked, trying to see who Jess was hiding from. After a minute or two she saw a group of girls walking through the crowd towards them and she attempted to hide her face as well. It was Chrissie, their arch nemesis, along with her friends. \"Hey girls. You enjoying the party?\" she droned in her nasal voice. \"Hey Chrissie. Well, yeah, isn't it just, like, amazing?\" Sarah said, making her voice nasal like Chrissie's, sarcasm dripping from her lips. \"Well, haha Sarah. You're so funny I forgot to laugh. Anyway, I helped to make this prom the amazing event that it is, so you should be thanking me.\" Her request was met with complete silence from all four of them and she sneered down at them, trying to find something that she could insult about them. Her eyes landed on Sarah's dress. \"Oh gosh, Sarah. It looks like you're wearing half of the clothes that I threw out last week. Why'd you cut them up and make them into that monstrosity?\" Her eyes went to Rae's and her sneer grew more evil. \"Rae. You could have at least tried. Your dress is so... simple,\" she laughed and her friends joined in. Jess stood up angry, but Rachel stepped forwards and grabbed onto her, stopping Jess from doing anything. \"Come on Chrissie. We're just here to have fun, like you,\" Rae said quietly. \"Yeah, well don't do it near me, okay? You freaks keep away from me,\" and with these spiteful words she walked off with her friends to be swallowed up by the crowd. \"Oh I hate that bitch,\" Jess snarled angrily. Rae nodded, agreeing with Jess. \"Come on guys, just leave it. I meant it when I said we were here to have a good time, okay? Don't let Chrissie ruin it.\" Trust Rachel to calm everyone down. Jess nodded, reluctantly agreeing. \"Maybe we should go to our rooms and freshen up,\" Sarah suggested. They all agreed. \"Where are our rooms?\" Rae asked Rachel as they walked through the lobby and towards the lifts. \"Third floor. You and Rae are sharing a room and me and Jess have got a room together. Two beds in each room of course.\" \"Yay!\" Sarah cheered, running forward to link arms with Rae. She dragged her forwards so that they could reach the elevators but as they moved forwards Rae stopped in shock. She thought she'd heard a familiar Irish accent. \"Was that? No. It can't be.\" she said quietly to herself. That voice... \"Rae? Are you okay?\" Sarah asked, worry evident in her voice. \"I'm fine. I – err- just forgot something. I'll see you guys in the room in a minute.\" Rae detangled herself from Sarah and walked off before they had a chance to stop her. As she went back to the desk she saw a man standing at the desk, with his back facing her. Was it him? \"Richard?\" she asked cautiously The man turned around and she gasped a silent sigh of relief as she saw that it was not him. \"Sorry sir. I thought you were somebody else.\" The man smiled politely back at her and continued talking to the receptionist. She walked off, feeling a sense of relief. However as she stepped into the elevator she realised that when she had thought that it was Richard she hadn't only felt nervous but had also felt excited. Why would she have felt that? He had killed two men as well as kidnapped her. If anything she should feel anger at seeing him again, not excitement. Muttering swear words to herself she pressed the button for the third floor and waited for the lift to go up. Once she had reached the floor she realised that she did not know what room number she had. \"Sarah? Rachel?\" she called softly as she walked up and down the corridor. One of the doors opened and a man came out with a baseball cap covering his face in shadow. However before she could ask him whether he had seen her friends, she heard Sarah calling her name from up the corridor. \"Rae! This way,\" she laughed at the rhyme. Rae nodded at the man before walking up the corridor and into the room. \"Oh my gosh Sarah! This is amazing!\" Rae exclaimed as she walked into the room. It was much more posh then any of the hotels that she had previously stayed at, not that there had been many. There were two beds placed on either side of the extremely large room, with a large space in the middle that was filled with a television and a sofa. There was another room with was to be there bathroom. She only briefly looked inside but from what she could see the bath was huge. \"I know, right,\" Sarah said, in agreement to Rae's reaction. \"Which beds mine?\" Rae asked. \"Well I've picked this one, because ya know I like sleeping close to the door, so that one's yours,\" she replied, indicating to the bed next to the wall. \"Aha, sounds good to me,\" she replied, before throwing herself on the bed and giggling. Sarah walked over to her bag that she had placed on the sofa and took out a small metal flask. \"What's that?\" Rae asked, suddenly suspicious. \"Just some vodka,\" she giggled in reply. \"Want some?\" \"Well...\" Rae said thoughtfully. \"Oh come on Rae. It's hardly gonna get you drunk.\" Rae sighed before taking the flask from her and swallowing a gulp. She had to cover her mouth, to stop herself from spitting the burning liquid out. \"Oh hell Sarah. No way is that just vodka,\" she said, after her throat had eventually stopped burning. Sarah giggled, \"Okay, there might be a teeny, tiny bit of tequila in there and possibly some whisky as well. \"Well it tastes disgusting,\" Rae replied. \"Aw, come on Rae. It's nice.\" Sarah snatched the flask from her and took a sip. Rae watched in amazement as she didn't even flinch when the liquid slipped down her throat. \"Wow Sarah,\" Rae exclaimed, expressing her amazement. \"I know right,\" she giggled. Sarah slipped the flask back into her bag before grabbing onto Rae's arm and leading her out of the room. \"Come on; let's go get Rachel and Jess.\" Rae only just had time to shut the door behind her before Rae dragged her down the corridor and into the room next to theres.[Chapter 31] Richard Richard opened the door to his room and watched as Rae looked up at him. He wanted to reveal himself to her, so badly, but he knew that it was dangerous. He was glad that he had had the sense to wear a baseball cap that cast a shadow over his face. She only looked up at him briefly, not managing to recognize him, before her friend called her and she walked away with a nod of her head. Damn. His eyes followed her as she walked up the corridor and disappeared into the room, exclaiming an \"Ohmygosh!\" at what she saw inside. At that moment when he saw her, he wanted nothing more then to grab her and hold her body tight against him. He would have revealed himself to her if she had not had friends with her. It was just his luck that she would not be by herself when going to the prom. Not that he wanted her to be lonely. He wanted nothing more then for her to have friends, but at the moment it was not convenient for him. After a few minutes of staring at the place where Rae had previously been standing he heard someone coming up the stairs, so he went back into his room and closed the door behind him. He had to admit that the hotel room was very nice and very big. It was maybe a bit too fancy for his liking but he was still impressed. He just wished that he had someone to share the room with. The expansiveness of the room only seemed to intensify his loneliness, causing it to burst out of him in waves. Rae was only a few rooms away from him and he wanted to see her so badly that it was an almost physical pain in his gut. \"Just wait for the opportune moment,\" he said out loud to himself, as he paced up and down the room. \"She'll be left alone at some point. I just need to wait.\" He didn't realise how soon this would be until he opened up his door and walked up the corridor, as if to get in the lift. Instead he was waiting to see if Rae was going to come out. After he had walked up the corridor a few times he decided that he had better go to this room to avoid looking suspicious. However, just as he was in the room and was about to close the door behind him, he heard the sound of a door opening. Cautiously he stuck his head out of the doorway. Coming out of the room that Rae had gone into were two girls, one with black hair and the other with dyed red hair. He had seen them earlier with Rae, so knew that they were friends of hers. The girls got into the elevator and disappeared from view, but nobody else came out of the room. This was the opportune moment for him. Standing outside the door of the room he wondered whether he should knock or simply walk in. Deciding that it would be best to knock, he raised his hand and knocked twice on the door. He waited in apprehension for Rae to answer, but was shocked as the door opened and another girl was standing in front of him. She had blonde hair and her eyes were unfocused as if she was drunk. \"Hello,\" she said, smiling warily at him. \"Hello,\" he copied, not sure who she was. What was he meant to do now? \"Is Rae in?\" he asked. \"Oh, yes,\" she said to him before calling out over her shoulder, \"Rae! Get your butt over here. Someone's here to see you.\" Her eyes went back to him, her eyes roaming up and down his body as if taking him in. \"You Rae's boyfriend? Because if you are, then I am extremely jealous.\" Before he could reply Rae's sweet voice came from behind her. \"Sarah, what the hell are you saying? Who is it?\" Her face appeared and he saw how much she had changed. Her face had lost some of the puppy fat that she had originally had, so her face was now a lot slimmer. Her cheekbones were more prominent but the effect was not sickening. Instead it cast shadows on her face, making her more interesting to look at. When first appearing behind the girl she had been smiling, but when she saw him he watched as her face fell in shock. \"Richard?\" she whispered, her hands moving to cover her mouth. It was obvious that she was shocked to see him, but who could blame her. It had been a while. \"Rae,\" he replied with a smile on his face. \"Who's this?\" Sarah asked, looking between the two of them, her face a mask of confusion. \"It's Richard Newman,\" she explained quietly. \"The man who kidnapped me.\" Sarah laughed but stopped when she saw Rae's face. \"You're joking, right?\" Rae shook her head, obviously not able to say anything. \"Rae, it's okay. I'm here now,\" Richard said, trying to reassure her. Why was she still so shocked? He expected her to be happy to see him, at the very least. Rae seemed angry now, instead of shocked. \"You can't be here Richard. You should be in jail.\" \"But my love, I need you. I couldn't cope in there without you.\" \"I don't care Richard. You need to leave, now.\" An unexpected burst of anger surged through him and he took a threatening step towards Rae and Sarah. \"Don't fuck with me Rae. I know how you feel about me so don't even try and deny it. I need to be here.\" Richard watched, almost in triumph, as fear clouded Rae's features. Sarah however seemed just as angry as he was. \"Who the hell do you think you are mister, coming in here and threatening my friend? Why don't you just piss off?\" While she had been speaking to him, she had walked up to him and her face was pressed against his. \"Sarah,\" Rae warned but before Sarah even had a chance to back off Richard had grabbed her by the hair. \"Don't you dare tell me to piss off,\" he said as he pulled her backwards by the hair, causing her to cry out in pain, \"You don't know who I am or what I am capable of.\" \"Stop it Richard,\" Rae cried out, running up to him, but he pushed her to the ground. He threw Sarah to the ground alongside her and ran into the kitchen. Grabbing the sharpest knife he could find from the kitchen drawer, he ran back into the living room to see the two girls still on the floor. He was breathing hard as he looked down at them. \"Now, Rae. If you don't do what I say then I am going to have no choice but to kill Sarah here.\" He ran the knife over his finger to show her how sharp it was. Blood dripped from his finger to the floor. \"I need you to find me something that I can tie Sarah up with. Off you go Rae.\" When she didn't stand up he grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her roughly up. The fear in her eyes almost made him feel guilty but he knew that she would be fine once she realised that he loved her just as much as she loved him. He watched carefully as she walked into the other room, before turning back to Sarah who was still lying on the floor. Tears were running down her face. \"I think that you and I shall have some fun Sarah,\" he said, as he leant down and pressed the blade against her throat, drawing blood.[Chapter 32] Thank you for everyone who has 'subscribed' to my story and is following it, but an extra special thanks to everyone who has reviewed. If it wasn't for the reviews then I would have given up on this story a long time ago, so thanks :) x Rae As Rae looked for something to tie Sarah up with, she had to fold her arms around her chest to stop herself from shaking so much. How could Richard be here? He was meant to be locked up in a prison far away from her, but no. Here he was, tormenting her and her friend. Unwillingly a sob was forced from her as she thought about Richard being in the other room with Sarah. What was he going to do to her? Would he kill her? And what about herself? Deciding that it was best not to dwell on things that may never happen she went to the bathroom to try and find some rope or something. Maybe it would be best if Sarah was tied up. It would mean that when Rachel and Jess came back then they could get some help for her. Realising that the only thing she would be able to find would be some kind of fabric, she picked up several long towels as well as some spare shower curtains. Suddenly from the other room there came a scream, followed by a sickening thud. Dropping the towels and curtain, Rae ran into the other room. She had to place her hands over her mouth to muffle the screams that came from her mouth as she looked at the site before her. Richard was standing above Sarah with his knife covered in blood, and as she looked down at Sarah she saw that her chest was covered in blood as well. He had stabbed her. \"What the hell have you done?\" she screamed at him as she ran over to Sarah. \"She threatened me,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"I just lost it.\" Rae looked up at him with disgust as he wiped the bloody knife on the sofa with shaking hands. She grabbed the cardigan that she was wearing over her dress and pressed it over the wound. \"She needs medical help.\" \"Oh, really? Well why don't I just go downstairs and ask the person at reception whether they would kindly call the ambulance because I just stabbed someone. Yeah, Rae, well done.\" \"Fuck you Richard,\" she shouted at him. He reached down and grabbed her roughly by the arm. \"What do you expect me to do Rae? Do you want me to go to prison again?\" She avoided his question, knowing the answer that she would give would not be the one that he'd want. \"You can't let her die.\" His eyes were cold and heartless as he looked down at her but she made sure to look as sad as possible, which under the circumstances was not very hard. \"Please,\" she begged. \"Fuck.\" He let go of her arm and threw her to the ground. \"Okay, okay. I'll go and get someone to help, someone I can trust.\" \"Who? What do you mean someone you can trust?\" \"There was this man that I used to know in prison. He was let out a few weeks ago, but he was a medic. He doesn't live too far from here.\" She didn't know what else to say so she nodded. As long as Sarah did not die, she did not care who treated her. \"Do you have a mobile?\" he asked. She shook her head. \"Fuck. I'm gonna have to go downstairs and make the call then.\" 'Yes' she thought to herself. If he left her alone then she could get some proper help for Sarah and maybe even call the police. \"Okay but be quick,\" she said, whilst hoping that he would take his time. \"Rae,\" he said seriously, obviously seeing something in her eyes, \"Do you really think that I'm going to leave you in this room so that you can call for help? I'm gonna have to tie you up.\" \"No!\" she begged. \"Don't Richard, please.\" He looked down at her and for a moment there was a hint of remorse in his eyes but then he blinked and he was the usual heartless Richard again. Shaking his head at her, he walked into the bathroom and picked up the towels and curtains that she had dropped. \"Put your hands behind your back,\" he demanded. When she refused he grabbed her and forced her arms behind her back, causing her to gasp in pain. Within a few minutes he had tied her arms and legs up, and had placed her in a chair. \"What about Sarah?\" she asked. \"She'll bleed to death if you leave her.\" \"She'll be fine for a few minutes. I won't be long.\" With these words he slammed the door behind him and left her tied up in the hotel room, with her friend bleeding to death on the floor next to her. There should be another chapter up later on because I'm starting to really get into this story again :)[Chapter 33] Richard Richard greatly regretted stabbing that girl. He had simply lost it when she had threatened him. How dare she say that he would be locked up in prison? Well he would show her. He'd show them all that he could take charge and handle everything. Tucked into the waistband of his jeans was the knife that he had used to stab Sarah. He wasn't sure whether he was carrying it for protection or just for comfort, but either way it felt good to have it with him. \"Please may I make a phone call?\" he asked, as he reached the reception desk. \"Of course, sir. There's one just up the corridor that is specifically for guests.\" He nodded his thanks and walked up the corridor towards the phone. On his way he passed one of the girls that Rae had been with. For some reason she stared up at him as he walked past and he could have sworn that he saw a hint of recognition in her eyes, which is why when he reached the phone he did not pick it up straight away. He was thinking hard. Where had he seen her before? And then all of a sudden it hit him. Rachel Marcel. She'd been a student of his when he was an art teacher at Rae's school. He hadn't recognised her straight away because she had died her hair from brown to red. \"Shit,\" he muttered to himself as he saw her staring at him from across the room with a look of complete panic on her face. He didn't want her to know that he knew she was staring so he picked up the phone and pretended to dial a number, all the while watching her discretely in the reflection of a frame. Now that she thought he was busy he watched as she ran over to the elevator. However it was obviously not coming quick enough because she gave up on the elevator and instead ran towards the stairs. \"Gottcha,\" he thought to himself as he placed the phone back in its cradle and walked quickly towards the stairs. As he sprinted down the stairs he could hear Rachel's heels against the concrete of the stairs. \"Rachel,\" he said, loud enough for her to hear but not loud enough that it would scare anyone else. From below he heard the clicking of heels stop and he took this moment to run and catch up with her. \"It's been a while, Rachel.\" Her face was shocked and filled with fear as she stared up at him. She tried to run but he reached forward and pushed her, causing her to go toppling down the stairs. She cried out as she fell but he did not go after her, instead choosing to stand and watch her from a distance. Quickly she managed to get up and pathetically attempted to run away from him. He didn't even bother running after her, deciding that he would make this into a game, making it more interesting. A crackling noise sounded from nearby in front of him, so he knew that she was not too far away. As he pulled a piece of plastic aside he saw that they were in some kind of storeroom where they held spare bits of furniture for the hotel guests. From the waistband of his jeans he took out the knife and held it at his side. \"Rachel,\" he whispered, knowing that she could hear him. His voice echoed pleasantly back at him and he couldn't help but marvel at the effect that he would sure to be having on the poor girl. \"I'm not going to hurt you,\" he continued. She must have heard the lie in his voice because she did not reveal herself to him. From his left he heard a light rustling and he walked towards the source of the noise. \"Is that you Rachel?\" he asked. All of a sudden something slammed him in the side and he gasped, falling to the floor at the impact. \"Fuck!\" he shouted, as he saw Rachel run past him, disappearing from sight. On the floor next to him lay a large trolley. Carefully he pulled himself, deciding that nothing was broken. \"You shouldn't have done that Rachel! Now I'm really angry,\" he shouted, the echoes repeating his words back at him. He walked forwards, being more careful this time. His ears were kept alert and he was using all his senses to watch out for her. Seeing a shadow pass by to the left of him he ran forwards and slashed the plastic aside only for a flock of pigeons to come flying out at him. He cursed, knowing that she would now know where he was. A footstep sounded from behind him but he was alert and he turned around and slashed at Rachel, just as she attempted to whack a piece of chair across his head. Satisfied, he watched as she dropped the piece of wood and gasped in pain. He got behind her and grabbed her hair pulling her backwards. \"You bitch. Nothing can keep me and Rae apart, nothing.\" He took a brief moment to relish the fear that fear that filled her eyes before he stabbed her in the chest. Once. Twice. He carried on stabbing her until he was certain that she was dead and then he threw the body to the floor and collapsed to the ground. His breath was being ripped out of him, in short, sharp gasps and it took him a while to compose his breathing. Whether it was the fact that he had done too much physical exercise, or the fact that a trolley had been slammed into his side, he did not know but either way he was exhausted. After he could breathe normally again, he looked down at his bloodied hands. It was strange, but he felt no remorse. Jessica deserved it. She should have realised that no one could get between Rae and him. There love was far too strong for that. He groaned as he realised that he now had the problem of trying to hide the body. However he brightened up slightly as he saw that there were plenty of places to hide her. Finding a cupboard that was about the same size as Jessica, he picked up her feet and started dragging her along the floor. It took him a while to actually get her in the cupboard, as although she was reasonably light, it had been a while since he had done any physical exercise. Once she was almost standing in the cupboard he took one last look at her bloodied form before slamming the cupboard door shut and locking it with a key that he had found in the drawer. Remembering that he was meant to call his friend for Sarah, he figured that it was too late. She was probably already dead now. Oh well. One less person to get in between him and Rae. With this thought he walked up the stairs, back towards his Rae, chuckling darkly all the way.[Chapter 34] Rae As soon as Richard closed the door behind him, Rae struggled against the towels that he had bound her with. She couldn't sit here while her friend lay bleeding to death next to her. It was harder to try and escape from the chair then she thought. He had tied her up pretty tightly and there was no way that she would be able to rip the towels in half. \"Sarah!\" she shouted to her friend, seeing her eyes start to close. \"Please Sarah. Don't close your eyes. Talk to me!\" \"Rae,\" she whispered back to her. \"That's it Sarah. Stay awake. Everything's going to be okay.\" Sarah chuckled lightly but gasped as if it caused her pain. \"Don't lie to me Rae.\" Tears started to trickle down Rae's cheek as she realised that her friend was going to die. \"I'm sorry Sarah. I'm so fucking sorry,\" she sobbed. \"It's not your fault sweetie.\" She was starting to slur her words. \"But it is! If it wasn't for me then he wouldn't be here in the first place.\" \"Don't think like that Rae, please. S' not your fault.\" Sarah's eyes closed and Rae shouted at her to wake up but her friends eyes stayed closed. \"Fuck,\" she screamed, thrashing desperately against the chair and towels. However she only attempted to fall over, crashing her head against the floor. \"Sarah,\" she whispered, tears still falling down her face. \"Please, don't leave me.\" She reached forward and tried to drag herself across the floor towards her friend but she was too weak and she soon gave up. For a while she kicked out, trying to break the chair but it seemed impossible to escape. Instead she decided to try screaming for help instead. Maybe if someone walked past then they would help her. \"Help me!\" she screamed, over and over, but no one came. She soon gave up, her voice soon becoming hoarse. All of a sudden the door came crashing open and she saw Richard illuminated in the doorway. \"Was that you screaming?\" he asked, closing and locking the door behind him. He walked swiftly over to her and dragged her and the chair up. She didn't answer him, not wanting to speak to him. He must've noticed something in her eyes, or even seen the fresh tears still on her cheeks because he looked down at Sarah. \"Is she dead?\" he asked. \"Yes!\" she screamed at him. \"You killed her! You're a fucking murderer!\" \"Shh Rae,\" he said, walking towards her and wrapping his arms around her. \"I'm sorry my love, I'm so sorry, but she was asking too many questions. I regret it now, but it's too late to go back on it. We're just going to have to live with the consequences.\" If she hadn't been tied up then she would have lashed out at him, but she couldn't and her anger eventually ebbed away, only to be replaced with a sadness that ran deep within her. \"I hate you,\" she whispered. He pulled away from her and looked into her eyes. She couldn't help but notice that his brown eyes that had once seemed warm were now cold and lacking emotion. \"You don't hate me Rae. You hate what I've done and I can understand that.\" \"No Richard. I hate you .\" She expected him to get angry but he did not. Instead he grabbed a chair from the dining table and placed it in front of her, before sitting on it. \"Don't tell me that you've always hated me. There must have been a time when you loved me, even liked me.\" For a moment she thought about lying to him, saying that she always hated him and always would, but she knew that it would be pointless. She had always been terrible at lying. \"Yes, there was a time.\" She was purposely avoiding his intent gaze as she spoke to him. \"When I first saw you in that classroom a year ago I thought you were good looking and I almost enjoyed the attention that you used to give me.\" She laughed pathetically at the memory. \"But then you took me away, without even asking me whether it's what I wanted. Then you denied me my freedom and that joy started to fade away. But then after they'd arrested you and locked you up I started to become worried about you. I knew that you wouldn't be able to cope locked up with all those criminals. I used to have nightmares about you killing yourself when in prison and I used to wake up screaming and crying. I think that I realised at that point that I did love you, but then you did this Richard. You tied me up, threatened me and killed my friend. Do you really think that I can forgive you for what you've done?\" \"Rae, I'm sorry for what I did but I was confused. I didn't know whether you wanted me or not and I just wanted you so badly.\" She shook her head. \"My friend is lying on the floor, dead, next to me and I think that the only reason I'm not screaming about is because I'm in shock. You killed her Richard. Her blood is on your hands.\" Something suddenly came to her as she looked at Richards bloody hands. \"Your hands didn't have any blood on them before. You didn't even use your hands. What the hell have you done?\" She watched as his face froze and he turned away from her gaze. \"It's nothing,\" he replied. \"What do you mean it's nothing? Tell me Richard. How did you get that blood on your hands?\" \"Someone got in my way. They were going to tell someone about you and I couldn't let that happen. I need you Rae.\" \"Oh god Richard.\" Her breath came out of her in sharp gasps as she thought of what he might have done to yet another person. \"Did you kill them?\" \"No,\" he said defiantly, but she could tell that he was lying. \"Fucking hell Richard!\" she shouted at him. \"Now can you see why I can't love you? You need help.\" He took a step towards her and got down to his knees. He pressed his palms together so that it looked as if he was praying. \"Please Rae,\" he begged. \"Please love me. I need you to love me.\" \"I-I don't know what to think Richard. Maybe... maybe if you got some help then I'd be able to love you.\" \"Help?\" he asked hesitantly. \"What do you mean help?\" \"Call the police Richard. Tell them what you did. Get some psychiatric help.\" \"No!\" he shouted at her, standing up. \"They'd put me in prison and then you'd never be able to see me again.\" \"But I'd be able to see you in prison. It'll be better for you if you give yourself in.\" All of a sudden there came a knock on the door and they both froze. A voice came from outside. \"Is everything alright in there? I heard shouting.\" \"Oh no, oh no, oh no,\" Richard muttered over and over. \"I need to get out of here.\" Rae regretted the words as soon as they came out of her mouth, but she knew that she couldn't let him kill someone else. \"Richard. Climb out of the window.\" \"No, Rae. I can't leave you.\" \"You have too.\" He looked at her for a long moment before reaching forwards and kissing her on the cheek. She had to resist the urge to flinch away from him. \"I'll come and find you Rae, soon. I'll show you I can change,\" he said as he climbed out of the window. He gave her one last look before disappearing from view. \"Help!\" she screamed. \"Open the god damn door.\" \"Miss? Are you okay?\" the voice from behind the door asked. \"No. There's... a dead body in here. You need to call the police. But first, please, open the door.\" \"Ok. I'm going to break the door down. Get back.\" She didn't have the strength to tell him that she could not move back. Several loud thuds sounded before the door came crashing open, bouncing off the wall several times. The man covered his mouth in shock as he saw Rae tied to a chair and the bloodied body next to her. As she saw her reaction, all of the energy disappeared from her and she must have collapsed because the next thing she knew - darkness. When she woke up it was to a beeping noise, which was incredibly frustrating and repetitive. The room that she woke up in was extremely white, and machinery surrounded her. She assumed that she was in a hospital. Someone must have realised that she was awake because the door opened and two police officers walked in. One was a man with short blonde hair and the other was a woman with red hair. She was suddenly reminded of Sarah and she had to swallow hard to make the sudden lump in her throat disappear. \"We know you've only just woken up but we'd like to ask you some questions if that's okay with you,\" the woman police officer said. Rae wanted to say that she was too ill to talk but she knew that if she left it then it would only be harder to lie to them. \"Sure,\" she said. She expected the two police officers to take a chair but they both stayed standing, with the man taking out a notepad, assumingly to take notes with. \"Who was it that tied you up and killed Sarah and Rachel?\" the woman police officer asked. Rae looked at them in disbelief. \"Rachel? What do you mean? Rachel isn't dead.\" The two police officers exchanged a puzzled look. \"Both Rachel Marcel and Sarah Johnson were found murdered in the hotel.\" \"Oh gosh,\" Rae whispered, tears streaming down her face. She was in shock. \"You didn't know Rachel was dead?\" they asked. She shook her head. \"No.\" \"I'm so sorry. Was she your friend?\" \"My best friend.\" Suddenly the fact that two of her friends were dead overwhelmed and she suddenly couldn't breathe. Her body started to shake so violently that she couldn't control it. \"Nurse!\" one of the police officers shouted. She heard the door open and someone touched her neck but she couldn't concentrate. Noises surrounded her but they were meaningless. Her friends were dead and all because of that monster. He knew that he'd killed Rachel as well as Sarah and he hadn't even told her. Something sharp dug into her arm and then the darkness overwhelmed her once again, causing her dreadful thoughts to disappear. She was so grateful. She couldn't have taken much more.[Chapter 35] Two weeks later Rae She drove up to her house and parked her car on the road outside, noticing that her mother's car was already parked in the driveway. Before entering the house she took a mint from her purse and started munching on it, so that it would disguise the smell of alcohol that was on her breath. That seemed to be all she'd done in the past two weeks, drink. It distracted her, made her numb. When she opened the door to her house the first thing she noticed was how quiet it was. The television was on but there were none of the normal noises of chatting and people moving around. She walked in slowly, the alcohol having made her slightly tipsy and slightly incoherent. She was about to call out her mothers name but something stopped her. Whether it was the thought of being caught smelling of alcohol, or the feeling that was something was wrong she did not know, but either way doing this might have saved her life although she did not know this yet. She threw her jacket on the sofa and turned off the television which seemed too loud in the silence of the house. Slowly she looked around thinking that maybe they were out, but then she remembered that she had seen her mothers car, and she would not have been able to get anywhere without it. They lived too far out to be able to walk anywhere. Walking over to the stairs, she heard a sound from above. A loud crash followed the sound. She proceeded cautiously up the stairs feeling the first feelings of doubt settle in her stomach. First she went over to her little sisters bedroom, expecting her to be sitting on the floor and playing with her dolls like she usually did but she wasn't there. The light was on but there was nobody in. She then went to her bedroom deciding that maybe they had gone out in her mother's car in a rush, and that was why all the lights were on, but deep down she knew that this was not the case. Then she heard the crash again. She realised at this point that all of the sound was coming from her mother's bedroom. She heard a scream from within and took a quick step backwards just as the door came crashing open. The scream that was just about to come out of her mouth was stopped mid flow when she saw her mother being dragged out by a man in a baseball cap and dark clothing. He paused as he saw her and her mother looked up at her with frightened eyes. Her mother was covered in blood and Rae could tell that she was hurt by the way that she winced as he struggled with her. With a quick move of his fist he threw her to the side. She didn't get up again. Rae's breath was coming out in short gasps now. She wanted to see if her mother was alright but she could not move. She could not see the mans face as he walked towards her, as it was covered by shadow but then when he was almost in front of her he looked up and this time she managed a scream. She had to cover her mouth to hide the hysteria that was spreading through her. His face was twisted and contorted in a mixture of love and anger, but all the same she could still recognise him. It was Richard Newman. \"Richard?\" she asked, her voice shaking. \"Rae! Oh I'm so glad you're here.\" He took a step towards her but she moved backwards. \"What are you doing?\" He looked down at her mother's unconscious form before looking up at her with a smile on his face. \"I worked it out while you were gone.\" She was confused. \"Worked what out?\" \"It's your family that's stopping you from being with me.\" \"My family? Richard, where's my little sister Louise?\" \"Gone,\" he said simply and she felt her feet collapse from underneath her. He ran towards her but she screamed at him to stop and he obeyed her. Her hands were shaking and she felt as if everything was falling around her. However no tears would fall because she was in shock. \"Oh Richard,\" she sobbed. \"Rae, you're free without them. It can just be me and you, no baggage, nothing to get in our way.\" \"You silly, silly man.\" \"Don't call me silly,\" he shouted at her, stopping her tears. \"I'm sorry,\" she said softly, a plan forming in her head. She took several deep breaths to try and calm herself down. She had to be brave for her mother and sister. \"I'll leave with you.\" He stared at her, shocked. \"You mean it.\" She nodded. \"You're right. I have nobody else. You're all I have left.\" He smiled at her and reached forward to embrace her. If she hadn't been trying to fool him then she would have pushed him away but she needed to be convincing. \"I need to get some stuff from my room.\" \"Of course, of course.\" He grabbed her gently by her arms and pulled her to her feet. He somehow already knew where her bedroom was and led her to it. \"Would you like me to get your suitcase?\" he asked. She was about to ask him how he knew where it was but realised that it would be pointless. She didn't care anymore. \"Sure,\" she said. While he went into her cupboard she reached underneath the bed and picked up the gun that lay there. The gun had once belonged to her father. Ever since Richard had first taken it, her mother had insisted that she kept the gun there, just in case he ever came back. She had thought it ridiculous at the time but now she realised that it might save her life. Raising the gun to the back of Richards head, she was about to pull the trigger when he turned around and stared at her. She kept the gun raised but moved her finger away from the trigger. \"Rae?\" he asked, shocked. \"I'm sorry Richard. I can't go with you.\" His expression changed so quickly that it scared her. He stared down at her sadly. \"I knew it Rae. I just knew it.\" \"I'm so sorry,\" she whispered. \"It's okay. Go ahead, shoot me.\" \"I can't,\" she sobbed. He walked towards her but she didn't lower the gun. He stood in front of her so that the gun was aimed at his chest. \"Do it. Please. I can't live without you anyway.\" \"But I think I love you.\" Her hand was starting to shake. His fingers brushed against her cheek, wiping away the tears. \"I killed people Rae. I'm not right for you. I understand that. I think I always have but I just couldn't admit it, so I killed people, pretending that I was doing right.\" Tears continued streaming down her face. His face moved forwards and almost hesitantly he pressed his lips against hers. The kiss was full of fire and anger, but at the same time it was sweet and loving. It was so desperate that it made her heart ache. She could taste her salty tears on his lips and she loved it. She hadn't realised how badly she had wanted to kiss him. As he pulled away from her, she was about to pull the gun away from his chest when she felt his finger on the trigger of the gun. 'Bang.' She screamed, over and over, as he fell to the floor, blood gushing from the wound to his chest. \"Richard!\" she screamed, leaning over him and holding tightly to him. He looked up at her, his eyes filled with tears. \"I love you Rae, never forget that. I did it all for you. I did it all for you my love.\" His eyes closed and she could feel a coldness start to spread through him as his heart stopped beating. \"No!\" she screamed at his cold lifeless body. \"Don't leave me! Please, Richard.\" She didn't know how long she clung to his bloodied body, sobbing and screaming at the heavens. From downstairs she heard the sound of a door being forced open but she didn't care. She just wanted Richard back. After a while someone gripped onto her shoulders, trying to pull her away from Richard but she screamed at them and lashed out, clinging more tightly to Richard's body. Slowly her senses started to come back to her and she heard people around her talking. \"Three... dead... screaming... called the police... who is he?\" \"He's Richard,\" she answered to the last person who had talked. \"He's the person that I loved.\" Warm arms picked her up but she didn't fight them. She was so tired. \"We'll look after you honey. You'll be okay,\" a kind voice said in her ear. \"I'll never be okay,\" she whispered, before closing her eyes and blocking out the rest of the world. Oh, guys :') I only have one maybe two more chapters to write of this story. This last bit was so sad to write though. :) Hope you like. x[Chapter 36] Rae As she looked at the rifle in her hand she wondered if she could really kill herself. Would it hurt? How much would she bleed? She could already imagine the metal bullet tearing its path of destruction through her body. It had only been two days since her mother and sister had been murdered and Richard had killed himself, yet it had felt like a lifetime. Now that her house was a crime scene she had had no choice but to move somewhere else. As most of her other family members were dead or lived in America, she was forced to move in with an older cousin who she barely knew. Several times the police came round but she refused to talk to them, not wanting to have to remember everything that had happened. Instead she did her best to block out the rest of the world by shutting herself in her room. She would refuse to eat, thinking that maybe she could starve herself to death. However when looking around the house when her cousin was out she had come across a rifle in her bedroom closet. There weren't any bullets in it but it hadn't taken her long to find them. Now she sat in her bedroom, with the gun in her hands, wondering if she really had the guts to kill herself. It was easy to sit down and say that you were going to kill yourself, but it was so much harder to physically grab a gun and press it against your temples, waiting for the courage to pull the trigger. Several times she had pressed the gun against her head, only to drop the gun back onto the bed as if it was made of fire. It was so much harder then she thought it would be. After half an hour of trying to pull the trigger, she was a mess. Tears ran down her face and she couldn't stop shaking. \"For fuck sake Rae,\" she muttered to herself. \"Pull yourself together.\" Once again she lifted up the gun but instead of pressing it against her head; she opened up her mouth and placed the butt of the gun inside. Maybe it would be easier. The metal of the gun tasted foreign in her mouth and a sudden wave of nausea ran through her. She threw the gun to the floor and ran to the bathroom, only just making it in time, before throwing up. After she was sick she felt slightly better but she was still shaking. \"I can't do it,\" she sobbed, covering her face with her hands. Suddenly a flashback of that dreadful night came back to her. \" It's okay. Go ahead, shoot me,\" he'd said. \" I can't,\" she'd sobbed back at him, her hands shaking from fear. He'd walked towards her but she hadn't lowered the gun. He'd stood in front of her so that the gun was aimed at his chest. \"Do it. Please. I can't live without you anyway.\" \" But I think I love you.\" She sobbed even harder as she remembered everything that she had lost in the past year. Her father, Sarah, Rachel, her mother, her little sister and Richard, all dead. It was no wonder that she wanted to kill herself. She had no one else left in the world. \"Fuck!\" she screamed, over and over, until she had no strength left and could no longer speak. \"Rae,\" a voice said from in front of her. She opened her eyes and blinked the tears away from her eyes so that she could see who it was. \"Jess,\" she whispered hoarsely. \"Oh sweetie,\" Jess said, tears falling down her face and making her black, eye make up run. She walked towards Rae and wrapped her arms around her. \"It's okay.\" \"No. It's not,\" Rae sobbed. \"They're all dead.\" Jess pulled her away so that she could look her deep in the eyes. \"I know, but we can't bring them back. We have to live with what we've got and right now, all we have is each other, okay?\" \"Oh, Jess,\" she sighed, wrapping her arms tightly around her friend. After a while Jess pulled away and looked at Rae. \"Were you going to kill yourself?\" she asked hesitantly. Rae nodded ashamedly. \"I thought I had no one left. I didn't think there was much point carrying.\" \"You'll always have someone, Rae. At the moment you have me, but you'll grow older and meet new people and they'll love you, just as much as your mother, sister and friends did. And don't forget that they're all watching you, and always will be.\" Rae had no words for Jess so instead she hugged her, pouring all of her emotions into that one hug. At that point Rae knew that the words Jess spoke were true. She was not alone. She would always have someone there who would love and look after her, no matter what. Deep in her heart she knew that her friends, family and Richard were watching her, making sure that she was protected. For the first time in several years she felt safe and protected from harm, and for that one moment she actually felt happy. And anyway, surely things could only get better? I can't believe it's all over :') I hope you like the final chapter. Thanks for everyone for reviewing and supporting me through the writing of this story. If it wasn't for you guys then I'd never have been able to finish this story. (Soppy much? Haha, but it's true.) I love you, I love you, I love you! Just to inform you as well, that I have another (short) prom night story up at the moment called 'Till death do us part.' I'm also writing a story called 'Taken' which is a transporter fanfic, so if you like transporter then please take a look and review, as otherwise I might just give up with that story :) Also, after watching 'When a stranger calls' (2006 version) again last night, I've decided to write one about the film. It's called \"When A Stranger Returns\" and is set after \"When A Stranger Calls.\" If you like the film then please take a look at my fanfic. Anyway, once again thanks for reading my story! I love you all! :) EDIT: I've added a poll to my profile, asking which cross-over fanfic people would be interested in me writing, so check it out. It depends on how much response I get on the polls, as to whether I will end up writing one. There's a couple of prom night cross-overs I was thinking of doing which is why I have posted this here. ","Summary":" Prologue She drove up to her house and parked her car on the road outside, noticing that her mother"},{"Movie":"Battle: Los Angeles","Title":"Intersections: a Battle Los Angeles story","Author":"Criosd Pherein","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7206571","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 –Back into the fight \"Three minutes to touch down Staff Sergeant!\" the helicopter loadmaster yelled over the roar of the machine's churning blades to the steely eyed Marine who sat beside him scanning the city below him from the rear ramp of the CH46 Sea King. \"Roger that,\" the soldier acknowledged then turned to his men, \"Three minutes people, tighten it up.\" The Marines in the helicopter began to adjust buckles on packs, helmets, ammo carriers, basically anything that could slip or move for the dozenth time. So began the ritual soldiers had been doing for hundreds of years, the deep breath before the plunge. Staff Sergeant Mike Nantz took it all in hardly able to believe he was in this situation. Seventy-two hours before he'd submitted his papers for retirement, sure it was time to move on and try to deal with the ghosts of his past that haunted him. Now the future not only seemed pretty uncertain, he wasn't even sure if Camp Pendleton where his paperwork had been submitted stood any more. He wondered if his friend First Sergeant John Roy had survived. He'd tried to keep those thoughts out of his mind as he absently ran a finger through the cleft of his granite chin, to lock them away in a place to go later. But Mike Nantz was human, not a machine, despite the image the United States Marine Corp tried to project. His thoughts drifted to those who'd fallen: Martinez, Stavro, Mattola, Mr. Rincon…at the thought of the Hispanic man who'd been shot trying to help out during the fight on the freeway his mind gravitated towards the others, Hector, the girls and Michele. He lingered on her, remembering their touch before he roped down from the helicopter, sure he'd die and suddenly sad that he'd not see her again. Her scream as he left the chopper echoed in his mind. With everything going on why was the fact he hadn't seen her before they'd left concern him the most? Why after everything he'd gone through in the woman-department the last few years did he continue to think about Michele? There, he'd named her even, she wasn't just a woman, or the woman, she was Michele. He cursed at himself for feeling this way, something he'd sworn he'd never do again. Hector was one thing; he was a kid, that didn't count, but Michele, that presented a problem. Maybe he'd die today and not have to worry about it. Happy thoughts! \"Thirty seconds!\" The helicopter's engines whined as the power surged preparing to land as fast as possible to avoid any potential enemy fire. Mike had to put that thought away, despite his desire to linger on her face and features: the flowing dark hair, rough and tumble he'd heard some of the young guys describe, the smile, then there were her deep, dark eyes that held a depth of emotion within. A familiar churn of emotion and adrenaline began to build in his stomach, nervous energy, fear. No time for that right now. It's said that those who go into combat and aren't afraid are either lying or crazy. He was neither, he was scared, with the same fear everyone else on the helicopter endured. Nervous energy surged through the Sea King. They were going back into Los Angeles to attempt to re-establish a beachhead to retake the city. With the destruction of the alien command-and-control station the invaders had lost their air support plus it seemed their ability to co-ordinate their activities evening the odds a bit. But the fight was still going to be hard and costly. Mike wondered again if he'd made a mistake going in so soon. Maybe they should have rested a bit, debriefed, but the adrenaline of the moment had him gathering ammo and going back in when he saw the Marines at the new base moving out. The others had instinctively followed. The wound he'd taken fighting against the drone the previous day began to hurt again. Even worse, he felt light-headed. No time for that either. The Marine helicopter powered up to land, bumping to an abrupt halt on the edge of the runway near a hanger whose roof was half collapsed at the Whiteman Airport in San Fernando. This was where the human forces would begin their campaign to retake what had been abandoned earlier. What had seemed impossible had become a reality thanks to the efforts of Nantz and his team. The sound of explosions and light weapon fire on the edge of the airport property greeted the arrival of the newly minted heroes of Los Angeles. Despite the steady chop-chop sound of helicopters taking off and landing the sound of the reality of the war they faced greeted the Marines. There was no time to think about what had just happened the battle to re-take Los Angeles was underway. As the chopper touched down Marines simultaneously leaped out trotting over to a command post set up in an intact hanger. Groups were quickly being put together then sent into battle. Soldiers from a dozen helicopters formed up in a semi-circle around an easel with a large tactical map of the area. A Marine major waited impatiently for all the newly arrived troops to be sorted out so he could brief them on the situation then send them to join in the fight. He had a field dressing on the left side of his face with burn marks evident around the edges of it but his eyes were clear as a blue sky. He spotted the Staff Sergeant in the crowd. \"Nantz, what are you doing here?\" he asked brusquely. \"Getting back in the fight sir,\" Mike responded, recognizing the officer who was from the 2-5. \"Outstanding,\" the major affirmed with a nod of his head. Turning his attention immediately to the rest he began to brief them. \"Okay, you men will form a battle group under Lt. Sanford here. We're attempting to push the aliens away from the airport to use it as a staging area for our operations. We now hold it so we're moving into the next phase. Men, help is coming,\" he declared to encourage the troops. \"The 221st Cavalry Regiment from the Nevada National Guard is on the way and will be here in a few hours.\" \"Tanks from Nevada sir?\" Lt. Sanford asked sarcastically. \"M1A1 ABRAMS tanks from Nevada,\" the major responded testily. \"Listen up, most of our assets in California have been either destroyed or lost. So we've got units that have been mobilized from other states and are being moved here to join the fight as fast as they can. We're not in this fight alone.\" He then fixed the marine lieutenant with a withering look then added, \"We're lucky we can get them or we'd be screwed.\" Satisfied there'd be no more interruptions the bald officer continued, \"They're being trucked in on the Golden State Freeway. They've got good air cover from an attack helicopter battalion from the Arizona National Guard\", he looked hard at Lt. Sanford who avoided the pointed gaze, \"but we need to secure an off-ramp for from the freeway and provide a safe corridor for them to get here and get in the fight.\" Pointing to a street on the tactical map he declared, \"Our job is to provide it along Osborne Street here so we're going to take and hold this road so they can get here.\" The major allowed the men to look over the map and get their bearings before he continued. \"Now there are aliens in the neighborhood. We don't know how many though. Fortunately we didn't have too hard a fight for the airport but as you can hear, we're not alone,\" as if too emphasize the point a large explosion on the edge of the airport erupted. \"We have a couple of gunships providing air support but for the most part we're on our own. Remember, fire to the right of where their hearts would be if they had one, that's the weakest part of their armor.\" He gave a nod of acknowledgement to Staff Sergeant Nantz for it had been his efforts during their rescue mission that had provided this vital information. For his part, Mike was happy to see it had filtered out already. So much happening in so little time. He couldn't believe how his life had changed in less then a week. But there was no time for such musings; again he would be leading people into combat. \"Questions?\" the major asked rhetorically not expecting any. Everyone there knew what needed to be done and the sense of urgency that went with it. \"Get it done Marines. Retreat…\" \"Hell!\" the other Marines erupted. Lt. Sanford led the composite combat team out of the airport and onto Osborne Street. Besides those that had come with Staff Sergeant Nantz there were another three dozen Marines from several other units. A real dog's breakfast. Passing the intersection of San Fernando Road the bodies of several soldiers brought the reality of what they were up against to the forefront. Looking down the road abandoned vehicles and several civilian bodies amplified the point. It was very quiet, not a sound could be heard. The sun beat down adding to the humidity of the August day. None noticed the heat though. The grim sights before them and difficult task at hand kept their focus. To their left the charred remnants of what appeared to be a police station continued to smoke. On the right some form of auto shop stood untouched but empty. Nothing moved though the Marines had difficulty seeing through smoke from something burning outside of their sight. \"Okay, we need to clear the road. First two teams provide cover, the rest get those vehicles and bodies out of the way,\" Lt. Sanford ordered, taking the opportunity of the break to remove his helmet and run a hand through his sweaty close-cropped blond hair. Corporal Lee Imlay and Corporal Kevin Harris, both survivors along with Staff Sergeant Nantz of the mission to destroy the enemy command-and-control ship, looked at the officer nervously as the others prepared to carry out the assignment. \"Sir, we might want to rethink this course of action,\" Mike responded politely. \"We have to get the way clear for those tanks Staff Sergeant. We have our orders,\" the young officer countered. \"I agree but their carriers are big enough to push through this stuff no problem,\" the NCO stated. Then pointing to several more dead Marines lying beside the closest group of vehicles he added, \"Besides, look at them. What do you think they were doing? We know the aliens are still around. It looks to me like they're waiting for us and we know they love ambushes. Better we get off the street and go property to property.\" Sanford opened his mouth to rebut the statement but checked it as the logic of the staff sergeant's suggestion sunk in. He grabbed his radio to give new orders. \"You might not want to use that either sir,\" Mike offered, putting his hand on the unit to stop the action. \"They can trace us using our comms. Voice and hand signals are best.\" The tension of the moment caused the young officer to snap. \"Listen, I know you've had some experience with these things but I've been in the fight too. This is my command. Is that clear?\" \"Crystal, sir,\" Mike responded evenly. But he fixed the crew-cutted officer with a steely gaze. \"Let's get going, we don't have a lot of time.\" Corporal James Lockett, yet another member of the original team, sighed audibly and shook his head but kept his thoughts to himself. Lt. Sanford broke the group into two teams. He led one, Mike the other and they split to each side of the road cautiously beginning to probe forward. \"Lockett, Harris, point,\" Mike ordered. \"Watch the roofs.\" Moving carefully forward, weapons covering all possible points of ambush, they cleared the first block and crossed into a residential area. \"We've got to push back to the next street,\" Mike observed, \"give the convoy a bit of a buffer zone. We go house to house from here.\" He halted the advance and looked to see if Lt. Sanford had caught what they were doing. The officer continued to timidly push forward oblivious to what the other part of his battle group was doing. Mike swore softly to himself. Having the others hold their position the sergeant ran across the road to share the thought with Sanford. The officer agreed to the logic of the observation so arrayed his force the same way. Returning to his section and resuming the steady advance, Mike felt a bead of sweat run down his back. His combat instinct was going off the chart as his heart rate increased. He knew they were being watched, so the exercise became not a matter of if but when. Looking back Mike could see other Marines following their line of advance from the airport. He knew they weren't alone but it was small comfort since they were first in line. Putting that out of his head, Mike focused on the front and task of moving to secure the off-ramp two and a half blocks away. If he were driving his Mustang it would take him about 30 seconds to get there, a minute and a half if he caught a light, but now he wondered if the two hours they had would be enough time. Moving forward the combat team cleared the first house and then the second. Everyone could feel the tension, it hung thick enough to cut. Approaching the third house on the block the distinct sound of an alien grenade launcher spooling up suddenly could be heard high and off to the right. \"Incoming!\" Lockett yelled. The others responded instinctively. All but one young marine moved and hit the ground, guns ready. As the alien with the launcher came into view on the edge of the roof next door to fire Harris shot first, shredding it with his M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. The creature went down firing its grenades harmlessly into the air. The alien ambush tactic had become predictable to the experienced Marines who had witnessed them using similar methods before. Another of the 8 foot tall creatures came from around a fence on the other side of the building loosing a burst of its arm-mounted machine gun into the frozen soldier. The man crumpled to the ground. \"Doc, check him out,\" Mike ordered as he squeezed off three rounds from his M4A1 carbine hitting the alien in the center of the chest causing it to spin around. Corpsman Jibril 'Doc' Adukwu ran to the fallen Marine, despite the increasing fire around him to look for life. Several other aliens appeared out of hiding spots to engage the marines. At the same time bursts of six-barreled machine fire ripped from the roof of the police station on the other side of the street they'd passed. \"They're behind us too!\" Tech Sergeant Elena Santos screamed as she swiveled her M16 around to return fire. \"Santos, take two guys with you and clear out those snipers,\" Mike ordered, \"we need to keep pressing forward. Rally at the next property.\" The Latino Air Force observer, who had shown herself to be a pretty good infanteer, grabbed a pair of the new Marines by his web gear and hauled him into a position to eliminate the threat. Mike knew their rear was safe with her out there. \"Staff Sergeant, he's dead,\" Doc yelled in his heavy African accent to Mike, confirming what he'd already expected about the young soldier who'd been caught in the initial attack. \"Okay, grab your rifle and get into the fight,\" he countered. Aliens poured out of both sides of the home, weapons blazing, trying to catch the Marines in a pincer move that would grind them up. Fortunately for the humans with the tactic becoming predictable the experienced soldiers in the battle group responded right away. Imlay pumped two grenades from his M203 launcher into one group. The whump, whump of the explosions and flying alien body parts showed that group's momentum had been stopped. The steady fire on the other flank from Lockett and Harris held the other ones in check. Tracer rounds flew back and forth like angry fireflies looking for a place to land. Another of the new Marines went down under a barrage of fire from an alien machine gun. Despite the volume of fire Doc Adukwu went to the young soldier dragging him to safety and miraculously not getting hit in the process. The alien's progress checked, Mike rallied his men. Leading the way, M4A1 carbine blazing, they counterattacked pushing the invaders back. One backpedaling alien crashed into a greenhouse in the backyard of the property that quickly became a shower of thousands of pieces of glass when a high explosive grenade was thrown in. The remainder of the ambushers turned and ran as fast as they could on their spindly legs due to the ferocity of the counter attack. But at over 8 feet tall they made great targets and several more had their cylindrical heads blown off. Then Mike saw what he was looking for. Attempting to sneak away in the shadows was the leader of the group. Unfortunately, in its panic it bumped it's head on the lower slope of the house's sun porch giving it away. \"There,\" Mike yelled, \"officer caste. Don't let him get away!\" At close quarters and standing nearly 9 1/2 feet tall it became too hard to miss. Despite its four mechanical legs the alien never had a chance. All the weapons of the Marines turned on it blasting the officer into bits and pieces. With the other aliens totally on the run, Lockett along with several of the other Marines kept up the chase, firing and moving. \"No, no, hold up, hold up,\" Mike yelled, effectively halting the advance and allowing the few remaining aliens to break contact and escape. Lockett fell back to the rally point but the hot-headed African-American turned to confront his Sergeant, eyes blazing. But the sound of battle to their left checked the corporal's angry words. There was more going on here then their own personal scores to settle. The remnant of their platoon was under attack and they seemed to be fairing badly. If Lockett had continued like he'd wanted, their whole section would have run the risk of being cut off. He kicked the ground in anger at himself. \"Imlay, Lockett, with me. We're going to go and help the Lieutenant,\" Mike ordered, rather then speak to what had just happened. He figured the corporal had learned his lesson so didn't need to rub it in. \"Harris, you're in charge. Hold here and wait for Santos to catch up. Doc, look after the wounded.\" Knowing his orders would be carried out instantly Mike sprinted off with the other two men to try to help the beleaguered Marines who seemed to be getting pounded on the other side of the street. The same ambush tactic had been attempted by the aliens but this time with success. The promised air support hadn't arrived so they were on their own. Moving forward, the three saw more infantry caste aliens taking up position, threatening to turn their flank. If that happened the forward momentum of the Marines would not only be checked but they could be broken and forced all the way back to the airport. As time ticked on it seemed less and less likely that they would be able to open the vital road that the tanks needed to properly deploy. The whole offensive could collapse before it began.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2- Clear sailing Moving into an arrowhead formation, Mike at the point, the three dashed across the street to provide support for the remnant of the beleaguered Marine platoon. Luck seemed to be with them because thus far none of the attacking enemy seemed to notice the trio's approach. Sprinting into range the Marines opened fire. The steady pop pop pop of 5.56mm full metal jacket slugs got the aliens attention as their flank began to be shredded by the reinforcements. High pitched chirping rose from an officer caste alien who seemed to be directing the attack. The leader of the ambush had a group break off to meet the new threat. Mike had hoped they'd do that. Guns blazing, his group split the two like a wedge as they went in hard and fast. That took pressure off the trapped Marines, allowing them to regroup while simultaneously throwing the aliens off balance. Imlay loosed a round from his M203 grenade launcher and the explosion seemed to freeze the aliens for a moment. Mike and Lockett concentrated their fire on the officer who bobbed and juked his way to avoid the withering fire. The result was the invader's offensive ground to a standstill. \"Come on Marines, get up and fight!\" Mike yelled to the hiding men, not even aware he'd done it to encourage the beleaguered soldiers to take the initiative. The challenge worked. First a large, bald Marine let out a rebel yell then charged forward his M4 firing on full automatic. Though he emptied his clip in seconds the rate of fire stunned the aliens who had thought they were shooting fish in a barrel. One by one other Marines emerged from hiding and began to fight back. The overconfident invaders hadn't expected a counter attack so they'd overextended themselves and now paid for it. Now exposed, they started being picked off, their size making them easy targets. Despite the momentum shift, the aliens had superior firepower so were able to hold their own. The fight remained far from over. Mike, with Imlay and Lockett flanking him, rallied a number of Marines and began to push the remnant of the aliens away from Osborne Street. He turned to get his men to extend their line when a fresh batch of creatures appeared from the back yard of the house next door. Caught in the open Mike cringed but kept moving as a staccato burst of machine gun fire erupted from the surgically-implanted weapon on the lead alien's arm. One round found its mark penetrating into his side, punching through his tactical vest. The force nearly knocked him to his knees. Though it felt like he'd been kicked by a mule the momentum and adrenalin pumping meant he only stumbled and didn't stop. Still, the sheer volume of the alien reinforcements checked the Marine's progress and they were forced to find cover or risk being torn to pieces. The air sizzled with munitions flying through it. The attackers sensed the new shift so pressed in for the kill, sacrificing bodies for space. It was a matter of simple mathematics. There was way more of them than humans and both sides knew it. A new officer caste alien directed the attack with great precision. It swiftly reorganized the various cadres pressing their attack sending the Marines back on their heels. Chirping in its strange language and flailing long tentacle like arms around for emphasis the aliens the officer directed came down like a hammer. Suddenly a loud crack like that from a Barrett .50caliber sniper rifle rent the air and its mushroom-shape head exploded. Before the echo died down the dull rhythmic staccato of an M240 General Purpose Machine Gun opened up. Rounds flew through the air like angry hornets kicking up little puffs of dust in the ground when it missed but more often then not sending aliens it hit in spasmodic contortions. Mike involuntarily turned to see where the extra support had come from, saying a quick prayer of thanks, and saw their help was originating from the roof of the police station behind him, the same roof he'd had Tech Sergeant Santos clear. He looked closer and could see her standing tall up top on the roof with the fire support teams whooping it up and pumping her fist. He could have kissed her. Never again would he say a bad thing about the Air Force. The overwhelming Marine firepower not only checked the alien attack but sent them into a full scale retreat to get away from the dangerous salvo. Unlike the section on the other side of the street, the soldiers here didn't pursue but rather slumped down to catch their breath and steady their nerves. In truth, there weren't many left still standing. \"Where's Lieutenant Sanford?\" Mike asked a Latino Marine, with shrapnel wound in the neck, once the area had been secured. \"He's dead Staff Sergeant,\" the man replied, his voice heavy with fatigue. \"Who was in charge then?\" \"Me, Corporal Gomez,\" the marine stated humbly. \"You did a good job getting them into a solid defensive position,\" Mike tried to encourage the young soldier, \"you saved the day.\" \"No, it was you coming to our rescue. We were screwed. They totally got the drop on us. Another couple of minutes and we'd have been toast.\" A fresh platoon of Marines moved through their position then advanced down the street, taking over for the remnant of the shattered lead group. A captain leading the way, who Mike recognized as an officer named Harvel from his original company in the 2-5, overhead the conversation so stopped to comment. He remembered the guy had been a pretty avid triathlete. He'd not likely get a chance to do that anytime soon. \"Yea, outstanding job Staff Sergeant,\" Captain Harvel added. \"We saw your move from the rear. Gutsy call.\" \"Well, it was Tech Sergeant Santos getting that fire team up on the roof that saved our bacon, sir.\" Mike countered humbly, uncomfortable with the attention. He'd not thought, he'd only reacted. \"Anyways, good job holding the line,\" the square-jawed captain commented, not really interested in a debate on who did what. \"We've got more troops on the way and we're pressing on down to the interchange. I'm not sure what happened to our damn air support. I think the choppers must have gotten knocked out of the sky so we may be on our own. So reform what left of your platoon and rejoin the column. We don't have a lot of time before the tanks show.\" With that he marched off, barking orders to the men around him. The momentum gone, Mike suddenly felt very tired. He put his hands on his thighs and began to try to control his breathing but every time his lungs expanded a knife of burning pain shot up his side. Imlay and Lockett rejoined the Staff Sergeant with the remnant of the platoon. Lockett noticed Mike's obvious discomfort and looked at him carefully. \"Man, you're wounded,\" he observed, seeing the growing dark stain low on the side on Mike's combat utility jacket. \"Doc,\" he yelled to the other side of the street. \"Get over here, the Staff Sergeant's wounded.\" \"I'm fine,\" Mike grunted, pushing away Imlay's arm as he tried to hold him steady. \"We don't have time for this. Anyone who can walk, grab all the ammo you can. We're pushing on.\" Doc Adukwu trotted over but stopped in his tracks at a withering look from Mike. \"But you are wounded, you should go to the casualty collection point,\" he dared to state in his heavy African accent.\" Mike ignored the comment as he slotted a fresh magazine into his M4. Looking around to ensure he knew how many men were left, with a wave of his arm he signaled the remnant of Lieutenant Sanford's platoon to move out. After the frenzy of the battle things got very quiet very quickly. Other then the sound of combat boots thudding on the ground no other sound could be heard. Then a wren sang out from a tree branch overhead, totally oblivious to the carnage all around it as it happily warbled on. Mike had to admire the bird for its blissful ignorance. If only life could be that easy. With several hundred Marines now deployed and moving towards the target area the pace could pick up. Marching forward in two columns, one on either side of the road a section would peal off to secure the properties to the side all the way to the next block over. More soldiers kept arriving to fill in those who now kept the flank safe forming one long corridor to the airport. All that remained was to get to the off-ramp and hold it. They Marines passed Telfair Avenue without any sign of the aliens. Some began to hope that they'd broken the back of any resistance and it would be clear all the way to the interstate. Mike Nantz was not one of those optimists. He knew the attackers wouldn't give up that easily. Though grotesque in appearance they were intelligent and knew how to fight. No, this was far from over. To emphasize the point, a car alarm went off somewhere directly to the front. Everyone dropped into defensive positions, covering every possible angle. For several tense seconds no one moved. Then Captain Harvel's voice could be heard shouting for everyone to get up and keep moving. They continued, although more cautiously, the car alarm continuing to echo in the quiet of the day. The column moved past Haddon Avenue so could just see the highway on the horizon. Maybe they would make it in time after all. But just past the cross street they found the car with the alarm still blaring. A dark blue Pontiac G6 sat in the driveway of a home with several garden gnomes on the clipped lawn. What got everyone's attention was the fresh dent in the side of the car, as if something long and narrow had smashed into it in haste. No, the aliens were still around. At the next cross street Captain Harvel called a halt so the Marines fanned out. The Golden State Freeway could clearly be seen now. As with most of the other roads the once busy highway was littered with abandoned and burned out vehicles. It seemed the original fight for Los Angeles had made it all the way to San Fernando too. Now near the front of the column, Mike and his team saw a Marine lance corporal come trotting up to them. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, Captain Harvel would like you and your team up on his position,\" the soldier ordered. \"Follow me.\" The officer gazed through a set of binoculars behind a minivan on the east side of the street as the fire team moved up. He then sat down and fished a tactical map out to assess the situation. As Mike pulled up to a halt he instinctively surveyed the area and was startled to see the name of the street on the opposite side of where they were: Rincon Avenue. His mind went immediately to Hector, wondering how he was, to the young boy's father Joe and how the man had died despite everything Mike had done to try to get him to safety, then it drifted to Michele and the look on her face the last time he saw her. \"Did you catch that Staff Sergeant?\" Captain Harvel growled, shaking Mike from the distraction of his chain of thought. \"Sorry sir,\" Mike apologized, embarrassed that he let his mind drift but suddenly feeling very woozy. \"I said, this is a perfect place for these things to make a stand. We're coming into a commercial area which means there's a lot of killing ground for them.\" \"Recce the area?\" \"We don't have a lot of time but I also don't want to go in blind,\" the captain responded, wiping sweat from his brow. \"Got anyone in mind?\" \"Lockett, Imlay,\" Mike ordered. \"Move up to the next avenue and get eyes on the area around the off-ramp. Find out if there are any bad guys around.\" As the pair began to move out, he added, \"Harris, you go along. Give them some backup fire power. Just a sneak and peak guys, don't get yourself engaged.\" Mike hated sending the guys out into potential harm without backup. They'd been through so much together but for something as important as this he also couldn't think of anyone more qualified. As he watched them inch their way to the next intersection he found himself starting to pray, something he hadn't done in a long time. He hoped God hadn't forgotten about him. The trio hadn't been gone more then ten minutes when the sound of alien fire erupted to the front. Everyone tensed then got into a good defensive position to receive an attack. All that happened though was the three Marines on reconnaissance came running back as if they were in the LA Marathon. Captain Harvel lowered his M4 after be certain nothing had followed the trio. \"So, what did you find?\" he asked as they trotted up to him to make their report. \"There's a bunch of them there sir,\" Imlay replied, sucking in breath to try to get his heart rate down. The combination of heat, anxiety and the run had caused him to begin to breathe in gasps. \"The first strip mall to the right is clear, nothing there. We got up to a pizza place on the left at the intersection. There's a Target store across the street. The place is crawling with them. We saw at least a dozen on the roof and more in the parking lot. On the other side there's another strip mall then a Chinese restaurant next to it. We saw a bunch there too but we couldn't get a count because they saw us and opened fire.\" \"Did you see any heavy weapons?\" Mike interjected. \"No, nothing in view anyway,\" Lockett added, pulling out his canteen to get a drink. \"It just seemed to be the regular infantry types.\" \"All right, good job men,\" Harvel commented. \"Rejoin your squad and get ready to move.\" \"So they've got a defensive line set up just before the off-ramp,\" Mike observed. \"You think they know what's coming down the interstate?\" \"I don't know,\" the officer responded, his mind clicking off possibilities. \"Maybe. It doesn't matter. We need to clear them out and do it fast.\" A small group of officers and senior NCO's had gathered, knowing this was the end of the line so waited to see what their leader would do. \"How do you want to play it, sir?\" Mike asked for the group. Harvel didn't respond immediately. Instead he took a hard look back at the gathered force he had, as if assessing the assets he possessed, then looked again to his front, making mental calculations then studied his tactical map of the area one last time. \"Okay, we got two 60mm mortars which is good news. We set up a fire base behind the pizza shop as well as our casualty collection point. Three GPMG's cover our front with sweeping fire. All will hammer the roof of the Target to clear it. A blocking force will hold up at the strip mall and give suppressing fire on the Chinese restaurant and surrounding. The main force will take this alley to the left,\" he pointed to the location on the map, \"then come down fast and hard on the Target through this tree line. It should give some cover until we get to the street then fire teams break and engage as the aliens show themselves. We consolidate then push back across Osborne. Any questions?\" \"What about air support?\" Mike asked, \"Weren't we supposed to have Apaches for cover?\" \"We were and we don't,\" Captain Harvel responded brusquely. \"Any other questions?\" Great, Mike thought, so much for their promised help. Once again they were going into the deep stuff with only their charm to recommend them. But then that's war he thought, improvise, adapt, overcome. There were no other questions of course. Considering what they had to work with, it was a good plan, well thought out and practical. More importantly, the group felt a growing confidence that they could pull it off despite the lack of helicopters. \"Okay, we move in five minutes.\" It was time for the rubber to hit the road and like their brethren in the past, the 2-5 Marines were about to begin a desperate assault with huge consequences.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 – musings Michele thought about him again. She'd tried not to but it had become almost instinctive now. Something didn't sit right with her. She'd wanted to say something to him, talk about what she was feeling, before he'd roped out of the helicopter but the situation hadn't been right. Something had been stirring within her beyond the adrenaline of the previous 48 hours. But the chaos of the battle at the bridge, trying to find cover from the bombing that never happened then the race from the wreckage of Santa Monica Airport to the extraction point had never provided an opportunity for her to articulate her thoughts let alone speak to the tall, rugged Marine named Mike Nantz. Then she'd heard that he and his team had done the impossible: they'd not only destroyed the alien command and control center in LA but had lived through it. Her heart sang at the news. She felt an elation that still brought her to tears which she couldn't quite explain either. The vivacious, attractive woman had made sure her young charges, nieces Kirsten and Amy, and now young Hector Rincon, were looked after before she made her way to the base to find him from the refugee encampment next door. Guards at the complex had told her once she explained who she was that the heroes of the hour had landed and were in the mess area getting food and resting. Michele couldn't help it but she began to run then started to giggle as she saw a cluster of Marines. The sophisticated woman felt like a school girl again, giddy, heart pounding. Maybe it was the stress of all she'd been through the past few days, but she hoped something else had taken over. It would be like one of those scenes in the movies that she used to loath, she'd call his name, he'd turn, his face would light up in recognition and then… The group was in ear shot. She knew he was there, though his back was to her in the group. She knew. \"Mike!\" Michele called out, anticipation thick in her voice. The Marines stopped their conversation and turned to stare at the running woman. 'He' turned but it wasn't him, stopping her dead in her tracks. \"Can we help you ma'am?\" a tall Marine officer with salt and pepper hair wearing a Lt. Colonel's silver oak leaf on his tactical vest asked with a note of irritation. \"Sir, she's one of the refugees from the police station,\" another officer tried to explain quietly. The lights of realization went on for Lt. Colonel Ritchie and his disposition changed. \"Sorry about that, you just caught me off guard,\" he explained. \"What can I do for you?\" \"Umh,\" Michele hesitated, her face turning red with embarassment, \"is it possible to speak to Staff Sergeant Nantz, just for a few minutes please? I never really got a chance to thank him for saving my life.\" \"I'm sorry,\" the commanding officer responded with a genuinely pained expression on his face, \"he and his team went back in to LA on a mission about ten minutes ago.\" Gone. Ten minutes, she'd missed him by ten minutes. It seemed to be the story of her life. A day late and a dollar short. Suddenly Michele felt light headed and her knees began to wobble. Lt. Colonel Ritchie called over a female Marine who led the dazed woman away. The officers then returned to their conversation though none made eye contact with each other. The cost of this war had just ratcheted up one more notch. For Michele Trantor this seemed to be yet another frustrating chapter in a mostly frustrating life. She was the one who was supposed to make a mark in life, not her sister. She was the one to leave the family home in Nebraska while her sister stayed. She left for the glamour of California. She had become a professional, a veternarian who worked on the pets of the stars. On the surface Michele had it all: success, looks, money, yet there was an emptiness to her life, something seemed to be missing, something she'd never quite been able to put her finger on. She'd tried, God knows she'd tried everything possible to find peace and contentment. But nothing had worked. Her sister had not strayed far from home, married a guy she'd known for years and had two beautiful children. Michele had a string of failed relationships. Yes, a day late and a dollar short. It seemed like a life of stalemate. She'd resented her sister for a long time then finally just gave up and tried to find solace in being Aunt Michele. This was supposed to be a special two weeks for her and the girls while her sister and brother-in-law travelled. Then the aliens attacked. Michele had been fixing the girls grilled cheese sandwiches when the news roke on CNN. The first mistake had been packing too much stuff into her SUV to take along. By the time they'd gotten on the road the aliens had cut off their escape to the evacuation zone so they'd ended up at a police station. When she arrived there were several dozen people hunkered down and a good number of police officers to protect them. A call then had gone out to the military to get them out. It didn't quite work out as planned. By the time the Marine patrol arrived there were only five of them left. She didn't want to remember what had happened to the others. When the grotesquely shaped monsters attacked the police hadn't stood a chance. The rest of the civilians tried to run for it with the remaining police. They hadn't made it past the parking lot. One officer had stayed with them. When he went down Michele, Hector and the kids stayed hidden so had not been found. When the Marines arrived, no when Mike and the Marines arrived, she thought she might actually live. Mike looked like a square-jawed angel to her and she wasn't sure she'd seen anyone more handsome. The stress of the situation had amplified her feelings to be sure but she also knew he was a guy she would have noticed in more normal circumstances. Yea, notice and then dismiss as not worth it, she chastised herself immediately. That had been a problem of hers, arrogance and an inflated sense of self worth. But much had changed. She also had the opportunity to watch him closely, how he treated his men and more importantly how he looked after the civilians. To many in the Marine detail the refugees seemed like a burden, especially when the helicopter filled with their wounded comrades had been shot down. But never with Mike Nantz. He was attentive and even took the time to help calm young Hector down when he'd been scared. Every time he looked at the young boy the sergeant had a strange look in his eye which made him even more attractive for some reason. Then they had worked together dissecting a captured alien. It hadn't been much of a first date but it was a start. Despite the feverish pace to find a way to kill these monsters they'd connected and even had a moment of levity. There had definitely been something between them. No, he was pretty attractive to her, hot in fact, as her young assistants at the clinic would have put it. Yes, there had been something there between them, despite all the chaos, a connection that stayed every step of the way right up to when he'd given her the letter for Lt. Martinez's wife in the helicopter. She'd wanted to say something, tell him how she felt, even spontaneously kiss him, especially when he held her hand after giving her the note but she'd frozen. A day late and a dollar short again. Despite what seemed to be yet another setback, much had changed in the past few days for Michele Trantor. Their lives had intersected for a purpose and she was determined to do something about it even if a war raged around them. But there was more, it was time to become an asset, not a liability.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 – out of gas The Marine column pushed up quickly to the pizza shop that would be their base of operations. Time had become a bit scarce so they had no time to be cute with their movement. The defenders of LA were getting into the red zone and needed to push the ball across the line. While the aliens responded with some intermittent fire as the soldiers came into view of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, it proved to be more annoying then threatening. With Marines providing cover, the machine guns and mortars got set up and ready to roll. The blocking force prepared to move as did the main assault force. Tension built like a coiled spring waiting to be unleashed. All knew that their hope for the recapture of LA, no, not just LA, THEIR city, likely hinged on the next few minutes. With a signal from Captain Harvel the fire support group opened up. Two whumps from the mortars led the way followed by the low guttural chatter of the GPMG's. To more whumps from the mortar tubes followed before the first two rounds exploded. Spotters recalibrated before they found their mark. Zeroed in, the deadly weapons rained destruction onto the enemy position. Captain Harvel waited patiently for several minutes seeming to enjoy the chance for payback on the pinned-down aliens. The timing had to be perfect so the officer didn't allow any personal satisfaction to get in the way of the job at hand. Satisfied the time was right the Captain sent the blocking force sprinting across Osborne to their position. The aliens managed some sporadic and uncoordinated fire, seeming to be caught off guard by the voraciousness of the mortar and machine gun fire so all were able to get across and into position before any could be hit. Harvel waited several more minutes for attention to be diverted to that area then he sent the main force down the alley hidden from view and through a townhouse complex that provided cover from view. If everything came off right this was going to ruin some alien officer's whole day. Mike and his team found themselves on the point of the assaulting force moving swiftly but carefully through the cover the trees afforded. Familiar ground to them, he thought. A few more seconds and they'd be to the road and it would be game on. Heart pounding his breathing started to become labored. He could feel blood trickling down his side from the wound Doc had quickly patched up. Or was it sweat? Likely both. Mike could hear the sound of battle to his right, the crump of the mortars, chatter of machine guns and the whiz of alien return fire. So far no one seemed to have noticed their movement so they'd have a bit of surprise. He hoped it would be more than a bit. The foliage began to thin out as the Marines moved steadily to the street to their front. Mike held up his hand in the signal to halt. He wanted to make sure everyone was up before they attacked. A quick shoulder check and he knew they were good to go. Taking one deep breathe, he closed his eyes to prep for what lay ahead. It was time. \"Go! Go! Go!\" he yelled, more from adrenaline then a need to give the command as the others sprung into action behind him. Sprinting through the trees, over the sidewalk and onto Laurel Creek Boulevard the soldiers burst into the open. Four lanes wide suddenly seemed like an awfully long way. The Marines held their fire, focusing on moving as fast as they could. This was not like a Hollywood movie where the good guys came out guns blazing. They waited for targets to indentify themselves and concentrated on moving to the parking lot of the Target where there were cars that could be used for cover. They didn't have to wait long to find something to shoot back at. Though initially surprised by the quick attack from an unexpected side the aliens responded to the new threat bringing machine gun and rocket fire to bear on the charging Marines. Combat had always been a strange combination of experiences for Mike Nantz. He, like many soldiers, called it his 'spidey-sense'. Everything seemed to go super fast and yet also moved super slow. Psychologists say that one's senses are heightened in times of high stress and our remarkably designed bodies respond in kind. So while everything seemed to be going by in fast forward, like watching a DVD on rapid advance, everything was crystal clear for Mike. He saw it all: the alien that popped up in the parking lot to the right only to be shredded by a SAW, one on the roof to the front who was blown off like a stunt man by the exploding round of a mortar, all came in pure, high definition clarity. Yet he couldn't hear anything. So much noise and confusion swirled around Mike yet he heard nothing as he sprinted across the road then into the parking lot. He didn't hear himself screaming manically in the face of the enemy return fire, he didn't hear the orders he automatically gave to those around him, he didn't hear the sound of his M4 firing steadily, he didn't hear the sound of men getting hit around him. He was focused. Next thing Mike knew, he stood under the overhang of the store near one of the entrances gasping for breath. He looked around and did a quick head count, pleased by the number of men who made it, including all of his. Good , he thought, these guys were beginning to become pretty special to him. He noticed the mortars had shifted their fire from the Target to the strip mall across the street to eliminate the threat of friendly fire. It was now time for them to start to do their job. A Marine Lieutenant who'd come up with them now started getting the troops organized. Mike recognized him by the shock of blond hair that hung jauntily out the front of his helmet, quite uncharacteristic for a Marine. Surfer Dude he'd been called because of his love of the sport. But Mike also knew him to be a solid officer, a bit of an anomaly, even for the Marines but the right guy for the job. \"Staff Sergeant, take four fire teams and clear the building. Secure any other entrances then report back to me,' Surfer Dude ordered crisply. \"The rest of you, cover the approach and hold this area. We're not letting these squid heads push us back. Move!\" \"Lockett, point,\" Mike commanded in response. \"They know we're here so use your comms to keep me posted. Let's move!\" The others followed naturally as the corporal pushed in through the doors, two other Marines automatically holding them open for the others to surge in in force. Mike deployed the fire teams as they spread out through the dark building. Flashlights played up and down deserted aisles as the soldiers charged through the store that only days earlier would have been filled with eager shoppers looking for the latest bargain. No more, not only had the city of Los Angeles changed but the whole world had changed since then. \"Movement, east wall,\" a Marine's voice crackled through the comm link. \"Light him up!\" The thump of a grenade being launched from an M203 broke the silence followed by an explosion and a shower of kids tricycles from the bike section a pair of aliens had been hiding in. \"Contact! Contact!\" others called out frantically as the invaders made their stand. Suddenly the dark store was lit up like the 4th of July by sizzling tracer fire and alien machine gun bursts. Mike had placed the men well so with interlocking fields of fire they were able to systematically push all the remaining aliens into a killing zone in the center of the store. Harris, firing systematic bursts from his SAW burst out laughing despite the frenzy of combat. An alien, desperate to escape, had floundered through the lingerie section and had a purple lace bra stuck to its head that would have looked better on his fiancée Cherise. The moment of mirth lasted but a moment as the alien was shredded by the fire of several Marines allowing Harris a moment of melancholy wondering if he'd ever see her again in something like that. Push the thought from your mind bro, it 's us or them , he told himself, Cherise is alive man and I'll marry her yet. I owe that to Stavrou. The soft spoken, bespectacled soldier pushed even harder, anger masking his usually happy face. It had been a sharp firefight but ended up lasting less than five minutes before the calls starting coming in: \"East sector secure.\" \"South secure.\" \"West entrance secure.\" But then followed the sound every combat leader hates to hear: \"Medic!\" The building was secure and fortunately the cost had been relatively light. Five men wounded, two seriously, but fortunately none killed. Maybe the tide had begun to turn. Mike deployed the bulk of his fire teams to secure the entrances to the building before taking his own team and trotting back to the Lieutenant. \"Good to go sir,\" Mike reported. Surfer Dude nodded but didn't say anything to him, preparing for the next phase of action. \"All right, assaulting force, let's take this street,\" he yelled to the force ready to move. Leaving Mike and his squad behind the officer charged off with a heavy platoon he'd chosen to take the last position. On cue the mortars stopped their fire as the Marines hit Osborne. The GPMG's provided covering fire but it wasn't enough. With the mortars stopped the aliens, who had wisely gone to ground, reappeared and blasted the approach to their position. A wall of fire greeted the Marines forcing them back to the cover of the department store. The aliens tried themselves to push across to retake their lost position but were met with stiff resistance from the hasty defense set up around the Target store so they couldn't move either. It had become a stalemate. Neither side seemed content to simply trade fire across the boulevard though time worked against the Marines. Both sides probed, looking for a weakness to exploit but neither gave any ground. The officer in charge of the attack called for his radioman in an attempt to bring some much-needed support. \"Echo 1-7 this is Echo 2-7. We're stuck here. We need fire support. Anything in the air? Over.\" \"Negative on the air support 2-7,\" Captain Harvel responded on the other end. \"But hold your position, I'm sending some reinforcements and something I think will help unstick things.\" The lieutenant organized his men for a renewed assault, curious to see what his superior could send that would help tip the balance. Then a smile lit up his tanned face as he saw not only another two sections of infantry move up but also a rocket launcher team. Yes, this would unstick things nicely. Directing rocket fire towards alien strong points, the Marines were able to soften resistance. With a charge worthy of any Marine echelon in the storied history of the Corp, with one more push they successfully dislodged the aliens from the strip mall. With the alien's last defensive position breached they fell back with the Marines pressing them all the way past their objective in order to have enough ground to set up a cordon to ensure the precious reinforcements they were waiting for would be unimpeded. The ramp had been secured as was the underpass and area on the opposite side of the freeway. Alien resistance seemed to evaporate. It became suddenly quiet again. Despite the exertion in the humid August afternoon no one rested. Fire teams began to set up a defensive position finding whatever cover they could to protect the off ramp and surrounding area. The cost had been high in killed and wounded but everyone knew the importance of this mission, plus, it had been a clear victory for the human forces, something they desperately needed. The wounded were being carried back to the airport for evacuation and a few more reinforcements had arrived but that had slowed. Doc Adukwu rejoined the section since the casualty collection point had been closed. All that seemed left to do was to wait for the arrival of the tanks. \"Not much longer now,\" Captain Harvel encouraged the men as he went around checking their progress, ensuring all of the arcs were covered. \"We're going to hold this position and the rocket launcher will hold the center.\" Boom! The Marine with the rocket launcher and his loader suddenly evaporated in a ball of flame. \"Walking gun!\" a nearby leatherneck screamed, warning too late of the arrival of the lethal weapon. Letting loose a salvo of missiles at close range it eliminated in one shot the biggest threat the Marines could muster. The aliens counter-attacked in force. The newly arrived alien walking gun began to systematically focus on the key points of resistance and just as systematically eliminated them. Other infantry caste aliens poured into the area, cutting down any Marine that tried to move out of the cone of fire of the deadly support weapon. Withering fire caused the defenders to wilt initially but they wouldn't break, not this close to accomplishing their mission. A large squad of aliens cut across Laurel Canyon Boulevard, effectively cutting the Marines holding the off-ramp from the reinforcements coming from the airport. It was as if they knew what travelled down the highway also so wanted to deny the humans the hope that had been growing. Harris returned fire with his SAW, checking the progress of those who would try to take the ramp. Imlay added what firepower he could with his grenade launcher but it was small compensation for the rockets. Mike moved from position to position, redirecting fire and shifting men about to keep them from harms way. All the while rounds hissed and pinged all around him. He was singularly focused on holding the position. The reminder of Hector and the others when he'd passed Rincon Avenue drove him despite the searing pain from his wound and growing light headedness. Not now, not again , he kept telling himself. The mantra went through his head again and again. He wouldn't fail those who'd put their trust in him another time. Not this time . The Marines were being pressed hard. It was only a matter of time before their line broke. But not one of them wavered. None thought of breaking and running. They were here to the end. Several glanced at comrades, gave winks and wry smiles, knowing what the next few minutes held. No, none broke. The Marine motto of Semper Fidelis coursed in their DVA: always faithful. They would hold to the end, taking as many with them as possible, hoping they would be remembered for their sacrifice. Then, just as suddenly as the rocket launcher team had been blown up, the walking gun erupted in a ball of fire. Simultaneously the sound of a 25mm chain gun opening up and the roar of a trio of Apache helicopters filled the air. All eyes turned to the source of the intrusion. Coming down the Golden State Freeway, escorted by a flight of gun ships flying cover, was a half-dozen LAV-25's leading the way for a convoy of flatbed tractor trailers. On those trailers was a sight for the weary eyes of the beleaguered Marines: M1A1 Abrams tanks. The column's escort joined the fight. Their considerable firepower overwhelmed the aliens in a matter of minutes. Momentum broken and main support weapon destroyed, the alien remnant retreated in disarray. \"The cavalry's here!\" Harris whooped, screaming with joy. \"We did it, we actually did it,\" Imlay shouted, wiping sweat from his eyes and pounding Harris on the shoulders. As if a burden had been lifted from him, knowing the mission had been accomplished, Mike did a half turn, as if to leave the position, took one step and collapsed to the pavement. The others in his section saw this and rushed to his side, ignoring the cheering marines around them. \"Doc!\" Lockett screamed, \"Get over here. Staff Sergeant's down!\" \"Hang on Staffs,\" Harris begged him, \"the funs about to begin.\" \"Tanks are here, mission accomplished,\" Mike grunted in his gravelly voice, \"good job 2-5. Retreat…\" his voice trailed off as everything went dark.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 - Reunion Regaining conciousness, before Mike's eyes fluttered open he felt a soft touch on his forearm stirring a pleasant memories in the sea of misery he suddenly experienced. He knew instinctively who it was. \"Michele,\" he croaked. \"Mike, you're okay,\" she gasped, a look of joy lighting up her face. \"What are you doing here?\" Mike asked in sudden surprise, his faculties starting to return to him as his eyes darted around the tent hospital ward he lay in. \"I'm helping in the aid station,\" she replied, trying to look casual but the intense look of concern in her deep brown eyes betrayed the woman's true feelings. Mike wasn't sure why but this made him feel good. Already conflicting emotions were swirling around in his head where he needed focus. Trying to move his body the electric jolt of pain let him know he didn't need his game face on for a while. \"I thought you only operated on animals and aliens,\" he deadpanned, recalling a previous conversation of theirs. Head bobbing in laughter Michele's pretty face exploded in a radiant smile. Leaning over, she instinctively put her head on his chest. Realizing what had just happened, she quickly pulled back by sitting up straight. Trying to appear casual, Michele brushed an errant strand of black hair back behind her ear while also trying to subtly wipe a tear of relief away. The observant Marine took it all in. Normally Mike would have been amused by the woman's discomfort but something, and it wasn't the pain, had him hold his tongue. Neither spoke, instead gazing unabashed at one another fearing the moment this intimate connection would be broken. Each caught the 'look' in the eyes of the other, stirring conflicting emotions. With everything that had gone on where this could realistically go for the pair seemed hard to figure out. To move from a look to an action, to go from longing to declaration, still seemed like a long stretch. Still aching from his wounds, Mike broke the ice rather then keep the pretense of indifference up. \"Its good to see you again Michele,\" he declared honestly. \"How are you doing?\" \"I'm doing okay. I still can't believe everything that's gone on,\" she replied reflectively. \"I mean a week ago I had no clue any of this would be going on,\" Michele added quietly, avoiding his penetrating blue eyes. \"It's a bit hard to process.\" \"I know. Two weeks ago I was ready to retire and now the world is at war. Who'd have known it?\" \"Yea, that too,\" Michele said stiffly, shifting herself away from him. Idiot! Mike wanted to bang his head on the bed post as he realized how stupid he'd been. He'd missed her point totally. An awkward silence came between them, the initial closeness stretching into to a wider chasm. Michele didn't know what to do. She felt as if she were pushing things with Mike, dropping hints she expected him to pick up despite the fact he lay there wounded and likely in his own state of shock. How unfair was that? But that's she did it, probe quick then get out rather then be hurt. No wonder she was lonely most of the time. How ironic, she thought, I'm likely as much a tactician as he is . There had been so much she'd wanted to say. She'd rehearsed it in her mind: the bold statement of affection, the desire for this to lead to something, all of it. The picture had been perfect in her mind, his response like something you'd see in a movie. A beautiful moment in this sea of misery. Yet the reality seemed to not be turning out nearly like she'd thought. It was awkward. Michele wanted to scream, to get up and run away, to do something, but she sat there transfixed, not knowing what to do. She wasn't the only one. For Mike, not knowing what to do or say, feeling suddenly unsure, all the thoughts and feelings he'd had in the helicopter before going back into LA suddenly seemed more dangerous then the aliens seeking to obliterate mankind. Perhaps the time had come for a tactical withdrawal. \"How's Hector?\" Mike asked trying to redirect the conversation. \"He's staying with me and my nieces,\" Michele answered woodenly. \"He seems to be okay but I suspect he's still in shock from everything that's gone on.\" Mike nodded his head in understanding. He could only imagine what the young boy was going through. \"Any word from your sister?\" he asked changing the subject. \"No. We're in a refugee camp. Its such a mess.\" Her eyes began to glisten as the emotion of everything going on began to overwhelm the seemingly confident woman who inside wanted to curl up in a ball. \"Well communications has got to be pretty spotty right now,\" Mike declared, trying to be encouraging. \"I'm sure she's okay.\" Yea, me too,\" Michele responded without conviction. How stupid are you Nantz? Mike chided himself silently, then observing the tears in her expressive eyes he added, You think saying something like that helps? Now you've made her cry Brick!. The two sat in silence for a couple of minutes. \"I got the letter to Lt. Rodriguez's wife,\" Michele volunteered, seeing the growing anguish on Mike's face, knowing she was the cause of it, mentally kicking herself for a lack of strength. \"What? You found her?\" he asked, trying to sit up in surprise but the pain caused him to fall back with a groan. Michele felt terrible for causing more discomfort. My special gift she tormented herself. \"No, she found me. You may not know this but your team are quite the celebrities. She heard I was part of the group you brought out and found me.\" \"How is she?\" How do you think? Michele regretted the sharp response as she saw renewed distress in Mike's clear blue eyes. Emotions were very high it seemed. The woman realized she'd been feeling sorry for herself and not thinking about someone she supposedly had feeling for so changed her attitude. \"There was nothing you could do about it Mike,\" Michele tried to get him to see. \"It wasn't your fault he died. She doesn't blame you but did appreciate getting the letter and finding out what happened to her husband.\" \"Thanks,\" he said without emotion, staring up at the canvas ceiling. Yet another dead man on my conscience Mike thought to himself, another face to haunt me in the middle of the night. Yet another I've failed, just like all the others. I got get out before I do it again . Why do I always do this , Michele admonished herself, speaking before I think. Yet again I hurt someone I care about. Both seemed to be sinking into a morass of dark feelings. Regaining her composure, Michele decided to try to strike out, to be bold like the man she realized she was falling love with rather than wallow in growing pity. \"I see you didn't get to your 'to do' list!\" \"What?\" Mike responded in confussion, clawing his way out of the lonely abyss. \"What do you mean by that?\" \"From the bus?\" Michele shot back playfully. \"From the wound you got saving us from that drone?\" she reminded him. \"Not only didn't you get it looked at you went right back into combat and got shot.\" \"I was kind of busy,\" Mike reponded a bit too gruffly, but touched by the concern he could see. Now smiling he added, \"I guess I forgot to put it in my Daytimer. Besides, its no big deal.\" \"It could have killed you,\" Michele said barely above a whisper, avoiding eye contact. She knew she'd tipped her hand, that she'd shown all her cards. The statement and the look on her face screamed out her true feelings for the handsome, stoic Marine. But Michele didn't care anymore. She'd watched people die, thought she was going to die and had no interest in games or pretense anymore. But did he feel the same way? Mike Nantz, despite his pain knew the beautiful woman who sat beside him, whose smell mesmerized him, cared for him, in fact cared deeply. Something he didn't dare hope for, a spark he'd felt when they'd first spent time together at the beleaguered police station, had been shown to him to be more then a dream, it was real. He didn't know what to do. Ever since Afghanistan, and since THAT NIGHT three years ago Mike had lost his nerve. He became suddenly silent and even reflective for several awkward moments. He tried to reach his hand out to her, to connect again with another person, another woman, but he couldn't move. A growing gulf of lonliness began to overwhelm him. Despite the fact the two sat only inches apart it seemed like they were now growing miles apart. Despite the dull pain of his wounds Mike felt a sharp stab in the center of his chest that felt a hundred times worse. He'd tried to open up. He'd made himself vulnerable and gotten burned before though something told him the woman before him wouldn't. Even more, he'd cared and then had to bury those he cared out. No, emotions, things of the heart, had cost him big time in the past. He'd built a Berlin Wall between his head and his heart and had been content to sit behind it, hunker down, and not be at risk again. But it was more then a wall, it was a castle. A castle can be pretty cold and despite his tough promises Mike still had longings, dreams, hopes. But the wall stood firm and he suddenly realized a castle could be a pretty lonely place for a king who had no queen. Could Michele be that woman? The look in her eyes said yes, his heart screamed yes, but his head said: protect! He wanted to drop the drawbridge and open the gate to his heart, to come out of the castle. But every time he thought about it, the pain, no the REALITY of THAT NIGHT assaulted him like a vicious horde bent on destroying him. So instead he retreated back to the safety of his walls.[Chapter 6] CHAPTER 6 – That Night Before LA, before the alien invasion of earth, before Hector and Lt. Martinez, before Michele there was THAT night, an event that lay the foundation for everything that followed for Mike Nantz. Though it happened in May 2008 the groundwork was laid in September 2001. 9/11 changed a lot of things for Mike. Like so many others it hit hard. This was especially the case for Marines like him. He wanted to do something. He wanted to strike back at Osama Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda fanatics. It went far deeper though. Something stirred within Mike Nantz, something he'd not considered before. As he watched the news, saw the smoke rising from the Twin Towers and saw the interviews with the families he became overwhelmed with an intense sense of melancholy. Who would mourn him if something like this would happen? What did he have 'to come home to'? A desire grew like a blaze ignited to put down some roots, to have someone who cared for him. He wanted a wife. He wanted a family. A bachelor up until that point, Mike had been so focused on serving the Corp he'd not had time for relationships. Sure there had been women but not one special woman. Not one he saw himself growing old with. Then there were kids. He liked them and strangely they liked the intense Marine. He wanted his own. The thought of dying and no one caring began to resonate with him, gnawed away at him really, so he began a duel quest of seeing how he could serve his country more directly and also have some kind of life outside the Corp. He'd never had much of a family and the example he did have stunk. His father had been a drunk and a drifter, an embarrassment really. His mother…well, she wasn't much into be a mom so he found himself left mostly alone at a young age to fend for himself. The only one who had really cared about him was his grandfather. Grandpappy Mike had always called him. Grandpappy had been a larger-than-life man, with broad shoulders, a shock of cropped white hair and ready smile. Tall and strong despite his age, despite being a career soldier he had a tender and sentimental side that made him a bit of a contradiction. As a result Mike adored the man and followed him around whenever he could. Best of all Grandpappy had been a 2-5 Marine. His father before him served with the 2-5 also. He'd in fact been with them in World War 1 when a French officer had recommended the regiment retreat during the Battle of Belleau Wood and his company commander Captain Lloyd Williams had replied, \"Retreat? Hell we just got here!\" thus giving birth to the battalion's motto 'retreat hell'. It was a strong legacy, one that had the ability to shape a young man looking to belong to something more then what he'd been given. Though Mike had a quick mind and good work ethic school didn't interest him much so he quit as soon as he could and joined the Marines. With the Corp he found not only something that he excelled at but more importantly he found purpose. Mike Nantz was so good in fact that right out of basic training he'd been tapped for a variety of advanced training leading to a posting with the elite Force Recon group. After 9/11 though Mike would no longer be content to be an observer, he wanted to be at the end of the spear that thrust back at the enemy. So when an experimental special operations group called Det 1 formed he joined right away. Working with a group of Navy SEALs he'd spent much of the early stages of the war in Iraq tracking THE target. He'd ultimately ended up with him in his sights but never given permission by squeamish bureaucrats to do what he'd been sent in to accomplish. Win, but don't win too badly seemed to be the prevailing thought. In the end his mission and his team didn't exist so he didn't participate in the victory celebrations. Mike didn't care though. He wasn't seeking glory, only to make a difference and he'd done that many times over. In the whirlwind of all this he met Amanda. The striking blonde haired woman was the daughter of a prominent industrialist. She herself was a success serving as a manager in one of her father's factories. They'd met through mutual friends, she a restless woman looking to make a statement to her father and he looking to set up something more permanent. It seemed not only a mismatch in terms of background but more importantly expectations. For the short term it seemed great but long term there were pretty major issues between them but love is blind at times and so they wed. At first Mike's work in the war on terror had been stimulating to Amanda and each return home proved to be an exciting, passion-filled release. But soon that became less appealing for the restless woman. By this point now a Sergeant Mike Nantz had joined the recently formed Marine Special Operations Regiment proving himself to be one of their key NCOs. The reward for his success though was a constant diet of missions. Iraq, Afghanistan, back and forth between the two, that had become the cycle. Oh well, nature of the beast Mike had figured but then Amanda didn't like the fact that he'd be gone for four months and had 'nothing' to show for it. The nature of his missions meant he couldn't talk about it nor could she. With nothing to brag about the tensions built caused increasing strain to their already fragile marriage. Things like that continued to nag at them and so two and a half years later he resigned from the special ops unit and returned to a regular Marine battalion being posted to the 2-5. But that wasn't enough. She wanted him out, to quit, to leave the Marines entirely. But how could he? Being a soldier was all he knew. How could he turn his back on that, on the legacy of Grandpappy? How could he give up service to his country to instead immerse himself in the world of injection-moulded plastics or whatever the heck it was her father did? Yet Mike was willing to do it to make things work despite the fact it was eating a hole in his stomach. But then it became academic after THAT night in May 2008. Amanda was out to another meeting at church. She had always been a regular church goer, they even had gone together early in their marriage. But the last six months she seemed to be there all the time. He never could figure out what they were doing. He believed in God, he went to church regularly and sometimes even dropped into chapel on base but there just didn't seem to be any point in getting all fanatical about it. But she sure did love to go to church with or without him. It seemed to be her thing so he supported it to try to be a good husband. Being they lived off base Mike didn't do too much on days off so he would work on the house, read or make plastic models when she was out which seemed to be all the time. THAT night two of his buddies from the base decided to take him out. Julio Garcia and Eddie Minor, two other sergeants from his company, wanting to expand his social standing positively refused to take no for an answer so took him out to a popular pub, The Fox and Fiddle. The music was loud and the place packed. Eddie, who always seemed to be on the make, declared it a 'target rich environment' and began to cruise around for someone who would be impressed by his war stories. Mike and Julio got a couple of cold Budweisers and began to debate American foreign policy. \"You're crazy, Mano,\" Julio shot back at Mike's comment about fighting on foreign fronts. \"I say we tell the world 'screw you. You don't like America, fine; sort your mess out yourselves.' That's what I think.\" \"Then what do we do, set up a wall around our country like the Israelis want to do?\" Mike countered cagily. \"Damn straight, just keep 'em out. We mind our business and then anyone mess with us we take them out.\" \"But can't you see how us fighting on their turf keeps them from fighting on ours?\" Mike countered. Julio opened his mouth to rebut but by the smile on his friend's face knew he was walking into an ambush. The Latino Marine chuckled then took a pull on his beer rather then speak, planning his next salvo. The two enjoyed their verbal chess game. But inevitably the debate became an aggravating irony since despite being its instruments they had no control over how it came about. Mike was beginning to be glad he came, enjoying the night out when his commando instincts kicked in. Something wasn't right. His Spidey sense began to tingle. He knew no enemy could be present. He knew no Jihadist lurked in the shadows trying to kill him yet he felt his skin crawl, like something worse sat lurking, waiting to destroy. Automatically scanning the crowd for any threats he saw in a dark corner of the pub a woman who looked like his wife with another man and couple. Looking more closely he realised it was Amanda sitting face-to-face, staring at another man. His heart nearly stopped before it raced up into his throat as he watched their lips meet in a tender embrace. \"Did you hear what I just said?\" Julio asked. But then his gaze tracked to where Mike's pained stare was fixed. \"Oh man. Mike…listen…,\" he stammered, not sure what to say. Mike got up deliberately from his chair carefully setting his bottle of beer on the table then began to walk towards the corner. Julio got up in a flash moving right beside him to block the way. Grabbing his arm, he tried to steer his friend away. \"What are you doing? Come on lets get out of here\" Silently Mike pulled his arm from his friend's grasp continuing to move towards the booth still unnoticed by the crowd. \"Leave it alone….don't deal with this here!\" Julio tried one last time to manoeuvre his friend away from fate. It became academic. They were on the group's radar screen. Amanda turned to look at what the group had become suddenly silent over and now were staring at. Her usually confident expression dropped off and the color left her as she saw her icy-faced husband. \"Mike, I…\" she stammered and then went silent, her eyes averting his. She saw in his face a look of serenity she'd never seen before but one she instinctively knew to be extremely dangerous. Mike went from deep hurt to rage in almost the blink of an eye when he identified the man his wife had been kissing. The haircut gave him away. Military. He wasn't sure how he knew him at first but he recognized the man as a Navy officer. Not the type to serve on ship mind you, to go into combat. No, the type who sat behind a desk filling in papers while others fought and sacrificed. Seeking glory but no guts. The next realization became far worse causing his rage to go from red to white hot. He was from their church. All the 'meetings' and time out made sense to him in an instant. He wondered for a brief moment what God thought about this, but then he pushed that aside, deciding to be the Almighty's agent of wrath. Embarrassment spiked his rage. He, Force Recon, Det One, Special Ops, he'd not seen it coming, not figured out the signs. He didn't want to, he didn't want to believe. He'd wanted stability, he'd wanted kids and she'd put him off, he'd left Special Ops for her and now she sat making out with this prissy pencil pusher. \"Listen, its not what it looks like…,\" the pale man whose name Mike remembered was Bill said awkwardly, standing up but not meeting the steely gaze fixed on him. \"Shut your mouth,\" Mike barked back, \"I've got nothing to say to you.\" Turning his gaze to Amanda his rage melted as his heart broke. \"How could you?\" he whispered. \"Mike, we need to talk,\" she answered, a gust of winter in her voice. \"HOW COULD YOU?\" Mike exploded, fury returning at her seeming lack of care for his feelings. \"I sacrificed everything for you. I've wanted a family for three years and this is how you repay me?\" The pub had gone quiet as others began to take in the unfolding confrontation. Bill, feeling the stares of the people around them, tried to calm the situation. \"Why don't we all leave here and go someplace quiet to talk?\" Bill asked, trying to shift the focus away from them. If the Navy officer had left it at that there wouldn't have been a problem. Mike ignored him so the man grabbed the Marine by the arm to get his attention. That proved to be a big mistake. Instinctively Mike countered the grab, throwing off the shred of restraint that remained. Locking his free hand onto Bill's arm he quickly spun the surprised man around while putting him into an arm bar. Mike used the leverage and momentum to savagely smash the Nay officer's head down onto the table. Glasses and plates flew off the table at the force of the impact. As Amanda screamed others scrambled out of the way. The rage took control and Mike reacted like a combat soldier. Totally oblivious to the events around him, laser-locked on his target, Mike poured all his frustration and rage out onto his perceived enemy, pummelling the man relentlessly. The next thing he knew Eddie and Julio had him pinned on the ground as Amanda knelt sobbing beside a bloody and unconscious Bill. Mike sat silently, head down, waiting for the Shore Patrol to come and arrest him. An ambulance took Bill away along with Amanda who rode with him to give the battered and humiliated man comfort. It turned out the Navy officer had a broken nose, lost 2 teeth, suffered a separated shoulder in the altercation plus had the embarrassing distinction that went around the base that he hadn't even been able to get a punch in to defend himself. No charges were filed against Mike due to the nature of what had transpired that night, Bill being too humiliated to press charges. Mike heard nothing from the church they had attended which suited him just fine. He didn't want to talk to them either. The last act of this tragic drama unfolded when divorce papers came two weeks later. Amanda never talked to him again except through her lawyer. So much for legacy.[Chapter 7] CHAPTER 7 – Deception [June 2010 – one year earlier] \"RPG 3 o'clock!\" the top turret gunner in the lead Humvee screamed into his headset catching the rocket's flash signature out of the corner of his eye. The driver of the gunner's vehicle instinctively looked while slamming on the brakes allowing the rocket to scream past harmlessly. \"Engage, engage!\" the vehicle commander ordered redundantly. The .50 caliber machine gun began to spit out rounds, causing the whole vehicle to shudder from the force. The other Humvees in the four-vehicle convoy came to an abrupt halt then disgorged Marines who moved automatically into a defensive perimeter to counter the ambush. \"Gomers on the berm line to the front,\" a young Marine on his first tour called out excitedly \"Light 'em up!\" the patrol's leader who wore the chevrons of a staff sergeant ordered the group. The beleaguered line of Marines erupted in fire at the threat throwing tufts of dirt in the air as their bullets sought to find a mark. In response, the ambushers shot back though their fire was not nearly as disciplined. Bullets whizzed through the air and pinged off the vehicles as the crouching and kneeling Marines attempted to achieve fire supremacy by bringing an M249SAW machine gun into action and loosing several grenades from their M203 launchers. \"We're pinned down Staff Sergeant, we need air support,\" a corporal yelled to their commander. \"Naw,\" the leader replied, piercing blue eyes flashing. \"This isn't going to last long enough for them to get here. These gomers'll cut and run soon, just watch.\" As if prophetically, the attackers ceased fire. The Marines responded in kind and things became eerily quiet except for a breeze blowing across the barren terrain. For several minutes the soldiers waited in their defensive position to ensure a renewed assault wouldn't come from another area. It seemed unlikely since it rarely did repeating the frustration of fighting an elusive foe that wouldn't stand and fight. \"Dante, Guttero, Colins, Paige, with me,\" the staff sergeant ordered. \"We're going to check out their position. Armbruster, cover us on the .50. The rest of you look sharp.\" The team leader knew what he'd find before he got there: nothing of use. His wisdom was rewarded as they cautiously approached the location the ambush had been sprung. Other then empty shell casings nothing of value could be found. No blood trails, no tracks, nothing. So continued another frustrating day in Afghanistan. Afghanistan reminded Mike Nantz, the patrol leader, a lot of Iraq. The terrain was different, the climate was different and the people were different, but the mission was similar and the feelings were the same. Another nearly impossible mission with parameters that handcuffed the troops on the ground. Gathering his troops Mike did a quick debrief of the situation, pointing out what they did well and areas to improve. This wasn't like training; if you didn't improve you were dead. They'd just loaded up and were preparing to resume their patrol when the radio in Mike's Humvee squawked, \"Kilo 1-3 this is Kilo 1, over.\" \"Kilo 1-3, go ahead 1, over,\" Mike responded, acknowledging the call from their company commander. \"We got a report of a Taliban attack on a school in Berekza 1-3. Go and check it out and report what you find.\" \"Roger that,\" Mike acknowledged. Yep, another frustrating day in Afghanistan. Forty-five minutes later Mike watched a twenty-something woman with black, naturally curly hair crying as the dust swirled around her wondering if the group that had attacked them had destroyed this place of learning. Dust always seemed to be swirling at this time of year in Afghanistan. \"Armbruster, stay on that .50,\" Mike ordered the Marine still in the top turret of his Humvee swiveling the .50 caliber machine gun back and forth, \"Dante, take a team and sweep the village, make sure there's no more rag heads around. Wortner, set up a perimeter.\" Sarah Scott's eyes were filled with tears as her slender body tightened with wave after wave of convulsive sobs coming from deep within the volcano of her emotions. The cold, life-less eyes of the little Afghan girl named Jahdila stared up at her, glassy and fixed as if incredulous to what had happened. The malnourished body would have been cause for pity itself back in Sarah's native Ohio but the true cause of the grief was the gaping bullet hole in the child's stomach. Ugly and bloated, the wound had stopped bleeding becoming crusty with dried blood. Worse for the Christian missionary, the bullet had travelled through the little Bible the girl had been given a week earlier and still clutched. The twenty-three year old woman had come to Afghanistan to be a teacher in a school an American organization had built but that had been only one part of her job and the mandate of the group. She was a Christian missionary first, there to tell the Muslim people about Jesus, and a teacher second. The organization she taught for, Teach Afghanistan, had built the school in order to gain entry to the country since they were a subsidiary of a large American Christian missions organization, Worldwide Gospel Outreach, whose desire it was to bring the Bible to the Muslim nation. The only problem was missionaries were forbidden in the country by the government and enflamed the Taliban who they were trying to dislodge. It made an already difficult situation that much harder. But that didn't register with Sarah Scott. She didn't care about the politics, she only wanted to make a difference in people's lives, to share the love of God she had experienced. And now this had happened. All she could do was cradle the girl who'd used to be so perky in her arms as a mother cradles her child, rocking back and forth with a soft and heart-breaking moan. The question that had been gnawing away at her for weeks now finally came gushing out as she set the child gently down in the dirt. \"WHY? Why God do you allow this to happen?\" The scream that came out of her mouth startled even her and caused those watching to turn away in silent embarrassment. Sheepishly the Marines who stood around the young woman cast subdued glances at each other or kicked the dirt in frustration with their boots wondering yet again how the most powerful nation in the world could allow something like this to happen. Someone had to act but no one dared move as they were afraid how the grief-stricken woman would react. Finally, Mike, since he wore the stripes of authority stepped forward to bring the scene to an end. There was still danger around and while well-armed they were not that secure especially that far into what was deemed enemy territory. \"Miss?\" Mike spoke gently but his voice held a slight hint of urgency. \"Miss, we really do need to get you back to your compound. This area is still pretty unstable so we really have to get moving.\" He stopped but then added awkwardly in a lower tone, \"I'm, I'm sorry about the little girl.\" Sarah looked up and turned back towards the voice that was calling to her. The sun sat high overhead hurting her already stinging blue eyes when she gazed at the man who had spoken. She saw a tanned, dusty and sweat-streaked face under the heavy Kevlar helmet. She saw a firm jaw with deep cleft in it giving a sense of relief due to the obvious strength. She could see concern but as her eyes focused and she saw his uniform and how the other men and vehicles framed the picture something snapped within her. Jumping to her feet Sarah looked up into the rugged face and shouted, \"It's all YOUR fault, you and your guns! You killed her, all of you, coming here and trying to take over. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Take a look at your work, big tough soldiers…\" Throwing the full weight of her 120 pounds forward she began to beat on Mike's chest and body. Another Marine stepped up to try to stop the missionary but Mike held up his hand to stop him. He knew the broken woman needed the outlet. For Sarah, all the pain, anger and rage that had been building up came out in this attack. The strong hands of the soldier gently but firmly grabbed her, holding not too tightly, until the frenzy passed. She stood there, shuddering at the violence of her assault against those who only were trying to help. She knew it wasn't their fault but they were there and they were a convenient target. The looks Sarah could discern back from the Marines ranged from awkwardness to stony displeasure. But the man who had spoken to her still had a look of pained concern which tore at her already broken heart. She hadn't been fair. \"All right 2-5 lets mount up,\" Mike ordered, as if nothing had happened. \"Dante, you have lead Humvee, stay sharp, watch for snipers,\" he added, signalling the time to move on from the tragedy had arrived as others from the village came out of hiding to clean up and look after the bodies. Silently the group loaded into the four armoured vehicles that their patrol travelled in. The top turret gunners hopped into place and checked their weapons. They automatically swivelled to cover their arcs ensuring 360 degree firepower around the convoy. \"Kilo 1 this is Kilo 1-3,\" Mike called in on the radio to give a report. \"We swept the area and there are numerous dead, no wounded,\" he confirmed to follow up on their first report after coming onto the scene of destruction. \"The school's destroyed too,\" he added without mentioning the Bible's he'd seen which weren't supposed to be there. \"Roger that, it's Taliban alright sir,\" he confirmed what his company commander already knew on the other end of the radio. \"No sir, no sign of them in the area but it wasn't that long ago. Yes, the teacher is secure and we're bringing her back to base. No sir, no other troubles to report.\" Sarah realized how lucky she was to be alive listening to the report. If she hadn't been away from the small village on a long walk, if she hadn't walked in the opposite direction the attack had come from, she would be dead with the others rights now. She tried to see Mike as he spoke to his base but couldn't due to her position in the uncomfortable vehicle. His simple report could have gotten her confined to the compound and her organization censured or expelled for what is it was doing. Her hysterical outburst and hate-laden words could have got her sent back, but this Marine, this man whose name she didn't even know, had covered for her even though she could tell that the men with him didn't appreciate what he'd done. She owed him and needed to thank him. The trip back to Camp Leatherneck was quiet for those in the Humvee. No one spoke of the situation, none knew what to say. Sarah was dropped off at the compound of Teach Afghanistan near the main Marine base in the area to report and recover before returning to the main operating area in the province. Mike had never really paid much attention to the Non-Government Organization before. There were plenty in the country taking part in the reconstruction. Now he looked closer as the small convoy drove away, seeing them in a different light. The sign out front proclaimed education and a future for the children of Afghanistan but now he could read a hidden agenda, one that not only went against the wishes of the leadership in this explosive country but also could prove to be dangerous if the ever-present Taliban discovered this. Mike found himself irritated by the situation, irritated by the woman who hadn't even thanked them but instead insulted and attacked him. He wouldn't report it, it wasn't his place to get people into trouble, but he was still bothered by it. The gate guards waved the vehicles through the sandbag reinforced entrance to camp Leatherneck. The largest Marine base in Afghanistan started as a staging area for operations in the volatile Helmand region. After the President's troop surge it became permanent spanning over 1,600 acres of space and housing 20,000 people. Despite the dust, searing heat during the day and numbing cold at night it did have many comforts like gyms, good mess facilities, call centers for phoning home and a well-stocked PX. But in Marine tradition it didn't have the frills of other NATO bases like restaurants. All the comforts of home, secure behind a large berm, razor wire, concrete and machine gun towers. Home sweet home. Mike made sure his men started all their PPD's, post-patrol-drills, before reporting to the battalion command post to make his report. The battalion Executive Officer, Major Ken Ritchie, listened in, uncomfortable with the brazen nature of the attack. None of the officers present could understand why this school, which has stood for two years, now suddenly had been attacked. Mike gave what details he could though left out the part about the Bibles he'd seen, guilt welling up in him like bile. Still uncomfortable he returned to his men, checking in to make sure no one was cutting corners cleaning weapons and checking gear. He had little fear of that since he'd left them in the hands of Cpl. Dwayne Lockett. The mid-20's African American was one of the best Marines he knew and had become a friend despite their age difference. Lockett desperately wanted to join the special ops regiment Mike had been part of so the Staff Sergeant had been mentoring him and helping him train. Lockett knew, as Mike had taught him, it was easy to get sloppy with a routine but the small stuff saved lives. The dedicated Marine made sure not only the others knew it but did it. \"Hey Staff Sergeant,\" Lockett greeted him. \"Lockett,\" Mike replied. \"Almost done?\" \"Yea, then we'll hit the mess for some chow. You want to join us?\" \"Thanks but no. I need to clear my head.\" \"The school attack messin' with you?\" Lockett guessed correctly. \"It is,\" Mike admitted, \"for a lot of reasons. I have some stuff to sort out.\" Sensing a need to change subjects, Lockett said, \"I got a letter from my little bro Jason.\" \"How's he doing?\" \"Great. He figures he'll make Corporal before the end of the summer. Can you get that? Little runt'll beat my time in to his second stripe. \"You should be proud of him,\" Mike chuckled at the sibling rivalry, \"he's had a pretty good example.\" The squad efficiently finished their work, bantering back and forth as soldiers do despite the death and destruction they'd just witnessed. It wasn't insensitivity or lack of compassion. The laughter and dark humour was an age-old safeguard that helped them keep their sanity in an insane situation. A couple guys went to hit the gym while Lockett and the others sauntered over to the Mess Hall. Mike walked off aimlessly by himself, a bottle of Gatorade in hand, pondering what he'd seen in the school and what that meant. He finally sat down on a bench, idly rubbing the defined cleft in his solid chin. His eyes fixed on a lone figure running towards him. Clad in grey USMC shirt and red shorts the lean man was obviously a competitive runner. Spotting Mike the runner pulled up to a stop at his bench. \"Hello Michael!\" the middle-aged man with short brown hair and greying temples greeted him cheerfully. \"Hi Father Alexander,\" Mike responded affectionately. Father Alexander McNair served as one of the chaplains for the 2-5 Marines. The Roman Catholic priest still had a slight Irish brogue since he'd been born in Dublin prior to his family moving to America. An avid marathon runner, Father Alexander would often be seen running laps on the hard packed dirt roads around the base. \"You still planning on running that race, Sir?\" Mike asked with a chuckle. \"You bet, LA Marathon, March 12th.\" Despite sweating profusely from the exertion of his run, the priest's breathing had already returned to normal. \"I've got the leave booked already. May I?\" he asked, gesturing to the Gatorade bottle on the bench. \"Go ahead.\" Mike agreed, shaking his head at the temporary distraction. \"Why anyone would voluntarily run that long for fun is beyond me.\" \"God works in mysterious ways,\" the priest answered as he took a long drink of the orange Gatorade, his green eyes lighting up playfully. \"Yea, he does.\" \"What's up Michael?\" Father Alexander asked. \"Something's bothering you, I can tell.\" Father Alexander was not just a priest and terrific runner he also had an annoying habit of being able to read minds. He had walked with Mike through the dark days after Amanda left him and through the divorce proceedings so was the only one who could call him Michael. Mike had met so many people who professed to know God, who would speak authoritatively about it, but this man was the only one he'd met who he knew truly knew God. He'd helped Mike see this wasn't God's fault but the consequence of choice. The priest was different from many of the other chaplains who would sit in their air-conditioned offices waiting for people to come to them. He'd go out on patrol with the Marines, eat with them, share the same dirt, the same risk. The men trusted him and Mike trusted him with his life. \"Well…,\" Mike hedged, not wanting to talk about what he'd seen, afraid of how Father Alexander would see it. \"Michael,\" the priest responded with a stern, parental 'tell me' tone. \"Okay. We were on a patrol today and got a call about an attack on a school about 75 klicks out. We know the place so by the time we get there the rag heads were already gone. They'd burned the school and killed a couple of the kids. There was nothing we could do,\" Mike explained, guilt evident in the explanation. \"The teacher was okay though because she'd been away from the school so we brought her back.\" \"What a terrible thing, to kill children in the name of God,\" the priest mused. \"Yea, but the thing that's getting me is in the school there were a whole bunch of Bibles,\" Mike confessed. \"Each of the kids who were killed was holding one. I think the teachers a missionary and the organization behind the school and the work in this area is a Christian mission's organization trying to fly under the radar.\" Father Alexander's normally cheerful faced clouded with anger. \"Are you sure of this Michael?\" \"Yes sir, I am,\" Mike responded. Concerned he'd upset the chaplain he added, \"Sorry, I didn't mean to rag on the church or anything. It's just, well, if they are doing this, that's wrong and its putting a lot of people at risk.\" \"Yes, themselves included,\" the priest responded. \"I'm not frustrated by you Michael but by them. I'm glad you told me because I've had my suspicions already about this group. I too would love to see the people of this land experience the love of Jesus and receive Bibles but the time isn't right. Things are too fragile and doing this type of thing only enflames the situation,\" the priest mused. \"Don't let this stress you. Let me handle this.\" Father Alexander McNeil left a relieved Mike Nantz to make inquiries and see what could be done about Teach Afghanistan. What he found was a more powerful organization behind it then he'd imagined, one well-funded and well protected by politicians back home who tacitly approved of their mission. Despite his knowledge and his position Father Alexander was told, in no uncertain terms, to mind his own business or suffer the consequences. The group could be touched by no one it seemed but the Taliban.[Chapter 8] Chapter-8 No Right Answer Mike tried to avoid her but she'd seen him first so came walking over towards him. The teacher his team had brought in from the destroyed school seemed to need to talk. \"Hi, I'm Sarah Scott,\" she introduced herself with a toothy smile. \"Staff Sergeant Mike Nantz,\" he countered politely, noticing she wore a plain silver ring on each thumb. Not your typical teacher, or missionary , he thought to himself. \"Listen, I want to apologize for the things I said yesterday. I was in shock and treated you poorly,\" she admitted. \"I'm leaving to return to our station in Sar Puzeur later today and couldn't live with myself if I didn't try to make it right. None of what happened was your fault. I should never have said that. I'm sorry,\" she confessed honestly, her brown eyes moistening a bit. \"I appreciate how hard your job must be.\" Impressed by Sarah's honesty, and something in her look, he decided to speak openly to her. \"Thanks for that Miss Scott.\" \"Sarah, please,\" she corrected him. \"Okay, Sarah,\" Mike agreed. \"I appreciate you saying that. Can I be honest with you?\" \"Sure, you can say anything you want,\" the attractive woman flashed a radiant smile, misunderstanding his intent. \"I know what you guys are up to,\" Mike began awkwardly. \"You're not just about education, you're a Christian missions agency from what I can see.\" \"Well…I…I mean…its just…,\" Sarah stammered awkwardly as the truth of her organization was revealed. She'd never been comfortable with this 'little secret', not understanding why they had to hide serving God. But she'd been emphatically told, ordered in fact, to keep their mission quiet. \"I'm not judging you and I'm not questioning your sincerity. In fact I agree in some ways this place needs God big time,\" Mike confessed, drawing an appreciative look from Sarah. \"But what you're doing is dangerous. The Taliban are already riled up in this district. They don't need a bunch of Christians flying under the radar whipping them up even more.\" \"I just want to serve God,\" she admitted, eyes beginning to tear up. \"I can see that,\" Mike answered, feeling terrible for upsetting the young woman. \"Just be careful that you don't end up causing more harm then good and getting a lot of people hurt in the process.\" \"Thank you Staff Sergeant for watching out for us,\" Sarah said quietly, \"I also appreciate your concern for me.\" \"Call me Mike,\" he answered. The two spent the next hour talking about life, hopes and dreams while avoiding what each did. Both seemed appreciative of the distraction. Unfortunately Lockett saw the two together and teased the embarrassed man mercilessly later but it had been a nice reprieve for Mike. Three days later Mike enjoyed a rare day off. Sleeping late then visiting the Mess Hall for breakfast, he planned on hitting the gym and then watching a movie. The new Shrek movie was showing and he needed a few laughs. He'd also been thinking about Sarah, as he'd done off and on since their meeting, wondering about her. None of his plans were to be. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz!\" Mike heard his voice then saw the orderly for their battalion executive officer come trotting over to him. \"What's up?\" he asked. \"XO needs you in the battalion CP right now Staff Sergeant,\" the pimply-faced teenage Marine answered. While Mike had been enjoying a rare leisurely breakfast a sweating man with receding hairline wearing a dress shirt and slacks marched unannounced into the battalion command post. \"I'm Arthur Livingstone, from the State Department,\" he announced, flashing his credentials. \"I'm a liaison officer with an NGO that's operating in this region. One of their compounds in Sar Puzeur has been captured by Taliban and we need you to go in and free them.\" \"What?\" Major Ken Ritchie, Executive Officer of the battalion responded, caught off guard by the intrusion and thrust of the statement. \"What compound are you talking about? We've had no reports of anything like that going on.\" \"Its Teach Afghanistan. The news came through our channels and our sources,\" Livingstone answered. \"And you've confirmed this?\" \"Yes we have. It's imperative you mount a rescue operation immediately. In fact it has to be today.\" \"That's impossible,\" Ritchie nearly exploded at the presumption of the civilian. \"We don't have the right personnel for this type of operation, plus we need to gather information and prepare,\" the major tried to explain more calmly. \"You have soldiers right?\" the man retorted, \"so use them and get the job done.\" \"You don't understand,\" Ritchie tried to stay patient while wanting to punch the arrogant snot in the face. \"We have line soldiers here. We need specialists, commandos like a Delta Force team.\" \"There's no time to bring in anyone else for this.\" \"Well the Brits have a troop of SAS, Special Air Service commandos, at their base next door,\" Ritchie implored. \"Why not use them?\" \"This is a delicate matter,\" Livingstone deflected the Marine officer, \"we don't want to go through the paperwork.\" \"Paperwork?\" Ritchie finally lost his calm façade. \"And what do you mean by delicate?\" the Marine asked, his eyes narrowing. \"They're not, strictly speaking, a relief and teaching organization,\" the sweating State Department officer replied evasively. \"Well what exactly are they?\" \"A branch of Worldwide Gospel Outreach,\" Livingstone admitted. \"What? A Christian missions organization in Helmand province?\" Ritchie shouted. \"You know they're illegal here. No wonder the Taliban are all kicking up a ruckus. Do you know how dangerous that is? How that puts us all at risk? Our very mission here is in jeopardy.\" \"We know that and they will be dealt with at the appropriate time but for now we must free the people there,\" Livingstone responded, his smooth voice sounding suddenly oily. \"This needs to be done before CNN or any other press organization finds out. If this gets out it could be very embarrassing for American interests and we can't let that happen.\" \"We don't have the right type of people for this type of operation,\" the Marine officer stubbornly declared. \"You don't have any choice in the matter Major,\" the State Department rep declared, puffing out his chest. \"This has the full approval of not only the NATO commander for this region but also the ambassador. I'm ordering you to get this done. Do you want to confirm this or should I?\" he asked smugly, pulling out his cell phone for effect. Great, not only are we the last to find out but now foreigners and politicians are giving orders to field officers Major Ritchie thought to himself. No wonder we can't win this fight . He thought about verifying all this for a moment but knew already what the answer would be. He turned his attention to the task at hand thinking who he could call from the battalion who might have the skills to pull it off. A name came to mind. \"Private Diggs,\" he called for his orderly, \"find Staff Sergeant Nantz and get him here right away.\" Skipping the pleasantries, Major Ritchie went right into the problem when Mike arrived. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, we have a situation we need your skills for. The Taliban have captured one of our NGO compounds about 75 klicks from here. You're going to lead a team to go in and take it back.\" \"We're doing this sir?\" Mike answered in surprise. \"Isn't that something for special ops to handle rather then line soldiers?\" \"There isn't time to assemble the necessary assets, this is time sensitive,\" his superior officer ordered \"Okay,\" Mike replied, wondering why this would be the case then getting a sick feeling of realization in his stomach. \"Who's the group sir?\" \"Teach Afghanistan.\" Mike knew immediately why the place had been taken and why it had to be done quickly. He suddenly felt like a little pawn in a big chess game. The others looked at him expectantly, Major Ritchie avoided eye contact. The die had been cast, there'd be no room for debate. \"All right then, how many hostiles in the compound and how many hostages?\" Mike asked impassively. \"Our information has it at three or four Taliban militiamen only,\" the State Department man stated definitively. \"In terms of hostages, we'll get find that out when we're on the ground.\" \"Any thermal imagining assets available for prep work?\" Mike asked his superior officer. \"Not available for this mission Staff Sergeant,\" Major Ritchie answered uncomfortably. Super, Mike thought. \"Well I guess we'll sort that out too when we get there.\" \"How soon can you have your squad ready to move?\" Livingstone demanded. \"Time is of the essence here.\" \"My squad sir?\" Mike choked out in surprise to Major Ritchie. \"We're not going to pick a team from guys in the battalion who've actually done this before?\" \"There's no time to put it all together and prep you to work with each other,\" the XO declared with a hint of exasperation. \"We need to move fast. You and your squad are going to handle this. Get your men squared away and ready to move within the hour.\" The die had been cast indeed, white pawn to E4. A Rapid Response Team from the base had arrived in Sar Puzeur ahead of Mike's squad and formed a perimeter securing the compound. By the time the convoy of MTVR transport trucks protected by four LAV25's arrived with Mike, his team, Major Ritchie, Arthur Livingstone and a State Department aide the area had been cleared. Few civilians were on the dusty streets and those who did travel about ignored the military presence. They knew what was going on and who was doing it so none wanted to become entangled in the situation. Soldiers from the Afghan National Army inefficiently manned several road blocks but beyond that the locals would be of no use. The MK25's wheels had barely stopped moving when the Marines swung into action. Mike left Cpl. Lockett in charge of the squad and followed the others into a one- story mud building that appeared to be used as a make-shift headquarters. Several Marines greeted them as they arrived while a group of three civilians huddled together as if praying. One left the group and greeted the new arrivals as they came through the door. \"This is Ray Stanton, project manager for this area for Teach Afghanistan,\" Livingstone announced. \"He can give you any information you need.\" Mike surveyed the leader of the group. The middle-aged man's sweat-stained shirt matched the glisten on his balding head. Likely didn't get out of the air conditioning much, but then he might be concerned for his people Mike chided himself. \"How many people you have inside?\" he asked, taking charge of the discussion. \"Well, it's hard to tell,\" Stanton answered nervously. \"What do you mean it's hard to tell?\" Mike shot back a bit irritated. \"People come and go. We had a kid's class going on that could range from fifteen to thirty children. Others are here to receive food and clothing packets plus our administrative staff. Say ten plus a couple of nationals and the kids.\" \"How many bad guys?\" \"I'm not sure,\" Stanton admitted. \"When the shooting and yelling started I escaped out of a window,\" he confessed sheepishly. \"You left your people to be captured?\" Mike blurted out in disgust. \"Someone had to put in the call.\" \"Listen Staff Sergeant,\" Livingstone cut in, \"Mr. Stanton's actions are not germane here. If he hadn't done what he did these people might all be dead.\" Mike didn't follow the logic but held his tongue. \"We estimate no more then forty hostages in the building and three to four Taliban,\" the State Department rep reported confidently. \"And you know this how?\" Major Ritchie interjected. \"We have our intelligence sources Major,\" Livingstone responded curtly. \"And they are?\" \"Classified and again not germane,\" the State Department man cut him off. \"Staff Sergeant, what else do you need from us to mount your rescue operation?\" Livingstone asked, signaling there would be no more discussion of that topic. \"Do you have any blueprints?\" Mike asked. \"No, we don't,\" Stanton admitted, becoming more forlorn. \"Please, just help us get the people out safely. \"We'll do the best we can,\" Mike answered, feeling sympathy for the man. \"Can anyone who knows the building make me an accurate drawing?\" Livingstone's eyes nervously darted around the collected group as Stanton avoided eye contact. \"Sure, we can provide that for you no problem,\" he answered unconvincingly. Guy probably knows little of the place other then his office and the kitchen Mike thought to himself, sympathy eroding. \"Okay, I'm going to prep my team and do a recce of the perimeter. When I get back I'd like that drawing and also any updates on numbers and hostiles.\" Mike left before anyone could respond, wanting to get away from the group as quick as he could. He felt sorry for Major Ritchie but then he was an officer and that's what they got paid for. \"Lockett, Dante, bring your teams in,\" Mike ordered his Marines who stood around the vehicles waiting for instruction. \"All right guys, I'm going to recce the location, you guys do weapons prep, equipment check and unpack the NODs. We're going to go in light and hard so minimal ammo and kit.\" Mike left the guys to do their thing as he prowled around the perimeter of the compound. He then found a building that allowed a good line of sight of the compound. Settling into position he began a mental inventory: Low wall with entry gate closed. Two dead guards at front. Scanning the periphery he saw what he needed. No cameras, that's good, windows shuttered closed but likely being watched. Three doors. Stanton won't likely know anything about what kind of locking or barring mechanism they have. There, two blind spots, we can use those for entry. He had the information he needed so before leaving he took a moment to sit back and thing of the reality of the situation: no time for rehearsals, no protocols set and with a team that's not trained for this type of thing. Lovely Arriving back a short time later at the command center he gave his assessment to the gathered military and civilian command group. A drawing had been provided of the two floors of the building which looked fairly accurate. He could make a fairly decent guess where the hostages would be held but the remainder of the building housed smaller offices and meeting rooms, prime fall back and ambush points. His prognosis for a safe clearing and rescue operation wasn't promising. No one cared; the show had to go on. While the civilians went away to find some coffee, satisfied they'd done all they could, Mike took the opportunity to speak to his superior officer. \"Sir, this is a disaster waiting to happen. We don't have proper int, we don't know what we're up against and I have guys who aren't trained for this.\" \"It's an imperfect world,\" Major Ritchie responded evenly understanding what the man said but knowing his hands were tied. \"We all have our orders; just get it done Staff Sergeant. Retreat…\" \"Hell,\" Mike answered, snapping off a salute. Mike, a sick feeling in his stomach, went away to get his men ready as best he could for the operation. Attempts to contact the attackers holding the compound continually failed. The command group couldn't figure out what they were waiting for. Then Livingstone's cell phone went off and they received an answer. Someone called the State Department rep letting him know a press contingent was on the way from Kabul and would be there in the morning. \"There's no more time to wait Major,\" Livingstone announced flipping his phone closed, \"your team has to go tonight. This has to be done and finished before morning. Is that clear?\" \"Crystal,\" Major Ritchie replied grimly. Turning to Mike he ordered, \"You have a green light, go get that compound back.\" Mike returned to the staging area, a heavy sense of foreboding enveloping him like the darkness of the approaching night. His plan had a simple elegance to it; it had to be though considering the situation and the key players. At 2am the power would be cut at the building and the assaulting force would enter from the north and east entrances in two teams using small explosive charges Mike had fashioned to create a breech. A third team would provide cover with the best shots in the squad providing sniper overwatch. With his squad huddled around him, Mike went over the drawing of the building and plan of attack while reviewing their drills for the fourth time. \"Don't worry Staffs,\" Lockett chuckled. \"You sound like an old lady. We know what we're going to do and we're going to get it done. Who-rah!\" The other Marines responded in kind, excitement at the prospect of the mission growing. \"Well stay focused,\" Mike snapped back. \"It may look easy but it never is. Watch for traps, watch for trip wires and watch your corners. They tell me they're only three or four inside but I doubt it. Be ready for more. But be sure of your targets before you fire, we don't want any civvie casualties.\" With time marching on and no further opportunity for training he gave the order to move out. Using Night Optical Devices the squad that had been broken up into three teams moved like ghosts into position. Thomas Dante would take one team through a service entrance at the north-east side of the building; Mike would lead the main assaulting force through the main entrance on the center of the north wall. Those groups would converge on the school room located on the main floor to rescue the hostages. Dwayne Lockett would follow with his group behind Mike and clear the second floor. Two Marines would act as snipers covering the building. It sounded good on paper but reality didn't always work out that way. At 0130 the squad moved into the inky darkness of the night. They easily reached the blind spots in the lighting of the building and silent as wraiths cleared the perimeter wall and moved into their start positions. Mike was pleased by how well things had gone so far, he began to hope they might actually be able to pull it off. Looking at the luminous dial on his watch he saw they had two minutes until go. He hand signaled his team and Lockett while depressing the send button on his radio twice to let Cpl. Dante's team know they were good to go. On cue, the lights went out at 2am, throwing the compound into darkness. The Marines switched on their NODs then swung into action. Dante hit the fuse to set off the breaching charge he'd placed on the handle assembly on the door. A split second later it went off with a dull pop and the door swung partly open. Adrenaline coursing through his veins, the excited Corporal threw in a flash bang grenade and waited for it to go off. With a loud whump the deafening concussion would stun anyone in its radius. Framing the door Dante shouted back to his team, \"All right, let's go 2-..\" He never finished the sentence. In his excitement he failed to see the trip wire connected to the door. When it opened it had gone taught. Dante hit it moving into the door, setting off a charge of C4 explosives. A sickening crump erupted hitting him and William Armbruster square on. The two were dead before they knew it flying back to tie up the remainder of their team. Mike had already thrown in his own flash bang before he heard the explosion on the other side of the building as he moved through his entrance. The distinct sound gave him a sickening feeling of dread. He'd seen a similar charge and detailed a trailer to look after it. \"Explosion at secondary entrance, team 3 is down and inoperational,\" Pte. Craig McNabb, the sniper reported, anger in his voice, confirming Mike's worst fears. But there was no time for that. Anger welled up in Mike like bile, he had men down. But he couldn't go there, the clock was ticking. Going onto autopilot, his days as a commando kicking in, Mike moved swiftly into the building. Hugging the wall he scanned left and right for movement, M4A1 tracking as he went. Two gomers with AK47s stumbled towards him, holding their deafened ears. Two rounds in the chest, one in the head in quick succession left the two Taliban fighters dead. \"Movement, second floor third window,\" LCpl Donovan Bailey, the other sniper, reported over the radio. Crack! The sharp report of the A5 sniper rifle told the tale. \"One hostile down, others moving to center of building.\" Lockett's blocking force raced towards the stairs to intercept. Mike continued to move swiftly towards the location of the school room. Without the other team converging they'd need to push the pace. Another gomer came out of a room. Wide-eyed with surprise at the face-painted Marines and their NODs he paused for a moment which proved fatal. Mike dispatched him with the same three round pattern. Four down already at least , Mike thought, so much for only three or four holding the building. They'd arrived at the entrance to the school room. Mike paused to allow the others to catch up. The sound of gunfire erupted on the floor above them; he couldn't think of that, he had to get the kids. He could hear voices within the room shouting back and forth in Arabic, a good sign. He hoped they were at the right place. Using hand signal he had his men form into position, giving them their placements since they'd be the only ones going in. It had been less then a minute-and-a-half since the lights had gone out but already it seemed like hours. With another Marine preparing to open the door, Mike gave the signal. The team burst into the room fast seeking to overwhelm what they hoped would be those holding the hostages. Mike's guess had been right. Scanning the room through his NOD, the eerie green glow showed a room in confusion. Children and mission workers huddled on the floor. Four Taliban stood around the cowering hostages yelling and threatening them with their AK47s. Though the room was still pitch black, they'd heard the door open. Mike took down one of the terrorists before he could get his gun up with a quick triple-tap burst. That set off a cacophony of screams from the children at the sound of the gunfire. One of the Taliban fired back with a wild burst of automatic fire wide of the mark. The next Marine through the doorway took him out with fire from his M4A1. Mike lined up the third one who had tried to shift position but never made it. His muzzle flashed and the terrorist went down in a heap leaving a bloody streak against the wall he crumpled against. The last Taliban went to shoot at the Marines but changed his mind at the last minute trying to bring his weapon to bear on the children to inflict maximum damage. That proved to be a mistake. He had a clear shot at the exposed Marine but in the time it took for him to shift another member of the team cut the gomer down with a burst of automatic fire. It was now about two minutes since the Marines had entered the building and miraculously all the hostages seemed safe. Despite the short period of time Mike could hear his breathing and feel his heart beating. He scanned the room for hostiles, seeing none he looked again to be satisfied they were safe. He noticed a curly haired teacher holding onto several of the children, it was Sarah. \"School room cleared, hostages secure,\" Mike reported through his radio to the rest of the assaulting force and the command center. Focusing on his team he began to order, \"Cover the entrances to the room until the building is secure. Jenkins, with me, Wortner hold this…\" He never finished the sentence as the lights unexpectedly came on in the building and the room. The burst of lights through the Night Optical Devices caused excruciating pain for the Marines wearing them. Mike instinctively threw them off as he doubled over in discomfort. Just as that occurred he heard a grenade go off on the second floor. Again he felt sickened since none of his men carried any. So much for perfect plans. \"Allahu Akbar!\" The opposite door burst open and three Taliban gunmen ran yelling into the room, weapons ready. LCpl Jeffrey Wortner was closest and took a full burst in the chest, going down with a groan of shocked pain. Mike shot back, dropping the first one through the door with a lucky shot to the head. The next went for the children. Opening fire three were hit before Sarah jumped in front of the gunman catching the remainder of the burst in the stomach with a sickening groan but effectively shielding the children. \"No!\" Mike screamed as he turned his M4A1 loose to late on the threat. The Taliban gunner fell down in a heap on top of the teacher whose body protected the cluster of children. The other Marines in the room were still not able to respond, shocked at the turn of events and incapacitated by their NODs. One terrorist remained, looking to take as many with him as he could before becoming a martyr. The Afghan saw Mike as the key threat so turned his weapon to eliminate it. Mike anticipated this move so rolled out of the way as the weapon burst in orange flame peppering the wall he'd just been standing beside. Mike came out of the roll into the prone position and fired up at the surprised Taliban sending several rounds up into his groin and through to the liver. The terrorist buckled over in pain allowing the anguished staff sergeant to finish him with two shots into the head. Mike released his grip on the assault rifle, letting it hang by its sling as he looked at the carnage and destruction around him. All he wanted to do was throw up. Then he heard the sounds of screaming children. Mike watched the four caskets being loaded on the C5 Galaxy. It had been two days since the assault on the Teach Afghanistan compound. The mission had been deemed a tremendous success by the State Department because it had been done before the press arrived and the missions organization could be exposed. In the end there had not been four Taliban holding the compound but thirteen. So much for accurate intelligence. Mike had taken out eight of them himself. As a result, he'd been recommended for a Silver Star. The idea made him want to throw up again. Sarah Scott, the naïve but effervescent missionary from Ohio had died protecting the children she'd come to teach. Mike was reminded there was something in the Bible about greater love being willing to lay down a life for a friend. Dante and Armbruster had died in the initial assault when they missed the door charge. Wortner met his end when someone at the command post had jumped the gun and turned on the power to the building before it had been fully secured. Accidents happen. The last casket was reserved for Dwayne Lockett. Like Sarah, he'd given his life to protect others, throwing himself on a Taliban grenade that had been tossed into the hallway saving the rest of his team from harm. Greater love. Lockett goes home in a box and I get a medal, what a sick joke , Mike thought to himself. The mission had already been deemed classified so none would know the truth of what happened save those who'd been part of it. That suited Mike just fine. He wanted to forget as soon as he could be instinctively knew the faces would be with him forever. \"Come on Michael, its time to move on,\" Father Alexander said to him quietly, hand reassuringly placed on the now shaking Marine. \"You did all you could, no one could ask for more. There was no right answer here.\"[Chapter 9] CHAPTER 9 – Realization Jason Lockett thought about his brother Dwayne again, as he did every day. The brooding Marine wondered anew how he'd died. For over a year Jason had hated the man who he thought responsible for his brother's death. The name had been a curse word to him: Staff Sergeant Nantz. But now that had changed. Lockett had it out with Nantz less then two weeks earlier at the destroyed Santa Monica airport forward operating base witnessing for himself how much the stoic Sergeant had been impacted by his brother's death also. Still, though he didn't hate Nantz, he couldn't understand how the man could have let Dwayne die, especially if he considered him a friend. It was frustrating not knowing how it had happened so he continued to simmer. \"You think we're going to see any action soon, corporal?\" Pte. Dan Keenan asked, breaking Lockett's train of thought. \"Hard to say DK,\" Lockett replied to the 17 year old farm boy from Iowa using his nickname. \"Squidheads've been quiet lately but they're out there for sure.\" Squidhead, or squids, had become a slang expression for the aliens as was 'rastas', referring to the long dreadlock-like tentacles that extended from some of their heads. The nicknames demystified the unusual foe as the defenders moved from shocked surprise to gritty determination. Seeing the nervousness in the teenager, an E-1, a kid really, who'd only been in the Corp less than four months, Lockett added, \"Don't sweat it man. Just stay alert, watch your corners and everything'll be okay.\" After the battle to secure the Golden State Freeway ramp and set up a staging area for counter-attack at Whiteman Airport, with Staff Sergeant Nantz being wounded and the number of overall casualties a large-scale reorganization had been necessary within the 2-5. Imlay and Doc had been placed in a platoon of the reformed Echo company, Santos' battle experience had gained her some recognition so she'd been made a FAC, Forward Air Controller with an Air Force reconaissance and identification company calling in close air strikes while Harris and Lockett now served in F company. The Marines, with the Nevada tanks and Air National Guard support, had been able to successfully push out from the airport achieving a solid foothold in San Fernando. The task had been tough slugging though, street by street and house to house at times. They'd made headway but it had been exhausting work the past week. Reinforcements had begun to arrive from different parts of the country which helped but the 2-5 Marines continued to be at the forefront since they had the most experience fighting the aliens. Lockett and Harris' platoon were on an advance to contact mission. That meant they pushed forward along the route they'd been given until they met up with the enemy. Moving carefully forward into 'Indian territory', or hostile land, the soldiers tensely scanned all around for movement, listening with strained ears for the now-familiar chirp of the aliens communicating or worse, the whine of their weapon systems spooling up. The platoon commander raised his hand to call for a halt. The Marines immediately went down on one knee forming a defensive perimeter while the officer took out his binoculars to survey the territory to their front. The platoon was led by 1st Lieutenant James 'Flash' Gordon. Gordon had been an NCAA champion sprinter at Florida State University and a favorite to represent America at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. But a torn hamstring in the quarterfinals of the qualifying meet ended his athletic career. The muscular African-American joined the Marines after he'd recovered, going to Officer Candidate School and excelling in the competitive environment. Though a firm disciplinarian, Flash Gordon also had a good sense of humor and led fairly so was respected and liked by his troops. Surveying the route of their advance Gordon saw something he didn't like. He knew there were still aliens in the area yet they'd had no sign of them thus far. It seemed like a recipe for ambush and the location to his front seemed to be the prime ingredient. Moving through a residential area they had been moving past a series of low rise apartment buildings. But to their front, about 200 meters away, two four story apartments across the street from each other had been blown up in an earlier battle. Brick and debris spilling out onto the road caused an impasse leaving only a narrow path through to the other side and the Marines' objective. Yes, it seemed a perfect place for an ambush. Bringing his squad leaders up Gordon gave them the plan. \"Lockett, your team has point, Harris, support. The rest of the platoon will follow then fan out once we're past the bottleneck, you hold the opening then bring up the rear,\" he ordered. \"Lets get it done Marines.\" \"First squad on me,\" Lockett announced bringing his men in for a quick huddle. \"We're moving forward. I want the SAW covering our advance then rolling up with us in bounds.\" Pointing to the obstacle he added, \"When we hit the choke point we go through single file, reform on the other side, then provide a blocking force for the rest of the platoon. DK you stay on my butt. Watch out for Squid Heads, and watch your intervals, don't bunch up, keep moving,\" he rattled off, tension rising. \"Okay, let's go.\" With the rest of the platoon waiting for them and Harris' squad providing fire support, the Marines spread out then moved fast towards the barrier to their advance. Each could feel their bodies tensing as they got closer, expecting, almost willing, the anticipated attack to come so they could unwind. Running down the debris-strewn road Lockett hit the opening first and found cover. He looked, saw nothing, then listened and heard nothing other than his pounding heart. He let out a breath he'd seemed to be holding since he left the platoon. Carefully moving through, he found a position behind a burned out car to provide cover for the others. One by one the remainder of the squad threaded through the obstacle and fanned out. Harris' squad came through next, movingd up and through to a new postion with the rest of the platoon following. Tension dropping, Lockett smiled in relief at the sweating DK who seemed tiny under all his gear. \"Nothing,\" Lockett said with a chuckle, taking a moment to relax, \"all this fuss over nothing. Lets…\" But the words froze in his mouth as he heard the familiar whine of an alien machine gun spooling up. Caught totally off guard he searched for the words in his stunned mind to yell out a warning. \"Nine o'clock!\" a kneeling Marine a few yards away yelled before disintegrated in a shower of grenades. The earth errupted around the platoon as aliens emerged from their hiding spots. They'd timed it perfectly allowing half the group to move through the barrier with the rest left behind effectively cutting them in two. Lockett let loose with his M4A1, dropping an alien that had exposed itself to attempt a cross fire. Several more grenades rained down but his squad had been put into good position. Harris' team responded but had moved too far forward and were cut off. Now pinned down, Lockett could see this but wasn't able to respond. Lt. Gordon and the remnant were hard pressed trying to make it through the obstacle. If something wasn't done they'd be chewed up piecemeal. Another Marine Lockett had only just met two days ago cartwheeled through the air landing with a dull thud on the hood of the car he'd been kneeling behind. The hard pressed soldier could see a trio of aliens moving to cut him off so rather then fire he ripped an HE grenade off his tactical vest and chucked it in their direction. The aliens had been caught moving so took the full effect of the explosive charge, shreding them. Lockett saw his chance to link up with Harris and shore up their defenses. \"DK!\" he yelled at the rookie, \"you're with me. We need to reposition and help Harris out.\" \"All right corporal!\" the excited rookie yelled out, immediately starting to move. \"No, wait man until I tell you!\" Lockett screamed. The warning came too late. The grinning farm boy from Iowa, overcome with the adrenaline and excitement of combat, stood straight up, eager to fight and was shot through the head. Lockett saw the round enter through his face and expode out the back. \"Medic!\" Lockett roared in agony as the teenage soldier's lifeless eyes stared at him in shock. Unconciously switching his M4A1 to full auto he emptied the clip towards the attacking aliens doing no damage. The situation seemed bleak for the pinned down platoon. They'd been caught in a pincer movement by the enemy who now were systematically squeezing it shut. Rescue came from above before the alien plan could be put into full effect. A pair of Apache helicopters suddenly roared overhead loosing a salvo of Hydra 70's. The rockets slammed into the main party of attacking aliens with the resulting explosion causing the area to boil with fire. Banking sharply left and right the deadly choppers came out of their tight, co-ordinated turns to rake the alien ranks with lethal fire from their 30mm chain guns. What seemed like a hopeless situation turned on a dime to the Marine's favor due to the head's up thinking of Lt. Gordon who'd called for air support once the first squad had moved out. The aliens retreated knowing they didn't stand a chance against the superior firepower, having to be content with the damage they'd done. Firing at the helicopters as they withdrew, the invaders had to contend with them nipping at their heels in return like a pitbull. Gordon's platoon was in no shape to continue the advance with numerous men down, dead or wounded. The call went out for medivac support and Echo company moved through Foxtrot's position continuing the advance. Imlay saw Lockett, head in his hands weeping beside the still body of the pimple-faced Marine. He didn't stop, giving his friend some space but did catch Harris' eyes as they moved forward to secure a new position –advance to contact. Fist-bumping each other, Imlay could only say, \"Keep an eye on him.\" \"Yea,\" Harris acknowledged, \"you watch out for yourself bro.\" \"You too. Stay healthy man,\" Imlay returned. \"Cherise is out there and she still wants to marry your sorry ass.\" Harris flashed a toothy grin but the comment both stabbed his heart and caused it to soar. Cherise would be waiting for him, looking for him, if…. He wouldn't go down that path. The brief exchange was lost on Lockett. Wiping a grimy hand across his face he stood up to begin reorganizing his section. The show must go on. But in a flash an unexpected burst of emotion hit him like he'd never experienced before causing him to almost buckle over. He'd lost men today, in fact his whole fire team, all four men including a kid just out of boot camp, were either dead or wounded and he was walking away without a scratch. Hurt, surprise, frustration, rage and intense sadness all bombarded Lockett at the same time as he watched two Navy corpsman prepare to carry DK's body away. In an instant he suddenly knew exactly how Staff Sergeant Nantz felt. While Lockett was having his revelation and beginning to understand the no-win situation of war at times Mike Nantz lay in his cot in the hospital ward as he'd done the past week thinking. He had begun to move around and do some rehabilitation but only in short bursts. That left him with a lot of free time on his hands, not a good thing for a guy with ghosts haunting him. Inevitably his thoughts went back to Afghanistan a year earlier and the men in his platoon who'd been killed on the rescue mission. A rescue mission, just like the one less then two weeks ago-filled with a lack of information and impossible odds. When Mike had held onto a dead Hector Rincon that night at the Santa Monica Airport he'd been taken back to that mission where he'd watched another group of helpless civilians he was supposed to protect die…where he'd watched Sarah die. His men dying in that compound, trying to save those who were already dead, was just the icing on the cake. Oh yes, he has a lot of ghosts keeping him company. He needed activity. \"Good morning sleepyhead!\" Michele greeted him playfully walking towards his bed. \"Huh?\" Mike replied in confusion since she'd interrupted his thoughts. Seeing the brooding look on the face of the man who'd saved her life the veternarian now turned medical assistant felt her heart pull yet again. \"I heard we're making good progress in retaking LA plus the report is the alien command and control ship in New York has finally been destroyed,\" she reported, trying to shift the mood. \"That's great,\" Mike responded grumpily. \"Is there anything I can get for you?\" she asked compassionately. \"Yea, you can get me out of this place!\" he shot back. \"What? No, you're not ready, you need to heal,\" the dark-haired woman testily responded, reeling from the declaration. \"I need to get out of here and get back to my troops,\" the Marine declared. Seeing the look of hurt in Michele's eyes Mike paused then tried to explain, \"Listen, I appreciate everything everyone's doing. I appreciate everything you're doing,\" he added, avoiding her stare. \"Its just I feel so useless here. There's a fight going on out there, its not just a fight for ideas or even our protection like we've been doing with these terrorists. This is a fight for our survival. I have to be part of it,\" he revealed passionately. Can you understand that?\" \"I can. I do see Mike,\" Michele answered, her heart filling with compassion for the frustrated man. \"Its just…,\" she wrestled with her thoughts, \"Its just…,\" she couldn't say it but then she realized how things could change in an instant, how her caution had caused her to lose so much. She wasn't about to lose him to the same insecurity. \"What is it?\" Mike asked tenderly seeing the turmoil, causing her heart to melt. \"I can't lose you Mike,\" Michele admitted breathlessly. \"I…\" \"So how are we feeling today Staff Sergeant?\" a heavy-set National Guard doctor asked, destroying the moment. Mike and Michele pulled back more emotionally then physically as the distracted MD busied himself with his examination. But something had been about to happen between the pair, they stood on a precipice needing only a nudge. It seemed it wouldn't happen this day. \"Good. Yes, very good,\" the doctor said more to himself then to Mike going over his charts. \"You're making great progress.\" \"When can I get back on the line?\" Mike blurted out in exasperation. \"Combat?\" the doctor asked in shock. \"Yea, when can I get back to my men?\" Michele felt her jaw drop and blood run from her face at the request but held her tongue. \"Well, its hard to tell,\" the doctor answered awkwardly. \"You're making good progress but we need to make sure you're okay before you're cleared. Besides, many with the nature of your wounds don't return to active duty.\" \"Well I'm not one of those ones doc,\" Mike retorted. \"There's a war going on out there and I don't intend to lay around here on my butt longer then I have too. You tell me what I need to do, I'll do it. But don't tell me I'm not going back because I am.\" The doctor shook his head in surprise and admiration at the Marine's determination. \"All right then Staff Sergeant, we'll see what we can do.\"[Chapter 10] CHAPTER 10 – Balance The Marines sat quietly in the shadows of an abandoned Laundromat whose windows have been blown away. The battered platoon picked away at their MRE's mainly to kill time since few had any appetite after the bloody attack they'd endured less then two hours earlier. The rest of the company had moved through their position with them bringing up the rear. A halt had been called at the front so the soldiers took the opportunity to rest. Unfortunately a lack of action also meant an opportunity to rehash what had happened. Few talked about it, most brooded alone, a weight of burden that survivors often bear increasing by the minute. Their leader could see this and knew what had to be done. Moving away from his troops he put in a call to headquarters. Several minutes later he called the men together. \"We're coming off the line,\" Lt. Gordon announced to the battered platoon a look of relief on his tired face. \"Forty-eight hours of R-and-R in the rear area. Choppers'll be here in an hour for us.\" The men let out a cheer at the unexpected revelation, happy for the brief respite from the intensity of combat. All cheered except Jason Lockett. He scowled at the news while fidgeting with his weapon. Gordon saw this so casually made his way over to the brooding corporal. \"You okay Lockett?\" the observant officer asked. \"I don't need to step down, I want to stay in the fight,\" Lockett shot back testily. \"You going out and getting yourself killed isn't going to bring them back corporal,\" Gordon surmised correctly. Lockett slumped in defeat at the correct observation. \"But I got men killed sir. I owe them…\" \"What? Payback?\" Gordon retorted. \"Leave that for the gang bangers and the movies son. That's not professional and it not what Marines do. Listen to me very carefully. You didn't kill them, the Squids did. You did everything you could.\" \"They're still dead,\" Lockett murmured, tears filling his eyes. \"That's war,\" the compassionate officer responded, sitting down beside the crumbling Marine. \"You can't control that, any more then you can control the circumstances. Do you know what the measure of a man is Lockett?\" he asked to distract him. \"I don't know sir. What we do? What we accomplish?\" \"No, that's what the world would say. That's what advertisers would say when they try to sell you something. The true measure of a man is what they do with the things that happen to them. You can't control what happens to you but you can control what you do with it. Does that make sense?\" Lockett reflected on that for a minute then he nodded his head, a spark coming back to his eyes. \"Yea…yea, it does. Thanks sir.\" \"All right,\" Gordon clapped him on the shoulder, \"let's get the troops ready to move.\" Mike lay in his bed idly flipping through an issue of Sports Illustrated that was making predictions for the upcoming college football season. Guess that's not going to happen anymore he thought to himself. Just one more change, one more thing lost. A television set in the step-down unit of the hospital he'd been moved to blared on incessantly with updates on the war and armchair analysts giving their predictions about what the future held. Mike had been placed there to recuperate and prepare for a return to active duty. Though continuing to suffer bouts of terrible pain from his wounds, he didn't let anyone know since he knew if they realized how shaky he was they'd never let him out. He spotted the now familiar tousle of dark hair come bobbing into the ward signaling Michele had arrived for a visit. Her working in the field hospital had meant she'd been able to see him every day, often several times. Despite reservations about his feelings, and discomfort about how she seemed to feel about him, the visits were a welcome respite from the grind of physiotherapy and the drone of the TV and war updates. He began to long even for Jersey Shore, or Dancing with the Stars, anything that would signal a return to their prior, insulated, mundane way of living. No more, everything had become practical, utilitarian. Despite the fact only costal areas of the US had been attacked the impact had been catastrophic for the whole nation. The stock market had plunged to its lowest levels in 100 years forcing a shut-down until the situation could be stabilized. Panic caused a run on banks and food supplies had started to become scarce. A large-scale mobilization of domestic National Guard and Reserves units further interrupted an already fragile economy. Attempts to bring troops and equipment home from overseas deployment had been temporarily halted when the returning 7th fleet had been decimated by underwater alien craft. So currently the only troops able to come back were those being airlifted but fuel was being used sparingly due to attacks in the Gulf region so the major response needed to be domestic. The nation stood, but teetered precariously. \"Hi Mike,\" she greeted him warmly. \"I brought someone to see you.\" \"Staff Sergeant Nantz!\" \"Hector!\" Mike sat bolt upright in surprise at the appearance of the boy, causing a wave of pain. The Latino youth rushed over to Mike's bed and crushed him in a spontaneous bear hug, oblivious to everything around him. Mike returned the embrace, basking in the feeling of unhindered affection. They broke but the boy sat at the end of the bed, within reach of Mike, his large brown eyes moist with tears. \"Hey champ, how've you been?\" Mike asked. \"Okay. I've wanted to see you for days. I didn't forget, they just wouldn't let me see you,\" Hector explained, starting to get emotional at the recollection. \"It's alright, I understand,\" Mike tried to encourage him. \"The doc's have been keeping me on a pretty tight leash. So what have you been doing with yourself?\" \"Nothing really. Just hanging out with Kirsten and Amy, trying to help out around the camp where I can.\" \"You're a good man Hector; you'll make a great Marine someday.\" \"I want to fight,\" the boy declared passionately. \"I bet you do,\" Mike agreed carefully. It would be so easy to patronize the boy, to brush off his fervor but as Mike looked at what was really a young man, he could see the desire to avenge his father, to prove he was a 'good Marine', to do something to help the cause. Mike was reminded anew of why he fought, and why they had to win. \"Some day you might but I pray you never have too because it would mean there is no other way. It's not your time.\" Seeing Hector slump in dejection Mike added, \"But you can fight back in other ways. You can help us and honor your dad by helping in the camp, by helping Michele with her nieces and by continuing to believe we're going to win. Can you do that?\" \"I can Staff Sergeant.\" The boy buried himself in Mike's chest causing the Marine to enfold him in his strong arms. Mike looked past the boy and saw Michele smiling at him, her eyes glistening with tears yet looking at him with an affection that made her more beautiful then he'd even seen her. \"All right Hector. We need to let the Staff Sergeant rest,\" Michele announced to the disappointment of both. \"But you can see him tomorrow again.\" \"Bye,\" Hector waved and walked away. Michele led the boy from the ward but suddenly stopped and ran back to Mike. She whispered to him, \"He needed that,\" then, without thinking, kissed him lightly on the cheek. Turning red with embarrassment she strode off without looking back. \"So did I,\" Mike whispered back, feeling a tingling sensation on his cheek. He watched the pair leave passing an officer in camouflage utilities with a clerical collar who'd been standing a few beds away. The clergyman watched intently with a raised eyebrow and amused look on his lean, tanned face. \"Father Alexander!\" Mike cried out in surprise at seeing the priest. \"Hello Michael,\" the priest responded walking over to his bed and giving a firm handshake with one hand and patting the convalescing Marine on the shoulder with the other. \"You're alive,\" the square jawed man exclaimed, still unable to believe what he saw. \"So it would seem. The Lord hasn't seen fit to call me home yet.\" \"How?\" \"Did I get out?\" Father Alexander asked. \"I left Pendleton in a support convoy just as Mainside came under attack. We were moving to assist the troops being deployed to protect San Diego….it wasn't a pretty sight.\" The priest shook slightly and made the sign of the cross as he seemed to recall what had happened. \"Anyway, once that fell apart those of us who remained made our way here kind of like Moses and Israel going to the Promised Land.\" A twinkle returned to his eyes and he added, \"I'm glad it didn't take forty years!\" \"I'm glad too,\" Mike agreed, emotion rising in his voice. Father Alexander smiled at the tough Marine with genuine affection. \"So I can see you're recovering and the doctor has told me you're wanting back into combat as quick as you can.\" Mike nodded in agreement at the recap but avoided the piercing eyes of the priest. \"That certainly fits with how I know you Michael so rest assured I wouldn't try to talk you out of it,\" the priest confirmed. \"In fact I think it's a noble thing you want to do. You're a good man.\" A tear rolled down the stoic Marine's cheek at the compliment. \"Anyway,\" Father Alexander continued, \"we're in a war now, certainly not one we expected which is ironic considering we're only a few weeks away from the 9/11 anniversary but I'm becoming overly reflective, \" the priest admitted, \"there'll be time for this when its all done.\" \"Do you think we'll even be around if that ever happens?\" Mike asked with a sense of hope. \"Do you think we can actually win?\" \"Of course, with God all things are possible,\" Father Alexander replied right away. \"And besides, we have men like you fighting for us. How could we lose? We may be battered but we're not broken.\" Seeing again the humble man's discomfort he smiled broadly and chuckled at the reality of his statement. \"I've been hearing some wonderful things about you Michael, how your efforts have helped the war effort, even turned the tide in our favor. I hear talk of a medal for you.\" Mike caught himself halfway through a swear word in reply before checking himself before the priest. Instead he responded through gritted teeth, \"Yea, big hero. I got a whole bunch more kids and civilians killed.\" Father Alexander sat down on the anguished man's bed then put a hand gently on his arm. \"My dear Michael, this is not a burden for you to bear. You did the best you could with what you had. You saved many lives at a time all of you should have died by rights. You did not kill them, our attackers did. You did not look for this fight but you're fighting it.\" He paused to let the words sink in. \"This is not Afghanistan and this is not your fault. You need to dismiss the ghosts from your past. Step out of the darkness which consumes you son and live in the light. Can I pray for you?\" \"Sure,\" Mike replied, struck by the statement the honest priest had made added, \"I think I'd like that.\" For several minutes Father Alexander prayed passionately for peace and a return to joy for the troubled soldier. He asked for healing for his mind and spirit along with protection in the days to come. Wrapping up the heartfelt prayer he gazed with a warm smile at Mike's tear-stained face and declared with a grin, \"Now that that's done, let's talk about Michele.\" The powerful blades of the twin-rotor Boeing Sea Knight helicopter continued to kick up irritating clouds of gritty sand as they slowed to a stop. The Marines exiting the helicopter looked away trying to shield their eyes from the flying debris. The remnants of Lt. Gordon's platoon moved towards the base, eager for a shower, hot food and a bed to sleep on. Most though were more excited by the chance to rest for a couple of days from the relenting pressure and pace of combat. Cpl. Harris rhymed off the things his troops needed to do while thinking how good a shower would feel, making sure the soldiers were taken care of but they didn't get sloppy in the rear area. The key that had been drilled into him was to stay sharp and stay focused even when resting. \"Kevin…Kevin Harris….\" A female voice called above the din of activity causing him to stop dead in his tracks. Harris turned to where the voice had come from, something registered within the recesses of his spirit, then began to well up within him, hoping, praying at the same time yet terrified to be incorrect. It was Cherise. Forgetting his discipline, his job, forgetting the world around him, Harris ran to his precious fiancée openly weeping before he met her. She had tears filling her eyes as they met in a fierce embrace. Then Harris began to strip off his kit and tactical vest to hold her closer, not wanting any barrier between himself and his beloved. The pair hugged and kissed while Harris howled in delight at the unexpected reunion. Lockett observed the tender scene, happy for his friend, yet he had a strange feeling in his stomach. \"It's what you do with it corporal,\" Lt. Gordon said to him as he passed by, not waiting for a response. The man torn by guilt and grief paused to think about the statement and the conversation he'd had earlier with his platoon commander. He made the choice to move on, to fight the enemy of humanity rather then fight against himself. Lockett felt peace within but also knew there was something else he had to do to make things right. Shifting his gaze to the temporary buildings set up at the base he spotted Imlay and Doc motioning him to join them. A smile, bright as the sun, lit up his handsome face and he jogged over to join his friends. \"How? How did you get out?\" Harris asked his fiancée, still not daring to believe this to be true. \"I mean LA was leveled. What happened?\" \"Me, Kathy and Laura were at the mall when the evacuation order came out,\" Cherise began, stepping back to gaze at her beloved. \"Kathy knew a back way when the freeway was jammed up so we were able to get out before things got bad. When I heard later on what had happened to Pendleton and Santa Monica Airport I thought…I thought…,\" her voice began to break with emotion and she couldn't finish. \"You thought I was dead,\" Harris answered, removing his tear-stained glasses to clean them. \"Yes,\" Cherise agreed with a whisper. \"We ended up at the refugee camp next door to this base. But then we heard about what you and your team did,\" she perked up. \"You guys were amazing. They say you saved the whole West Coast with what you did.\" \"Well I don't know about that,\" he replied modestly, \"we just got lucky.\" \"Where's Stavrou? Is he okay?\" Cherise asked. Harris' face dropped at the question. \"No, he's dead,\" he choked out, collapsing into his fiancée's arms finally able to grieve the loss of his best friend. Lockett, Imlay and Doc enjoyed some hot food, joking with each other as they recapped all that had been going on of late. To an outside observer the trio, as with most of the soldiers in the mess hall, were sharing in some macabre humor but for the combat veterans it was a way to release the tension and keep from going crazy because of what they'd been facing. A television played in the background as the group spoke. None paid attention to the special report from CNN taking place on the outskirts of LA as a handsome, tanned man in a blue sport coat confidently spoke into the camera with the destroyed city in the background. \"…want to commend the military for their efforts to retake our beloved city. With the gains they've made its time to re-establish civilian government over the area and not military rule. So with the authority of the President and the sanction of the governor I will oversee the reforming of proper governance and the renewing of infrastructure to the beleaguered people of Los Angeles.\"[Chapter 11] CHAPTER 11 – What is a hero? \"And we're off the air,\" the cameraman reported as the red light went out. \"Well done senator,\" the female reporter complimented the handsome man who stepped away from the camera. \"I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. I'm sure it'll be encouraging to the people watching.\" \"Thank you Terry,\" Senator Garry Sharpe replied smoothly, flashing the attractive reporter wearing a tailored business suit that complimented her figure a toothy smile. \"Hopefully we'll get a chance to see each other more during the days ahead,\" he declared flirtatiously, then added, \"Since you'll want to report on the progress we make at re-establishing proper authority.\" The CNN on-air personality giggled with delight at the boldness of the man, allowing her own gaze to linger on the magnetic politician. Despite the breeze Sharpe's professionally-groomed hair stayed in place. Two aides scurried forward, one with a bottle of cold ice tea, the other with a dossier of information on the state of the city. The man's bodyguards looked impassively outward through their dark sunglasses though any threat seemed unlikely since they were well back from the front line. Several other handlers plus his personal stylist stood off to the side chatting idly. \"All right everyone, its time to show these people who's boss,\" Sharpe announced to his entourage, confident he'd made his point clear in the television interview that had gone out across the nation. The party loaded into four dark SUVs and began to drive towards the military's forward operating area. Gary Sharpe's business skills had always reflected his name. The middle-aged man with graying temples had proven himself extremely shrewd as a merger-and-acquisitions specialist before entering politics. Some saw the multi-millionaire as a corporate raider, one who would buy undervalued companies then break them up and sell the components like someone stripping a car for its parts. But none could question Gary Sharpe's success. Originally a lawyer, he'd steadily built a significant empire, becoming one of the richest men in California. Bored with the business world he turned his sights onto politics, his next area to fix. He'd swept into office the previous election through a brilliantly run and well-funded campaign. Unfortunately for the man used to getting his own way, he'd found his influence less then anticipated due to the presence of the senior senator for the state, a respected and wise long-serving member of congress. So Sharpe had to wait for his opportunity to shine. It came the day the aliens began their invasion. The senior senator had been in the city along with several other key politicians for the state at a summit on poverty and violence called for by the mayor of Los Angeles while Sharpe had chosen to attend an industrialist's convention in Los Vegas. When the initial attack had happened the political leader's had moved to the area of initial assault to assess the situation and lend support. But when the attack had escalated their convoy became overwhelmed by the surging aliens and all were killed leaving a vacuum of power. Thus opened the opportunity Gary Sharpe had been looking for. Hector sat wide-eyed on the edge of Mike's bed, soaking in the atmosphere of his hero. They'd been talking in general about things that interested them and found surprisingly despite their age and background difference a lot in common. They liked to make models, liked baseball and loved hot dogs with mustard. The list went on and on. But the Latino boy could sense the time coming for him to depart so his mood became dark. \"I miss my dad,\" he announced sullenly, changing the conversation and its tone abruptly. \"I can imagine you do,\" Mike agreed, not wanting to downplay the boy's emotions. \"Still, you're lucky in a way.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" he retorted, stung by the seemingly insensitive comment. \"You had a lot of good years with your dad and he taught you a lot of valuable lessons that'll help you with life. I didn't know my dad and I sure didn't get anything of value from him,\" Mike confessed. \"So yea, in a way you're lucky.\" \"You didn't know your dad?\" Hector asked, intrigued. \"No, he took off when I was real young. Not like your dad who was a hero.\" \"He was wasn't he?\" Hector agreed, leaning in eagerly. \"Yes he was and his spirit is with you Hector,\" Mike declared. \"He's shown you a path to follow. The best way to honor him and his memory is to live with the same values of courage and sacrifice he displayed. Do you understand?\" \"I think I do,\" Hector answered then paused to reflect a moment. \"And I'll do my best to live that way, no matter what.\" \"That's all anyone can ever ask of you son,\" Mike replied, unaware of the last word he'd slipped in, being engrossed in the conversation. The pair sat chatting with each other for the next half hour despite the need for the boy to leave the wounded Marine to rest. Several times a nurse came to check Mike's signs but left not wanting to interrupt the cathartic moment. Everyone in the ward knew Hector's story by now and could see the good that came out of him spending time with the gruff soldier. On the flip side, many were beginning to see a side of Staff Sergeant Mike Nantz they'd never thought existed. One of the keenest observers had been Michele, who'd often been around the periphery during the pair's time together. While not listening in on their conversations she'd watched the body language and the tender care the hard-as-nails soldier showed to the orphaned boy. With every occurrence her heart became at greater risk of being given over to this hurting man. Strangely, she seemed ready to take the plunge. The conversation between the boy and the Marine continued on until a new arrival brought it to a close. \"Hey, what are you doing here?\" a surprised Mike greeted the Marine who awkwardly stood before them. \"Hello Corporal Lockett!\" Hector greeted the man warmly. \"Hey little man, how's it going?\" he returned the greeting, patting the boy on the back. \"Okay,\" Hector answered. \"How about you? Are you killing lots of aliens?\" Lockett's expression clouded and he seemed unable to answer the simple question. Mike caught the shift and knew something was wrong. \"Listen Hector, can you give me and the corporal some time for a bit? Why don't you find my nurse and let her know she can poke me again like she's wanted to do for the last half hour.\" \"Okay,\" Hector agreed cheerfully, unaware that he'd been dismissed. \"Good to see you Lockett,\" Mike greeted him, extending his hand as the boy left. \"What brings you here?\" \"Platoon got pretty banged up yesterday so they took us off the front to get some rest and refit,\" Lockett answered woodenly, eyes going glassy. \"How about you though?\" Mike asked, having an idea where things were going. When the expressive soldier stumbled for words he added compassionately, \"Are you okay Jason?\" \"I…I lost some men out there…it shouldn't have happened…happened so fast…did everything I could but they're still dead,\" Lockett rambled, his voice choked, \"and now I know what it feels like. I…I judged you wrong Staff Sergeant, about my brother, and I want to say sorry,\" he confessed. \"Don't worry about that. But how are you doing?\" a concerned Mike questioned him. \"Terrible Staffs. I can't get their faces out of my mind. I couldn't sleep last night and I don't know what to do.\" \"I know what that's like,\" Mike responded honestly. \"You have to find peace with it, one way or another Lockett or it'll eat you alive. Its war and that's leadership. Sometimes you can't control what happens around you but you can control what you do with it when it does.\" \"Sounds like good advice,\" Lockett admitted. \"Yea, my priest gave it to me,\" Mike responded with a chuckle. \"Whatever,\" Lockett retorted, thinking him to be facetious.\" \"No, I'm serious. Father Alexander, one of the regimental chaplains, helped me through my struggle after last year. Maybe you should talk to him.\" \"I'm not Catholic and I sure haven't been a good man,\" the tormented soldier mused reflectively. \"You're better then you think I suspect and God is equal opportunity,\" Mike countered, surprised at what had just come out of his mouth. \"Thanks for that. I do understand now and I'm sorry I've been bitter towards you but the whole thing still frustrates me. I know the mission was sealed, but is there anything you can tell me about how Dwayne died?\" Lockett pleaded. Mike looked at the grief-stricken Marine and his heart twisted into knots. He thought for a moment then came to a decision. \"Screw it. A lots changed in the past few weeks so maybe this has too. What are they going to do, throw me in the brig?\" he added with a chuckle, deflating the balloon of tension that hung over them. \"Let me tell you what happened to your brother…\" The group of soldiers wearing Air Force uniforms avidly watched the view screen set up in their command area in the parking lot of an abandoned grocery store in north LA. All eyes were fixed on a jet bomber that came swooping in to deliver its payload. The sight of a large explosion was joined by a dull thud miles away. The group broke into spontaneous cheers. \"Yes,\" a balding officer wearing captain's bars did a fist pump. \"In your face!\" Elena Santos shook her head in frustration. \"This is bogus sir,\" she complained. \"We're supposed to be FORWARD Air Controllers and this is supposed to be a reconnaissance company,\" the tough female sergeant added. \"But all we do is play Xbox here with drones and watch from a distance.\" The cheering officer suddenly became sullen at the implied insult. \"Listen Tech Sergeant, I know we're not a bunch of big heroes like you for getting into the thick of things. That's not our job, that's for the Marines. We're team players here and all do our role despite how much we'd all like to be on the front line.\" \"As if,\" Santos muttered under her breath. \"What's that?\" the captain shot back, angry now. \"We don't need to be in the fight but we should be near the fight. That's our job,\" she countered doggedly. \"Our job Santos is to get the job done. And our success rate is very high, I might add. We use all the assets at our disposal to the best of their abilities. That's success. Plus, we're too valuable a unit to be put at risk. That's a job for the grunts,\" the thin Air Force officer added with a sneer. Then he signaled an end to the discussion. \"We need team players here Tech Sergeant. If you can't follow orders you'll find yourself at a desk in the rear area. Do we understand each other?\" \"Yes sir,\" she responded with a glare but held her tongue. \"Good. I'm so glad that's all cleared up,\" he answered insincerely. \"Now go find me some coffee somewhere.\" Mike lay on his bed, hands behind his head on the pillow. He felt content, at peace. Though he still had a fair amount of pain from his wounds the ache that he'd been carrying in his heart seemed to have leaked away. The time he'd been spending with Hector had been a gift. The fatherless boy had been around frequently and it reminded Mike of his time with Grandpappy years earlier. Lockett's apology had meant a lot and the decision to share with him what had happened on the mission his brother died had an element of catharsis. But none of these compared to the feelings stirring in his heart for… \"Hi Mike!\" Michele seemed to appear from nowhere at his bedside, he'd been so deep in thought. Her radiant smile and glowing face was worthy compensation for the pleasant thoughts she'd interrupted. Though both at times had resisted it, they'd become close. Neither was certain if it had been the war, the brokenness in their own lives or a combination of the two but there was no arguing that something seemed to be going on between them. Others had joked about it and initially both had tried to explain it away but now each hoped it to be true. \"So what's up with you?\" Michele asked, a look of curiosity filling her expressive face. \"What? What do you mean?\" Mike responded with confusion. \"I don't know. You just look different.\" \"Is that a bad thing?\" \"No. Actually its like I'm seeing who you really are for the first time since I've met you,\" she confessed, pushing a wisp of hair away from her face in a way that caused the man to breath heavier. Mike's heart began to race at the comment. Alarm bells around his heart began to go off, signaling him to pull back from a dangerous place. He chose to ignore them. \"Is that a bad thing?\" he asked with a note of hesitation. Ignoring her own protective signals Michele sat down on the bed and oblivious to the other people around them took his hand. \"No, it's a good thing Mike,\" she said with a whisper. Eyes moistening, her lips parted slightly. \"It's a very good thing.\" Then Michele did something she'd wanted to do for several days. Not caring who saw or worrying about any reaction, she leaned down and kissed him long and hard. And to her great delight he kissed her back.[Chapter 12] CHAPTER 12 – Footholds Mike and Michele seemed to lose themselves in each other. As they kissed he grabbed her, pulling the willing woman on top as he tried to drink deep of her love. She responded in kind, pressing closer with a sense of urgency. Their mouths opened and a new depth of exploration opened for them which each gladly grabbed. The world was long gone by this point as the blissful ecstasy of discovery crashed over them like a wave. \"Ahem!\" The sense of being alone in the world shattered though each belligerently held on to it for another moment. Mike and Michele broke their embrace to see Mike's doctor standing over them with an irritated look on his face. Standing behind them was Father Alexander, a look of amusement on his face, especially as he saw the embarrassed reaction of the couple. Ignoring the breech of protocol the doctor announced: \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, you're cleared for a return to duty. You can return to your unit when you're ready.\" Less than 24 hours later Mike found himself back on the front being tossed around in a LAV25 as it moved towards battle. Drenched in sweat since the air conditioning unit in the armored carrier had broken down and there was no time to fix it the vehicle felt like an oven. None of the soldiers complained, all were silent with their thoughts as they prepared for yet another battle with the alien invaders. Mike was fine with that. It allowed him to be alone with his thoughts before he went back into the fight. His thoughts inevitably went back to Michele and their time together the previous few days. The kiss they shared was still indelibly stamped in his memory. He could feel her soft, full lips on his. But when he'd left she'd been edgy. Though supporting him as he prepared to leave and even helping to make sure he had everything before he went back to the 2-5 he could tell she struggled badly with his return to action. He wasn't sure if it was irritation with the situation or with him for his eagerness to go back after the declaration of their feelings for each other. He wasn't sure but it confused him a bit so some doubt began to creep in. Father Alexander had been great. The priest had pledged to watch over her and ensure she adjusted to the new reality. But still… \"We're less than half a klick from the front Staff Sergeant prepare to deploy in the thick of it,\" the voice of the LAV's commander crackled in Mike's headset. \"Standby people, we're going in hot. Lock and load,\" Mike ordered crisply. Thoughts of Michele would need to be put away for another time. The fight was at hand. Mike had been re-assigned to E company of the 2-5 as platoon sergeant for Lt. Gordon. The two had worked together before in Afghanistan and had a mutual respect for each other. Mike also was happy for the assignment because it would be a chance for him to spend more time with Lockett and help him with his current struggles. The 2-5, along with armor from the Arizona National Guard and two mobilized Army Reserve infantry battalions were pushing hard to clear alien resistance in the San Fernando area. The fighting had been tough but they'd made steady progress. The aliens had centered their defenses around a water treatment plant at the Los Angeles Reservoir in the Upper Van Norman Lake basin area. They'd taken the time to dig in so had been fighting fiercely to hold the millions of gallons of water it controlled. Despite being in the carrier the muffled sounds of combat still bled through increasing the anxiety of the men within. An explosion nearby buffeted the heavy vehicle showing a near miss. The engine roared as the LAV came to a stop. Simultaneously the rear ramp lowered blinding the men inside temporarily with the bright sunlight that streamed in, as the armored fighting vehicle opened fire with its Bushmaster 25mm chain gun. \"Let's go 2-5!\" Mike yelled, leading the way. The air sizzled with ordinance flying back and forth around the hotly contested site. Mike led his men past a destroyed Dunkin Donuts shop and away from a burning Chevron station. The rest of the platoon formed up in a defile on the side of the highway facing the reservoir. He had a quick moment to survey the scene. Though a veteran of the 2nd Gulf War he'd not seen this level of destruction before. Several Abrams tanks stood smoldering on the road leading to the highway crossing besides a number of destroyed LAV's. He hoped the men they had been carrying had a chance to get out before hand. Aliens and soldiers lay strewn about the area and small fires burned all around. Suddenly the air about him whistled and he knew what that meant. \"Incoming!\" Mike screamed to alert his men to take cover. The Marines scrambled out of the way just in time. Several more rounds fell in the area spelling disaster if they stayed. \"Sir,\" he yelled to his platoon commander, \"they've got our positioned zeroed. We need to displace and find a new area to stage.\" looked around and found a better spot for them to move to while the rest of the company deployed. \"We'll set up over there, 150 meters. I want Harris with the GPMG to provide covering fire as the rest of the company gets on line.\" \"We got tanks coming up sir,\" Mike pointed out, spotting a pair of M1A2 Abrams rumbling into position. In response to the alien artillery barrage they were experiencing the tanks opened fire with their 120mm smoothbore cannons. They seemed to hit their mark since a temporary lull in enemy fire resulted. A moment later a trio of Apache helicopters roared overhead loosing off a salvo of Hellfire missiles lighting up the horizon around the reservoir and water treatment plant. Lt. Gordon had been listening to his radio on the battalion network. Getting everyone's attention he barked out, \"That's what we're looking for people. Time for us to get to work!\" The athletic officer stood up and started to follow the tanks to the other side of the interstate highway. All along the line soldiers rose up and began a mad sprint for the other side. \"This guys a track star,\" Mike yelled at the men in the platoon referring to their officer, \"don't let him get too far ahead of us. Watch your spacing's. Keep moving.\" Then before they knew it they were at the other side and hitting the ground. Their timing was perfect because one of the Abrams tanks took a direct hit and erupted like the Fourth of July sending shrapnel in all directions. Watching muzzle flashes from the enemy position they began to engage the alien position with small arms fire waiting for the order to move again. Back and forth they went with neither side gaining the upper hand. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, on me,\" Lt. Gordon bellowed above the din of combat. Mike frog walked down the line, ensuring the men in the platoon were in good position, as he made his way to their leader. \"We got orders?\" he asked. \"Command needs us to flank around the other side of the reservoir and provide a blocking force,\" Gordon responded. \"There's a big push coming and they don't want the Rasta's to get away.\" \"Infantry only?\" \"That's right,\" the lieutenant answered evenly. \"There's no route for armor, plus we don't want them to know what we're up to. We'll have gunships covering us and we shouldn't have to hold too long.\" \"What's our route and position?\" Mike inquired without emotion though his heart began to beat harder as he ducked since several rockets flew overhead slamming into the road behind them. \"We flank around the dam using a series of service roads then hold a position here,\" he pointed on the map between the reservoir and Upper Van Norman Lake. Another unit will hold the position north cutting off any retreat. None of them get out, understand? Get ready to move.\" A combination of tank and mortar fire came to bear on the alien position creating the distraction the Marines needed to leave their position and get to cover behind the reservoir's dam. Other troops in reserve filled their abandoned position to maintain a continuous front and pressure on the aliens. Moving fast, the soldiers kept glancing nervously to their right as if expecting the concrete barrier to give way and flood them but other then the anxiety everything went according to plan. Lockett's squad had the point. He was still a bit shaky after his loses only a few days earlier and now worked with more new soldiers. But he had to put that behind him, he had a job to do. Rounding the corner of the reservoir he began to move towards a concrete berm that would give them cover to their objective but the sight before them stopped him dead in his tracks. \"What the heck?\" he said a bit louder then he'd wanted to in surprise. The corporal signaled his squad to take cover. Since they were on radio silence he motioned for the platoon commander to come forward. Mike and Lt. Gordon made sure the platoon was in good position then moved up the line. Gordon came up fast since there was little time for caution and they were stopping well short of their objective. As if to increase his anxiety the sound of battle intensified on the other side of the reservoir in the area by the water treatment plant. \"What's the hold up corporal?\" the platoon commander asked with irritation. \"We need to keep pushing.\" Then he saw what Lockett had and his mouth came open. Less then 200 meters in front of them were two enormous bird-like aliens. Standing on two legs with a long hose-like snout the creatures rose nearly 100 feet in the air and seemed to be drinking out of the reservoir. Mike looked around and spotted two more with bloated bellies waddling down another service road towards a gap in the hills that would link them up with Woodley Avenue and a residential area. Along with these unusual things a half dozen infantry caste aliens guarded the pair at the reservoir and an equal number walked along with the ones leaving the scene. \"What are those things sir?\" Mike asked in amazement. \"I don't know,\" Gordon responded in amazement. \"None of our Intel has talked about anything like that.\" Lockett took a closer look at the reservoir while watching the pair at the side with their long snouts in the water. He noticed them growing steadily in size and then a sick feeling came over him as he watched the water level in the man-made lake drop. \"Sir, I think they're some kind of water extractor. Look at the level of the water.\" Sure enough, the reservoir seemed to be down to three-quarters its regular volume. \"Man, they're taking our water,\" Lockett declared angrily. \"We need to stop them.\" \"Makes sense,\" Lt. Gordon agreed. \"That is why they've invaded us and this area contains the most water in the city. No wonder they're holding on to it so tight.\" \"So we going to take them out?\" Mike said more as a statement then question. \"Well, we can't go around them and we're sure not going to let them get away,\" Gordon responded. \"We need to act fast of those other two will get away.\" \"Okay, you take two squads and take out that group leaving the scene,\" the lieutenant ordered Mike. \"Pepper them with M203s and take the Predator Short Range Assault Weapon team with you. Hit them hard, don't worry about the escort then we'll rally at the berm a half click up from here,\" he pointed out. \"We'll clear this group out with our SAWs, the AT4 anti-tank gun and mortars then meet you there. Good luck.\" \"Lockett, Pace, your teams are with me. SRAW team, bring the Predator and come with me too,\" Mike commanded the groups as he began to move out. The platoon split up and began to move quickly, not wanting to lose the element of surprise they currently had. Lt. Gordon's job would be easier since they could move along the concrete berm and have cover the whole time. Mike's team, on the other hand, at some point would have to move through open ground to close with the enemy. The approaching group had luck with them, covering half the ground without being spotted. But then a large explosion where the main battle continued to rage caused not only the Marines to involuntarily see that a pair of A10's had dropped their ordinance onto the alien position but the aliens leaving the scene turned also, spotting the approaching humans. The six escorting infantry caste warriors fanned out, taking position between their lumbering cohorts and the approaching threat. Mike could hear their weapons spooling up and knew what was coming. \"Lockett, Pace, use your teams to keep those Squids pinned down. Grayson,\" he called to the SRAW team leader, \"you focus on those big mothers. Pop a couple of holes in them and see what comes out. Harris, you cover the Predator,\" he ordered as the Marines moved into position ahead of the first salvo from the aliens. A combination of grenade fire and multi-barreled machinegun bursts chewed up the earth around where the soldiers had gone to ground. In return, they opened up with small arm and their SAW's causing the aliens to duck for cover. One gangling creature was too late, getting caught in a cross fire between the two squads and jerking around like a spastic marionette before finally collapsing in a heap. While the two groups battled back and forth Mike moved up and down the line in a crouch, assessing the distance and speed of the retreating behemoths. \"Greyson, come on, get it done or they'll be out of range.\" The SRAW gunner swore as his loader fumbled nervously to secure the round. Rather then wait for the targeting system to lock on the experienced corporal decided to do a line-of-sight shot since the objective seemed too big to miss. With a roar the Predator spat out its missile. At 560mph it didn't take long to see his shot had been true. The round buried itself into the round belly of the strange creature. A rumble could be heard inside as the warhead exploded causing the skin to rupture. Water cascaded out of the beast creating a mini flash-flood down the trail below. Yea!\" Greyson yelled. \"Reload me.\" \"It's some sort of water carrier or extractor or something like that,\" Mike called out as he finally figured out the purpose of the strange creature. He felt a sickening feeling as he realized it was in fact a living creature and not a machine based on the howling death cry emanating from it. He had no sympathy though. This was the enemy and it had to die. \"Don't let the other one get away.\" \"That fat lard ain't go' in nowhere staff sergeant,\" the grinning Marine replied. Almost as the words left his lips the gunner and his loader erupted in a ball of orange flame. \"Aliens to the left, 10 o'clock!\" a Marine called out urgently as another four infantry caste warriors came out from behind a defilade to their side. Their well-timed attack had caught the group unaware, costing them their Predator team. Mike had no time to think of the men lost he'd only met earlier that day. \"Harris, bring the machine gun on them. Keep 'em off of me. You,\" he called out to a pimple-faced teenage Marine carrying an M16 with grenade launcher underneath, \"you come with me. The rest of you hold this line.\" With that he and the young Marine stood up and ran through alien fire toward the fleeing water extractor. \"Staffs, what the hell are you doing?\" Lockett yelled as he saw Mike run off but he held his position and adjusted his fire team. Everything seemed to slow down before Mike. He could swear he saw the alien rounds flying past him. He didn't flinch when shrapnel from an exploding grenade cut his cheek. He had one thing in mind, get that tanker. \"Come on kid,\" he screamed at the Marine whose name he couldn't recall trying to keep pace with him. Harris was able to keep the newly arrived aliens pinned down with the GPMG and Pace's fire team dropped two more aliens so they got in range for the grenade launcher. The young Marine stopped and attempted to fire at the lumbering beast but he'd forgotten to take the safety off so nothing happened. Then with a yelp he spun around and fell to the ground. A pair of newly arrived aliens had cut the young soldier down with a burst of machine gun fire. Mike dropped prone in one motion as they fired at him and loosed a burst from his M4A1 hitting the lead warrior in the sweet spot. It stumbled causing the one behind to trip giving Mike the chance to drop the second one. He took a moment to do a quick scan of the area to see if there were any other advancing aliens. Satisfied he was clear Mike dropped his carbine and picked up the fallen soldier's M16. Finger on the M203's trigger he whispered, \"this ones for you kid,\" and pulled the trigger. With a bloop it spit the grenade out landing just under the exposed belly. The high explosive charge went off, causing the water extractor to shudder but still it stayed intact. Another round within seconds brought visible cracks and a third grenade caused it to burst at the weakened spot. Once again water exploded from within, showering the area as the tanker collapsed. Mike suddenly realized he was standing straight up watching the spectacle. Involuntarily he winced, expecting to meet the same fate as the young Marine he'd brought with him. Only then did he realize there was no other shooting in the area. His group had eliminated the other threats. Lockett trotted over to make sure he was okay. \"Way to go Staffs, you the man.\" \"Big as brass,\" Corporal Pace commented with admiration still shaking his head in disbelief at what he'd seen. \"All right, we need to look after our dead and wounded and hook back up with Lt. Gordon,\" Mike ordered awkwardly, not comfortable with the praise or attention, especially when other good men were lying dead around him. \"Let's get it done 2-5.\" Leaving several men behind to ensure the bodies were looked after and the wounded evacuated the remnant of the group trotted to the position they could see the rest of the platoon already occupied. Coming up and squatting down beside Lt. Gordon Mike could see they'd been successful at destroying the other two water extractors. \"Well I can see you got it done Staff Sergeant, outstanding work,\" the officer congratulated him. \"I also saw you got hit by their reinforcements. Any trouble with it?\" \"We did what we had to do sir,\" Mike responded stonily, \"we had three killed and two wounded though.\" \"Not your fault staff sergeant, good work,\" Gordon encouraged him, giving the tense NCO a pat on the back. \"Time for that conversation later,\" Mike stated flatly. \"What's our situation here?\" \"We're holding our blocking position,\" the platoon commander began, knowing not to talk further of the loss of life. He'd been there himself. \"So far we haven't attracted any attention. The rest of the company is holding this line to our right. Over there,\" he pointed to his left, \"is the end of the line for the northern battalion.\" \"So we've given them about a 75 meter gap in the line if they're stupid enough to fall for it?\" Mike guessed. \"Prime killing ground,\" Gordon confirmed, a wicked grin breaking out on his sweat-soaked face. Less then 30 minutes later the theory was put to the test. With A10 and F15 air support pounding the main alien position, tanks along with LAV-AT's began to surge forward. A group of armored bulldozers broke through the berm the aliens had set up behind. The breach allowed the attackers to surge through pushing the aliens back in disarray. About twenty tried to retreat through the gap in the line that had been created by the flanking Marines and they were shredded as a result. With no place to go the aliens didn't seem to know what to do. The decision became academic. In less then 15 minutes the remnant were entirely destroyed, pounded by cannon, artillery and rockets from above. None were left standing. As the Marines and other soldiers moved in to secure the water treatment plant the carnage they observed was unsettling even for the now seasoned combat veterans. Dead aliens lay everywhere, body parts were strewn about. The wounded aliens couldn't be treated by the medics since no one knew anything about their physiology or how to communicate with them so they were left to die. The other observation that stunned most was when looking into the reservoir the water level was down by 1/3rd. They'd launched their attack in the nick of time it seemed. Alien resistance crumbled with the fall of their fortified position at Upper Van Norman Lake and the water treatment plant of the LA Reservoir. Reconnaissance showed them pulling back to a new defensive line. The advancing Marines and Army troops had a breather as they consolidated their positions and set up a fresh defensive line. Forward operating points were established, supply depots hastily built and artillery and air support locations moved up. Best for them though, they now controlled the whole of the Golden State Freeway which made movement and men and material much easier. They now had more then a foothold in the campaign to reclaim LA, they had a firm grasp.[Chapter 13] CHAPTER 13 - Set backs Mike and two other sergeants, hand-picked from among the combat veterans of the 2-5, sat in the El Dorado Avenue Elementary School that now served as forward headquarters for the battalion, two blocks from the scene of the heaviest fighting. It had been a day since their victory over the aliens at the water treatment plant at the LA Reservoir. The troops had set up defensive positions then enjoyed a rare chance to relax a bit. The three had been taken out of their positions to meet with their battalion commander. After exchanging greetings with the other non-comms Mike sat and relaxed waiting for the coming briefing. \"Atten-tion!\" The men snapped ramrod straight. \"As you were,\" LCol Ritchie ordered, breezing into the classroom that now served as a briefing room. He removed his helmet then ran a hand through his grey-blond hair. \"Outstanding job yesterday gentlemen. That was the way to get it done. I can confirm that with our successful attack all of San Fernando is free of infestation. The 2-5 led the way and I couldn't be prouder.\" He let the congratulations sink in for a moment before getting to the point of why they'd been brought there. \"With their collapse not only in San Fernando but also Reseda and Burbank the aliens have fallen back past Encino, Studio City and Griffith Park which is good. But now the squidheads have been fighting tooth and nail to protect Bel Air and Beverly Hills and command wants to know why,\" their colonel declared, pointing at the area on the map. \"Yea, we want to know why because there's heat from the rich and famous who don't want their homes wrecked huh sir?\" one of the sergeants piped up. \"You expect me to answer that sergeant?\" Ritchie shot back testily. \"Listen carefully men, there are no soft targets here. We're fighting for our very existence so there's no outside influence coming into play. Everything, and I mean everything, is tactical. Got it?\" The sergeants nodded their heads in agreement at the chastisement. The colonel, satisfied he'd made his point, continued. \"Aliens have set up a surprisingly effective air defense network. They seem to have adapted some of their walking guns and have some sort of artillery forming a triple-A grid. We can't get anything in there to get a good look. Drones, planes, choppers all are getting knocked down and command wants to know why. So we're going to send three teams in to recon the area. You'll hump it in, get eyes on what they're up to and let us know.\" \"When do we step off sir?\" one of the sergeants asked. \"0100 hours. You'll be going in dark. Everyone will be using Night Optical Devices. Three choppers, one squad each. You pick the men from your platoon. Minimal ammo, fighting order only. This is a sneak-and-peak only gentlemen. Get in and get out. Any questions?\" There were none from the gathered NCO's. It seemed a pretty straight forward mission. \"Okay, get it done Marines,\" Ritchie signaled the end of the meeting. \"We need that information to keep the momentum going. Find out what's going on.\" Huddling up with Lt. Gordon Mike picked his team. They were all veterans, including Lockett and Harris. Gathering NODs for the mission and beginning to cam up, Mike thought of Michele and wondered what she was doing. He winced in pain as he covered the field dressing on his cheek where he'd taken the shrapnel wound. Hope she likes scars he thought to himself. It only dawned on him then how close he'd been to dying during that fight, especially when he stood up with the M16 to take out the last tanker. That was definitely not something to share with Michele! Catching a short nap to recharge the batteries and eating a light meal, the men from E company moved out from the school to the Blackhawk helicopters waiting in the parking lot to take them to their drop off point. LCol Ritchie had come out to see them off so he and the three sergeants huddled and went over last minute thoughts on what to do once they'd been inserted. Tension began to mount as everyone loaded into the helicopters and the crew chiefs gave the signal to their pilots to start up the birds. Two of the three Blackhawks whirled to life in short order but the third one, containing Mike and his section, wouldn't start. He could hear the crew chief swearing then looked to see the pilot and co-pilot flipping switches trying to get the machine to come to life. The other two helicopters stood in neutral, their blades spinning, waiting to take off. Five minutes went by and still nothing. Tension grew and the Marines in the helicopter began to look at each other nervously. \"Hydraulics are shot Staff Sergeant,\" the pilot yelled back at Mike. \"It's a no-go for this bird.\" \"Then call up and get us another one,\" Mike shot back with irritation. \"We've got a mission waiting for us.\" \"Nothing available,\" the pilot responded grimly. \"They'll have to go on without you.\" He then switched on his radio and sent out the bad news. \"Dog Pound 2-2 is buster and we are aborting due to mech failure. Dog Pound 2-1 and 2-3, carry on without us.\" Mike swore and punched his gloved hand into the side of the helicopter. The other Marines got a sense of what was happening so reacted as angrily especially when the other two Blackhawks powered up and lifted off. \"What happened?\" LCol Ritchie yelled as the men from the dead helicopter filed out and marched glumly back to the school. \"Blackhawk had a hydraulic failure so wouldn't start.\" \"All right. Well they can still carry out the mission with two teams, no problems,\" the officer affirmed though he too seemed irritated by the set back. \"You and your men can stand down. Go get some sleep.\" \"Is it okay if I stay in the op center and monitor how the mission proceeds, sir? I kind of feel like I've got a stake in this.\" \"Suit yourself. They should be dropping them off in about a half hour.\" Mike entered the hive of activity and threw his helmet against the wall in frustration. A few of the troops staffing the center seemed to notice but none said anything. He grabbed a cup of coffee then sat down in a chair that was better suited for a fourth grader then a soldier in combat gear. The time went by quickly though nothing of interest could be heard on the loudspeaker turned to pick up the radio chatter between the two helicopters. \"This is Dog Pound 2-1 approaching LZ, everything looks clear for a clean insertion,\" the pilot reported back. \"2-2, flare right for the drop,\" he ordered calmly to the other pilot. \"Wait…wait…what's that? Oh man we've got contact…no we've got multiple contacts coming down on us. 2-2 abort, pull up.\" The intense sounds of and explosion and metal crunching assaulted the speakers as people in the ops center tuned in to figure out what was going on. \"Can we get eyes on?\" a captain ordered to the team sitting behind computer monitors. \"I need a sit rep. What's happening people? Talk to me.\" \"Sir, Dog Pound 2-2 is not responding and is off-line. I think they're down,\" an army private responded in a staccato pitch. \"Can we activate their cockpit cameras? We need to know what's going on.\" Just then the conversation was interrupted by the helicopter pilot reporting from miles away. \"This is Dog Pound 2-1, we have been engaged by hostile aircraft at the LZ. We're falling back and trying to disengage. We need a….\" The sound of another explosion and flash of noise erupted over the speaker. Then it suddenly went dead. Just before, a technician reported, \"I've picked up their camera signature sir and am putting it on screen.\" A moment before the pilot signaled his doom, a video image flashed up on the main view screen of the operations center. It showed a pair of alien wedge ships swooping in on the beleaguered helicopter. Somehow the aliens had been able to re-establish air support. The attack from the sky came a short time later. Ironically, the death of the Marines who had been on the recon mission served the purpose of warning the forward echelons of the chilling reality that the aliens once again had air support. There was little time to figure out how this happened in the fury of activity to prepare. When the wedge ships came flying over bent on overwhelming the human position they were met by Hawk and AMRAAM surface-to-air missiles. Fortunately for the Marines, and the other soldiers in the area by default, their division commander, Major General Ron Dailey had planned for this contingency despite the foot dragging of some of his staff officers who thought the ordinance an unnecessary burden to carry to the front. Without the air defense it would have been carnage. Even with them, it was a hard won fight. The end result though was forward progress would be checked until the situation could be rectified. This situation continued on for another week. A sense of stalemate seemed to carry the day. Neither side could gain the upper hand. The humans held the outer areas of the metropolis and the aliens the core. General Daily began rotating his troops back to the rear area for a brief respite from the constant aerial attacks that had been going. Fortunately the drones did nothing but attack the fortified positions so thoughts of moving around didn't compute in their calculations. As a result, the rear area had become surprisingly calm. E Company of the 2-5 was one of the first to rotate back and Mike was happy for that. He'd wanted to see Michele, and also Hector, again. Yet as the transport helicopter he flew in drew closer to the rear area he felt himself becoming edgy, like his internal compass was out of whack because of the constant combat. Plus he had been thinking a lot about what had happened when the helicopter he'd been on had malfunctioned. He'd been fuming mad at that, angry he'd not be able to go on the assigned mission. Yet if he had, he'd be dead with the rest of them. That made him edgier though he couldn't figure out why. Normal no longer felt normal to him so seeing Michele, who he'd done nothing but think and dream about since he'd left, suddenly felt abnormal. Weird. \"General Dailey, Gary Sharpe, its nice to meet you,\" the smooth senator smiled as he shook hands with the commanding officer of the 1st Marine Division and overall commander in the Los Angeles theatre of operations. The politician was even more congenial since a phalanx of reporters were covering the meeting. \"You too senator. But listen, this is not really a good time,\" the career Marine responded apprehensively. \"The aliens have re-establish air cover so I'm in the middle of a fight right now.\" \"Not to worry general. I won't take much of your time,\" Sharpe blew the busy soldier's concern off. \"We're both very busy. I just wanted to touch base for a few minutes so we can discuss the process of turning power back over to civilian authority.\" The look of surprise on Ron Dailey's face was obvious to all who were watching. The expressive African American couldn't believe what he'd just heard. He opened his mouth to retort but wisely held it. He'd been the CO of 1st Division long enough to understand the power of the press and the optics of how things were presented. Motioning slightly to one of his aides he met the politician's grin with one of his own. looks like another front might be opening. Well, two can play at this game jerk , he thought to himself. \"Well all right,\" General Dailey agreed in a friendly tone. \"But let's get away from all these distractions so we can talk.\" He smoothly led the senator through a door into a rear area of the building he'd set up his headquarters. Sharpe's entourage and the reporters tried to follow but their way was immediately barred by the General's aide and a half-dozen armed Marines who showed they were not too messed with. Sharpe's bodyguards tried to bull their way in but they too were repulsed by the soldiers so the group had to wait outside, fuming the whole time. They weren't the only ones. Gary Sharpe had expected his staff and the reporters to follow him in and hadn't anticipated being alone with the physically intimidating Marine. General Dailey caught the flash of anger so tried to defuse it. \"Easier for us to talk, huh? Without all those distractions I mean?\" he clarified innocently. The senator knew he'd been outmaneuvered but held his tongue. He held the trump card so would wait patiently to show this upstart who was boss. \"Good idea,\" he said magnanimously, opening his arms wide, \"now let's get to know each other better so we can begin to work more effectively together.\" Mike saw her from behind, walking briskly from one of the temporary buildings in the refugee encampment towards another. Her tousled dark hair blew in the breeze causing a strange feeling inside of him. \"Michele!\" he called out in anticipation. She froze in place, recognizing her name and who had called it out. But instead of turning in a flash and running to him like he'd anticipated she paused, as if collecting her thoughts. Taking the initiative, he moved towards her. Finally she did face him and he could see she'd been crying. \"Hello Mike,\" she responded woodenly. Then noticing the bandage on his cheek she added tightly, \"You've been wounded…again.\" \"It's nothing, just a scratch really. Caught a bit of shrapnel a week or so ago,\" he tried to downplay the injury avoiding the reality of what could have happened. \"I see. Well I'm glad you're okay.\" Something in her tone irritated him. He couldn't quite put his finger on it but there seemed a cool reservation that seemed undeserved. Mike already was tense from battle and tormented by thoughts of the men who'd died in the recce incident and how easily it could have been him. Now this. He began to wonder if he'd been premature at opening the door of his heart and with this woman. It appeared it might be time for a tactical withdrawal. \"Yea, I am,\" he responded cautiously. \"I just wanted to touch base and say hello. So anyway, I'll see you around.\" Mike turned and walked away, back towards the base. \"Mike, wait.\" Michele herself was a woman torn. The past week had not been easy for her. A thought that had been growing, a hope beyond her relationship with Mike, had been dashed. She began to realize how temporary things could really be. She'd not heard from Mike since he'd left and she'd been worried sick. Then he shows up, unannounced, and with a field dressing on his face. This was becoming a bit much for her to handle. Then there was what had happened earlier in the day. Mike turned, a look of anticipation on his face in response to her request. \"I'm sorry,\" Michele began, \"you just caught me off guard, that's all. I'm really glad to see you.\" Though her words were inviting Mike could see she still kept her distance, kept a buffer zone. Her body language said a barrier now existed. \"Are you okay Michele?\" he asked. \"You don't seem yourself.\" \"Myself? What do you expect?\" she snapped. \"I don't hear from you for over a week, I do hear about the fighting at the front and the aliens now have their aircraft back. I've seen the wounded, heard about the dead, then you show up wounded and say its nothing.\" \"Hey, I'm sorry. I should have tried to get in touch. It's just been hard and I've been busy. We're in a war,\" he answered defensively. \"We've been pretty busy and not had a lot of down time. But I've thought about you a lot and really have wanted to talk to you. I don't know what else to say.\" It's not you Mike, it's me,\" Michele confessed. \"And it's not this. I...something happened today that…\" she suddenly burst in tears, looking so helpless. Mike glided to her side, pushing aside her defenses, to take the sobbing woman in his arms. \"My sister…my sister,\" she tried to choke out. \"Is she okay? Did you get any news about her?\" Mike asked tenderly. \"She's fine. She was here and she took the girls.\" \"What?\" Mike shot out, shocked by the unexpected news. \"They've been okay the whole time. Its just the roads have been closed and there was no communication going out or in. But now they're opening stuff up so she and her husband found me here. I guess we've been in the media so they tracked me…tracked us down.\" \"Kirsten and Amy are gone?\" Mike still couldn't believe it. He barely knew them but for some reason felt the lose severely. Then it dawned on him how she must be feeling. \"Oh Michele…are you okay?\" \"They stayed the night and then took them away just this morning. Just like that.\" Then a spark of anger lit in the unstable woman. \"Yea, just took them. For over a month I think she's dead and I'm going to have to look after the girls and then she just shows up and takes them…doesn't even say thanks. All she can do is try to get away from here as fast as she can, says it's not safe for them. What about ME!\" \"Well, I'm sure they were scared for their kids and for you. I mean…\" \"Don't,\" Michele cut him off. \"Don't you try to explain or rationalize this because I don't want to hear it right now.\" \"Okay, I understand,\" Mike responded quietly, a bit hurt. \"Oh, and you should try to find Hector,\" she added, a hint of anger still in her voice, \"he has some news for you too.\"[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 - complications The sense of urgency in the movement of Staff Sergeant Mike Nantz was obvious to even the most casual observer. With only 24 hours off the line he had no time to waste. He was a man torn though. When he left Michele the irritation and even growing anger seemed pretty obvious but her veiled comments about Hector caused him to panic. Mike lost his temper with her when she wouldn't tell him exactly what she alluded too so he'd stormed off to find out for himself. Ten minutes later he regretted it but that would have to wait. He checked the infirmary, finding the boy was not hurt, then went to the billet he'd been staying at. The attendant gave him a new address in the refugee city where he could be found. The camp for the displaced citizens of Los Angeles had grown into a city courtesy mostly of a Christian mission agency called Samaritan's Purse who had come in with the house-tents people were living in. Mike still found it hard to believe that in other parts of the country people's lives had not been touched by the war like his and the people of LA had been. It seemed surreal. But then he realized this was no different then what the people in Iraq or Afghanistan had been experiencing the past 10 years. A lot had changed in the last month and a bit. Looking over the expanse of tents laid out in neat streets Mike realized there were many thousands of people living in this circumstance, maybe ten-plus thousand. He couldn't really count. Continuing to walk he realized how isolated he'd been in the past. The scene seemed grotesque but only because this was America. If he'd been in Sudan or many other African countries this would be a commonplace site. The thought sickened him. He'd been so self-absorbed in his life the injustice of something like this had never registered. It took it happening in his own country, to his own city and to his own people for it finally to sink in. He thought of Father Alexander and how he'd often talked about how God will try to get our attention. Was this one of those times? He'd have to ask the priest about that sometime. Finally the philosophical thoughts needed to be put away as Mike arrived at the address he'd been given. A few children played soccer outside on the dirt road but he didn't see who he sought. Knocking on the flimsy door he called out, \"Hector…Hector are you in there?\" A rustle of activity could be heard and Mike almost was bowled over by the young Latino boy who flew through the door. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz! You're here!\" The boy gave Mike a crushing hug, hanging on like his life depended on it. \"Hector, como? Que pasa?\" A short, rotund Latino woman with a hard face and hair in a severe bun stood in the doorway, hands on her hips. \"Sorry aunt,\" Hector apologized, looking away from the woman. \"This is Staff Sergeant Nantz, the man I've been telling you about. This is my Aunt Maria.\" \"Maria Hernandez,\" she introduced herself with a curt nod. \"I am Hector's aunt. His father was my brother. I found the boy and so we are together now as a family.\" \"I'm sorry for the loss of him. Joe was a good man,\" Mike responded reverently though a bit put out by her referring to Hector as 'the boy'. \"Si. Gracias,\" she answered without feeling. \"Jose was his own man and he did not listen to reason. But that is behind us now. I am Hector's only relations so I will be looking after him.\" \"He's lucky to have you looking after him.\" Mike wasn't sure how much he believed that statement. \"Listen, can Hector and I take a walk? I'd like to catch up with him before I have to head back to the base.\" The woman's face showed her irritation but she really had no reason to refuse the man who had saved the boy's life so instead she said, \"Be back soon. You have work to do.\" Gary Sharpe was beginning to become a pain in the butt for Major General Ron Dailey. Not only did the senator continue to pop up with his entourage and press group at the worst possible time but then he'd shown the career Marine his Presidential Order to re-establish civilian authority in the Greater Los Angeles area. The commander of the 1st Marine Division had no problem with civilian governance, he hoped for the return to normalcy some day but the politician had been pressing for it already before the city was anywhere close to being safe. Unfortunately the order had been vague on the timing and terms for succession leaving a lot of room for interpretation. That set up a bit of a power play between the ambitious senator and the no-nonsense Marine who had no time for politics. Unfortunately for General Daily, Gary Sharpe had found an ally in an ambitious National Guard General. Frederick Gibil had been a career civil servant before his elevation to senior command in the Guard. He'd spent a minimal amount of time in field command, finding he could fast track up the logistical and administrative track so had taken that route. He'd done very well at balancing budgets so had moved quickly through the ranks. Now that Gibil had latched onto the ambitious politician, some confusion over how to run the campaign already stretched to the max began. Sharpe started making suggestions about military operations and Gibil backed him, even using his influence among non-Marine units to assist the man, creating a growing sense of confusion which had begun to breed hesitation. So in order to facilitate this new chain of command, Sharpe had insisted on daily meetings to be apprised of the military situation with his new advisor General Gibil, and begin to push for a transfer of power. General Daily did not look forward to their coming 9am meeting. The night had been difficult with significant casualties from an alien air attack and the continued inability to break out. It seemed their attackers had somehow been able to re-establish some form of command-and-control asset since their drones now filled the air. Though the human forces now knew how to counter them they were stuck in a stalemate. As long as that C-and-C asset remained they couldn't punch out. Something had to be done; unfortunately Daily'd have to waste at least two hours with the simpering politician and his entourage. \"General, we need you to break out of this gridlock you're in,\" Sharpe opened, sipping on a cappuccino. \"Well sir we're doing the best we can,\" Daily replied, trying to stay calm. \"It'll take time. Are you in a hurry?\" he tried to lighten the mood. \"I'd like you to press the front forward so we can begin to repatriate civilians back into these neighborhoods.\" The general thought to laugh then saw the politician was serious. \"That can't be done. The fronts too unstable to bring people back in,\" he explained. \"There's a need to begin to return to normal General,\" Sharpe declared airily. \"You contain the fighting to an area so the rest can begin to move forward.\" \"Move forward?\" Daily declared incredulously. \"Normal? We're in a war sir. We can't just contain the enemy like some video game and we sure as hell can't guarantee their safety. It would be suicide.\" \"Well that may be,\" Sharpe replied, nonplussed, \"though there are some military leaders who would disagree with you assessment. But you're in charge for now so we have to defer to your more cautious stance.\" \"Glad to hear it.\" Daily shot a withering glace at General Gibil who stood behind the senator with a smug look on his face. 'Gerbil' his staff had started calling the National Guard officer and the tough African-American Marine thought he looked like a rodent right now. \"One more thing,\" Sharpe added casually, holding his hand out so an aide could place a file folder in it. \"Yes, what's that?\" General Daily answered tensely. \"I've read the After Action Report on the attack on the water treatment plant,\" the senator declared. \"Oh?\" the general responded carefully, wondering how he'd gained access to the still classified document but knew immediately when Gibil avoided his look. \"Yes I have and there seem to be some irregularities. It would appear from this that every alien combatant was killed. None were taken prisoner or given the chance to surrender.\" \"That's not the way aliens fight senator,\" Daily snorted. \"Yet this would seem inhumane at the very least and a violation of the Geneva Convention at the most.\" \"You've got to be kidding me!\" the Marine finally exploded. \"They attacked us without warning, slaughtered thousands of innocent civilians and are not part of the Geneva Convention. This is ridiculous! Whose side are you on anyway?\" \"Now calm down sir,\" General Gibil interjected trying to play the statesman, \"that's not what Senator Sharpe meant. Is it?\" \"No, of course not,\" the politician feigned innocent surprise. \"I'm surprised you'd think such a thing, but then these are stressful times. I only meant to remind you that we should always be above reproach in this campaign. We don't want to act like them.\" \"Take the high ground, right senator?\" Gibil suggested. \"Exactly General. Thank you. That's exactly what I mean,\" Sharpe agreed. General Daily shook his head in disgust. As if he didn't have enough to deal with already. A pain in the butt indeed. Check that, two pains in the butt. \"I hate her Staff Sergeant,\" Hector confessed, bursting into tears. \"She talks bad about my dad all the time. She talks bad about the Marines and how you're messing up all the time. She makes me work and won't let me help at the base like I used to. I don't want to stay with her. Can't you do something about it, please?\" the boy pleaded. \"What can I do Hector?\" Mike asked. \"She's your family.\" \"You're a soldier. You have power. You could make her let me go,\" the boy shot back with rising emotion. \"I could stay with you or with Michele. I just don't want to be with her.\" Frustration grew in Mike as he realized the futility of his situation. Here he was trying to save humanity and he couldn't help this boy. \"It's not that simple Hector; she's your family and has rights. I can't just use my power to take you. That would be wrong,\" he argued unconvincingly. \"You saved me before, why can't you save me again?\" \"That was a different situation…different circumstances…it's not the same,\" Mike tried to counter, feeling completely impotent. Hector opened his mouth to speak but a desert camouflaged Humvee roared up and stopped beside them. While the engine continued to run a corporal jumped out of the passenger side. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, I have orders from Colonel Ritchie to bring you back to battalion right away. Hop in.\" \"But I'm on a 24 hour leave,\" Mike replied, head beginning to swim with the implications of what Hector had been saying and what now was being requested of him. \"It's been revoked,\" the corporal explained. \"The colonel wants you right now so get in.\" Mike nodded his head in agreement. \"Hector, I've got to go but we'll talk about this again, I promise.\" \"Yea, whatever. You do what you have to do,\" the boy responded sullenly, walking away. Mike climbed into the rear of the transport vehicle and watched the boy walk with his head down back towards his tent. He swore under his breath as the Hummer began to move. So now not only was Michele mad at him and he wouldn't have the chance to make things right before he went back but now Hector had been disappointed by him too. Some hero.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 -Discoveries Mike jumped out of the Hummer and hurried into the battalion command post. He could see those manning the situation room working feverishly so figured another attack was taking place. Maybe this had been why he'd been brought in though he wondered what he could do. He was only one man. He couldn't help Hector and now Michele was mad at him. Mike hoped going back into action would get rid of his lousy mood. He wondered if he died if anyone would even care. \"Staff Sergeant, sorry to have yanked you off your pass but we've got a situation we need you for,\" LCol Ritchie declared as he walked out of his office towards the man. Mike threw up a salute then replied, \"No problem sir, that's what the Marines are here for.\" \"All right, good to hear,\" the senior officer acknowledged with a nod of his head. \"The aliens are starting to kick the crap out of us from the air. We're holding our own but if we don't knock their Command-and-Control centre out we won't last.\" \"So where do I come into the picture sir?\" Mike asked, afraid of what the answer might be. The no-nonsense Marine got right to the point. \"We want you to form a team, go into LA and take it out like you did the last time.\" Mike waited for the punch line. He looked at the officer and saw he was dead serious. Sure, just like that. Go back into LA, find the C-and-C station and destroy it. The last time had been dumb luck. This time the squidheads wouldn't be so casual about it. \"Sir, that was a different situation. We caught a break. This is a job for Force Recon or Delta, not a bunch of line jarheads,\" Mike argued. The colonel looked like he didn't disagree but it seemed this had come from higher. \"Well regardless, this comes from General Daily himself. He specifically asked that you lead this mission.\" \"The Division Commander?\" \"One and the same,\" Ritchie chuckled at Mike's disbelief. \"It seems Staff Sergeant Nantz that you have developed a bit of a reputation.\" \"Okay. I'll do it,\" Mike agreed, knowing he had no choice but flattered a man like Ron Daily even knew his name. \"Outstanding!\" The colonel came over and clapped Mike on the shoulder. \"What do you need?\" \"Are there any stealth Blackhawks available to take us in? MH-60's I mean. After the last mission I was supposed to be on we need something with stealth capabilities to get us in,\" Mike stated honestly. \"I kind of figured you'd be asking for something like that,\" Ritchie confirmed, nodding his head in agreement. \"Elements of the 160th Special Ops Aviation Regiment are now operational in this area. We can find one of their birds for the mission.\" \"Good. If the Night Stalkers are around then we might have a chance to get in since if the squidheads know we're coming we won't even get a shot.\" \"Agreed.\" \"In terms of the team, I think I'll take all E company troops. Harris, Imlay, Lockett, Petrie and Chavez for sure. Doc Adukwu as corpman. Then Domingez and Allen,\" Mike checked off. \"I also want someone from Air Force to co-ord the air support and fire mission if we find it.\" \"Anyone in mind?\" Yes sir. Tech Sergeant Elena Santos,\" Mike answered without hesitation. \"She was with us when we took out the first one. She's tough, knows her stuff and can keep up. Can you find her?\" \"No problem. Leave it to me,\" the colonel confirmed. \"Good. I need the day to assemble and prep the team plus I need all the intel you have on the C-and-C asset and we'll go from there,\" Mike concluded, nothing left but to get the wheels in motion. \"Well all right Staff Sergeant,\" LCol Ritchie declared, shaking hands with the man. \"It seems like the general picked the right man.\" [Location: US Air Force Forward Observation Company, suburbs of LA] \"Impossible, you can't have her,\" the captain argued into the radio, gripping the receiver hard. \"I need her for our work here.\" \"This is not a request, it's an order,\" the staff officer from the wing on the other end of the line stated. \"This comes direct from the theatre commander General Daily. She needs to be at the 5th Marine staging area by 1300hrs so you better get hustling. If she's not…well, you don't want to go there.\" The thin, pale man swore as he signed off. He bit his lip hard, causing him to wince. \"Santos, get your gear and get ready to move out,\" he yelled, \"you're being called for a mission on the front.\" [Location: 5th Marine staging area] Mike watched the Marines checking their gear, laughing and horsing around with each other. You'd never know they were about to embark on a virtual suicide mission. The happiest was Elena Santos who couldn't stop grinning. She'd thanked Mike about ten times for asking for her. And she had come out of a safe rear area assignment and wanted to go back into harms way. Man, did he love soldiers. Mike only had a few minutes before their more in-depth briefing. He'd given them a head's up of what they were doing and what they'd need so each could start checking gear and then left them to it. With some time to spare he furiously finished writing. He didn't like to write and his penmanship showed it. People had made fun of his writing for years so he did it as little as possible. But this was different. He finished two letters and licked the cover to seal them. One for Michele, the other to Hector. He'd tried to explain in the letters what he'd been unable to before, tried to tell them how he felt…. The troubled Marine saw Father Alexander walk towards him. \"Hello Michael,\" the priest greeted him warmly though tension marked his face. \"You know, don't you?\" Mike answered. \"Colonel Ritchie gave me a bit of a head's up. I don't know all the details but he needed to give me a sense of the urgency of this to get me here right away,\" Father Alexander said with concern. \"Thanks for asking for me. Are you okay?\" \"Yea, I'm fine. I have these letters. Just in case…could you deliver them for me?\" \"Anything you want. I'll give them back to you when you return,\" the priest said without a tone of optimism. Mike grunted but said nothing. \"Is there anything I can do for you though?\" Father Alexander asked penetratingly. \"Pray for me. Pray that you don't have to deliver them and I can talk to both of them myself.\" Ten minutes later Mike assembled his team, feeling a lightness he'd not experienced for a long time. Father Alexander had prayed earnestly and passionately for him and it had made a difference. He began to believe he would make it back, that he would be able to make things right. But first he had to do this. Many lives were at stake and felt the full weight of the responsibility. \"All right, gather around people,\" Mike called out to his team. The soldiers trotted over and settled down quickly, a testimony to their professionalism. He surveyed them and realized just how much he cared about this group, one he was about to put in harm's way. Another perverse reality of war. \"Okay, I've given you the peripherals on the mission already. We're going back into LA, behind enemy lines, so the risk is great. I've picked each of you because I know you can get the job done but this is voluntary so if anyone feels they can't go or has any hesitation, there's not dishonor in that. Let me know and I'll release you.\" He looked particularly at Santos to ensure she understood where he was coming from. The perceptive Latino woman caught the thrust. \"Its about time you called me back to the fight Staff Sergeant,\" she countered with a smirk, \"I was starting to think you didn't love me anymore.\" No one took up the offer to withdraw from the mission though several chuckled at the woman's mirth. \"Excellent. We're going to break into two fire teams. Imlay, you lead the first, Lockett the second. Harris you take the machine gun det along with Petrie on comms, Doc and Santos round it out. Questions about that?\" \"So where are we going Staffs?\" Lockett asked, ready to get down to business. \"We don't know for sure but best estimates are in the area of Culver City. That makes sense since they arrived at Santa Monica and that's in proximity. We're going to travel light but be prepared to be out as long as necessary since we're not coming back until we get the job done. I'd say be ready for a three day hump so bring enough IMPs. If we haven't found it by then, well…,\" his voice trailed off and none of the assembled soldiers needed clarification. If they didn't do it fast it wouldn't happen at all and they'd be dead. \"Santos, do you have the strike package codes?\" Mike asked, getting back to business. \"Yea, I do,\" she confirmed, patting a breast pocket in her tactical vest. \"Stealth bombers with Tomahawk cruise missiles will be standing by waiting for our signal.\" \"Well all right then.\" Mike looked at the group again wondering how many would come back. He wondered if he would be coming back. Putting those thoughts out of his mind he ordered, \"get some hot chow in the mess hall, then get some rest. We move out tonight.\" Seven hours later, a single Blackhawk helicopter, its noise supression system already engaged, took off with the sound of a whisper from the Marine staging area. Favor was on the side of the human encroachers because as they were loading up in the special ops helicopter thick cloud cover moved in, blotting out the half moon that had given off a low light. The helicopter took off north then headed east in order to mask its true destination. Then it turned sharp to the west and headed towards highway 405 before dropping low into the Stone Canyon Reservoir, flying low to the ground. Making no more sound then a bat and with lights out, the helicopter was invisible to even those who rode in it. Ninety minutes later they approached the landing zone Mike had chosen, an industrial complex the sergeant had chosen from satellite images that seemed to give good cover. The Blackhawk didn't touch the ground but hovered at three feet, a crewman surveyed the area, traversing his mini-gun back and forth. All clear, he signaled. Like wraiths, the ten soldiers hopped out of the chopper and sprinted to their rally point 200 meters away. Moment of truth time. Mike braced himself as he sprinted away from the helicopter into the inky darkness wondering if the ground around him would erupt in alien grenade or machine gun fire. But the only thing greeting them was a steady breeze. It was silent as a grave which suited the team just fine. Then, just as quickly, the Blackhawk lifted off and flew swiftly into the night, lost in a matter of seconds. The whole insertion had taken less then 30 seconds. They were now boots on the ground and ready to go. Now if only they could find the command-and-control center. [US Army Reserve Signals Intelligence Unit operations area, somewhere outside LA] \"Wait a minute,\" the soldier said to himself. Adjusting his designer glasses he went back to the screen and tapped a series of keys to run the intercepted alien transmission back. Cutting and pasting the file into a program he'd been playing around with he began to run the algorithms….words popped up and he nearly had a heart attack. \"Sir, I think I have something!\" Army Reserve signals and intelligence specialist 1st Lt. Richard Watson had been trying for over a month, ever since he'd been activated, to find out a way to crack the alien language. They'd been able to intercept their communications fairly quickly but the format, and the language, had been gibberish to everyone so had been of little use. The mobilization order of the Reserve had been compete and across the board, not really figuring in the needed skill set so the SIGINT people from his intelligence company had largely been bored in the rear area. Not Richard Watson. While most of his peers had used the time to Facebook and play on Tumblr he had poked away at the steady stream of intercepted communications. Within a day he'd already figured out a pattern existed so immediately starting writing a program to try to deciper it. Richard Watson was one that to see him would not be a memorable experience. Of mid-range height and slender build, the pale, quiet man would not be one to warrant attention, especially lost as he was in the sea of vibrant soldiers all about. But those who took him at face value missed out on who the man was. 'Ritchie Rich', to his friends, Watson had the distinction of likely being the only Silicon Valley millionaire to serve in the Reserve. But there was more to the man then just that. He'd been a brilliant hacker before entering the corporate world and written some of the most sophisticated programs on the planet until 9/11 changed him. Watching the Twin Towers collapse on his laptop that fateful day from his sunny office in California something changed. Suddenly he wanted to give rather then take. He started surfing the net and saw that there was a desperate need for people with his skills to serve in the military. An active career was out of the question. He was dedicated but not that dedicated. Then he found out the Army Reserve had positions in their signals division for people with his unique skills. He could contribute, keep his job and serve on the side. When the recruiting officer found out who he was the man almost had a heart attack. Watson swore him to secrecy in exchange for his service so other then his company commander none knew the reality of who he was. A classic 'geek' but with a brilliant mind, he found surprisingly he enjoyed the work and found it useful. Now, in the battle for LA, perhaps his greatest accomplishment was about to be revealed. He'd been working on a program to decode and translate the alien language. It was a 'smart' program which meant it learned from itself so would run 24/7 and build on itself. Weeks later, the first series of words came out. By being able to backstop the information to intelligence reports and alien movement he could then refine and calibrate the program. He'd told no one about this, and everyone in his section ignored the dedicated man, until he was sure because it seemed so crazy. But then crazy was what launched the Silicon Valley in the first place. Watson looked at the printout then looked at it again. He'd run the previous days intercepts through the program and it had been a perfect translation into english, 'common', to his Dungeons and Dragons teammates but perfectly legible though the grammar was a bit spotty. He then pulled up the intelligence capture for the day and cross referenced the alien transmissions with what they did. It was a perfect match. \"Major Swan, you want to see this,\" Watson called out to his company commander. The man who ran his group, a computer executive himself who knew the caliber of man the quiet First Lieutenant was, still couldn't believe what he was being told. He called several of the other team members over who at first laughed and thought it was a joke. But then they looked at his program, ran a diagnostic and his supporting data. Suddenly you could hear a pin drop in the room. That lasted about a minute before the room exploded into a hive of activity. Major Swan reported to the Division Headquarters what they'd found and within a half hour a Blackhawk helicopter along with two Apache gunships were flying 1st Lt. 'Ritchie Rich' Watson and his MacBook Pro to meet with the theatre commander. Within two hours of that meeting General Daily was already starting to move troops and air defense assets around.[Chapter 16] CHAPTER 16 – politics [somewhere in Culver City, LA] Imlay frantically flashed the signal back to the rest of the patrol, his eyes showing the urgency in his hand movements. Hostiles approaching! Danger close! Staff Sergeant Nantz responded immediately, signaling the rest of the group to melt into the destroyed building to their right. There were no radio communications since the aliens could pick them up so everything was done by hand signals. Just in time the soldiers disappeared because coming up the street they'd just been on a column of two dozen infantry caste aliens came marching along the route the Marines had just been picking their way along. They seemed to be alert and looking for something which made Mike even more nervous. This was the third such patrol they'd run into and it wasn't even noon yet. Once Mike's team had been inserted by the Blackhawk they had moved for several hours towards the heart of the urban community beginning their search for the alien Command-and-Control center. Progress had been slow as the soldiers methodically moved to orient themselves to the reality of the area rather then the theory they'd been shared by the intelligence specialists in the rear area. As dawn came they went to ground to assess the situation and see what they faced. It didn't encourage them. The Marines and their Air Force comrade seemed to have slotted into a large concentration of aliens. So either they were in the right location or there were a lot more bad guys around then they knew about. Either way it spelled bad news for the team whose job it was to remain invisible until they found what they searched for. All clear. Imlay's signal came back and the team reassembled. \"That was too close,\" Lockett voiced everyone else's sentiments. Yea, that's three groups already,\" Harris confirmed. \"We've got to be close.\" \"Or else we've walked into some sort of troop concentration,\" Lockett countered. \"It doesn't matter, we have a mission to get done,\" Mike reminded them, looking up as an alien wedge ship flew overhead. \"This changes nothing, we just need to move more carefully.\" He looked around, knowing they needed to move out of the open. \"We stay in the rubble and get off the main street.\" \"That's going to slow us down,\" Harris stated. \"What? You in a hurry to get somewhere?\" Mike shot back, breaking the tension. Let's keep moving.\" [Task Force LA administrative support area, well back from the main line] The National Guard officer floated around the periphery, making sure people were unaware of his presence. He watched the Reserve Signals Intelligence officer showing off his program to General Daily. The theatre commander clapped the slender, bespectacled man on the back, congratulating him for his discovery. After another demonstration the Marine officer called his intelligence chief and had a batch of intercepts fed into the programmer's computer. The results came back a few minutes later causing the commander to bark out a series of orders to his subordinate officer. Somehow this computer geek had cracked the alien language the Guard officer realized. This was huge. Pulling out his Blackberry he tapped a pre-set number. \"Senator Sharpe, there's something happening here you need to be aware of,\" General Gibil whispered into his phone. Later the same day, when all the excitement had died down, the politician's entourage pulled up to the Signals Intelligence area where they were met by the National Guard general. The man introduced them to Richard Watson and arranged for a private meeting. Though the politician already knew about the project he feigned a lack of knowledge in order to encourage the impressionable computer programmer to keep talking. Finally, after three quarters of an hour of technical talk the wealthy senator ignored he was ready to move to the real reason for his visit. \"So you're able to receive and translate,\" Sharpe confirmed. \"But can you translate and send back to them?\" Watson looked at the politician for a moment, unable to process what was being requested. Then the light went on and he got it. \"Well sure. I don't see any reason why not,\" the computer programmer confirmed. \"I mean it should be able to work both ways. It would be simply a matter of reversing the flow.\" \"So we could talk to them then?\" Watson nodded his head in agreement. \"Would you try then?\" Sharpe pressed him. \"I'm not sure that's what we're supposed to be doing with this, sir. I mean…\" Watson tried to evade the question. \"Don't worry Lieutenant,\" General Gibil cut in to assuage the man's fears. \"I give my full authorization to anything the senator would ask you to do.\" \"But what about General Daily, sir?\" \"Leave him to me,\" Gibil declared confidently. \"Just get to work. If I can figure out what Senator Sharpe is wanting to do, and I think I can, this might just put us into a position to end this war.\" \"I think we're on the same wave length, General,\" the senator confirmed, flashing a winning smile. \"Are you sure?\" Watson asked enthusiastically, any nagging fear he had subdued by the confident pair. \"I mean if this could be used to stop the fighting that would be great. I'll work on it right away. If everything goes the way it should I'll likely be ready to test it out in the morning. I hope that's okay?\" \"Okay? Son, that's incredible. In fact, you're a hero,\" the politician played the naïve programmer expertly. \"They'll be writing books about you and studying you in schools if you can pull this off. Oh, but one thing. I'd keep this under your hat. We don't want people to get their hopes up prematurely. Do you understand?\" Gary Sharpe didn't want meddling soldiers ignorant of the bigger picture intruding on his plan. Nor did he want anyone else coming up with the idea and stealing his glory. When this was all over, and people had a chance to look at the whole situation with some depth, they'd see who had shown real leadership. The president had been weakened by this unexpected attack. People already were questioning his management of the campaign. This move would should where true leadership lay and they were close to an election year. Gary Sharpe was ready for the next step in his career. \"I do sir, you can count on me,\" the young programmer responded enthusiastically. \"I'm sure I can,\" Sharpe responded with another dazzling smile. [somewhere in Culver City, LA] \"See that over there,\" Lockett pointed out to Mike. \"Those are the same tanker aliens we took out at the reservoir.\" The recon team was in cover watching a water treatment plant. They'd thought they might have a lead on the C-and-C area based on the amount of alien activity in the area. But on closer examination they realized this was not what they sought. Still, the realization they did have had a chilling effect on the Marines observing. They sat watching for several hours, unable to move because of the presence of a company of infantry caste aliens that showed up right after they'd gotten into position. Well concealed, they had nothing more to do but watch. What they saw disturbed them. The aliens seemed to be drawing water as fast as they could, moving them to larger cargo drone hovercraft vehicles and flying them away. Where the soldiers could only guess but it wasn't to the ocean. \"Looks like we've got another problem,\" Mike muttered to his two fire team leaders as the others stayed hunkered down. \"It seems like they're really going to town grabbing water.\" \"Maybe they're getting ready to bug out,\" Imlay declared hopefully. \"Maybe,\" Mike answered, unconvinced. \"Regardless, this is part of a bigger problem we have. This water plant is tied into the broader grid so that allows them to draw water from the whole region.\" The staff sergeant was aware of a growing problem for the people not only on the west coast but throughout America. Consistent reports showed water levels in the country were steadily dropping. At the rate of consumption it would become dangerous, threatening to upset the eco-system if not unchecked. It seemed that if the aliens didn't have the strength to colonize the country they would try to take as much of the water as they could which could prove as fatale for the human inhabitants as the war had the potential to be. \"Do we call it in?\" Lockett asked. \"No, we can't break radio silence. Not yet anyway,\" Mike answered. \"We mark it on the map with the details we can, like the one we saw yesterday, and stick to the mission. One thing at a time.\" The recon team was into the second day of their mission to find the alien command-and-control center. They'd found several of these water harvesting centers and lots of aliens out and about but nothing that seemed to be controlling their drones. The good news was they hadn't been discovered but their luck wouldn't last forever. They were ten against what seemed like ten thousand. As they watched, another squadron of drones screamed overhead north towards the human position. The urgency of their mission became evident anew and the frustration of what they'd thus far accomplished even more so. As they continued to watch another tanker leave the water treatment plant and be replaced by a fresh one a greater sense of urgency seemed to build. Time, it would appear, seemed to not be on their side. [Army Reserve Signals Intelligence Area, outside LA] \"Are you sure about this sir?\" General Gibil asked Gary Sharpe nervously, beginning to wonder if this was such a smart plan. \"I mean, shouldn't General Daily be aprised.\" \"He's in charge of military operations, I'm in charge of civilians affairs, that's how I read the orders. The guys a grunt, a high-paid one, but a grunt. Besides, he's a neandrothol. All he knows is fighting. This is negotiation and that's what I know. If we continue to pointlessly fight it'll cost lives and more money. It's all about communications and give and take. We had no way to talk to them, to reason with them. Now we do. It's going to make all the difference in the world.\" \"But they attacked us without warning, it's like Pearl Harbor,\" Gibil dared to challenged. \"It doesn't strike me that these are the reasoning types.\" \"My dear man, it's nothing like that,\" Sharpe responding with a patronizing tone. \"How do we even know what their motivation is or what they wanted? We didn't. Let's talk to them and see if we can't come to some sort of compromise. That is the way of civilized people. Besides, what's the worst thing that happens? We don't succeed and the fighting continues. But if we do…,\" he let the words hang. And we've let them know we can read their language which kills our advantage , Gibil thought but didn't have the courage to say. \"…we end the war and save all those lives.\" And you become famous and get more power the Guard general thought. Too late the man began to wonder if he'd bet on the wrong horse. \"Okay senator, we're ready to go,\" Lt Watson confirmed, interrupting the conversation. \"I've patched the program into our communications grid thanks to General Gibil. We can broadcast as soon as you're ready.\" The California politician flashed a toothy smile and winked at the female reporter he'd invited along to witness the potentially historic event. There were lots of rumors about the two of them floating around. It seemed the senator was an effective multi-tasker. A Guard corporal, who'd been setting up the radio equipment, handed the politician a microphone and quickly instructed him how to transport. \"This is Senator Gary Sharpe representing the government of the United States,\" he announced into the device that had been tuned into the radio frequency the aliens had been consistently using. \"I am authorized to speak to you about ceasing hostilities and negotiating a peaceful solution to the unfortunate conflict we've found ourselves in.\" The twin speakers above the computer played the converted transmission and it came out in the chirping gibberish of the alien's language. It had worked perfectly. Now all they had to do was see if anyone responded.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 – negotiations [Army Reserve Signals Intelligence Area, outside LA] \"This is Vizier Bizripp, Thrall of the Zhuntran Advancement. How do you know to speak in our way?\" the harsh voice demanded in halting English. A cheer went up from the assembled at the successful attempt to communicate. Sharpe waved his hand to silence the crowd so he could hear. \"Quiet!\" General Gibil yelled. \"Sir, we have someone very gifted in translating who figured out how to convert our language to yours,\" the senator answered, giving a thumb's up to Lt. Watson There was a pause, as if the alien were processing the information. \"I see. What is it you want?\" the alien leader demanded harshly. \"My government would like to discuss how we can find a peaceful solution to this unfortunate conflict we find ourselves in. If there's a way we could help you with whatever struggle has driven you to attack us we'd like to figure it out so we can help you.\" \"Help us…hmmm. Perhaps you can,\" the Vizier responded carefully. \"So you are leader of your people? Of a high caste?\" \"I am the leader of this particular part of our country but do speak with our overall leader's authority,\" Sharpe confirmed. \"Excellent. Perhaps we should meet to discuss this further rather then using this device. Are you able to make us communicate with this device leader-to-leader?\" Sharpe looked over at Lt. Watson who shrugged his shoulders but seemed confident he could take it mobile. \"I believe we can make that work.\" \"Then I will accept this term and meet you,\" the alien responded in a guttural tone. \"I'm honored by the opportunity sir,\" the politician confirmed, gleefully thinking about what a photo op this was going to be. He began to hear 'Hail to the Chief' playing in his mind. The pair then worked out the time and location for their meeting. It took more effort then expected since the aliens and humans had no sense of the same scale of time nor had any common geography but eventually they found something they thought would work. The meet would happen the next day at noon in an area beyond the front that could be easily accessible by each side. Sharpe posed for a few photos and graciously accepted congratulations from a number of the gathered military techies and some of his entourage. General Gibil watched with increasing concern. He waited impatiently for the senator to finish eyeing up the female reporter with him and had to delay further for her obvious response to the overt leer. Finally the man separated himself so the Guard officer could speak alone with him. \"Are you sure about this Senator?\" Gibil questioned. \"About what General?\" the man replied nonchalantly. \"About meeting with the aliens. It seems way too easy. They attack us, we crack their language then they agree to meet with you, just like that.\" An irritated look marred the senator's handsome features. \"What are you getting at Gibil?\" \"Listen, I may not be a brilliant tactician but I smell a setup,\" the General mused. \"Really?\" Sharpe snorted sarcastically. \"And you don't think that maybe they're tired of this war too? Their losses have been heavy and they're not going to win.\" The senator then fixed the man with an intense glare. \"Instead of being all paranoid you might show them some goodwill and see the brilliance of this plan. You know they might be looking for a way to get out of this mess too.\" \"That doesn't make sense,\" Gibil pressed. \"Enough!\" the senator cut in, holding up his hand to silence the man. \"If you lack vision and aren't a team player I might have to look for another to be my military advisor. So watch your step. I do remember who has the vision and the courage to look to the future,\" he looked down his nose at the smaller man, \"and who doesn't. Get it?\" \"I get it,\" the National Guard officer responded, not able to make eye contact. [Somewhere inside Culver City, LA] This had to be the Central Hive, Mike thought as he looked again through his binoculars. A series of antennae came out of the ground housed in a domed structure similar to what they'd encountered last time. It seemed promising at the very least. While there seemed to be about a platoon of infantry caste aliens about they moved about in a loose patrol formation. So after dark the Marines should be able to sneak in and get a better look. All they needed to do was hunker down for a couple of hours which seemed easy enough after sneaking around like ghosts the past three days. LCpl Julio Dominguez had the overwatch on the position as the others rested out of sight. He was higher up then the others, having worked his way to a position of observation on the second floor of the destroyed building they were set up. The 21 year old Latino had a great view of the area they were seeking to explore. His mind drifted to some of the downtown clubs he had liked to go to in the past then naturally to the ladies with their short skirts and high heels who frequented them and liked to run their fingers through his short Mohawk haircut. It sure would feel good to have that happen again…. Crap A large group of aliens had come quickly out of the structure then began methodically searching the area towards him. He'd missed that and now at least ten of them were coming directly for his position with others fanning out in support. Had they been compromised? Had they been spotted? It didn't seem that way since the squids seemed to be sweeping the area. Routine? Maybe but the aliens definitely seemed to be moving with a purpose. All these thoughts processed through the mind of Julio Dominguez causing him to hesitate for about two seconds. It was two seconds too long. The lance corporal needed to shift his location to signal the rest of the patrol since they were in cover so couldn't see what approached. Unfortunately in his pause he'd lost the opportunity to make the move unseen. To do so now would expose him if he did. What to do? There was only one thing to do for the young Marine. Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath Dominguez said a quick prayer, crossed himself and moved as quickly as he could. \"Inbound! We got inbound squids,\" he yelled once he saw his team. Dominguez evaporated in a grenade explosion that peppered his second floor observation point. \"Fall back!\" Mike screamed. \"Move to the fall back point! Get out we've been compromised!\" The Marines responded instantly jumping out of their hiding places and moving in the opposite direction. The sound of advancing aliens became evident. Machine gun fire began to randomly pepper the building while several grenades whizzed into where they'd been holed up in. Dominguez's sacrifice and their quick response saved the remnant as the grenades exploded harmlessly. Harris and his team had already fallen back so were the first to drop down and set up a firebase to cover their withdrawal. The M240B GPMG opened up cutting down the lead group of infantry caste aliens who pressed through the Marines old hide allowing the others to move back then consolidate in order to withdraw from the area. Aliens seemed to be appearing from everywhere so this could take only a few moments or they'd be cut off. Santos sprinted as fast as her short legs would allow but she fell behind the other more athletic soldiers making for a juicy target. A burst of alien machine fire caught the Latino woman pushing her to the concrete road she'd been crossing. Fortunately Santos' Kevlar vest absorbed the rounds but her helmet had been knocked free. Looking back as she picked it the Air Force sergeant saw something that caused her to pause. Half-dozen drones were flying into position as a series of cables shot into the open at the position they'd been watching. It had to be the alien command-and-control center. \"Staff Sergeant!\" she screamed, falling prone to hold her position. \"Staff Sergeant! This has to be the place.\" \"Run Santos, fall back,\" Mike replied, dropping to one knee and drilling an alien that had been approaching from the side with a burst of automatic fire. \"We're going to get overrun here. We need to bug out.\" \"The drones are hooking the thing up,\" she shot back with a sense of urgency. \"We won't get another shot at it if we leave.\" Mike took a nano-second to think about it. \"Marines hold up, hold up!\" he ordered the others, his voice booming over the din of combat. \"Form a defensive position. We're going to hold this line. Petrie, get the radio up we're going to call this one in.\" \"Are you crazy Staffs?\" Lockett yelled back spraying fire left and right at the advancing aliens. \"We can't hold.\" \"We have to. This could be our only chance to get this thing,\" Mike countered confidently. \"All right,\" Lockett agreed his adrenaline surging. \"Find a spot Marines, let's buy some time.\" With Harris in the center Lockett and Imlay had their teams find good positions and began firing on the advancing aliens. It had taken only about ten seconds for this complete change in tactics. Thinking the humans had been on the run the aliens came in overly aggressive allowing the Marines to decimate the first ranks with M4A1 fire and then successfully targeted the officer caste aliens with several grenades from their M203's. Leaderless, the attackers fell back in disarray giving the soldiers a chance to withdraw but instead they held, hoping they could complete the mission. \"Comms up!\" Petrie reported. \"Santos, call it in,\" Mike ordered her with a sense of urgency, popping off three more rounds at an alien who'd tried to move out of cover. The Air Force Tech Sergeant licked dry lips then ducked her head as the aliens began to pound their position with rocket and machine gun fire. \"Anvil Command this is Foxtrot 2 November with a priority fire mission authorization Tango 7-Zulu 4-9er.\" \"Foxtrot 2 November this is Anvil Command. Your mission is authenticated. Go,\" the voice on the other end confirmed briskly. \"Anvil Command bring strike package Delta on grid co-ordinates 34028 November 118243 Whisky,\" Santos requested. \"This is a danger close mission, fire for effect.\" \"Roger that Foxtrot 2 November, fire for effect, danger close. Package inbound in less then five minutes.\" \"Five minutes,\" Santos screamed to be heard above the ruckus, \"inbounds in five minutes.\" Never had three hundred seconds felt longer. The drones worked frantically to hook up the Command Hive to pull it away, likely remembering what had happened the last time. The infantry caste aliens increased their fire and became more reckless, throwing caution to the wind in their attempt to dislodge the Marines. The fire became intense, the air sizzling with flying ordinance. Pete 'pig' Allen, so named for his legendary eating ability, had been holding the extreme right flank with his SAW. A group of aliens had tried to come around but he'd expertly picked them off, driving them back with a flurry of 5.56mm rounds. Things seemed fairly stable and they only had about two more minutes to go. Another group of infantry caste attackers showed themselves and Allen let off a long burst running through half a belt when the Squad Automatic Weapon suddenly stopped. \"I'm jammed, I'm jammed,\" Allen yelled out in panic as aliens began to surge towards him sensing the opportunity they'd been seeking. Imlay was closest to Pig's position so lobbed a grenade to his front then switched fire to try to cover the Marine who desperately attempted to clear the stoppage and reload the gun. It was too little too late. Allen had come into a kneeling position to get a better angle which made him too easy a target. With rounds whizzing all around, the burly Marine went down in a flurry of alien machine gun fire. \"Man down! Doc, we need a medic over here!\" Imlay cried out, his heart in his mouth as he watched Allen squirm in pain from multiple wounds. Santos and Petrie covered Doc Adukwu as he fearlessly sprinted from cover into the whirlwind of ordinance flying through the air, helping push the attackers back so he could try to save the life of the critically wounded Marine. The aliens continued to surge forward, trading lives for real estate but still the Marines desperately held on. Then came the sound they'd been waiting for. Overhead the whistle of inbound Tomahawk cruise missiles filled the air. Drones tried to intercept but the fast moving missiles cut through the hasty screen. Perhaps they'd been expecting the projectiles to be laser-guided like last time but not this day. The programmed missiles stayed true to their course and while three were cut down four more crashed into the bulky alien craft. The resulting explosion was not only deafening but flattened the surrounding block. [LA Theatre of operations headquarters] \"He did WHAT?\" General Daily exploded, flinging his briefing binder across the room barely missing a female corporal. \"I'll lock the idiot's ass in jail. Does he know what he's just done? The risk he's put us in?\" the man raged. \"Get me the captain of my MP detachment,\" he ordered a sergeant standing nearby. \"There's a problem with that sir,\" the officer reporting to him answered. \"He's already gotten a reply from the squidheads and a meets been set.\" Daily's eyes bulged with rage at the news but he held his tongue seeing the adjutant had more to report. \"He sent a flash message off to Washington right after. I don't think we can touch him.\" The general rubbed his temples as he felt a fresh migraine coming on. \"All right, send a message to our brigade commanders that our intelligence capabilities have been compromised and the squids know we can listen to them so proceed with caution on what we get. Then get me in touch with the good senator. We need to have a chat.\" [Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA] Michele sat on a bench, trying to think and at the same time trying not to think. Her mind became once more a jumble of thoughts and feelings. Though looking calm and collected on the outside, within the veterinarian was a volcano of emotions. She'd not heard from her nieces since they'd been taken from the refugee city and the situation with Hector continued to get worse. Then there was Mike. The troubled woman's attention shifted as a door banged open at the hospital across the dusty street she sat facing and a group of three Army nurses came out. \"I heard there was a team sent in behind the alien's line to try to hit their new command center,\" a nurse with poorly dyed blonde hair gossiped, taking a drag on a cigarette outside the infirmary. \"I heard it was the same guys that did it the last time,\" another confirmed. \"Poor buggers, couldn't they let someone else do it?\" An older woman with a tight bun wearing olive drab scrubs marched out and shot the chatty women a withering look. \"Prep for casualties, we've got another batch coming in from the front,\" she ordered. Michele's heart sank as she overheard the conversation between the nurses. The report from the supervisor only made her feel worse. \"Another mission?\" she groaned to herself. \"Was that why Mike had disappeared?\" The woman sunk into a sea of deep, dark guilt. After their heated conversation four days earlier then him not returning she'd figured he'd bailed on her and she'd flown into a rage. She'd even broken the precious bottle of Napa Valley wine she'd been able to secure and had been planning on sharing with him. The next day the beginnings of doubt for how she'd viewed things began to come alive. He saved her life, they had feelings for each other and she dumps on him the first time things get tense. Nice. No wonder he'd left she'd then began to think, falling into a depressed state of second guessing. Then she's talked to Hector and found out how bad their time together went and how he'd been called away from his leave. It all added up. It had to be him on this mission. \"Please God, let me see him again. I'll never be like that again,\" she prayed, tears clouding her vision as she sat alone.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 – Cost [ Battalion Headquarters, 2 nd Battalion, 5 th Marines, front line, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations] \"Sir! We're getting reports of alien drones falling from the sky,\" a radio operator yelled to the commanding officer of the battalion. \"Their air grid is completely gone.\" A buzz went around the room as some tried to get in on the action while others attempted to check their sources for confirmation. A few cheered at the news but most worked feverishly. LCol Ritchie charged over to a computer to check the information himself. Satisfied at the accuracy of the report he allowed himself a moment to smile slightly at the relief the news gave of them. \"All right, send this up to General Daily and put this out to all our commanders in the field. We're back in the driver's seat.\" The Marines on the front line took the opportunity to push back against the surprised aliens who'd been surging of late. With their air support removed the advantage again returned to the humans who took full advantage to recapture the ground once lost. But as all that transpired, back at the 2-5 headquarters, thirty minutes after the initial report of the destruction of the alien hive the Marine colonel became concerned for Staff Sergeant Nantz's team behind enemy lines. They'd not been heard of since the blast. \"Break radio silence. Try to raise the team,\" Ritchie ordered, shifting focus to getting his troops back now that the news had gone out about the loss of alien air power. \"Foxtrot 2 November this is Juggernaught Actual, come in please, over,\" the chief of communications for the battalion broadcast on the team's frequency. \"Foxtrot 2 November, can you read me, over?\" The radio operator waited as tension filled the room. \"Nothing sir.\" \"Any bio reading?\" LCol Ritchie snapped at a female Marine at another terminal. \"The woman checked her screen and checked again. \"Negative sir. Nothing coming up on the tracker. But the blast could have blitzed the system,\" she quickly added trying to offer hope. \"Boost the signal and try the comms again,\" he barked at the main radio operator. The officer in charge did as he was ordered but still nothing but static could be heard at the other end. Growing increasingly frustrated, Ritchie went to another terminal in his headquarters. \"I want a satellite reading of the area. Feed in the co-ordinates.\" \"We can't do that without NSA authorization sir,\" the operator responded, avoiding the Marine's piercing look. Bull. I know you can override the system,\" Ritchie declared. The operator reddened at the truth of the statement confirming the officer's suspicion. \"Do it.\" \"All right sir, give me a sec.\" The thin soldier adjusted his glasses and began to rapidly tap the keys on his keyboard. \"Image coming up on the main screen now.\" Attention fixed to the view screen that hung on a wall in the center of the headquarters. The screen flickered then a grainy image looking down from space showed Culver City. \"Sharpen the image and magnify,\" Ritchie ordered. The operator adjusted the settings and the sight though clearer was not encouraging. A large crater smoked in the center of the picture, while a billowing dust cloud still hung in the air. All around, at least two blocks out was fresh devastation. Even though the Tomahawks carried non-nuclear warheads, the number and size of the payload spelled overkill to those who watched. The alien Central Hive had been completely destroyed. Nothing moved in the picture though from the edge of the screen infantry caste aliens could be seen entering into the area. No one said anything, the elation of the moment lost at the realization of the cost. 1st Sergeant John Roy stood behind the senior officer watching the scene, feeling intensely the loss of his friend. \"Should I call up SAR to look for survivors after dark sir?\" \"Negative,\" Ritchie replied flatly. \"Search and rescue's too risky. The place will be crawling by then.\" \"Understood,\" Roy replied, keeping his emotions in check. Looking over at Father Alexander the two locked on each other for a moment. \"With your permission sir, the chaplain and I need to let some people know what just happened.\" [Task Force Los Angeles Command Center, rear area, somewhere in LA] \"Thank you for the report colonel, that's excellent news,\" General Daily responded to the news of the successful mission. \"Well done and congratulations.\" He listened as the report continued. \"I'm sorry to hear about your team. We'll make sure their loss is not forgotten.\" Daily handed the receiver back to the radio operator and sighed audibly. More cost, more brave men lost in this conflict. When would it end? \"Well?\" The general's thoughts were interrupted by Gary Sharpe. Keeping his emotions in check at the man who continued to irritate him in new ways every day he responded, \"Okay, I can give you the green light for your mission.\" \"You know, I don't need your permission to do this. I have the president's authorization,\" the senator declared confidently. \"You do if you want to use my helicopters,\" Daily retorted. \"Gentlemen, it's a moot point,\" General Gibil stepped in, playing the statesman. \"The meet's been set and time is running out.\" \"You're right of course,\" Daily admitted. \"I'm sorry about that senator, I just don't like this. The risk is too high.\" Rather then taking the high road and apologizing for his agitation, Sharpe smugly looked down at the humble soldier. \"That's more like it. Now we're co-operating, now we're getting somewhere,\" he chided. \"My people are ready to move so make sure everything is prepped.\" \"I think you should have at least a platoon of Marines escorting you,\" Daily responded, chaffing under the arrogant politician. \"I'd take a company if it were me. Plus I'd go in on the ground. It makes you less of a target.\" Sharpe chuckled and shook his head. \"You really don't know anything about negotiations do you?\" \"I do know about war!\" the African American commander shot back. \"That could be viewed as overly aggressive. It's acting in bad faith.\" \"Bad faith is attacking without warning.\" \"They had no way of communicating with us,\" Sharpe explained in a patronizing tone. \"Plus they don't really know our ways, do they?\" Daily couldn't believe what he was hearing but held his tongue. \"Okay, it's your call senator.\" \"Yes, it is,\" he responded ungraciously. \"I'll take a gunship with me as escort to comfort you and General Gibil plus another helicopter for the press.\" He watched the Marine officer's eyes narrow but ignored him. \"Oh and general, when we get back we're going to talk about a formal transfer of power.\" [Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA] Michele saw the chaplain and Marine sergeant approaching and instinctively knew they were coming to see her. She also knew the news they bore wasn't good. Maybe it was the way their shoulders slumped. Maybe it was a sixth sense. Her first instinct was to run. If they couldn't tell her she wouldn't be able to hear it. But as much as her mind screamed 'run' her legs were stuck like they were planted in cement. \"Miss Trantor,\" Father Alexander began, his eyes filled with remorse, \"I have some bad news we need to share with you.\" Michele could feel her heart begin to pound and thought it might burst out of her chest. The sergeant she figured to be Mike's friend John Roy wouldn't look at her. The priest seemed in pain himself. Her head started to feel light. \"We know that you and Staff Sergeant Nantz have become close this past while,\" Father Alexander continued kindly, \"so we wanted you to know that he was on a mission behind enemy lines. While the mission was successful and was a huge help for the war effort we're afraid we need to let you know that he and his team are missing and presumed lost.\" \"No,\" Michele whispered, hearing the words she'd feared, \"…no…NO!\" she screamed drawing looks for those in earshot. The woman's legs buckled and she fell to the ground, drawing her knees in to her chin and rocking back and forth as the two soldiers looked on helplessly. [meeting between the Zhuntran Advancement and the representative of the US government, somewhere in LA] The two parties stared at each other, wondering who would make the first move. Bizripp stood flanked by a dozen infantry caste aliens. Senator Sharpe has his protection detail, handlers and press followers who were setting up to capture the historic event. The officer caste alien stood taller then even his other peers towering nearly ten feet tall. The meet had been set for an abandoned Walmart which allowed for the helicopters to land. The alien party was already in place when the humans arrived. They stood, unmoving, as the two transport choppers landed and turned off before their passengers left. An Apache attack helicopter flew above and away from the scene on overwatch. Sharpe waved at the aliens who continued to stand impassively though they did seem to be speaking to each other. The senator motioned to Lt. Watson to set up his mobile translation apparatus. With the help of two soldiers from his unit they began to unpack their gear and hook everything up. For Richard Watson, this continued to be surreal experience. The computer programmer thought back to his hacker days and wondered at how weird life could be. A few months ago he'd been bringing in over $100,000 a month now he was sweating in the sun, twenty yards away from the things that had been trying to destroy the planet. The senator was so confident but for his part the thoughtful man kept getting strange vibes from the whole thing. No matter, Sharpe seemed to know what he was doing. While several print journalists snapped pictures and began scribbling background notes, the senator's personal videographer began to capture the event. CNN, on the other hand, set up to go live and broadcast across the country. This was going to be huge, a real career maker. Getting the signal, the leggy blonde reporter with a short skirt began, \"This is Ashley Madison, live from Los Angeles where a historic gathering is taking place. Senator Gary Sharpe has arranged a meeting to negotiate peace with the alien invaders.\" The camera panned back and showed the surrounding area. With cameras rolling and a live feed, Gary Sharpe was feeling pretty good. Off camera he winked at the reporter who he'd picked to come along. She'd already indicated she'd be showing her gratitude for the opportunity later that night. Life was good for the senator. Lt. Watson signaled to Sharpe they were ready to begin. The equipment had been booted up, microphones and speakers were fed into the Apple computer that had been upgraded with the fastest hardware around. Sharpe motioned to Bizripp and his entourage to join him but they continued to stand stonily, not moving, peering warily about. Looking around the lanky creatures finally moved, joining the senator. He extended his hand which was refused . Oh well, not likely their custom , he thought. They're nothing more then savages and man, do these things stink. \"Vizier Bizripp, it's nice to meet you\" Sharpe began, smiling broadly. \"Thank you for your willingness to meet and speak of ending our disagreement. It shows great vision on your part.\" \"This is the one who makes you speak our tongue?\" Bizripp said through the translator ignoring the introduction instead gesturing to Watson who worked the computer at a portable table. \"Yes, this is Richard Watson. He's really a genius with computers.\" \"And he is only one?\" \"You're correct. He figured out how to translate your native tongue into ours. Now, let's get down to our negotiations.\" Bizripp ignored the senator and instead began to speak to a pair of officer caste aliens who flanked him. Strangely, the alien leader's dialect changed and Watson's translation program couldn't figure out was being said. The officers gestured around and other aliens began to move. \"Sir, there's something wrong here,\" Watson said in a low voice to Senator Sharpe. \"I can't translate what they're saying. They're using a different tongue.\" Sharpe froze, unsure what to do as several walking guns and dozens of infantry caste aliens came rushing out of hiding. Back at the area headquarters General Daily watched the situation live on CNN plus their own camera via the orbiting helicopter. Instantly he knew it was going bad. \"Get them out of there!\" he yelled, sensing an ambush. \"Get that gunship online and cover the withdrawal.\" The order was given too late. The Apache helicopter exploded in the air, hit by a hidden missile battery followed in short order by the destruction of the two transport choppers. Alien machine gun fire erupted and in a matter of seconds Sharpe's entire guard was down, leaving only the reporters and the Senator with his civilian aides and Lt. Watson. \"Shut down that news feed,\" Daily ordered, watching the scene, \"kill the broadcast.\" Again, too late, the CNN editor in New York was frozen and so the scene went out across the nation. \"You, insect, who dare defile our sacred tongue with your machines,\" Bizripp spat out at the terrified programmer through the translator, \"pay for your insult.\" The alien commander raised his arm and two infantry caste aliens executed Watson at point blank range, causing his head to explode like a pumpkin. \"I don't understand,\" Gary Sharpe stammered, as he watched a long, narrow sword come extending from the alien commander's right forearm, \"we had an agreement. We were to talk about peace.\" \"This is how we make peace,\" Bizripp replied with a sneer on his ugly face, ramming the sword into the chest of the surprised senator whose eyes went wide in disbelief as the life left them.[Chapter 19] Chapter 19 – Pledges The broadcast of the attack at the much-anticipated peace meeting created panic across the country. The video footage of the brazen ambush of Senator Sharpe's party had a ripple effect sweeping through the nation. Debate raged over the internet on what to do with many pushing to find peace before man was totally annihilated. Pressure mounted on the president and government to do something, to negotiate. The only problem was the man who had figured out how to communicate with the aliens died in the attack. In fact the death of Richard Watson and destruction of his translation equipment had been something the alien leader seemed to make a point out of. Already others were being tasked with trying to figure out ways of communicating with the aliens. While some prominent civic leaders began to preach a policy of appeasement others became more strident pushing a win-at-all-costs strategy. As a result of one broadcast America had become a nation polarized. The threat of battle within seemed a greater threat to the stability of the country then the attack of the aliens which had limited success beyond coastal areas. Indeed, other then in Norfolk Virginia none of the assaults had penetrated beyond the initial city attacked. Yet in the inland of the country groups of armed citizens were on patrol looking for alien invaders. Mistaken gun battles had already happened in Omaha Nebraska and Louisville Kentucky as rival parties mistook each other for aliens and opened fire. America stood on a razor's edge. It was a dark time, darker then it needed to be since the destruction of the new alien command-and-control center in LA had given the advantage back to the human forces attempting liberate the city. Coupled with gains made in other centers under assault in the United States progress looked good. In addition, around the world the lessons learned in LA had been paying off dividends. The Chinese had fought back with ferocity, making significant gains to reclaim their homeland and even co-operating with the Japanese to free their country. In London, English forces had completely destroyed the alien attackers with two members of the British Royal family in the thick of action. With Prince William flying an attack helicopter and Prince Harry leading a tank squadron the English people rallied, much like they'd done in World War 2, and threw the invaders, literally, into the sea. Yes, there was much to celebrate. It seemed to be a worthy sacrifice of one Marine staff sergeant, an Air Force tech specialist and a squad of soldiers. Other then at the battalion headquarters of the 2-5 Marines and with the devastated Michele and Hector who were in shock at Mike's demise the country celebrated as word of the brave soldiers sacrifice in LA became a public relations tool to try to calm the panicked population. But even that was deceiving, much like the grounds for the panic going on across America. [Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA] Michele felt numb, that was the only way she could describe her feelings. Numb, worse still, she felt as if she were spiraling down, like grains of sand flowing through an hour glass. She'd been angry with Mike. Why she didn't even remember now, but she'd wanted to hold onto it, like some sort of game. She'd wanted to nurse it, like a martini at a cocktail lounge; she wanted to make him suffer a little. Not a lot, she wasn't that type of person, but she did want him to know that what he'd done wasn't acceptable. Now he was gone. A fresh wave of emotion came crashing over her, almost taking her breath away. The priest, Father Alexander, and Mike's friend, 1st Sergeant Roy, had been very kind. They'd sat with her as she wept, then sat with her as she went silent, they continued to sit with her as she raged at the injustice of what had happened. Somewhere in the recesses of her mind she knew this was the 'process of grieving'. It must have come from her textbooks in psych class during med school. The source didn't matter. The logic of it didn't matter. She now resided in a pit of misery and wondered how she'd ever feel again. Then there was Hector. Michele had asked the two Marines to accompany her to tell Hector. They readily agreed so drove her to the place where he lived in with his aunt. She could swear the hard-faced Latino woman smiled when she broke the news. Hector had been heartbroken and ran out of the temporary house to get away. Father Alexander, an avid runner, had followed and talked to the boy for an hour before they returned. Michele, the sergeant, and Hector's aunt sat in silence the whole time. Finally the boy returned, eyes red and puffy but under control. Michele had pledged to stay in touch, to do whatever would help him overcome this devastating news. To lose a father, then a father-figure in such a short time was too much for the boy. Already he seemed to be slipping into a catatonic state. Michele's heart broke anew. She cursed the war, cursed the aliens for invading, and cursed fate for allowing her to feel so she could only be hurt. Hector's aunt had thanked her for the concern but also made it very clear that his destiny lay in the hard woman's hands. Now Michele was alone with her thoughts, alone in the hustle and bustle of people around her. The two Marines had returned their duties; she'd not hear from Hector, his sister wouldn't return her text messages. She had no one. She wished she could do it over again, tell him she loved him, tried to understand, understand the pressure he was under. Then at least he could have passed from this life to the next knowing where he stood with her. If she could only do it over again, she'd do it differently. She'd be less concerned about her needs, her insecurities and focus on him. She'd look more to correct her faults then point out his. She'd be a different woman, the kind that a man who'd been deeply hurt and seen so much could not only love but trust. If only. But not now. Now, her constant companions were misery and guilt. They, unfortunately, were very attentive, and she found herself falling deeper into despair. [Somewhere in Culver City, LA] The first thing Mike realized was the intense ringing in his ears. Next was the feeling of being buried. Initially he was sure he was dead. The blast had been immense, bigger then the last time and he'd had no time to get out of the way, sending the other men in his patrol to cover and standing alone guarding the rear. The blast had been an orange volcano then everything had gone black. Now Mike remembered, he had to be dead. But then he felt intense pain, and pressure all over his body. The Marine sergeant wasn't dead; he was buried under debris, suffocating to death. He wished he was rather then face this prospect. They'd fulfilled their mission. The alien command hive was gone. Mike hoped it made a difference. Then he thought of Michele and how things had ended. He chided himself for being a fool, allowing his pride and emotions to get the better of him. And now he was going to die and not be able to tell her he really did love her. Idiot , he cursed himself. Then there was Hector. A thought had been percolating in Mike's mind before this mission, one that seemed crazy but had caused him great joy as he thought about it. Now that wouldn't happen either. Oh God, if you get me out of this I will never hesitate again, I'll let down my shield and really live , he prayed hopelessly. Then he heard it. \"Staffs! Can you hear me? Staff Sergeant Nantz!\" came the muffled cries from outside the pile. \"I'm in here! Get me out, his mind screamed in reply, desperate now to be free but it came out only as a grunt. It was enough. The sound of intense digging gave him encouragement. \"Hang on, we're coming for you.\" It only took a few minutes it turned out to remove the debris from Mike. The burly Marine was fortunate that several large slabs of the building that had collapsed on him formed a bit of a teepee and carried the bulk of the load. He'd been buried only by the lighter concrete, the heavier fortunately missing him. Mike felt hands pulling him out. His eyes involuntarily closed at the bright light after being in the dark. \"You okay Staffs?' Lockett asked, concern etched on his face. Imlay handed him a canteen. \"Here, take some water.\" The sound of sporadic small arms fire caught his attention. \"What's going on?\" Mike croaked, pushing Doc Adukwu away. \"Squids are coming back,\" Lockett reported, looking over his shoulder nervously. \"We got to get out of here,\" Mike declared. \"No way. You're down, Harris is hurt bad and Santos has a busted ankle,\" Imlay reported. \"We got pasted by the blast. So we're going to hunker down here and call for evac.\" \"They'll never make it in the time,\" Mike argued. \"Squids'll be all over us. We need to move. Disengage, find some cover then look for extraction.\" \"It'll be too hard with the wounded. We can't do it.\" \"Leave me behind,\" Harris said weakly lying off to the side. \"I'm not going to make in anyway. I'll just slow us down.\" Lockett and Imlay looked away, not wanting to validate the statement. Doc worked away, not looking at anyone either. \"No way,\" Mike declared weakly though with convictions, his faculties suddenly razor sharp at the realization of what was being proposed. \"We all get out or no one gets out. No one gets left behind.\" The two Marines smiled in relief at the decision. They fist bumped each other then Lockett shot out, \"all right, let's get it done.\" Imlay nodded his head in agreement. \"Marines, prepare to move.\" \"Santos, you okay to walk on that?\" Mike asked the Latino Air Force sergeant. \"I've had worse injuries fighting off drunks at the sergeant's club,\" she grimaced. \"Don't worry about me, I can keep up. What about you?\" she countered with a grin, \"You look like crap.\" Mike laughed and tears streamed down his cheeks at the release. \"I guess I probably do. I'm glad there's no mirror around. Anyway, I'm alive and I've got an appointment to keep so let's get out of here.\" Though the aliens were still unorganized due to the destruction of their command element, they still had superior numbers so seemed to want to extract revenge on the destroyers of their key asset. They pressed in; confident they could overwhelm the staggered humans who had been in the blast radius. Only sporadic fire came from their position in a collapsed building so it would be easy. Then a half-dozen grenades flew out of the defensive position and the aliens had to change their position. A series of explosions from the HE grenades shredded the alien troops advancing in the front causing the others behind to scramble for cover. Lockett and Petrie popped up and began to move the opposite way, into a mass of destroyed buildings near the site of their stand. Imlay opened fire with the SAW while Chavez threw another grenade for good measure then added fire with his M4. The determined stand by the pair of Marines checked the leaderless aliens who hesitated allowing the wounded soldiers to fall back with the assistance of Doc Adukwu. Lockett and Petrie laid down their own base of fire allowing Imlay and Chavez to fall back in good order and rejoin the wounded. The pair then scrambled another bound while Lockett and Petrie now provided rear guard fire. The wounded moved again and the process repeated. \"Leave me behind,\" Harris rasped out, \"I'm slowing you down. I don't want to get you all killed.\" \"Shut your mouth Marine or I'll kill you myself,\" Mike growled, \"we're getting you out of here. You and everyone else. We're all going to get home.\" The aliens were slow to press in and then when they did their lead elements were torn apart. The disciplined fire control of the Marines who then fell into the classic pair's fire-and-movement strategy was a thing of beauty. All were completely focused on protecting the group and especially their wounded comrades. Several times Mike wanted to stop as he helped carry Harris to safety and fire his M4 but each time someone else eliminated the threat first. Both Imlay and Chavez were hit but each carried on, none would stop. Each supported the other. They truly were a fearsome team. Mike was never prouder to be a Marine. Though the alien fire was ragged compared to that of the Marines, the invaders had the advantage of numbers and reinforcements. More and more infantry caste surged into the area and several times the humans seemed to be totally blocked. But each time the disciple and dogged determination of the remnant of the team kept them going. But this point no orders needed to be given. A symmetry existed within the group, it almost seemed like a dance of fire and movement took over. Though grenades crashed in and machine gun rounds screamed all around, the soldiers kept moving steadily away from the blast area, exacting a heavy toll the whole way. Then, as if nothing had happened, they were free of contact. None knew if the aliens had given up or if they'd just sucked the fight out of them but one moment the firing was heavy, next it had evaporated. The Marines didn't take the time to ponder what had happened. They kept pressing on, picking up the pace to try to move to safety. Each bound took them further away and still the pursuit hadn't been picked up. \"How's Harris?\" Mike gasped out to Doc Adukwu, the exertion and his own injuries catching up. The medic did a quick check on the now unconscious corporal then replied in his thick African voice, \"Not good Staff Sergeant. We need to stop soon so I can stabilize him. If not, we might lose him.\" \"Okay, then we stop because I'm not going to let that happen. Imlay, Lockett, on me.\" Mike watched the pair move towards him as the others set up a defensive perimeter. Both looked bad themselves. Lockett had a shrapnel wound on his cheek that bled openly. Imlay had lost part of his ear and a lot of hair had been burned off with a close call with a grenade. Yet each stood tall, ready to do what was needed to see the rest of them get out. \"We need to lay low and let Harris get some treatment,\" Mike declared, catching his breath. \"What are our options?\" \"No troubles Staff Sergeant,\" Lockett responded without missing a beat. \"We're good to go and can hold the squids as long as need be. We're not losing my boy.\" \"Roger that,\" Imlay agreed. \"There's a good spot about 150 meters to our right,\" he pointed out. \"We can lay up there, defend it easy plus it's got some good exit points. Just like home,\" he added with a grin. \"Outstanding,\" Mike agreed. \"Let's get it done.\" The group moved swiftly and set up as best they could while doc worked feverishly on Harris. Tension was high, thick enough to cut, but after 45 minutes they began to ease off as no sight or sound of alien pursuit came about. For whatever reason, they'd given up the fight. With night setting in, Mike began to think they might just get out of this. The evening passed without incident, it seemed as calm as an exercise back at Camp Pendleton. Harris' condition improved so now it became time to thing about calling for help. Mike poured over his map, looking for the right spot and calculating the time it would take to get there. The aliens could still pick up their transmissions, he assumed, so it needed to be a tight and focused call. With several hours to go before first light he had a plan. If it worked, they'd be out of Culver City before the sun came up, just in time for breakfast. Mike ordered Petrie to set up the radio while the others waited, tension renewed. None had expected to make it to this point. None had been willing to abandon their comrades so each had been willing to die, but now it seemed like they might make it out. More then one began to pray. \"Juggernaught Actual this is Foxtrot 2 November,\" Mike called into the microphone. \"We are alive and request immediate extraction and medical evac.\"[Chapter 20] Chapter 20 - no disrespect intended \"Get Colonel Ritchie! We got 'em. They're alive,\" the duty officer called to an orderly after receiving the call for help from Mike's team. A cheer went up from the headquarters. The battalion commander came charging in wearing a tee shirt and shorts a couple minutes later. No one bothered about the casual attire. \"Do you have their location?\" he yelled. \"Yes sir!\" the young lieutenant confirmed. \"We've got it.\" \"Okay. I want a bird with medics up now,\" LCol Ritchie ordered. \"Plus get them full gunship cover and I want Air Force on station to support the extraction if needed.\" \"We're on it sir,\" the officer responded briskly pointing to several signalers waiting for order. \"Good. Get it done. I want our people home,\" the commanding officer declared, \"all of them. And also send a message up to area headquarters. General Daily is going to want to know this too.\" In less then ninety minutes what had seemed impossible had become a reality. A Blackhawk helicopter from the Night Stalkers landed at the battalion headquarters flanked by a pair of Apaches, missiles bristling. Several medics and two doctors rushed to the transport helicopter even before the rotors had stopped turning to attend to the wounded Marines. Corporal Harris was already on a stretcher so he was moved first. Petrie had an abdominal wound which turned out to be more serious then it seemed once the adrenaline stopped pumping so he went next. Santos followed then finally the walking wounded were taken to the field hospital attached to the 2-5's staging area. Though sore from getting buried in the blast Mike felt pretty good. Despite losing Pte. Allen he'd brought everyone else out. The initial assessment on Harris was he was going to make it too. They'd succeeded in their mission, the helicopter pilot had personally thanked him on the way back for destroying the alien command pod, so he had that to feel good about too. Then he remembered the pledge he'd made to God under the pile of rubble. It had seemed a bit cavalier at the time, especially when he figured he wouldn't make it out, but strangely the recollection gave him a sense of peace rather then stress like he'd expected. It seems he had some promises to fulfill though he wasn't sure when he'd get the chance. LCol Ritchie's presence reminded him of that. \"Outstanding job Staff Sergeant!\" the commanding officer commended him, charging over to shake his hand. \"You and your team really pulled us out of the fire. We're already making some great headway thanks to your efforts. I need to talk to you ASAP and do a debrief but I want you to get checked out by the docs and get some chow first. God knows you deserve it. Once you and your team are sorted out I'd like to thank you all.\" Mike followed a nurse, as if on autopilot, into the hospital. He sat down on a cot as a doctor began to look him over. He answered some questions that he couldn't remember even if he had tried, everything coming out automatically. He was told that other then some bruising he seemed okay but to take it easy for at least 48 hours. The medical professionals then left him, moving on to another patient. \"Michael!\" He looked up to see Father Alexander coming towards him, a huge grin on his face. \"Good to see you…,\" Mike tried to greet the man but the priest enveloped him in a bear hug, causing the Marine to wince and the nurse to issue the clergyman a sharp rebuke. \"I'm sorry for that,\" Father Alexander apologized, wiping a tear from his eye. \"I just thought you were…I prayed that you'd…\" his voice dropped. Mike was touched by the honest emotion from the humble priest. \"Thanks, that means a lot.\" \"It's a miracle, praise God. I prayed for this, but didn't…,\" the man's voice choked. \"I'm so glad you made it out. A lots gone on the past couple of days and there's some things we need to talk about. But first, there are two people who will want to know you're okay.\" A look of horror registered on Mike's face as he realized what he meant. \"Oh man, Michele, Hector…they didn't find out did they?\" \"Yes, they did. 1st Sergeant Roy and I told them when we thought you were lost,\" the priest admitted, avoiding Mike's eyes. \"I'm…I'm sorry. I never meant to…\" \"It's okay Father Alexander. You did the right thing, everything considered,\" Mike released the man from his anguish. \"But how can we let them know?\" Father Alexander pulled out his cell phone and began to tap out a text message to Michele. Mike looked at him in surprise. \"Hey, isn't that type of communications a security violation?\" The priest grinned back at the Marine sheepishly. \"It's better to ask for forgiveness then permission.\" Mike laughed in relief, tension draining out of his body knowing the anguish Michele and Hector had been going through would end soon. \"Drat! I lost the signal,\" the priest announced. \"Maybe its God giving me a message, huh? Let's go outside and try it there.\" Father Alexander helped Mike to his feet and the pair walked towards the exit. \"Listen, I might not be the one who should tell you this but there's something you should know about so you're prepared,\" the priest mentioned as they opened the door outside. \"There he is!\" someone yelled and in an instant Mike was surrounded by a crush of reporters. \"How does it fell to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor?\" \"What are your thoughts on what this means?\" \"Is it true you're going to Washington to receive it from the president?\" \"What impact does this have on the war effort?\" Reporters peppered a stunned Mike with questions. Microphones and cameras pressed in at him from all directions. He stood there with his mouth open, not able to comprehend what was happening. \"Please…please, give the man some room. He's just come off the line and been injured,\" Father Alexander pleaded to the surging reporters to no avail. \"All of you, back off!\" a voice boomed above the crowd. \"This is a restricted area. Get away and leave him be.\" 1st Sergeant Roy came running into the fray, shoving reporters out of the way to get to Mike. To emphasize his point a half dozen Marines trailed in the wake behind him and more poured into the area to regain control. The reporters wisely backed off after one look at the agitated NCO. A thin Army Captain trotted over. \"So sorry about this 1st Sergeant. A little miscommunication on my part.\" \"Get them out of here sir, right now,\" Roy demanded, face red with rage. \"He doesn't even know yet.\" \"What?\" the Public Affairs officer started. \"Oh, okay. Leave it to me.\" The officer smoothly interjected and began herding the reporters to another area of the base while edgy Marines stood ready to pounce on any who mis-stepped. \"What's this all about John?\" Mike asked his friend in confusion. \"What's going on?\" \"Come on, I need to talk to you,\" he motioned Mike away from the group. \"Why don't you come too,\" he added to Father Alexander. \"What's this about a medal?\" Mike demanded, his faculties coming back to him. \"Listen, the colonel was going to tell you himself but he wanted you to get checked out first. That Public Affairs weenie jumped the gun. Sorry about that.\" \"But what's this about the CMH?\" Mike raised his voice in growing agitation. \"Message came down from the Pentagon yesterday,\" Roy reported. \"The president has authorized the Congressional Medal of Honor for your actions at the Robinson off ramp and the destruction of the first alien C-and-C asset back in August.\" \"What? That's impossible,\" Mike shook his head in disbelief. \"Every guy deserves a medal for that, especially Lt. Martinez. There has to be some sort of mistake.\" \"There's no mistake Mike. I saw the message myself,\" the barrel-chested Marine confirmed. \"We kept it quiet when we thought you were lost until the brass figured out what to do. But when we found out you guys were okay, well, the word must have leaked out.\" He looked accusingly at the Public Affairs officer but said nothing more. \"I don't want it,\" Mike responded bluntly. \"I don't deserve it and I'm sure as hell not going to take it over the other guys.\" He folded his arms defensively. \"I won't accept it.\" \"You sure about this Mike?\" 1Sgt Roy asked. \"I can't do it John, it's just not right,\" Mike doggedly replied. \"Well, I understand where you're coming from and commend your sense of duty\" his friend agreed, \"but the brass is going to have a fit over this. You better go in and see the boss.\" 1st Sergeant Roy escorted Mike to the colonel's office in the battalion headquarters. The middle-aged Marine officer greeted the pair warmly until Roy explained to the man the purpose for them being there. \"Who in the hell do you think you are?\" LCol Ritchie exploded, his eyes flashing. \"You don't refuse the CMH and you sure as hell don't refuse the President of the United States.\" \"With all due respect sir…\" \"Cut the crap Staff Sergeant,\" LCol Ritchie cut him off, in no mood for pleasantries. \"What's this all about?\" \"Sir, its not that I'm ungrateful for this, I am. It's a great honor…but if anyone deserved to be recognized for what we did out there its 2Lt Martinez. If he hadn't blown that C4 we'd never have gotten off the I10 and we'd all be history. Or it could go to Lance Corporal Domingez. If he hadn't exposed himself to warn us the squids C-and-C unit would still be up. Either of them should get it, not me.\" \"Hm,\" the career soldier ran his hands through his close cropped salt and pepper hair. \"I respect that Staff Sergeant, I really do. It takes a big man to make that kind of statement but it doesn't wash.\" \"Why not?\" \"Don't you get it?\" the senior commander exploded anew. \"This country needs live heroes not dead ones! We're hanging on by a thread here and people need to know there's still some hope. They need people to pin that hope on.\" \"Me?\" \"You.\" \"Well I still don't want it,\" Mike stated belligerently though his resolved seemed shaky. \"Well you have no choice Staff Sergeant Nantz so you better cowboy up and do it for the Corp.\" Outside the battalion HQ while the discussion raged on, the story was already getting out to some of the members of Mike's team. \"He turned it down?\" Lockett asked Santos in surprise after her report of the staff sergeant's refusal. \"He said no to the CMH?\" \"He did,\" the Air Force tech sergeant confirmed, leaning on crutches to support her broken leg. \"No way,\" Imlay interjected. \"I don't believe it, not even about him. No one is that stupid.\" \"I was there man,\" she confirmed. \"I was giving my report at the BHQ when he walks in with the 1st Sergeant and tells the colonel. Well the guy goes ballistic. I think he's going to have a brain aneurism and croak. But the staff sergeant won't back down. They want to take him to Washington and everything but flat out says no.\" \"Unbelievable,\" Lockett shook his head. \"Well, good for him. He's got more guts then me. I'd never say no.\" He then paused as something caught his attention. \"I think things are going to get a little more interesting,\" the African-American corporal observed, pointing to an armored convoy escorting a Humvee with a flag flying three stars pulling into the compound. Inside the headquarters an orderly knocked loudly on the office door to get the attention of the still-yelling officer. \"Colonel? General Daily is here,\" the staff member reported, though he was loath to interrupt his commanding officer, especially when he was chewing someone out. Ritchie looked at Mike with a raised eyebrow. \"Why don't you tell the general you don't want it since he's coming to congratulate you?\" Mike sighed, feeling the weight on his shoulder's growing. This was wrong, all wrong. But what choice did he have? He didn't want to look ungrateful or arrogant but he didn't deserve it. Listen, Staff Sergeant…Mike,\" Ritchie softened. \"I can imagine how you feel. They didn't make it out, you did. Plus, a CMH comes with a lot of expectation and baggage.\" Mike lowered his head to avoid the older man's stare, nodding his head slowly in agreement. He knew the reality of what was being told to him and what needed to be done, confirming the colonel's suspicion. \"You can't turn it down, it's not right,\" LCol Ritchie reasoned in a low voice. \"Do it for the guys who won't get it and deserve it. Then do everything you can to make sure their memories are honored.\" Mike absently rubbed the cleft in his chin, understanding the reality of his situation and why he had to do it. \"You're right sir,\" he agreed quietly. \"I'm sorry if I sounded ungrateful. I'm not. I'm honored. It's just…it just kind of was sprang on me. I never thought something like this would ever happen to me. I'm no hero. I'm just doing my job.\" \"I understand son,\" the colonel moved closer and patted him on the shoulder. \"I heard what happened and that was wrong. If you think I chewed you out wait until I get a hold of that PAFFO.\" Mike chuckled, a sense of relief at his decision coming over him. Then he began to look at the situation differently. \"Maybe I can give them a voice and tell their story. Let's go and see the general so I can tell him how pleased I am to be honored this way.\" \"Good man,\" Daily clapped him on the shoulder and they left the private office to begin a new level of complication. [Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA] Michele wandered aimlessly towards the rec center near the hospital. She'd completed her rounds automatically not even sure what she'd said or done. The life had gone out of her, like the air being let out of a balloon. Though busy, the woman felt she had no purpose, no future. Where once she'd had some exciting plans, despite the war, now there seemed to be only darkness. Her Blackberry chirped its annoyingly cheerful tone to announce she had a text message come in. Probably from my sister , she thought, it's about time . She absently pulled out the sleek slate grey device and looked at the screen. Alexander McNair. Who's that? She wondered. Then it hit her. He was the priest who had told her about Mike, the one who despite being so kind had devastated her life. It wasn't his fault, she should feel guilty for the ill feelings she had towards him but couldn't get up the energy . He's likely checking in on me , she surmised. Looking coldly down at the message, her heart nearly exploded at what she saw: Praise God! Michael is alive. His team just got out this morning. I can't tell you more right now but wanted you to know the good news. More to come when I can. Mike, alive? Michele's heart raced. Could this be? Was she dreaming? \"Michele! Come quick!\" A nurse she knew from the hospital who had sat with her as she cried at the news was urgently waving her towards the rec center. \"Come on! You've got to see this. Your boyfriend is on TV!\" The words hit her like a javelin. Not even registering the 'boyfriend' comment she ran as fast as she could, taking the three steps up into the building in one bound. A TV hung from the wall in a corner and it seemed to be tuned to a news broadcast. A group of people stood around looking up at the report fixated by what was going on. She stopped dead in her tracks, the nurse who had been trailing behind crashed into her it had been so sudden. Mike was in the center of the screen flanked by a husky African American officer wearing general stars and a tall, thin man in a suit who was talking. The words, which rang clear in the building, caused her to start. \"…..pleased to announce on behalf of the president that Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz of the 2nd Battalion 5th Marines is to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism in the face of the enemy in August. He will be presented the medal at a ceremony at the White House as soon as it can be arranged….\" Michele tuned the rest of the speech out, her head reeling. Not only was Mike alive but now he was a genuine hero, being awarded the country's highest honor. What did it mean for her? For them? After their last time together, would he even want to see her again? The moment of elation she'd had at the priest's text now seemed to drain away in the anxiety of the unknown, like an enemy opening a new front.[Chapter 21] CHAPTER 21- Reluctant hero \"I'm no hero,\" Mike said uncomfortably yet firmly into the camera. \"Heroes are guys like Lt. William Martinez, Lance Corporal Julio Domingez and Pte. Kearns. They all gave their lives for this cause and we'd be sunk if not for their sacrifices.\" His voice became stronger as conviction built. \"It was my privilege to serve with them and it's their stories I want to tell.\" \"That's great Staff Sergeant Nantz,\" the civilian wearing a tailored Hugo Boss suit interjected. \"Your humility certainly does you credit.\" He then turned to the collected group of reporters keeping himself between them and Mike. \"That's all for now but be sure once he's had a chance to rest they're be more opportunities for interviews. My office will have full press schedules and ensure the access that you want.\" The man took Mike by the elbow and moved him into an adjacent building. Todd Brooker had flown in from Washington to take control of the public relations coverage of the new hero. A top reporter for NBC before being tapped to join the White House press office, the man was connected and knew what buttons to push to get the coverage needed. He'd been given the job of maximizing the exposure of this medal building goodwill and also political capital as quickly as possible. \"Well done staff sergeant,\" Brooker said with a broad smile. \"You did great. In a week you'll be ready for your own talk show.\" Mike grimaced, not realizing the gregarious man was joking. \"When can I get back to my unit sir?\" he asked the general, ignoring the man from the White House. \"Pardon?\" Brooker responded, as if he hadn't heard the question properly. \"When can I get back in the fight,\" Mike repeated. \"Good one staff sergeant, that's funny,\" Brooker chuckled at the serious question. \"You have far more important things to do now and you are way too valuable to be anywhere near the front.\" \"What?\" Mike exploded, \"No way. No way you're taking me out of the game.\" \"That's not really your choice Marine,\" the White House man answered coldly. \"Listen, everyone just calm down,\" General Daily interjected. \"Staff sergeant, go to the mess hall and get some chow. Make sure your people are all squared away then we'll talk. Dismissed.\" \"But,\" Brooker tried to counter. \"Mr. Brooker, you and I need to have a talk,\" the general said easily but firmly. Mike left as quickly as he could, ignoring the look from 1st Sergeant Roy and the calls from several lingering reporters. Walking towards the mess hall several soldiers called out congratulations to him which made him feel uncomfortable. He saw Imlay, Lockett and Santos lingering around so steered over to where they were. \"Guys, I want you to know that all of this stuff is none of my doing,\" Mike began to explain before he'd even reached them... Realizing he was there, Lockett cut him off, \"Hey, way to go Staffs!\" \"Yea, congratulations staff sergeant,\" Imlay added, \"about time the weenies in Washington got something right.\" \"You're not mad about this?\" Mike exclaimed in surprise. \"Mad? Why would we be?\" Santos asked, taken aback. \"Because all of you deserve a medal. The guys we lost…I mean…\" \"You got us through all this, you made it happen. You deserve it,\" Imlay countered. \"Straight up,\" Lockett agreed with a grin, the sun catching his gold tooth. Mike was genuinely confused but also appreciated their vote of confidence. He loved these people for it. \"Thanks guys. That means a lot. I never wanted it but…\" \"But you'll do the Corps proud and us too staff sergeant,\" Santos cut him off. \"Come on, let me buy you guys a beer before I get shipped back to the rear,\" she added. Mike looked at her with disappointment, seeing the cast on her leg and realizing what that meant. The perceptive Latino Air Force sergeant caught the look and chuckled. \"Ah, don't worry about it. I need to get back to the rear anyway. Now that I'm famous I have a certain captain I need to be a pain in the ass to.\" Mike started laughing and couldn't stop, his sides beginning to hurt. Though the joke wasn't all that funny the release of tension and knowing his team wasn't mad at him gave him the sense of relief he desperately needed. Two hours later he stood in LCol Ritchie's office with his CO and also General Dailey. The pair of senior officers prepared for a conflict of wills with the stubborn Marine but found him more reflective after the time he'd spent with his team. \"You need to do this staff sergeant, for the good of the Corps and the good of the country,\" General Daily reasoned with him. \"I know it's a hard thing to ask. No sergeant worth his stripes would want this kind of dog-and-pony show. But we need this, the country needs this. It's an important assignment.\" Ritchie opened his mouth to echo the words but Mike cut him off. \"I understand sir. I'm sorry if I sounded belligerent before. I am honored. I just needed some time to think about it.\" \"So you're on board then?\" the colonel asked to confirm. \"Yes sir, I am,\" Mike answered to the obvious relief of the officers. Neither had wanted to force the man to do it. \"I only have a couple of things I'd like in return.\" \"Name them,\" General Daily replied carefully. \"I want you to promise me once I've done my tour and rallied the people I can come back and finish this if it's still going on. I want to be back in the 2-5 and I want to be on the front.\" \"Well we'll have to see staff sergeant,\" LCol Ritchie began hesitantly. \"The man from the White House sees you as a pretty valuable asset and not one he's likely going to allow into harms way. I'm not sure about that.\" \"I am,\" General Daily cut him off. \"That's a fair request and it does you credit. Yes, I can make sure that happens.\" \"But sir, what about Mr. Brooker? He'll have a fit over this,\" Ritchie protested. The stocky African American commander chuckled. \"That makes it an even easier decision. I'll make sure you get back to the front. Anything else?\" \"Yes general. I need to talk to someone in the rear area. I'd like the chance to do that before I ship out.\" \"Done. I'll arrange a helo but I want you back by 1800hrs,\" General Ritchie agreed. \"Thanks for this staff sergeant. I won't forget it.\" Less then two hours later Mike arrived at the refugee city with a sense of anticipation. A plan had been forming in his mind and excitement mingled with nervousness began to build. An hour later frustration gave way as he couldn't accomplish what he'd set out to do and he watched the time ticking away. He had wanted to see Michele then go see Hector together. She wasn't at her room nor was she at the hospital. He'd been given several leads but none panned out. Each place he went to she wasn't. What had originally seemed like a simple thing turned complex. He'd been hoping to have a 'moment' with her before going on the tour he didn't want to. Most importantly, he wanted her to be clear on how he felt and ensure there was no lingering miscommunication. `Frustration began to build giving way eventually to a growing panic. What if he didn't find her? What if her attitude had changed? What if he was off base about her feelings and setting himself up for another fall? Doubt began to build, lingering fears Mike thoughts he'd eradicated slithered in. He needed to talk to her. Out of options he cruised around the encampment hoping to see her all the time watching his time evaporate. The idea of seeing Hector became moot. He'd spent too much time trying to find Michele so the chance to go to the other side of the sprawling refugee city had passed. Mike wasn't the only one watching the clock. The young Marine driving him at first subtly checked the time but then as the hour for their return to base came and passed he began to be more overt about it. Mike ignored the hint, hoping for a miracle. It didn't come. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, we need to be getting going,\" his driver finally informed him apologetically, stating the obvious. \"I got a call from the General's aide that we need to be back to the staging area on time and ready to roll.\" Mike wondered what to do. He heart said stay but his sense of duty overruled that. Reluctantly he signaled to the soldier only doing his duty to take him to the already warming up helicopter. Mike went like a man with a heavy burden, the little excitement he'd had at the opportunity the tour presented gone. Michele saw the Humvee drive past her but didn't see who was inside. Too late she returned to her billet. She'd decided to get away from everything going on so had gone out to the desert to clear her head. When she heard Mike had been there looking for her confusion reined rather then assurance. Why had he come? Why couldn't he stay? Had he come to say goodbye? The man was a hero now, a man in demand. Why would he be interested in a messed-up woman who wasn't willing to stake a claim to his affections? A chill overcame the woman despite the warm fall day. Things had gone from bad to worse it seemed for the couple. At 1800hrs, as promised, Mike returned to the 2-5 operating area and faced a full news conference set up by Todd Brooker. It went well but his sense of anticipation had been quelled. Afterwards, he'd been given orders to prepare to leave with the man from Washington and several Public Affairs officers. The prospect of traveling with this group didn't help. Packing in his tent, Mike felt like a man preparing for exile. Unsure what to do, anxious about the unfamiliar territory he was going in, certain he would fail at this, make things worse and dishonor those he hoped to speak for, Mike had a heavy heart. He didn't know what to do so in desperation he prayed. \"Knock, knock,\" a voice came from outside. Mike was startled by how quickly an answer seemed to arrive. Father Alexander stuck his head in the flap. \"I hope I'm not interrupting you Michael,\" the priest said. \"No, actually your timing is perfect,\" Mike replied in a bit of shock at the unexpected turn. \"You look like a man going to the chair rather then a hero who's about to be wined and dined across the country,\" Father Alexander chuckled. \"You know I don't want that,\" Mike shot back blackly. \"I know; I'm sorry. I shouldn't jest about that,\" the priest apologized. \"Naw, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped like that.\" \"You look troubled. Is there anything I can do to help?\" \"Yea, you can. I'm ready for this. It's the right thing to do,\" Mike admitted to himself as much as to the clergyman. \"It's just Michele and Hector. I wanted to make things right with her…to tell her how I feel. But I couldn't find her and had to come back. Now I'm leaving in the morning and I don't know when I'll see her next. It's so frustrating.\" The tormented Marine fell silent while the priest looked at him compassionately. The pair sat silently together for several minutes. \"I love her Father,\" Mike suddenly blurted out. \"It's more then that. I'd…I'd like to have a future with her, and Hector too. It's just this war keeps getting in the way of it.\" The priest thought for a moment then his face lit up. \"I'm happy for you Michael.\" The quizzical look on the young man's faced called for an explanation. \"I'm glad that you've found your heart again despite all this. It's been a long, hard journey for you since Amanda left. You deserve this. Why don't you write her a letter? I'll take it to her and we'll leave the rest in God's hands.\" \"I never thought of it that way,\" Mike perked up. \"I've seen the last few years as nothing but pain but maybe…maybe all the destruction has only made my desire to have something different stronger.\" \"Good. Those are good and true feelings,\" the priest encouraged. \"Its sometimes only in our adversity that we can truly see who we are.\" \"Thanks. I appreciate that,\" the Marine responded warmly. \"I don't know what I would do without you. I'll write that letter for her right away.\" Father Alexander clapped him on the back then helped the troubled Marine with his packing, praying silently for him the whole time. On schedule, the following morning Mike flew off on a MV-22 Osprey a letter for Michele written and in the hands of Father Alexander. The seasoned combat veteran had experienced pitched battles in Iraq, Afghanistan and now in the war against the aliens. He'd fought all form of enemy but nothing prepared him for what he experienced. Moving to a staging area for troops and material flowing into the west coast combat areas he was briefed on what to expect. It didn't sound great. It turned out worse. Not comfortable in the spotlight, he began a cross country tour stopping at major urban centers along the way to meet local dignitaries, being interviewed by the local press and generally becoming a poster boy for the war effort. All the time CNN and the other major TV networks plus several large newspapers travelled along with him. By his count there was over 100 people swirling around waiting to broadcast or report his every word and action. The first day he used a particularly pointed profanity to describe the situation in LA and that had led to an hour-long debrief with Todd Brooker on how to properly describe things. Not fun. He began to feel like a raw recruit again. The whole tour was to culminate in his medal ceremony at the White House the end of the week. Mike desperately hoped that once he had the award they'd let him go back to the 2-5. Unfortunately the aliens had a different plan. Three days into the tour they launched a surprise offensive on the east coast in an attempt to break out. Almost an entire army division was decimated in the well-orchestrated and co-coordinated assault. New York City almost fell but a heroic defensive action by a largely National Guard force held them back. As all this transpired alien drones flying cover for ground forces even pushed out towards Washington. Though checked outside the city limits the impact created panic in the capital. Despite protests, the president and most of the cabinet was evacuated by the Secret Service to Philadelphia. With the political machine on its heels things like medals took a back seat. The result was a renewed sense of anxiety for the future of the nation. The people became desperate for good news, for hope. That good news and hope began to rest on the shoulders of Staff Sergeant Mike Nantz. The offensive not only caused the tour to shift inland but led to an increase in frequency and intensity. Large crowds began to come out to listen to Mike's reflections on the conflict as he shared what he and the other soldiers were experiencing. Despite his discomfort with the spotlight, or perhaps because of it, he became an instant celebrity. The simple reports of the combat soldier contrasted with the supposed expert analysts who filled the television talk shows in their tailored suits consistently showing they didn't know what they were talking about. The wisdom and straight forward sense of duty from the Marine began to galvanize the people giving them much needed resolve. Mike hated the attention but began to see the importance of what he was doing. This caused the already conflicted man even more since he desperately wanted to be back in LA doing his part for the fight but seeing the importance of the morale-boosting he was providing. The entourage he travelled with didn't help. The soldiers with him were soldiers in name only. They were bureaucrats in uniforms, none seeing any combat and only interested in optics and presentation. Brooker was extremely focused and tried to tightly control the message. He and Mike clashed frequently as the humble Marine kept trying to tell what he'd seen and experienced rather then the tailored messages he was given each day. It wasn't that Mike was trying to be belligerent. He wasn't. It was just he felt the people wanted to hear what the soldiers on the front line were experiencing. They appreciated hearing of the effort and sacrifice they were making, rather then be spoon-fed a bunch of rah-rah propaganda. One week of this back-and-forth turned into two and despite Brooker's growing frustration with Mike the people of America were captivated by the staff sergeant and his message of bravery and hope found in the American fighting forces. This only increased the already high tension between them. A new conflict was brewing as a result, one for how the war would be presented. Unfortunately this was one Mike wasn't equipped to fight. Despite wanting to go back to the front he began to fear what would happen if he left and this shadowy figure would be allowed to manipulate the message unchecked. Mike finished the second week of the tour preparing to leave for Columbus Ohio, conflicted and lonely.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22 - complication Michele read the note a fourth time, trying not to allow the tears welling freely from her eyes to fall onto it. The letter had been written hastily, as Father Alexander explained, but Mike's thoughts were very clear. He did have feelings for her, strong feelings. He wanted to talk to her, spend time with her, when he got back from his tour. Would she wait for him he'd asked. She would. Her heart began to soar at the possibilities and what the future held. A cloud lifted. She'd do it right this time, no more holding back, no more hesitation. She gave herself over to the quiet but solid Marine totally, the exhilaration of it causing her to giggle like a school girl at a Justin Bieber concert. It felt good. She couldn't wait to hear from him again. [Columbus Convention Centre, Columbus Ohio] Tension grew in Mike as he prepared to leave the ready room that had been set up for him back stage before speaking in the main auditorium. This was to be his second speech of the day in Columbus. The first had gone really well. He'd talked to a combined assembly of several high schools in the city. Brooker had been aggravated though when he'd left out the pitch to join up and fight the aliens. It wasn't that Mike didn't believe in the cause, or didn't want people to join. It was just he didn't want to see himself as a walking recruiting poster. He was there to encourage, perhaps even inspire, but he wouldn't allow his message to be turned into some commercial. Joining the Marines, or any branch of the military, had to come from within. It was a big commitment with tremendous cost at times. There had to be a sense of calling, a desire to serve. Too often he'd see over the year's idealistic young men and women join for the wrong reasons and suffer as a result. He'd seen too many who joined to get a free education or to learn a trade only end up being thrust into the war on terror with disastrous consequences. No, he wasn't going to do that. So he had to endure another lecture about being a 'team player'. Brooker had patronizingly spoke down his nose about him doing his part and allowing those more knowledgeable in these things to do theirs like he as in kindergarten. It made him want to puke but he held his tongue. This event would be different. He was to speak to a group of business leaders at the convention center then do a mix and mingle. His speech would focus on the need for the commerce of America to join in the fight by supporting it and the country financially. Mike was to tell them to continue doing what they were doing, to support the effort by creating jobs, generating tax revenue, blah, blah, blah. He'd given the message before, it wasn't difficult. But something else stirred. For some strange reasons Mike's combat senses had kicked in as he entered the building. They went into high alert as he walked onto the stage to thunderous applause after his introduction by the president of the Columbus Area Chamber of Commerce. As Mike spoke he went onto autopilot, going through the speech without changing it. This pleased Brooker since it had been the first time in three days this happened. Instead Mike scanned for threats, checked his exits, and even opened his stance to balance his weight more effectively, all things he'd done to keep himself alive in combat. Then the speech was over. The chamber president, a heavy-set African American man in an expensive suit, came over and pumped his hand as the crowd rose to its feet in applause. Must have been a good speech , Mike though, too bad I missed it . The Marine felt a bit foolish for reacting the way he did . I must be losing my touch if I'm getting all jumped up in this kind of crowd . Still, he couldn't shake the feeling of an imminent threat. Weird. Brooker beamed as Mike passed, giving him a thumb's up sign. Mike then began the process of being introduced and trying to be the hero everyone thought him to be. This went on for several minutes working through the room as hor dourves and cocktails were served by white-coated waiters. \"Mike, Mike Nantz!\" a female voice called out but was lost in the din of conversation. Mike missed it but Brooker didn't. He saw an attractive, fashionably dressed blonde haired woman trying hard to get the Marine's attention. Wearing a short black skirt with high heels and a tailored suit jacket the woman looked stunning. The former news reporter smelled a great photo op so began to signal the press entourage around him to prep for something significant. He then began to work his way through the crowd to ensure the intersection he sought happened. \"Mike Nantz!\" Mike froze as he heard his name called from the crowd. Things suddenly went very quiet though he'd just been introduced to the president of the Columbus Blue Jackets hockey club. He recognized the voice. It couldn't be. This had to be a mistake, a nightmare perhaps. Mike felt himself begin to perspire. He turned to face it, not realizing his security detail was clearing an area around him. It was Amanda. Flashing a somewhat embarrassed but radiant smile she glided over to the shocked man. Embracing him tightly Mike's ex-wife planted a kiss on his cheek as three dozen cameras went off along with a half-dozen video cameras catching the event. She pulled back though continued to hold onto his arms with her hands. Amanda laughed lightly noticing the lipstick on his cheek which she then wiped away. Mike stood frozen, unsure what to do, his brain unable to process what had just happened so allowed it to crash over him like tsunami. \"Amanda, what are you doing here?\" \"A lot has changed Mike,\" she answered, her eyes fixed on him. \"Can we talk?\" she asked politely. \"I don't know. I mean…,\" Mike stammered, trying to regain his lost equilibrium. Brooker stepped in to ensure the contact continued to roll. \"Sure, that can be arranged. Miss? \"Nantz. Amanda Nantz.\" The press agent smelled a Pulitzer. \"Leave it with me. Thirty minutes and I'll have a room for you two. Mr. Hess,\" he then redirected to the chamber president who'd heard the whole exchange, \"can you arrange this for me?\" \"Anything you need sir,\" the man beamed, thankful for the opportunity to show his stuff with this much press around. He raised his hand and the wheels began to turn. Thirty minutes later Mike sat across from the woman who had nearly destroyed his life. \"What are you doing in Ohio?\" Mike asked, trying to buy time to figure out what was going on. The last half hour had been a disaster. He couldn't concentrate, stumbling over his words and generally making himself look like an idiot in front of the high-powered crowd. The only thing Mike really remembered was agreeing to join the Blue Jackets president for a game in his private box that night. \"I came here about a year ago to run one of my father's plants,\" she answered, her eyes fixed on him. Mike felt like she was trying to drown him in the blue depths but then anger flashed as he remembered what she had done to him. \"And did Bill come with you?\" he shot back testily. \"No, we're not together Mike. It was over long before I came here.\" She dropped her eyes, now she being the uncomfortable one. \"I…I made a mistake Mike…with us. I was wrong…about a lot of things…I'm…I'm sorry.\" Tears welled up in her eyes and began to run freely down her cheeks pulling involuntarily at Mike's heart. \"If there was anything I could do to change it…to make it right….I know I hurt you badly…I was so selfish…so wrong.\" Mike sat in a lounge chair stunned by the profession. He felt as if an anvil had been dropped on him and didn't know what to do. A part of his heart ached but then he remembered that night and what it did to him. Sorry wasn't enough. \"I accept your apology Amanda,\" Mike answered, trying to keep his own voice in check, \"I appreciate that. You did hurt me, deeply. But I've moved on from that. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get going.\" He stood up and walked out, hoping to free himself of the conflicted emotions welling up inside. Brooker, who had watched the exchange, frowned as he watched his story angle evaporate. Despite Mike's reaction, the news went like wildfire across the country. With interest in the Marine already high the identity of the mysterious blonde became one people wanted to know. His went from a story about a military hero to a human interest story thus widening the exposure. In short order the information of Amanda's identity and their past relationship was released. Almost immediately a rumor began to circulate of a possible reconciliation between the estranged couple. Excitement built quickly and exponentially as the news sizzled through the internet and over television as people starved for a story of this nature with Hollywood out of commission sought more information. Before supper time it had played on all the major media outlets with pictures and video being shown and reshown. It even made it back to LA. [Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA] Michele booted up her Toshiba Satellite laptop then opened the internet browser. She was thankful access had been re-established in the past two weeks right around the time another MacDonalds opened in the encampment, giving the guise of an almost return to normalcy. If it weren't for the fact the people were living in plywood constructed buildings people might just get used to it. That and if they travelled to LA and saw the devastation themselves. But people are resilient so a routine, including the internet, seemed to be growing. For Michele this was secondary. After reading Mike's letter she became eager to follow his progress, feeling it gave them a connection of sorts until he returned and they could be together. Todd Brooker's efforts had been successful so finding pictures, articles and videos of his tour were not difficult to access. She knew from the previous day that he'd be in Ohio so looked forward to her time with him as she'd come to consider it, a long distance connection. It had been a particularly difficult day since a batch of casualties had come in from an alien surge. Seeing the suffering of the men holding the line pulled at her heart and reminded her of the reality and suffering going on. Mike's message of heroic sacrifice became that much more important to those not witnessing it. This was no movie, it was real life and she wondered if the media-saturated people of America used to action films and video games would realize this. She put those thoughts away for now, eager to lose herself in Mike's activities. What she saw caused her heart to skip a beat. On the Yahoo homepage in full color was a picture of Mike with a gorgeous blonde hanging on his arm. The blue headline screamed: War Hero battling for ex-wife. Mouth suddenly dry, Michele swallowed hard and read it again, looking hard at the picture. She clicked on the link and read the article. There was little information other then a confirmation that he and his ex-wife had connected at an event in Columbus Ohio. She went to a video link where she watched the encounter between the two. Her heart began to beat so hard she thought it would burst out of her chest. The news commentator enthusiastically reported that rumors were already circulating that Staff Sergeant Nantz and his estranged wife Amanda Nantz were seeking to work towards a reconciliation. Beads of perspiration broke out on her forehead as her hands began to shake. \"And we here at NBC Nightly News wish the two the best. Hopefully something good will come out of all this man's efforts and sacrifices,\" the anchor saluted the pair. Michele ran to the bathroom to throw up. Nationwide Arena, Columbus Ohio \"Please welcome Congressional Medal of Honor winner US Marine Corp Staff Sergeant Mike Nantz,\" the public address announcer's voice boomed through the arena as the Halls of Montezuma began to play through the arena and a spotlight shined to the box where an uncomfortable Mike stood to wave to the cheering crowd. Despite battles raging on each coast in the mid-west life was fairly normal this Tuesday night in October and that included professional sports. The puck dropped to begin the regular season National Hockey League game between the hometown Blue Jackets and the Detroit Red Wings. Mike had never seen a hockey game before so the president of the team explained some of the nuances of the fast-paced event. The Marine found he enjoyed the action as the contest went back and forth. Then he heard the voice again and the night changed for him. Amanda, dressed in tight jeans, high boots and a red leather jacket, not only came into the box but slid into the empty seat beside him, placing a hand on his forearm in a friendly gesture. Mike looked around wildly to try to figure out how this happened spying a beaming Todd Brooker at the back of the box eagerly watching their exchange. The tough solider would have killed the man if he thought he could have gotten away with it. Amanda chattered away like nothing had changed with them while Mike tried to ignore the woman and watch the game. Unknown to him, cameras were snapping pictures of the pair and the news already was going out over the internet. Finally, Mike could stand the charade no longer. \"What are you up to Amanda?' he demanded. \"What do you mean?\" she asked in surprise, her expressive eyes going wide. \"I don't hear from you for years,\" he retorted angrily. \"I don't hear from you since our divorce in fact and only then I heard from your lawyer. Nothing!\" his voice began to rise causing those around him to watch what was going on. \"Then today you show up and pretend like nothing has gone on. You had an affair. You abandoned me for another guy. Another military guy, even though you did nothing but complain about it while we were married.\" \"Mike, I…\" she tried to explain. \"Now you show up here tonight,\" he cut her off, \"and want to hold my hand and touch my arm. What kind of game are you playing?\" \"You're right,\" she agreed quietly, averting his eyes. \"It must seem sudden and forward to you. But I've been thinking about this and praying about it for a long time.\" \"Don't bring God into this,\" Mike demanded, \"because what you did He wouldn't approve of. Even I know that.\" \"You're right again. But there is forgiveness. I was wrong. I hurt you….hurt you badly. I didn't understand a lot of things. I didn't appreciate you the way I should. But this war…\" \"Has made me some kind of hero so now attractive to you, right?\" he sarcastically cut her off. \"No. No Mike it's not that,\" she tried to counter. \"No, I see how hard it is for you, for all of you. Before you were gone someplace else, and wouldn't talk about it. It didn't impact me so I didn't understand.\" \"And now you do?\" \"Yes, I think I do. I have no right to try to work back into your life. But I do want to apologize for what I did, to make it right. But if you'd like me to leave I will and never bother you again.\" Every fiber of Mike's person screamed at him to take her up on the offer that this was a path he didn't want to go down. But something else stirred within him too, something he couldn't put his finger on. \"No, it would be okay if you stayed,\" he responded meekly eliciting a warm hug and radiant smile from the woman. [Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA] Two plus hours had passed since Michele had watched the video. She hadn't moved since, totally immobilized. The nausea had passed but her heart was sick. She didn't know what to do, what to believe. In desperation she picked up her phone to call Mike but didn't have a number for him. Instead she scrolled through her previous calls to find the one she sought then pushed the button. \"Father Alexander?\" she confirmed. \"Michele, is that you?\" the priest asked, afraid of the call since he'd seen the reports also. \"Yes. Do you know what's going on with Mike?\" she asked desperately. \"Why is he with his ex-wife?\" \"I don't know,\" the clergyman answered with pained honesty. \"I'm as surprised as you are.\" \"What about his letter?\" \"Let's not jump to conclusions Michele,\" Father Alexander counseled. \"This could be a chance encounter.\" \"But what about what the media is saying?\" Michele sharply pressed him. \"I wouldn't put a lot of stock in that. They're looking for a story.\" \"I'm so confused,\" the hurting woman confessed. \"Maybe his letter didn't mean what I thought. Maybe he wants to come back to tell me he's done with me. I mean look at her. She's gorgeous, rich, successful.\" \"And also broke his heart before,\" the priest reminder her, \"let's not forget that. I was there when he wrote the letter he meant….,\" his voice trailed off as if suddenly distracted. \"Father Alexander? Are you there? Is something wrong?\" Michele cried into the phone. The priest, mouth agape, watched a video report from the Nationwide Arena showing Mike and Amanda together, she touching him frequently with a voice over reporting the two of them together at an NHL game as guests of the team president. \"What's going on?\" Michele screamed on the other end. \"Uhm…..I'm not sure,\" the priest said evasively, not wanting to lie but also not wanting to tell the already-troubled woman what he was watching. \"Let me get in touch with Michael and find us an explanation for all this,\" he responded. Michele figured something else was going on so searching her own computer she saw what had caused the clergyman to stop talking, setting off a new wave of nausea.[Chapter 23] Chapter 23 -decisions Burbank California, Western Ave and North Glenoaks Blvd. The Marines were on a rest break. They'd spent the early hours of the morning tracking a group of aliens who had been trying to break the human line. Their motivation and intention had caused concern from command so they had dispatched the company-sized fighting patrol to find out and eliminate them. The current objective in the campaign for the 2-5 Marines and the battle group they were part of had shifted to Burbank and the goal of capturing the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport. Holding that would allow the humans a better staging area for assaults into metropolitan LA. Unfortunately for the humans, the aliens had seemed to figure that out too so were stubbornly fighting back. As soldiers do, they went from tension to relaxation in a moment. The topic of interest in one particular group became the news reports they'd picked up overnight on Staff Sergeant Nantz through the internet. \"Hey, did you see the picture of Staffs and the blonde?\" Lockett asked the guys in the squad, tearing into some powerbars. \"Word. She was fine,\" Pte. Rico Gains agreed. \"I wouldn't mind an assignment like that.\" \"I don't know guys,\" Imlay joined in, not so exuberant. \"It doesn't make sense to me that he'd get involved with her. I mean he seems pretty sweet on that woman we pulled out of the police station back in August. I think they're serious.\" \"Yea and what's the problem of having a little R and R while he's away?\" Gains interjected, fist bumping another man in the squad. \"What? He too much of a hero to have a little hook-up?\" \"Shut your mouth Rico,\" Imlay shot back, irritated by the tone. \"You don't know nothing about him or her.\" \"Whatever. What's your problem dude? You his mom?\" the Marine retorted, spitting on the ground for emphasis. Lockett jumped to his feet, the fatigue of the long patrol suddenly gone. \"Watch your mouth man!\" The other was up in an instant, fists clenched, the growing tension of the conflict finding a new outlet. \"Yea, what you goin' to do about it big shot?\" The two looked like they might come to blows except that their platoon sergeant, a massive African American with a shaved head, stepped in. \"What's going on here?\" Sergeant Ed Gibbs demanded. \"Nothin',\" the two said, glaring at each other. \"That was a rhetorical statement,\" Gibbs shot back. \"I could hear your whole argument. Probably the aliens we're doggin' could too. You sound like a bunch of old ladies at the beauty shop gossiping about the stars. Pathetic! If you spent less time surfing on your iPhones for crap info and more focusing on getting the job done we'd win this war,\" he glared at the pair then shot a withering glance to the rest of the soldiers who averted their eyes from his. \"Now all of you, shut your mouths and get ready to move out.\" \"Everything okay here?\" Lt. Gordon stepped into the crowd of Marines, an irritated look on his handsome face. He'd heard too. \"Naw, things are under control here L.T.,\" Sergeant Gibbs answered glaring at the soldiers. \"Good. We can't afford conflict in the ranks. We got enough troubles to deal with.\" As if prophetically, one of their perimeter guards yelled out, \"Contact, squids in bound.\" A flurry of grenades slammed into their position, hitting several lounging Marines and sending the others scrambling. The aliens the 2-5 company had been tracking seemed to have backtracked and come back on them. Infantry caste aliens aggressively pressed the flatfooted Marines at several points turning the tables. The hunters now became the hunted. Gordon flipped from the posture of irritated parent to efficient tactician in a nano-second. \"1st squad, defensive perimeter. Hammer them with the 203's. Keep 'em off us. Lockett, take your squad up the gut, check 'em. Imlay, 3rd squad, wedge them, don't let them concentrate.\" Rather then back off the Marines met the attack head-on, countering the thrust. The bold tactic caught the aliens in the middle of setting up their attack causing their momentum to be broken. The battle-hardened leathernecks pressed the advantage pushing them back with concentrated fire and disciplined bounds forward co-coordinated by their platoon sergeant. The aliens fell back in seeming disarray but it was again only a ruse in order to consolidate their position. The infantry caste soldiers paused but that was only to allow more reinforcements to arrive. They seemed to be developing tactics of their own to meet the human. Not seeing this, the charging platoon sergeant looked behind him to yell, \"Come on guys, we can break them!\" A moment later his head exploded from a direct hit by an alien machine gun, catching the surging Marines off guard. At the same time the invaders renewed their assault, supported by a walking gun, swarming all around the humans and threatening to envelope the now unsupported squads. Gordon saw this and knew they were outmatched. \"Pull back,\" he yelled into his radio to the surging squads but the adrenaline caused his voice to carry that far on its own. \"Form on 1st squad. Defensive position. Hold the line!\" Imlay and Lockett had seen the same thing their platoon commander did as well so were relieved to receive the order. They efficiently brought their men back seeing the lieutenant had set up in a small community park that afforded excellent cover in addition to good lines of fire on the attacking aliens. Supported by 1st squad they placed their men to best hold off the assault just as the aliens started to surge anew. Gordon switched frequencies in order to call for help. \"Any stations, this is Echo-2-Hotel we are in heavy enemy contact and request assistance. We're at grid 20110520 and are hard pressed with casualties, over,\" the lieutenant called urgently. In one motion he dropped the handset and raised his M4A1 to drop a charging infantry caste alien who'd broken through their line. He scanned the location and could see two more men down which led to the gap. \"Page,\" he yelled to one of the SAW gunners, \"shift position and cover the breech, Doc, get to those men.\" With the extra fire power the Marines put up a walking wall of lead to push back the aliens who had begun to drive a wedge into their position. With mounting casualties the aliens pulled back to probe another part of the line. The threat temporarily eliminated, despite the flurry of activity and air filled with explosive rounds, the leader slid over to his radio operator and tried to reach help again just as the aliens came charging in again. The situation was becoming desperate. \"Any stations, this is Echo-2-Hotel, we need immediate assistance. Can anyone assist? Over!\" heart pounding Gordon shouted to try to hear himself over the growing noise of battle. \"This is Longhorn 3-5, 2-Hotel,\" a voice twanged over the radio, \"we're on our way. Just hold on boys.\" Though Gordon didn't recognize the call sign he was relieved that someone was coming to help since with the increased fire and growing numbers it would only be a matter of time before they were overrun. \"Sir, squids are starting to flank us, we need to adjust,\" Imlay yelled out desperately from the right, ducking as a flurry of grenades exploded around him. The African-American officer looked and saw a sizeable group moving swiftly to the side, sliding along the line he'd established and finding the end. He didn't have any men to counter it, all were hotly engaged. \"Imlay, drop part of your squad back, deny the flank,\" he ordered, knowing it wouldn't work. Help better get there soon. Boom…Boom…Boom The ground erupted in fire and smoke around the main group of aliens who'd been concentrating for their attack on the beleaguered Marines. The sound of roaring engines overpowered the din of battle. Rumbling up the road six M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles appeared. Their turrets swiveled left and right looking for targets. When any group of infantry caste aliens was discovered the tank's M242 25mm chain gun would spit out death in rapid succession. Outmatched, and apparently without support, the aliens quickly broke contact and began to retreat in disarray. Four of the Bradley clanked past the Marine's position, while two stopped right in front of it. Dropping its rear ramp a half-dozen soldiers ran out and took up a defensive position. One medic trotted over looking to help Doc Adukwu with the wounded. \"You saved our butts,\" Lt. Gordon acknowledged, extending his hand up to the soldier now standing in the commander's hatch, \"thanks. I'm Gordon, 2-5 Marines.\" \"Sure enough. Billy Gantry, Texas National Guard,\" the captain's voice twanged above the rumble of the engine from his AFV, \"36th ID, happy to lend a hand.\" \"Well we do appreciate you guys bailing us out of a tight spot.\" \"When we heard your call we scampered over here as fast as we could,\" Gantry explained. \"You boys have had all the fight so far and we've not been here too long. So if you don't mind, we'd love to stay around and jaw with you but me and the boys came here looking for a fight. We're going to push on.\" Gordon chuckled at the gung-ho attitude, weary from the fight himself. \"You'll find it, no troubles. Thanks again captain and good luck.\" The officer threw a quick wave then spoke into his headset. Gordon could swear he heard a rebel yell coming from inside the tank. The column of Bradley's then clanked off in search of the retreating enemy. The Marine lieutenant had not doubt with that kind of enthusiasm they'd win the war. With a laugh and shake of his head Gordon returned to the task of putting his banged-up platoon back together. Double Tree Suites Hotel, Columbus Ohio Sitting in a comfortable arm chair in his large suite, Todd Brooker heard the ping of his Blackberry and looked down at the incoming text. It was from that pesky priest from LA again. He smoothly dismissed the alert and went back to the conversation he'd been having with the reporter. Brooker had been sharing some 'inside' information on what had been going on with Staff Sergeant Nantz. How the priest had gotten his cell number he didn't know but the guy was getting to be a pain. Didn't he have a church or something to run? The priest had left several voice mails and text messages urgently wanting to get in touch with Nantz about an important matter. Like that was going to happen, Brooker thought. The war hero was too busy to speak to some clergyman looking for confession. The story of the Marine and his ex-wife was dynamite. The last thing he wanted was anything that would dampen the flames. The press agent deleted the message and carried on totally focused on bringing his message to America. In the same hotel's restaurant Mike nervously fidgeted with the napkin that sat on the elegant linen tablecloth at his table. Caught in the moment the previous evening, he'd agreed to meet Amanda for brunch the next morning after the game. Now his emotions were conflicted. He didn't trust her, yet what if she had changed? He had loved her deeply, what it…. Amanda entered the upscale dining establishment and lit up the room. Dressed in a black and brown fitted suit which complimented her figure, blonde hair swishing back and forth, she playfully waved at Mike then moved to sit at his table. \"Good morning Mike!\" she announced cheerfully. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Not bad. How about you?\" \"Not as well as I could have,\" Amanda flirted with him. \"I'm so glad we're getting the chance to get together and talk away from everyone.\" She placed her hand on his forearm. An electronic chirp came from her Louis Vuitton handbag. \"Sorry about that,\" she apologized, \"but I guess this is still a work day for me.\" She pulled a sleek Blackberry from the bag and quickly picked up the message her gorgeous face contorting in frustration. \"Idiot!\" she said under her breath. \"Pardon?\" Mike asked in surprise. \"Not you darling,\" she purred. The general manager at my plant. The guy's totally useless on his own. She quickly tapped out a message and slid the device away. \"Sorry about that.\" Then her sunny disposition returned. Mike was stunned by how quickly the woman could flip in and out of emotions. This was something he'd not seen in her before. The pair chatted lightly until a waiter took their order. Mike was surprised at how much he enjoyed the conversation as she recalled some of the good things they had experienced in the past. She skillfully played to some of his interests and he found himself leaning into the conversation. \"Michael, I'm not going to beat around the bush. I made a mistake when I got involved with that other guy. Your reaction was true and I was wrong. I've had a lot of time to think about it and also seen just how special you really are,\" Amanda confessed. \"Other guys huh?\" Mike countered, trying to keep his emotions detached and in check but beginning to fall into a deep pit. \"Yes. I'm ashamed of it but won't lie to you,\" Amanda admitted, face reddening as she averted his glance. \"But I've seen just how foolish I really have been. I'm willing to do anything I can to get you back,\" she confessed. \"I know how to make you happy and I'd like the chance to show you that I've changed. What do you think?\" I…I…,\" Mike stammered, getting lost in her deep blue eyes. \"Sorry to interrupt,\" the waiter announced, delicately balancing two china plates of food, \"here's your breakfast.\" Amanda's eyes flashed angrily but she smiled sweetly. \"Thank you.\" Mike grabbed his fork and took a big bite of food. He'd found food had tasted better on this tour after the field rations he'd been eating in LA. He let the eggs sit in his mouth, savoring the moment, as he absorbed the taste. \"What is this?\" Amanda demanded to herself. \"This is all wrong. I can't eat this,\" she complained. \"Waiter! Waiter!\" she called out raising her voice to be heard. The young man, likely a college student, came rushing back. \"Yes ma'am?\" he asked. \"These eggs benedict are all wrong.\" \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" he apologized. \"What's the matter with them? \"I said they're wrong,\" she huffed. \"That should suffice. Take them back and tell you chef to make them right or they're going back again.\" The waiter scurried off after the reprimand while Mike sat his mouth slightly ajar at the exchange. Amanda caught the look. \"What?\" she asked defensively. \"If I let them get away with such poor cooking it'll impact their business. I'm only being honest,\" she defended herself. In that instant Mike made up his mind. \"Do you have any idea what the people in LA are eating right now Amanda? What the soldiers on the front are eating? And you send yours back?\" \"Mike, come on. This is different,\" she protested, realizing she'd made some sort of mistake. \"I'm sorry. I didn't realize. I didn't mean to be disrespectful of what the people are going through or what you've gone through.\" \"You don't get it. You never really have. Just because you're telling the truth it doesn't mean it's the right thing to do or even should be said,\" Mike answered in frustration. \"It's always been about you and your needs.\" He held up his hand to stop her from speaking. \"I appreciate your renewed interest and your offer to get together again. It's tempting but I've met someone already that I care deeply about. So my answer is no.\" \"So who's the lucky woman?\" she asked huffily. \"I met her during the war. It doesn't really matter,\" he admitted. \"What matters is I want to spend the rest of my life with her.\" \"I see,\" Amanda responded evenly. Then looking into his eyes she could see the resolve and knew any attempt to change him would be a waste of time. When her order came back she accepted it graciously, even apologizing to the waiter for being abrupt. The pair then spent the remainder of their time together talking about old times and old friends. It was an altogether pleasant morning and they parted on good terms. Mike felt his heart soar. He'd passed an important test. Suddenly he desperately wanted to get back to LA and see Michele. Walking back to his suite one of the members of Mike's protection detail, an ex-Marine now working with the Secret Service, nervously looked around before speaking. Ensuring no one else was in ear-shot he said in a low voice, \"Did you know someone has been trying to get in touch with you?\" \"No, who?\" Mike answered surprised. \"It's some priest from LA. I thought you should know.\" \"Thanks. Do you know why I haven't gotten the message?\" Mike hadn't brought his cell phone along when he'd travelled. He didn't want the extra kit and really didn't want the contact. Besides, Brooker had told him he'd take care of all that stuff. The Secret Service agent didn't answer the question as the two other members of his detail glided into position and they began the job of walking him to his room in the hotel. All along Mike thought it a bit comical that he needed 'protection' here in the rear area yet on the front line of battle he'd be on his own. Civilians had a funny mindset about threats. Bothered by the brief conversation, Mike picked up the telephone sitting beside his bed as soon as he got back. Getting an outside line he dialed the number from memory. \"Hello?\" \"Hey Father Alexander. I heard you were trying to get in touch with me,\" Mike said cheerfully, happy to hear the familiar voice. \"What's going on Michael?\" the priest demanded in a clipped tone. \"What do you mean?\" Mike asked a bit stunned. \"I've been trying to get in touch with you for three days.\" \"I didn't know,\" The Marine admitted. \"What's up?\" \"What's up?\" Father Alexander raised his voice. \"I wanted to talk to you about what's going on with you and Amanda.\" \"Me and Amanda? What are you getting at?\" \"Have you not seen the news reports? The pictures out there?\" Father Alexander asked incredulously. \"I mean it's all over the press about you and her. They say the two of you are getting back together.\" \"What?\" Mike exploded. \"It's nationwide and it's come back here. Michele saw and she's pretty upset.\" Mike sat in shocked silence at the revelation. He could feel his heart begin to pound as the reality of his friend's words began to sink in. \"Well yes, we did connect. And we did go out. But nothings going on. I told her so. I even told her about Michele.\" \"Really?\" \"You don't believe me?\" Mike shot back, irritated at being misunderstood. \"Why haven't you called me back?\" Father Alexander asked, voice becoming calmer. \"Why haven't you responded to all the media attention and set it right?\" \"What are you accusing me of?\" Mike said defensively. \"Nothing Michael. I just want to be sure where you stand.\" \"I haven't seen any of this stuff you're talking about,\" he yelled into the phone allowing his frustration to spill over into anger. \"Are you telling me the truth?\" the priest asked hopefully. \"Come on, you know me,\" Mike answered, calming down, beginning to see how this might look back home. \"Oh man, Michele, she must be really…\" \"Hurt? Yes, she is and confused too especially after your letter.\" Father Alexander paused for a moment as if letting the conversation sink it. \"I'm glad this isn't the case Michael. But how then did this all happen? I mean, why is this continuing to be reported and no one has put a stop to it. Why didn't you even know about all this?\" \"I don't know but I plan to find out,\" Mike assured him. They chatted for a few more minutes, both calming down. Mike then tried to call Michele but she wouldn't pick up and her voice mail was turned off. Hanging up, frustration gave way to a growing rage. Someone had been manipulating the information, using it to build publicity. That could only be one person: Brooker.[Chapter 24] Chapter 24: Back to LA Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Michele pushed through the doors of the hospital like a person desperate to get away. In truth she was. She was a veterinarian, not a combat doctor. The carnage she'd experienced made her sick. Another group of soldiers, this time a company from the Utah National Guard, had walked into an ambush and been decimated. Several hours of trying to help put broken bodies back together and save the wounded took their toll. Coupled with the sickness in her heart she wasn't sure she could take any more of it. It had been three days since her conversation with Father Alexander about Mike. She continued to see reports of him and his ex-wife and how everyone seemed to be pulling for them to get back together. Everyone except her. The insecure woman wondered if she were a fool. He she missed something in his letter? Mike had seemed to genuinely want something more with her, a lasting relationship. So if that were the case why was all this going on? Unsure what to do she felt a wave of nausea begin to build up as her head swirled with confusion. \"Michele, are you okay?\" She looked up and into the face of Doctor Guy Chevreau, a civilian surgeon she'd been assisting lately in the hospital. Staring at her with compassion, he brushed some wavy blond strands of hair away from his tanned, handsome face. \"I'm…I'm just tired,\" she responded, getting lost in his gaze. \"Michele, you've worked so hard and done so much but I'm getting worried about you,\" the doctor stated, putting a hand gently on her shoulder. \"I hate to see one so pretty so torn up, it's just not right,\" he said trying to sound light. Michele sucked in her breath suddenly. Was he flirting with her? \"It's okay. I'm just trying to do my part.\" \"We've all lost a lot in this war,\" Chevreau reflected, \"given a lot. I suspect you've given much. Perhaps even too much?\" \"We all have,\" Michele answered weakly. \"I've not suffered any more then thousands of others in LA. I'm no one special.\" \"I would disagree with that,\" the doctor countered, giving her shoulder a light caress. He was definitely flirting with her now. Seeing a confused look in her eyes Chevreau added, \"I know many have suffered, it's been a terrible tragedy for us all. But your situation is different I think. Michele, I've heard the talk around the hospital. I've seen the news reports. I can see how this is affecting you and I hate to see it.\" \"It's nothing,\" she mumbled back, suddenly embarrassed that her situation seemed to be public knowledge. \"It's not nothing,\" he refuted, suddenly taking her hand, \"you deserve more then that.\" \"I don't know about that Dr. Chevreau. I think I'm getting what I deserve,\" she answered without conviction, defenses beginning to crumble. \"Please, call me Guy. Again, I would have to disagree. I'm not certain if you're aware of half what you deserve.\" \"That's sweet but the scales don't tip in my favor,\" Michele mused, replaying lost opportunities in her mind. Chevreau pondered the statement for a moment as Michele felt her heart rate begin to increase. Then with a toothy smile he took both hands, lifted her to her feet and said, \"Come, let's begin to balance the scales a bit.\" \"What do you have in mind?\" Michele asked, head swimming and mouth suddenly dry. \"Coffee for starts,\" he responded with a wink. Task Force LA Headquarters, Pasadena California \"This is the fourth time this week,\" General Daily shouted, slamming his fist down onto the tactical map table. \"Can anyone tell me how this is happening? How is it we keep walking into ambushes?\" \"I don't know sir,\" a major who spoke for the intelligence team sheepishly answered, looking away in embarrassment. \"You're my J-2, it's your job to know,\" Daily pressed, still angry at the after-action and casualty report he held in his hand. \"You damn well need to know because I'm not going to lose more troops senselessly this way.\" The officer avoided eye contact and shifted away from the fuming general. \"Fine, you don't know. Listen up people. Drop whatever you're doing,\" Daily ordered the people in the room that served as the Corp intelligence division. \"I need answers but right now I'll settle for ideas. How are the squids able to keep ambushing us?\" The room went silent as nearly thirty people avoided the withering gaze of the aggressive combat officer. Daily didn't speak; he waited with an agitated look. No one spoke. It was an awkward silence. \"No one? None of you here have any ideas of what's going on?\" the officer stated in disgust. \"Leave it with us General Daily,\" the major answered awkwardly, \"we'll come up with something I promise. \"And what for now? What about the troops on the line who are getting chewed up because our Intel sucks?\" the general countered, neck muscles bulging in frustration \"Sir, I think I may have an answer,\" a female captain with blunt cut short blonde hair and wearing outdated glasses spoke up. \"General, we've been over this before,\" the major commanding the unit cut her off. \"She's an excited reservist. Like I said, leave it with me, I'll…\" \"Quiet you,\" the general ordered menacingly. \"I think I've heard about as much from you as I'd like. So captain,\" he said, shifting his gaze to the mousy looking woman in uniform, \"what were you going to say?\" \"This may seem simple general but the answer, I believe, is not that hard. We cracked the alien's signals right?\" she confirmed, displaying a confidence her looks didn't warrant. \"They've known we can intercept their messages and understand them ever since Senator Sharpe was killed. So it would appear that since then they've been systematically feeding us false information and using it to set us up.\" General Daily was stunned by the report. It made sense but how come no one else hadn't figured it out? How come he hadn't? \"What's your name captain?\" he asked. \"Blatchford sir, Gloria Blatchford.\" \"And what do you do in the civilian world Ms. Blatchford?\" \"I'm an investigative reporter for the Sacramento Bee. It's my job to figure stuff out,\" she said pointedly looking at the major. The officer commanding the group reacted defensively. \"Come on general. That's crazy. It makes no sense at all. They don't have that capability.\" \"Just because they're not human it doesn't mean they're stupid,\" Blatchford shot back. \"They're smart enough to figure out space travel.\" \"That's enough you two,\" Daily ordered the bickering pair though he was beginning to like the feisty reporter turned int officer. \"I assume you have some way of backing up this hypothesis?\" \"Do you think I would share it if I couldn't?\" she countered, unintimidated by the commander. \"Listen sir, I've cross referenced all the ambushes with our intelligence signals right before they happened and all of them match up. They were all set ups.\" General Daily smiled broadly. Now they were getting somewhere. He definitely liked her. This one was unafraid, unlike the others in the room. \"You don't happen to have any ideas of what to do about this do you captain?\" \"As a matter of fact I do, general.\" \"Come with me Captain Blatchford,\" he responded with a chuckle, \"I think I might have a position on my staff for an investigative reporter.\" Pittsburg, Pennsylvania Mike finished his evening speech. He'd stuck to the script though much of it had irked him. He didn't care. He wanted to get on with it. Brooker had avoided him all day, as he had the day before. Today they'd travelled to their new location in separate vehicles. It seemed as if the man from Washington could sense trouble so had been successfully avoiding him. Mike had tried to speak to him the previous day also but the man had slipped away and not been seen. The newspapers and television talk shows continued to carry speculation about what was happening between him and Amanda. Father Alexander had been right about how things looked and Mike was angry about it. He'd been proud of himself for how he'd handled the temptation yet this was how it all turned out. To make things worse he still couldn't get in touch with Michele. No, tonight the slick Washington PR man wouldn't be able to avoid him. \"Good job Staff Sergeant,\" Brooker congratulated Mike, as he left the stage. Already the man though seemed to be preparing to move. He turned his back and started to speak to one of his assistants. \"We need to talk Mr. Brooker,\" Mike declared, shifting to stay in his line of sight. \"How about tomorrow? I have some people I need to meet in a bit then a conference call after that.\" \"No, right now,\" Mike demanded, an edge to his voice that others around them picked up. \"I really don't have the time, I'm very busy,\" the PR man answered evasively, moving away from the Marine. \"I said now.\" Mike's hand shot out and grabbed the man by the lapel of his suit. Giving him a shake he demanded, \"What's all this crap about Amanda and me? I've seen the papers. And why didn't you tell me Father Alexander has been trying to get in a hold of me?\" Instead of answering the question Brooker tried unsuccessfully to pull away. \"Get your hands off of me!\" he shouted in growing agitation looking desperately towards is entourage. One of Brooker's security men stepped in clamping onto Mike's forearm then trying to wrench it away. \"Back off Sergeant,\" the bull-necked Secret Service agent ordered. \"The man said to leave him be.\" Mike resisted, and the trio began a tug of war for advantage catching the attention of everyone around them. \"Let me go you stupid grunt!\" Brooker screamed as the tussle became more intense. Another of Brooker's men grabbed Mike in a half-nelson to try to pull him off the White House officer. \"Hey, there's no need for that,\" one of Mike's protection detail men, the ex-Marine, called out stepping in himself. \"All he wants is some questions answered. Let's all just calm down and talk about this.\" \"Back off,\" Brooker's man snarled in reply as he moved to put Mike in a headlock, \"this is none of your business.\" \"It is now,\" Mike's man replied as he intercepted the other Secret Service agent move and tried to lever him off. Tension that had been building between the rival groups all tour finally broke. Each lost control, chaos broke out. The security men on both sides waded into the fight and an unseemly melee began. Men in suits began wrestling with each as and punches were thrown. \"Calm down! Everyone calm down!\" the senator from Pennsylvania who had hosted the event ordered, striding purposefully over to the group. \"This is a disgrace. Gentlemen, get a hold of yourselves.\" Hearing the voice and realizing how this looked, the grappling men sheepishly began to disengage. Mike began to let go of Brooker, but kept his fists cocked, ready to strike. Though desperately he wanted to pummel the man he looked around at the gathering crowd and knew it was wrong. Instead he stepped back and unclenched his hands. Brooker's security man though took advantage of the break and viciously shoved Mike's ex-Marine agent as they separated causing him to stumble. The attacker smirked in victory until a crushing right fist landed on his nose from the one who had deftly recovered from the stumble and counter-attacked. \"I said that's enough!\" the senator barked. \"Get a grip on yourselves, all of you.\" He glared at the secret service agents from the two rival details who were adjusting their suits after the fracas and spat out, \"you men should know better. Your job is to protect. How can you do that when you're fighting each other? Grow up!\" The men hung their heads in shame, not meeting the withering look from the politician. Satisfied he'd sorted out that part of the public spectacle he then walked over to Mike. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, what is the meaning of this?\" he demanded. \"Sir, I'm sorry,\" Mike apologized to the senator as Brooker glared at him with hatred in his eyes, \"but for the last couple of days things have been reported in the press about me and my ex-wife that aren't true. Plus I found out a close friend of mine has been trying to get in touch with me and Mr. Brooker has been blocking it. I've been trying to talk to him about it but he's kept avoiding me. All I want is some answers, sir.\" A surprised look replaced the irritated one on the senator's face. \"Is this true?\" he asked Brooker. \"Well, no, I mean yes…it depends on what part we're referring too. Well, it's complicated and there are some mitigating circumstances you're not aware of senator…,\" the publicity man stammered. Mike again wanted to attack the man, his warrior instinct flaring, but instead he restrained himself putting his trust in the senator to settle things. \"Did you or did you not deny this man access to his friend?\" the senator, a former circuit court judge, questioned. \"And I won't even get into the news reports I've seen because I think I can figure that out.\" \"Sir, this is not germane to what's going on here. The president has tasked me with generating support for the war effort. I've been doing everything in my power to see that happens under very difficult circumstances. This man,\" he huffed pointing at Mike, \"is impossible to work with. He doesn't follow instructions, is belligerent and likely is causing more harm then good.\" \"Cut the cock and bull story,\" the senator retorted, \"because I've spent enough time in Washington to know a load of manure when I see it. Staff Sergeant Nantz is a soldier, a damn good one from what I understand, not one of your Beltway prima donnas. He's a genuine hero, not some prissy rock star, so start treating him that way.\" \"Senator, with all due respect, this is not your area of expertise or your jurisdiction,\" an exasperated Brooker responded arrogantly. \"Hmm, we'll see,\" the senator responded with a snort then turned and walked away. The next day the tour was ended by the White House. Todd Brooker found himself with a new assignment supervising the clipping of newspaper articles in an annex of the White House. It seemed the senator had more expertise then the press officer had realized. Mike finished the last two days of presentations. There was no more talk about him and Amanda in the press. Finished, he prepared to be sent back to LA. He couldn't be happier.[Chapter 25] Chapter 25 Subterfuge Task Force LA Command Centre, Rear Area, LA General Daily introduced the Reserve captain to the rest of his team as soon as they returned to his headquarters. She'd be an intelligence consultant working with his strategic planning group, he explained. They'd talked little on the ride over, the reporter seeming reserved until asked a direct question. The other members of his team gave the reporter a warm reception and readily accepted her which surprised the woman after her somewhat acrimonious relationship previously. Blatchford thought she'd not only have a chance to finally contribute to war effort but enjoy it as well. \"Okay, so what's your plan?\" Daily asked getting down to business. \"Simple. We play a little role reversal,\" Blatchford responded with confidence, believing she'd be respected. \"We use their information against them. Spring an ambush on their ambush. Not only will that protect our troops but it'll get the squids looking over their shoulders.\" She adjusted her glasses then a hard look came over her face. \"We get them on their heels and then slaughter every SOB that comes into the kill zone.\" Daily was impressed by the plan but surprised by the ferocity of the meek-looking Army Reserve officer. It appeared the reporter turned intelligence officer had a hard streak to her. \"What kind of reporting do you do, captain?\" he asked. \"Criminal investigation, sir.\" \"You like it?\" Yea, I do. I get a chance to expose criminal scumbags for what they are. Of course the liberals scream a lot that I don't understand their circumstances. That's a lot of crap. I know everyone has a story but everyone also has a choice. I write about the bad choices people make.\" \"I bet you're pretty good at it.\" She shrugged her shoulders non-chalantly. \"I got a wall full of awards so some would say so. That doesn't really motivate me though.\" The woman paused for a moment as if processing information or sizing up the general. \"And this? This situation is simple. Kill or be killed so we sure as hell better be the ones doing the killing.\" Seeing she'd made her point, Blatchford began to realize the impact of the chance she'd been given. Thanks for listening to me general. I appreciate it a lot, more then you an imagine. That idiot major wouldn't get his head out of his arse long enough to figure some of this stuff out. If he checked his ego at the door he'd be a pretty good J2.\" Daily was amused by the frank, yet accurate, assessment given by the reporter. This one seemed dangerous, exactly what he needed on his staff. \"So what motivates you Captain Blatchford?\" \"Justice. Seeing the right thing done.\" \"But this situation seems a bit different,\" the general pressed, \"it seems a bit personal for you.\" \"It is.\" For the first time the granite-faced woman bent slightly. Her lip quivered a bit as she spoke, \"I lost my only aunt and uncle in the first assault on Santa Monica. They practically raised me when my parents split up. Plus a whole bunch of my friends have gotten killed and the old neighborhood I grew up in as a kid got levelled. It is personal with me general and I'm looking for payback.\" \"Make sense, captain,\" General Daily nodded his head in agreement. \"We all have strong reasons for wanting to win this fight. I think you're going to be a great addition to my team.\" The commander turned to one of his aides standing nearby. \"Get me Col. Ritchie at 2nd Battalion. I have a new mission for him I think he'll like.\" Somewhere in Pasadena The entire 2nd Battalion had mobilized along with several armored squadrons. They'd received information from command about several alien ambushes that were being planned. They were to set up counter-ambushes, so moved into position ahead of time then waited for the aliens to come in themselves. Once set, other units would then move in as bait. Three potential target areas had been set up. The attacking Marines took up their positions the previous night under the cover of darkness and their observers who'd act as fire controllers set in place. The tech guys had been working to change the frequency and method the Marine's radios broadcast so that the alien's could not only be unable to home in on them but not even pick up the signals. A team of experts, made up of some of the best minds in the country, had been working on it for over a month. An MIT professor thought he had it figured out. This was going to be the first real test, theory entering into practice in real time. For this scheme to work the humans would not only need clear radio communications but also it had to be undetected by the aliens or things would turn ugly real fast. Imlay and Lockett lay hidden on the top floor of a heavily damaged building sweeping the area with binoculars. They were on more then overwatch, they were the observers in the ambush area that had been set up. They'd be the ones to bring the rain. \"Man, I hope this isn't a wild goose chase,\" Lockett thought out loud, trying to chase away the boredom. The sun had come up an hour earlier. The two Marines had spent an uncomfortable night in the hidden position and it was beginning to seem like nothing would happen. \"I know what you mean,\" Imlay agreed, shifting yet again to try to get comfortable. He felt his shoulder muscles cramping up from laying in the confined space. \"I never thought I'd be doing something like this. I mean Afghanistan makes sense, I signed up for that. But this? It's crazy, like some kind of nightmare. Aliens? That's just nuts,\" Lockett mused. \"I know what you mean. Its like something out of a movie. I thought the fight might some day come here but not like this. Now we're fighting for America, fighting for our homes and our loved ones,\" Imlay responded passionately. \"You sound like Lt. Martinez.\" \"Yea, maybe I do. He was all right, for an officer anyway.\" \"He was,\" Lockett agreed. \"Gordon's pretty good too. But I wonder how Lt. Martinez's wife's doing? Man, that's got to be tough. I hope she's okay. Its times like this I'm glad I'm single.\" \"Staffs went to visit her after we got back,\" Imlay reported. \"He had a letter for her from the L.T. Apparently he also made sure through the colonel that she got a new home and was looked after\" \"He did that? Wow. I didn't know. The guy just keeps on surprising me.\" \"I wonder how he's doing.\" \"Better then us,\" Lockett snorted. \"I'm not sure about that,\" Imlay mused reflectively. \"He doesn't seem like the guy who'd be into all that attention.\" \"Yea, probably drives him crazy. Plus there's all that crap about him and his ex in the media.\" \"You don't think its true? I sure hope not anyway.\" \"Naw, that's not his style. He's totally old school,\" Lockett declared. One-woman man and he's sweet on Michele.\" Movement to their left caught their eye. \"See that? At eleven o'clock?\" Imlay pointed out. \"Yea, looks like a pair of infantry type squids,\" Lockett answered. The two aliens moved cautiously into the apartment complex parking lot and looked around carefully. Imlay thumbed his radio switch. \"Two Tangos entering target zone,\" he reported. The two Marines held their breath. So far the advancing aliens didn't seem aware the pair had eyes on them. \"Wait out, they're likely scouts,\" came the response from Lt. Gordon. The aliens looked around the parking lot strewn with vehicles. They seemed to be sweeping back and forth, casing the place. Apparently satisfied, more aliens entered in, lots of them. The horizon filled with them marching into the area in tight columns. Imlay picked out not only officer caste by intelligence caste aliens. They'd hit the jackpot. \"More Tangos inbound, I'd estimate at least two companies worth.\" \"Excellent,\" Gordon replied, the excitement in his voice obvious. \"Hold position and prepare to lase target on my order.\" A-10's and Apaches were on station waiting for the order to strike. It would be a spectacular show for the pair of observers. 2nd Battalion would then move in and mop up the area. \"All right boys, switch to tactical net now and lase target on their command. We're about to go loud,\" Gordon ordered. \"Roger that, switching now.\" Imlay adjusted his radio to tap into the battalion tactical network. \"Juggernaught Actual this is Survey 1. We are in positions and preparing to lase Kill Box Alpha on your command.\" \"Survey 1, this is Juggernaught Actual, confirm, lase target now, Hammer Flight is in-bound ETA two minutes. Hammer Flight, you are weapons free, target will be lased at Kill Box Alpha.\" The aliens continued to march steadily forward, now with the bulk in the parking lot unaware of the destruction that was about to rain down upon them. The sound of roaring jet engines and the furious chop-chop of accelerating helicopters caught them by surprise. The aliens froze, not expecting this development, uncertain what to do. They waited too long. Knowing exactly where to hit because they'd be laser-targetted in, four A-10 Thunderbolts seemed to pop above the trees and swooped in on the unmoving column. They open fired with their 30mm Avenger gatling guns. The large depleted uranium slugs tore up everything in their wake, cutting huge swaths in the tightly packed alien ranks. To add insult to injury, each plane loosed two AGM-65 Maverick missiles that slammed in right behind creating a cauldron of fire in their wake. The remaining aliens tried to scramble for cover as the planes winged up and around for another pass but six Apache gunships rose up from different positions to box them in then add their own destruction to the menu. Using their full inventory of weapons to deadly results, cars flew in the air from the force of explosions, crushing aliens, concrete and asphalt richocheted around filling the air with destructive shrapnel. The Apaches pulled back just as the A-10's came in for another pass. Ordinance expended, they peeled off and another flight of four took its place. All the while, the Apaches would pop in and out, stinging like a swarm of angry wasps. It was an altogether vicious and effective attack. The co-ordinated dance of destruction would go on and on until none moved or even stood. On the ground, the display of deadly firepower was horrifically spectacular. Explosions filled the sky and the ground shook. The aliens had been caught totally flatfooted and were being ground up in the fury. Watching the incredible spectacle as if from ringside, Lockett and Imlay almost felt sorry for them. Almost. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Father Alexander had a spring in his step as he walked towards the hospital complex. He'd received word from Mike that he'd be back in the area the next day. The situation in the media had seemed to die down and the fickle group had moved on to another novelty story, this time a story about a quaterback named Tebow. The priest continued to find it ironic that professional sports continued despite everything going on in America. The NFL, NHL and now even the NBA, who'd finished their strike and resumed play, were carrying on like nothing was going on. Of course all the leagues were doing it without teams from Los Angeles and the other cities under siege but still, they carried on. Sure there were heated arguments on boths side. Some contended that to play showed a disrespect for the loss of life and continued threat, trivializing the suffering going on versus another that countered to carry on showed resolve, showed the American spirit could not be beaten, that a return to normalcy was the best way to deal with the horror of war. Sports became a distraction and that, and the economic reality of the games, carried the day. God works in mysterious ways. The priest contemplated the thought as he walked down the now paved road towards the growing structure. He remembered when the temporary encampment had been built. A small infirmary had given way to a larger hospital and already a third wing was being built. The main road had been paved and others would be shortly. Was this a return to normalcy or a concession to reality? How soon would they be able to return home and what would that look like? There was coping with reality but then there was settling for something that would suck the spirit away. Which was this? He thought back to the aftermath of 9-11 and how people had returned to 'normal', as if nothing had happened so very quickly. Churches had filled with people looking for God and then emptied just as quickly. Would this be the same? Would the people miss this opportunity to learn and grow, to self-examine, or would the balm of entertainment and consumption distract them again? I've certainly become a philosopher, the priest thought to himself. Today he had good news for Michele so all the thoughts that swirled through his head were pushed out. Entering the hospital, Father Alexander found out she was on a break and had gone to a newly-built coffee shop nearby. This seemed odd to him since she tended to eat outside and alone. He put the thought out of his mind and walked over to it. Arriving at the busy establishment he had to push his way in since a large crowd had gathered there to enjoy what it had to offer. He scanned the crowd looking for Michele happy for the chance to bring good news for a change. The smile fell off his face like a brick when he saw her. The woman sat at a table, engrossed in conversation with a man he recognized as a doctor from the hospital. The thing that got him though was the handsome surgeon held her hand stroking it lightly and she let him. His pulse quickened. He didn't know what to do. Saying a quick prayer he knew he had to deliver his message. The rest was in God's hands. Walking purposefully over to their table the priest saw that Michele noticed him. Turning slightly red the woman avoided his gaze, pulling her hand away. As the priest reached the table Michele stammered, \"Father Alexander, I didn't expect to see you.\" \"No I suspect you didn't,\" he responded coldly. He paused and took a breath, trying to control his rising anger. \"I wanted you to know that Michael will be back on base tomorrow. His tour is over and he'd like to speak to you. There's been some misunderstandings,\" he looked at the pair who sat close together, side by side, \"it seems about a number of things. Anyway, I wanted you to know.\" The priest turned and walked away, surprised at the strength of his emotions towards the scene and wanting nothing more then to get away. \"Father Alexander wait, please!\" Michele called out but he'd already disappeared in the crowded coffee. She tried to get up but Dr. Chevreau grabbed her hand anew. \"Let him go,\" he instructed her, \"why spoil a pleasant time?\" Somewhere in Pasadena The 2nd Battalion Marines and their armor support charged into the wake of destruction, mopping up the stunned aliens. The opportunity for payback after several weeks of struggle drove the soldiers on and the results were decisive. The aliens were routed completely with heavy casualties. The humans suffered a few men wounded and only one killed. Unfortunately that one was the new sergeant in Lt. Gordon's platoon. He'd been killed accidentally when a building damaged in the attack collapsed on him. Soon people would begin to whisper that the platoon sergeant's role in that particular group was jinxed, others would say it was cursed. But that didn't impact this day as the soldiers celebrated their total victory. Confidence in headquarters had been re-established.[Chapter 26] Chapter 26 Things have changed Task Force LA Command Centre, Rear Area, LA A cheer went up around the operations control group as another report came in of the successes of the human forces. Personnel huddled around radios and computer consoles picking up information then eagerly transferring it to a large white board and map in the center of the room. General Daily beamed at the latest update then spontaneously pounded Captain Blatchford on the back. Caught off guard the slender woman was almost knocked over. \"Now that's how it's done!\" the commander celebrated, buoyed by the trend becoming evident. Based on the reports coming in, two of the three kills boxes set up had worked perfectly with the near total destruction of the alien forces engaged. Better still, there had been only minor casualties among the infantry while one Black Hawk helicopter had crash landed due to a mechanical failure on their part. The third ambush had been only a partial success since the trap had been sprung prematurely allowing the aliens to pull back with only light casualties. Another update came in leading to more cheering among the soldiers who were supposed to be focused on their tasks. Their commander wouldn't chide them though since he himself applauded along. It had been a long time since they'd had something to cheer about. \"So what now, captain?\" Daily asked a smile lighting up his face. \"What do you see in your crystal ball?\" \"No crystal ball sir,\" Blatchford answered without emotion, \"just good information and discernment. Search and destroy in kill boxes one and two, advance to contact on the third,\" the Reserve intelligence officer suggested evenly. \"We've got them by the short hairs so lets not let them get away.\" \"Consolidate quickly then push on,\" Daily nodded his head in agreement. \"I see you're more then a reporter but also a student of tactics Captain Blatchford.\" She shrugged her shoulders and adjusted her glasses. \"I like to read plus it's the logical thing to do.\" Daily snorted in amusement at the no-nonsense reporter. He'd need to remind himself to read what she'd wrote once this was all over. The imposing general caught himself for a moment. For the first time since this war began he thought about what things would be like after. In his heart he'd never believed they'd survive, not after the initial shock of the unexpected invasion and ferocity of their foe. Now he began to feel like they not only could win but would win. An optimistic attitude, a sense of destiny, drives success. \"Well, ma'am, however you come up with it, you make sense and I'm glad you're on my team,\" General Daily responded with genuine admiration. Turning to address the rest of his staff in the room he called out, \"All right everyone listen up. New assignment. Our main battle group engaged is to press forward and harass the enemy. In Kill Box 3 I want them to re-engage and regain momentum. I'm taking the 160th and 223rd infantry regiments along with the 221st Armored Cavalry out of reserve to bolster the attacking force. Let's find their main body people and bring the fight to them.\" \"Sir, are you sure that's wise?\" a staff officer questioned hesitantly. \"That's a major troop commitment. It's pretty risky.\" \"Son, we've got the enemy on the run and a chance to break out. We need to let the dog run free,\" the General replied with a grin, looking at Captain Blatchford who cheekily winked at him in return. \"No more half measures, we're pushing the ball into the red zone.\" Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA As the Gulfstream jet prepared for its final descent into the Los Angeles military command area Mike finally looked at the newspaper he'd been given when he got on. He'd spent most of the trip thinking. Thinking about what he'd do next. He had no orders so would report in and see where things took him. He thought about Hector and wondered how the boy was doing. He wondered about his guys, Imlay, Lockett, Doc. He wondered how Harris was doing and if Santos would see the front again. But mostly he thought about Michele. He'd really be asleep at the switch with the whole thing about Amanda. What must she have thought? He shook his head and silently cursed his stupidity at letting it go as long as he did and not emphatically stating his feelings for the woman he shared more then combat with. But then he was reminded there had been a push there too. He hoped that idiot Brooker suffered for it. Too many thoughts. Opening the paper he saw an analysis of the global war effort. It was easy to forget that not only was America at war but attacks had been going on around the world. Maybe the radical Muslims would have something else to hate and try to blow up rather then the US, Mike mused. It appeared the attack on New York City and the eastern seaboard had been contained which meant troops could be shifted to other theatres of operation. A report was given that many would be sent south to Brazil since their forces had collapsed entirely and Rio de Janeiro had been overrun. Already an invasion force was forming to counter. England continued to fair well and the resolve of the English people still existed showing, as they had in World War 2, that any who sought to conquer needed to be ready to pay the cost. The aliens had been pushed from London and were being chased across the channel. Already UK forces were coming to the aid of France who had struggled badly with aliens who stubbornly held Paris and great tracts of land leading to the ocean. Alien water harvesters had been busy pulling water along the coast so English fighter-bombers had been active seeking to eliminate that threat. Japan and China continued to co-operate, setting aside their historic differences to counter the serious threat that existed in the Pacific Rim. Other then LA the forces that hit these two Asian countries were likely the largest. They'd fought the aliens to a standstill and were now pushing back. An unconfirmed report was that Chinese forces had used short-range tactical nuclear weapons as part of their counter-attack to break the alien's momentum. The government had been quiet on the issue as had the UN. All hoped there would be a future to address such an action. Perhaps the most interesting story had happened in Russia. Despite their size the former Soviet power had shown at the start of the war that their equipment had been poorly maintained and morale among their military low. At the early stages of the invasion in August the aliens had swept them aside and seemed unstoppable. Large water harvesting facilities had been set up at their invasion point in the Arctic Sea as the aliens pressed towards Moscow. But as Napoleon and Hitler had found in the past, the harsh weather in the north and the resolve of the Russian people was strong and on the outskirts of the city a fierce fight had been put up. Now with assistance from Germany and some of their former Soviet allies including Poland and most notably Georgia, they too were pushing back. Perhaps even more surprisingly, after an initial reluctance to assist, many of the Muslim nations of the Middle East had decided to join the fight. First stamping out the radical terrorist cells in their own nations, proving as many believed that it could be done, a number came to the world's assistance with oil, finances and even some troops finally seeing the need for global co-operation. World War 3 had come as many had speculated it would but the key protagonist had been one none expected. Yet despite the devastation some good things were happening. Former rivals were setting aside animosity for the collective good, nations were working together and a thought began that if they could defeat this common foe the world would be changed in a way only a year earlier none could have imagined. Something the UN had never been able to do was a distinct possibility. War, which often forges nations, could now possibly do the same for the whole world. Mike closed the paper and put it on his lap. \"That would sure be an incredible thing if some good came out of all this crap,\" he said to himself. But they needed to win in order for this to happen he reminded himself. What was it Father Alexander always says? God works in mysterious ways. The 'fasten seatbelt' sign came on and an efficient stewardess dressed in an Air Force uniform made sure it was enforced. Mike looked out the window as the airfield came into view. It seemed to be a hive of activity with troops marching towards Sea King helicopters and supplies being unloaded from trucks and onto cargo helicopters. All around there appeared to be preparations for some major operation. Something must be up. Even from the air, Mike could feel a buzz of excitement. Father Alexander watched the C-11 Gulfstream 2 bank then drop its landing gear preparing for final approach. The sleek passenger jet landed on the recently constructed paved landing strip in the rear area. A charged atmosphere cascaded throughout the staging area as soldiers and materials prepared to be moved to the front. CH53E Super Stallion heavy lift helicopters were taking off in support of the new offensive underway while a convoy of MK-28 MTVR transport trucks drove away from the base. The priest didn't share the excitement, unsure what to tell Mike when they met. Lord guide me in this, he prayed. The ramp of the plane dropped and after letting a few officers get off first Mike emerged. Blinking with the shock of the bright sunlight his eyes adjusted and he saw a familiar sight. Father Alexander. He walked over to the priest and vigorously shook his hand. \"It's good to see you Michael,\" Father Alexander greeted. \"It's good to be back,\" Mike agreed. \"Hard to believe but I missed all this. It looks like lots going on,\" he observed. \"A new offensive is apparently underway. But yes, a lots been going on to be sure,\" the priest replied a bit hesitantly. Mike grimaced, believing he knew what the man referred to. \"Yea, I can imagine. Listen, thanks again for looking after things here. I appreciate you giving me the head's up about what was happening. That whole tour was weird, totally surreal. It was like nothing was going on in the rest of the country. Anyway, I know I have some things to make right.\" Father Alexander still wasn't sure how to reply. For the first time the articulate minister was at a loss for words. \"I don't have new orders yet so I'm in limbo,\" Mike continued, missing the awkward silence. \"I thought I'd go see Michele.\" \"Michael, I'm not sure that's such a good idea right now.\" \"I know I have some explaining to do but I'm sure we can sort it out,\" Mike answered, ready to push forward. \"I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I think its time to settle down.\" \"Wait, you should think about it,\" Father Alexander cautioned. Mike's concentration was broken by the sight of a Marine corporal he knew driving by in a Humvee. \"Hey, Schmidty,\" he called out waving the vehicle to a stop. The pair greeted each other then Mike asked, \"Can you give me a lift to the civie town?\" Jumping in, before the vehicle left Mike called back, \"Sorry to cut you off like that Father Alexander. I know you were trying to tell me something but I need to grab this chance. When I get back lets have a coffee and get caught up.\" The priest froze, the words still forming on his lips but it was too late. In anguish for his friend and how he'd not warned him, he sunk to a knee doing the only thing he could think of at the time. He prayed. Mike got dropped off near the hospital. He thought he'd find her there since it was still early in the day. He was so excited to see Michele again butterflies fluttered about in his stomach. Mike felt like he was back in high school about to go on a big date. He remembered borrowing Grandpappy's car, cleaning and shining it before going to get the girl of his dreams. The stuff with Amanda had been bound to cause some concern with Michele but he was confident he could explain and get things back on track. He loved her and he believed she loved him. That was all that mattered. Spotting a desert flower growing on the side of the path he plucked it spontaneously and took it to give to her. Happily pushing through the front doors he entered in and took a quick look around. He was again surprised at how the facility had grown over the past several months. It was a big change from when he'd been there as a patient. Seeing a nurse he knew to have become a friend of Michele's lately he went over to find out where she was, the flower clutched in his hand. \"Hi Kelly!\" he greeted her enthusiastically. \"Is Michele around?\" \"Uhm, hi Mike,\" she returned the greeting, avoiding his look. \"No, she's not here right now.\" \"Any idea when she'll be back?\" \"Sorry, I'm not sure of that either,\" the nurse answered evasively. \"No troubles,\" Mike replied lightly, missing the nurse's discomfort, \"I've got someone else I need to see. I'll be back in a bit. If she does show up, let her know I'll be back and would like to see her.\" Mike turned around and walked out, a spring in his stride, missing the pained look on Kelly's face. Rather then try to find a ride into the residential area he decided to walk. It was a warm fall day, the sun shone and it felt good to stretch his legs after the plane ride and weeks of inactivity on the speaking circuit. It gave him a chance to think some more about how surreal things were turning out. Six months earlier, still haunted by the ghosts of Afghanistan, he was ready to retire with no plan or sense of purpose in his life. Now not only had he been awarded a yet unreceived Congressional Medal of Honor, he was in all the way. The ghosts had been exorcised; he'd made amends with Lockett's brother and met the woman of his dreams. Life was good! Rounding the corner to come onto Hector's street he thought back to how things had gone the last time they were together. He needed to make things right with the boy and help him see a future too. He'd had some thoughts about that he wanted to share. One step at a time , he reminded himself. It took only one knock on the plywood door for it to be opened. Hector came out of the darkness into the light of the day. Mike involuntarily took a step back in shock at the sight of how poorly the boy looked. He'd lost weight but the alarming thing was the boy's once lively eyes had a dull sheen to them. Then Hector perked up at seeing the Marine standing before him. \"Staff Sergeant, you came back!\" he cried, stepping forward to bury his head into Mike's chest in a big hug. \"I was afraid you'd forgotten.\" \"I'd never forget you sport,\" Mike responded, returning the embrace and finding his voice choking. \"How could I forget you? Its just I've been on the front lines for a bit then I got sent away for a while.\" \"Yea, I saw some of that on the TV,\" the boy responded, face clouding. Mike rubbed the cleft in his chin absently, trying to figure out what was going on. \"Listen, the last time I was here things didn't go so well and I think you may have misunderstood me.\" Mike's explanation was interrupted as the door to the home opened and Hector's stern-faced aunt came out. \"Hector, que estas haciendo?\" she asked in an irritated tone. \"I'm not doing anything Aunt Rincon,\" the boy answered tightly. Then he perked up and spoke like he was making a point. \"Look, Staff Sergeant Nantz is back. I told you he would be.\" The Latino woman glared at the Marine. \"I can see that. You appear well sergeant. Bueno.\" Standing her ground she declared, \"You must excuse Hector, he has work to do and does not have time to speak right now.\" The boy looked down at his feet, face forlorn. Mike opened his mouth to speak but the woman cut him off. \"Perhaps you can come back another time for a visit but not today. Come Hector, rapido.\" Taking him by the arm the forceful woman led him away. Anger welled up in Mike. He clenched his fists, gritting his teeth, but knew there was nothing he could do. Not yet anyway. Mike lost the spring in his step as he returned to the hospital. Hector's situation and the deterioration of the boy caused not only concern but remorse in him . I should have done more for him, the Marine chided himself . I should have tried to help him more so he wouldn't have to be in that crappy situation. By the time Mike arrived his spirit was quite heavy. He perked up with the hope Michele was back and could make things right with her. Retrieving the purple flower he intended to give her he walked back into the hospital with a sense of anticipation. Looking around it became quickly obvious she wasn't there. \"Hey Kelly,\" Mike greeted the nurse without the same spark in his voice as a result. \"I guess Michele hasn't come back yet?\" \"No,\" she replied with the same awkwardness as before. \"No she hasn't. I'm…I'm sorry.\" Mike caught the tone this time. \"Do you know when she'll be back or even where she went?\" he asked with a note of desperation. \"I'd really like to see her.\" \"No…no I can't help you. I'm really sorry,\" Kelly lied awkwardly, her heart breaking for the torn man. \"I know where she went,\" another nurse, a dark haired woman named Libby offered, joining the conversation. \"Really? That's great. Where is she?\" Mike asked with a note of renewed hope. Despite a stern warning look from Kelly, Libby answered the inquiry. \"She went away for the day into the desert with Dr. Chevreau.\" \"What?\" Mike exclaimed, recoiling in shock. \"What do you mean, they're away for the day?\" \"Yea, they're out on a date I think.\" The words hit Mike like an anvil on the head. He had to get out of there. He stumbled away despite the call from Kelly and missed the smirk on Libby's face, a woman who had once been intimate with the doctor and now sought a measure of revenge. As the door to the hospital banged closed behind the hurt Marine Kelly found on the floor the single flower he'd dropped during his flight to get away.[Chapter 27] Chapter 27 – Reactions Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA What was that all about?\" Kelly angrily demanded. \"What do you mean?\" Libby responded coyly. \"You know exactly what I mean.\" \"I told the truth,\" the nurse shot back. \"And why's it such a big deal to you?\" \"And did it need to be said at all? And in that way? \" an irritated Kelly answered. \"You know Michele and Mike have feelings for each other but have been struggling because of stuff. How is that going to help Libby?\" \"Well maybe Michele should have thought about that before she went out with Guy,\" Libby rebutted. \"Yea, okay. That might be,\" Kelly agreed reluctantly. \"But you didn't need to say it and in that way.\" \"He had a right to know, Libby countered. Then a grin crept onto her face. \"Besides, the guy's a hero and pretty cute too. He deserves better.\" \"You?\" The nurse batted her eyes but didn't say anything. Kelly grunted in frustration then shoved the unrepentant woman out of the way and ran from the hospital to try to find Mike, to try to explain to him. But it was already too late. Eyes filling with tears Mike stumbled down the steps of the hospital and into the road almost getting hit by truck. A horn blew as the driver angrily yelled out, \"Hey, watch what you're doing. I could have killed you.\" \"Sorry, my fault,\" Mike mumbled apologetically, trying to clear his eyes. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz?\" the Marine private driving the car asked, recognizing the now well-known soldier. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yea, fine. Listen son, can you give me a lift back to the base.\" \"That would be awesome. Hop in,\" the Marine answered, excited at a chance to meet the legendary figure. Though the pair chatted about the war during the short trip Mike's responses were automatic and without feeling. His time on the speaking tour had given him the ability to talk and respond on auto-pilot. While the young Marine chattered on, excited by the chance to connect with the seasoned soldier Mike sat and stewed about what had just happened. He felt like he'd just stepped on an IED. Worse, that he'd been ambushed. Hurt and confusion gave way to growing anger. By the time they'd reached the base rage had taken over. He wanted action. Thanking his young driver Mike surveyed the hectic scene around him as troops and equipment continued to prepare to leave the staging area for the front. Seeing a group of Marines from another company of the 2-5 prepping to move to the front waiting near dozens of transport helicopters starting to spool up he desperately looked to see if anyone was familiar. Mike's keen eyes recognized one of the officers as someone he knew from his time in Afghanistan. He trotted over. \"Captain Winters, sir.\" He called out saluting as the man turned to face him. \"Hey, Staff Sergeant Nantz! Long time no see,\" the lean officer replied warmly. \"I didn't think you'd be back with us again after your celebrity tour.\" \"I'm back where I belong sir,\" Mike declared. \"Who-rah!\" \"Are you going out?\" Mike asked eagerly. \"Because I'm looking for a fight\" \"That's the spirit, no rest for the wicked huh?\" Captain Winters replied warmly. \"Yes, we are. Got some squids on the run so command's reinforcing the attack. This may be the breakout we've been looking for.\" \"Mind if I hitch along? I could use the exercise.\" \"Sure thing,\" Winter's answered eagerly. \"If you're unattached right now I could really use another good senior NCO. Grab some gear and meet me in that chopper,\" he pointed out. Ten minutes later Mike sat in the helicopter, going back into battle, looking desperately to shift his simmering rage onto something else. Michele couldn't stop grinning. Maybe it was the bottle of wine she'd drunk with Dr. Chevreau, Guy, she reminded herself, or maybe it was the happiness of release. Regardless, she felt light, like some school girl. They'd walked, sat, talked. Just simple stuff. There could have been more, that was made very clear by Guy. Maybe next time. Now they were back at the home she shared and it was time to part ways. \"I had a great time today Michele, you're a remarkable woman,\" the handsome doctor gushed. \"Thanks Dr…Guy. You're not so bad yourself.\" Then, without saying anything, he swooped in, took her in his arms and kissed her hard. She let him, responding in kind, beginning to lose herself in the embrace. Her arms found the back of his head and she went deeper. \"A-hem.\" The doctor leapt back like he'd been shocked by electricity. Michele stood fixed in place, head swimming. Kelly. Michele's friend stood in the doorway with a cross look on her face. Staging area, USMC Forward Line of Advance, Highland Park, LA \"You're going to be working with Sergeant Lipton in 4th Platoon,\" Captain Winter's yelled over the roar of the helicopter engine as it took off after dropping the men at the forward staging area. \"He's a replacement with no combat experience. Most of the company is green. They're reservists called up from other parts of the country to backfill the unit. Bring him up to speed Staff Sergeant, fast. I can't afford any on the job training.\" \"Understood sir,\" Mike answered, looking over at the NCO who seemed to be extremely tense. The sound of small arms and machine gun fire could be heard in the distance punctuated by the occasional boom of an explosion. Mike watched a group of soldiers flinch involuntarily, looking around with almost wild eyes. It seems he was in the right place though he might have gotten more then he'd bargained for. Captain Winters called his officers and NCOs in for a quick briefing. \"All right, we're going straight into the fight on foot. It's about a two klick hump to the front. Staff Sergeant Nantz has joined us for this mission and he'll be working with Sergeant Lipton. We're lucky to have him with us. Watch and learn from him because he's done this before and lived to tell.\" The commander's eyes narrowed giving his face a hard look. \"All right, stay sharp, the area's not secure yet so there could still be squids around. Get your troops squared away and ready for the shit to fly right out of the gate. Questions?\" There were none. All right, let's get it done. Retreat…\" \"Hell.\" The response was less then enthusiastic. The leaders returned to their groups and prepared to move out an almost heavy spirit of impending doom hanging in the air like a storm cloud. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA \"Would you care to explain that to me?\" Kelly demanded from Michele. \"That, it was nothing,\" she replied unconvincingly. Doctor Chevreau had left suddenly at Kelly's announcement, avoiding eye contact and scurrying away leaving the fuming nurse alone to confront her friend. \"Nothing, huh?\" Kelly snorted. \"You know, Mike was at the hospital this morning looking for you.\" \"He was?\" Michele responded in surprise then turned sullen. \"So what if he did?\" \"So what?\" Kelly exploded. \"You love him. You've told me that how many times? You've cried about it. So don't try to blow it off like its no big deal.\" The woman calmed down. \"I don't get it. You say you love him yet you're running around with Doctor Chevreau. I've seen the two of you together the last few days so I can see where this is heading. Everyone can. What's up with that?\" \"Yea? Well he's running around with his gorgeous ex-wife all over the news,\" Michele spat back. Now it was in the open. \"I see,\" Kelly answered evenly. \"I saw that too and I know it has to be upsetting but you should talk to him Michele, find out what really went on. You know you can't believe everything you see in the press,\" she reasoned. \"I know what I saw,\" Michele shot back petulantly. \"Don't talk to me like you everything. You don't know me.\" \"Wow,\" Kelly recoiled. \"I guess you're right. Maybe I don't know you after all.\" \"I think I can run my own life Kelly,\" Michele yelled. \"Okay, I said those things, I said I loved him. But it takes two to be in love.\" \"Yes it does,\" the nurse agreed coldly, but not the way Michele had meant it. \"You're right. It's your life to live. But don't string Mike along, he doesn't deserve it.\" She turned and began to walk away then stopped and returned. \"Oh, he brought you this.\" Kelly handed him the desert flower Mike had dropped in the hospital when he'd left then quickly strode away. Holding the delicate purple flower in her hand Michele stood stunned for a moment. \"Kelly, wait! Don't go,\" she called after the woman but she was already gone. Staging area, USMC Forward Line of Advance, Highland Park, LA Mike went over to the NCO he'd be working with right away. It was time to see what he'd be working with. Lipton didn't seem older then 20 and his face looked a little green. \"Mike Nantz,\" Mike introduced himself, extending his hand. \"Charlie Lipton, sir,\" the sergeant responded nervously. Mike looked at the E-5 and could see he was barely holding onto his fear. This was a dangerous situation for the men in the platoon especially since they were heading into a fluid combat situation. He needed to do something and quick. \"Listen, I'm not a sir. Just call me Mike okay? Are you ready to go?\" he probed, starting the conversation rolling to where he knew it needed to go. \"Sure thing. Let's get it done. I can't wait,\" Lipton answered, trying to appear like a warrior. \"Are you sure?\" Mike responded. \"I mean I know you're new in theatre and this is your first time going out. It's totally natural to be nervous and unsure so don't sweat it if you are. But once we get into it your training will take over and you'll get the job done.\" \"Really?\" \"Yea, really,\" Mike reassured the young NCO, giving him a pat on the shoulder. Can I ask you a question Staff Sergeant?\" Lipton asked, his eyes darting around to see if anyone else could hear their conversation. \"Shoot.\" \"What's it like out there?\" \"Scary. It's a surreal, terrifying experience every time I go into combat,\" Mike answered honestly. \"You? You get scared?\" Lipton responded in disbelief. \"I can't believe it. You've won a CMH. Come on.\" \"Sure. Every time I go out.\" \"No way. I can't believe that,\" the young sergeant replied, still seeming skeptical of what he was being told. \"Why? Because I've won a medal?\" Mike shot back. \"Because I'm still alive? Listen, I'm no different then you Charlie I've just got more time in. The only people who go into combat and aren't scared are the liars and the nut bars. And I don't want to fight with either. This may sound like some line from a bad movie but it's true. Fear keeps you from doing stupid, reckless things. This is no movie and it ain't no video game. There's no room for Rambo's or Master Chiefs in real combat because they don't value life. That gets people killed. The key is to move beyond your fear, to use the energy you get from it to do things you're not able to on your own.\" \"I'm afraid I'm going to screw up, get my guys killed,\" Lipton confessed, getting to the heart of his anxiety. \"That's good. \"You should be scared of that,\" Mike agreed with a grin seeing the surprised reaction to his response. \"It means it matters and you're not going to go and do some stupid John Wayne stuff with your men. They're your responsibility so you should care. Just don't care so much that you're afraid to do anything with them. That does more harm then good.\" \"Okay, makes sense,\" Lipton said with a gulp. Mike moved in close and looked the young NCO square in the eyes. \"Charlie, you're a Marine. Every one of us had to go into combat for the first time. The Corp isn't about to let you go unprepared and unequipped. Captain Winters has confidence and I have confidence in you. You'll be all right. You ready?\" \"Yea,\" Lipton said, without his previous feigned swagger. \"Yea, let's do this.\" \"Good. Just stick to your training, watch your corners and go with your first instinct. The rest is in God's hands.\" The young sergeant thought about what he'd been told for a moment and Mike could see the pressure seem to come off the soldier's shoulders. Now he was ready for combat. \"Thanks, I appreciate that,\" Lipton said with a smile. Already he looked better. \"All right Sergeant now go lead your platoon,\" Mike encouraged. Winters barked out some orders and with a sensible screen of flankers the company began to move forward at a quick pace. Were they ready? They'd find out within the end of the hour.[Chapter 28] Chapter28- Useful The sounds of pitched battle intensified as they got closer so Mike watched Lipton carefully to see how he would react. The talk must have worked because the formerly nervous Marine Reservist had a calm confidence about him, edgy for sure, but the right mix. I'm so glad to be back where I'm needed and I know what I'm doing , Mike thought to himself. The incident with Michele had rocked his confidence and coming so close on the heels of what had happened on his tour that did nothing to assist the growing resignation he felt. At least here he had things figured out. In only a matter of minutes it seemed they'd arrived at the action. Captain Winters halted and the Marines immediately went into a defensive position. All around were the signs of battle. Several soldiers lay dead on either side of the street but a lot more aliens littered their path of retreat. A few small fires still burned while scorched earth, destroyed vehicles and splintered trees marked a spot where pitched battle had occurred. A casualty collection point had been set up off to the side under the cover of trees to keep the wounded out of the sun. Mike could swear he saw Doc Adukwu among those treating the soldiers in need but didn't have time to look closer since Captain Winters signalled for his officers and NCOs to gather after returning from receiving orders from a major who seemed to be marshalling the newly arriving troops. \"Ok, listen up,\" Winters ordered getting everyone's attention. A huge orange fireball leapt into the air followed by an ear-splitting explosion less then two blocks away. \"It looks like we're in time and didn't miss the fight,\" he grinned wickedly trying to relieve the tension among his nervous leaders. \"We're beginning to envelope the squids so we're going to keep pushing them all the way to Lincoln Heights. Our job is to hook right with the Pasadena Freeway on our left flank, got it? We're going to follow Griffin Ave all the way down so check your maps. Our objective is Hazard Park,\" he pointed out, \"then we hit them on the left flank and push them all the way past the San Bernadino Freeway. The situations kind of fluid since this is a running fight so we need to be strapped in once we step off here, understand? So we're going to go diamond formation. 1st platoon, you have point, 2 in rear, 3 and 4 go left and right.\" Cocking his M4A1 carbine he declared. \"All right, now let's get it done Marines.\" The military was still in process of recalibrating all the radios and hadn't finished yet so they would be doing things old-school, with hand signals and verbal commands so as to not give their position away to the aliens who still seemed to be monitoring the old frequencies. Finding their line of advance the company pushed forward, tension high, as they waited to engage the enemy. Mike gave Lipton a wink and nod of his head and the young NCO nodded stoically in return. As the sound of gunfire increased the pace seemed to involuntarily slow as the lead group moved from North Griffin to Griffin Ave drawing nearer to battle so becoming more timid. Not a good start. Captain Winters trotted over to Mike's position at the rear of the platoon where he'd placed himself. \"Staff Sergeant, get up to 1st platoon and get them to push the pace. We can't let this happen. Their platoon commander is a good man but he's got no experience with this. Walk him through it. These guys need to get bloody or they're going to end up dead.\" \"Understood sir. Bring 'em to the fight.\" Mike snapped to attention, every nerve now firing with adrenaline. For all intents and purposes, he would be leading the fight. Mike quickly explained the switch to Lipton and his platoon commander. He gave the young sergeant a reassuring pat on the back then ran off. He didn't need to run to overtake the lead platoon; he could have made it with a swift walk. Moving slow as molasses the Marines were advancing timidly along the quiet street. Though gunfire could be heard to their left all was eerily quiet. There had been some fighting in the area since several buildings burned throwing plumes of smoke into the air and obscuring vision to the front. A young 2nd Lieutenant who didn't look like he shaved yet and an equally young platoon sergeant were in charge. \"Hi guys,\" Mike greeted them trying to set the edgy pair at ease. \"Captain Winters asked me to move up and bolster your numbers a bit,\" he fibbed, not wanting to discourage the men about to get their first taste of combat. \"Good to have you with us Staff Sergeant,\" the junior officer acknowledged. \"Any suggestions?\" the man asked, showing wisdom at bringing the seasoned veteran into the situation. \"I think we might want to shake it out and pick up the pace. Also, I'd break the platoon up a bit, use the trees for cover. Slow moving and bunched up troops are a pretty inviting target. Let's not give the squids something to grab a hold of.\" \"Sounds good,\" the 2nd Lieutenant acknowledged with a look of relief. It seemed evident right off that he was happy to have Mike helping them out. \"Let's get it done.\" The tightly packed column loosened up and began to move from cover to cover while still more then doubling their pace. Now they at least looked like Marines heading to combat. Moments later the sentiment was put to the test. The men on point missed alien defensive emplacements as they neared Hazard Park due to the smoke and anxiety. Machine gun and grenade fire erupted from the place and several Marines were hit. The ground churned up around the soldiers who dove for cover. While three men went down seriously wounded in the initial fusillade the adjustment made only minutes earlier had saved at least half the platoon. Marines looked for cover and returned fire haphazardly with own their weapons. The SAW gunner burned through a whole box of ammo in less then a minute going full auto and not taking his finger off the trigger of the M249. \"Get up!\" Mike screamed at the prone men ducking and weaving as he moved, \"Get up! You're sitting ducks.\" He kicked one in the rear end and grabbed another by the yoke of his tactical vest. \"You're going to get killed if you don't move. Come on, you've got to get moving, the whole company is jammed up behind you.\" Mike's encouragement and the whoosh of an AT4 rocket going past them to slam into one of the alien defensive positions seemed to shake the men to action. With Mike in the lead, firing and moving, one by one the rest of the men in the platoon got up and got engaged in the growing battle. There was decent cover and the aliens hadn't set up good lines of sight to fire since this was likely a hasty defence so the Marines were able to get in close and hammer the recoiling enemy. By the time they'd reached a group of parked cars on the edge of the park the SAW gunner had settled down and began a steady rate of fire into the alien position keeping them pinned down. Pointing to three Marines, one who was bleeding from a shrapnel wound, he ordered, \"Okay, on my signal, you're going to chuck grenades into that main group holding the center of the line.\" Then looking at the rest with him he continued, \"When they go off we beat feet left and hook around getting them with flanking fire. Once they bug out we leap frog forward and roll them back. All right, grenades, now!\" The three stood up and threw in unison. One got hit in the shoulder which spun him around but not before he threw his grenade. In short succession the three went off causing the ground to boil around the main concentration of aliens. \"Now, let's go 2-5!\" Mike stood up and began to run, fanning his free arm to signal the others to join him. He let off a burst from his carbine at an alien who turned to meet them, drilling it perfectly in the center of the chest. The creature went down with a high pitched chirping sound. I guess I haven't lost my touch, Mike thought to himself as he dropped another with a three round burst who had been furiously trying to discharge a salvo of grenades from its wrist launcher. But most impressive to Mike was that he had six other young Marines running and cursing with him but most importantly firing their M16s with cool precision. The main alien position was quickly overrun allowing the charging Marines to fire into several others groups trying to get engaged. The break in their line caused a collapse in the defensive position and so with squealing chirps several officer caste aliens seemed to signal a withdrawal. They began to fall back chaotically away from the charging Marines right into the rest of the company. Captain Winters had correctly figured out the thrust of Mike's quick attack so had adjusted the remnant of the company to maximize the distraction he'd conveniently been presented. Winters set his troops out in a line supported by two M240B GPMGs while the company mortar team had already embedded their tube and was ready to fire. So as the aliens came across their field of fire he grinned wickedly at the gift he'd been given. \"Open fire!\" The whole line erupted in flames as lethal red hot metal slammed into the group trying to escape stopping them short. Several mortar rounds dropped in quick succession just behind them forcing them to come even closer to the deadly line. Caught between the two they paused only adding to the carnage. Mike saw what the captain had set up so halted the men from the platoon with him and got them set up to fire into their flank. He had an idea what the efficient tactician would do. Less then five minutes later he was proven correct. Like a door closing, the Marine company began to push forward sweeping the aliens in their wake forward right into Mike's fire base. Tracer rounds flitted through the air like angry fireflies others hummed like agitated wasps. The rattle of gunfire became deafening and everywhere it was concentrated aliens soldiers fell by the dozens. After a span of only about ten minutes the din of war began to die down. Not one alien stood. Smoking corpses lay stacked up on top of each other like cut cord wood. The sounds began to die down as the soldiers tensely waited to see if there would be a counterattack. None came. They seemed to have broken the backbone of alien resistance. \"Great job guys!\" Mike congratulated the gathered Marines who grinned goofily in return, the stress of their first combat experience flowing out of them. He stood up and looked around at the gathered Marines, some who were bleeding from minor wounds and liked what he saw. These were now Marines ready for combat. \"Movement, left flank!\" an alert private who was watching the perimeter yelled out urgently. \"All right guys, defensive position,\" the 2Lt barked out decisively, \"we're going to hold this line and nothings getting through.\" Mike was impressed with how the young officer took charge. These guys are in good hands he thought to himself as he scanned the line to make sure everyone was ready to meet the new threat. The sound of movement through the haze of smoke was evident to all now. The soldiers braced for the assault to come, hoping they could hold this critical position. A few adjusted their optical sights to try to get a sharper picture as they looked intently at the buildings that provided cover outside the park. \"Friendlies! Friendlies coming in!\" \"Check fire!\" Mike yelled out as a group of Marines started appearing out of the fog. \"Those are Marines coming in.\" More and more soldiers started to emerge. While most stayed in the area others began to probe through. They'd met their objective. They'd not only captured the park but held it. \"Good job guys!\" a couple Marines called out as they passed the now beaming rookies. \"Who-rah! 2-5\" others joined the chorus of praise as they looked around at the carnage of battle that had happened moments earlier. Though grinning himself, Mike allowed himself a small smile and measure of pride in the men around him. But he also continued to automatically scan all around. This was still a hostile area and threats existed. He did catch Captain Winters meeting with several officers. The older officer caught Mike's eye and gave him a wink and nod of approval. Mike allowed himself a sigh of happiness. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, what in the hell are you doing here?\" Mike turned to face the familiar voice and now grinned as he saw Corporal Imlay coming into sight. \"Hey Staffs, what's up?\" Lockett added, a look of surprise on their faces. \"Hi guys, good to see you.\" \"Good to see us?\" Imlay mocked, an incredulous look on his face. \"What are you doing here?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"What I mean is why are you here and in combat?\" Imlay declared. \"I got back from my tour earlier this morning and hooked up with these guys coming in,\" Mike answered honestly. Lockett shook his head in disbelief. \"Man, you are something Staffs.\" \"I'm just trying to be useful, that's all,\" Mike tried to explain. \"Okay, if you say so,\" Imlay responded, still looking amused. \"It's good to see you back. Hey, I need to ask you something…about the stuff in the press...\" he asked awkwardly. \"It was a load of crap,\" Mike responded instantly, knowing where the young man was going. Imlay smiled in relief. \"Glad to hear it. That's what I thought but I wanted to ask. What are you up to now?\" \"I'm not sure,\" Mike responded, happy to move onto to something else. \"I want to be back in the action, that's for sure. Any word on Harris?\" \"Yea, he's good. He's doing some physio now but wants back into action. He may get cleared in a couple of weeks,\" Lockett reported happily. \"If it lasts that long!\" Imlay added optimistically. \"That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that.\" Mike relaxed for a moment, happy to be around people he'd shared much with and could trust. Then he spotted another familiar figure moving with a group of Marines. \"Lt. Gordon, good to see you.\" The handsome African American officer stopped in disbelief, as the others had at the sight. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz? Well you're a sight for sore eyes. I'm glad you're back in theatre.\" \"I'm glad to be back sir.\" \"So are you posted to G company?\" Gordon asked, as if he had something on his mind. \"Naw, I just tucked in with them for this fight,\" Mike answered. Gordon seemed relieved. \"Well, if you're looking for a home, I could sure use you in the platoon if you're interested. I know the guys would like you back and so would I.\" \"I'm not sure what the colonel has in mind for me but it would be great to be back with you guys if I could,\" Mike answered enthusiastically . Useful. I'm finally useful again , he thought to himself happily. \"Well that would be great. Lockett, Imlay, we need to get moving and get into our new position,\" Gordon ordered the other men. The trio said their goodbyes and the others headed off with their company. Mike only then noticed they didn't seem to have a platoon sergeant. Captain Winters called out for him to join him as he returned to the leaders of the company to give his report. \"Here's the deal. We're going to bivouac here tonight and hold this area. We don't think the squids will return but they may regroup and try to push us back. So we'll have max security up all night. But the rest we'll use the abandoned homes to rest in. Command is bringing up more troops and armour overnight. In the morning we'll begin to push again. They want to exploit this opportunity and try to break the alien's line. So keep your guys sharp but get them fed and rested because tomorrow we'll be right in the thick of it.\" The officer turned as if to walk away then paused and looked back affectionately at the men. \"All of you did good today, real good. I'm proud of you,\" his face beamed. \"The men did awesome too. I'm proud of all of you. So look after your platoons and get some rest. We'll have an O group at 0530. That's all.\" Mike spent the remainder of time before it got dark backstopping the lieutenants and platoon sergeants as they set up their hasty defences. Fields of fire for the machine guns were laid out and all would interlock nicely. The company mortar detachment had a good position to cover. Claymore mines and a few traps were laid out and fire team positions established. He was impressed by how quickly the troops adapted and the resolve of the group that earlier in the day had seemed so shaky. Satisfied all was well he allowed himself to begin to feel the fatigue of the day so decided to join one of the sections in a home that had been commandeered. Entering the home he was immediately greeted by the young Marines billeting there and invited to join them. Two of them selflessly handed Mike parts of their MRE's since he hadn't stocked up himself. Enjoying the simple meal he felt better then in some of the gourmet restaurants he'd dined in during his tour. He was with people who were honest and shared the same values, people who would give their lives for him because he wore the same uniform and he'd gladly do the same. Finishing food that had never tasted more delicious he sat back on his rucksack, put his hands behind his head, closed his eyes and listened to the excited banter going back and forth. He was content being among those he loved. He was home. The Pentagon, Washington DC \"Sir, you may want to take a look at this,\" the female Army captain reported to her team leader. \"What is it Gail?\" the Public Affairs colonel she spoke to responded, rubbing his receding hairline. Deep in the recesses of the US military headquarters reports were regularly flooding into the analysis section then routinely being disseminated for press briefings and releases. But one in particular had been flagged for further attention because of a familiar name that had popped up. \"After action report coming out of the Los Angeles Theatre of Operations,\" she answered a look of concern on her face. \"These are yesterday's battle captures. They've just come in from the field this morning. It seems they have some sort of offensive going on.\" \"So? We knew they were looking to do something like that and it's already been reported up the chain. Is there a problem?\" \"Take a look at this,\" she encouraged him, thrusting a printout of one of them under his nose. \"Look at the fourth paragraph dealing with the Hazard Park actions,\" she pointed out. \"Recognize that name?\" The colonel absently looked at the copy of the report that had been sent out in the morning dispatches, a daily intelligence account dealing with what was happening in the field. He suddenly perked up as he looked where her manicured nail pointed. \"Holy crap. It can't be. He's on a speaking tour.\" \"It is. I confirmed its accuracy already. The tour was cancelled prematurely and he was shipped back to LA.\" \"Well how did he get back to the front?\" the colonel in charge of processing raw information coming from the various fronts and turning it into new releases for the press demanded. \"It doesn't say, just that he's mentioned in dispatches by his company commander for helping them in a tough spot,\" the project manager in charge of overseeing the processing of the data answered. \"Great,\" the officer rubbed his temples in exasperation. \"So this idiot goes back into combat. What if he goes and gets himself killed before he gets his medal? How is that going to play in the press?\" The officer bit his fingernail as he pondered the situation. \"This can't happen. We have to do something about this. Corporal,\" he yelled to one of his orderlies, \"Get me the general on the phone. I think he's with the Joint Chiefs right now but tell him this is urgent. Then find out who the theatre commander is in LA. We need to have a little chat with him.\" LA Theatre of Operations Command Centre, somewhere in Los Angeles \"No, I have to confess I wasn't aware of this. Yes, I understand the significance of what you're saying,\" General Daily replied clenching the telephone receiver hard, trying to keep his obvious disgust in check, \"No. No sir, it's not a problem…Yes sir, I'll take care of it personally when we get done with this conversation….Very well. I'll report back to you directly when it's done.\" The powerfully built African American officer slammed the phone down so hard the others in the room involuntarily started at the sound. \"What is it sir?\" Daily's aide asked, knowing it wasn't good. \"That was the Pentagon. Someone in Washington got their knickers in a knot reading an after-action report from yesterday that Staff Sergeant Nantz is actually acting like a Marine again. Apparently that's gotten some generals nervous up there. I guess they don't want to see the guy get killed before he gets his medal. I suppose the other guys dying don't really matter since they're not in the paper. I've been ordered to see he's reassigned to the rear area.\" \"Nantz isn't going to like it,\" the officer commented cautiously. \"Neither are the troops.\" \"No he's not but it's not his choice. I've got to pull him,\" Daily fumed. \"When he's back we'll figure out what to do with this. He's likely out with 2nd battalion. Just find the guy and get him off the line this morning.\" Somewhere in Pasadena, LA theatre of operations The morning had gone well so far. The company had moved off just after first light. The lead platoon had come across an alien patrol. This time the Marines had reacted instinctively and automatically, dropping the half dozen infantry caste troops before they could organize. Mike had been right there helping, encouraging the platoon sergeant. He was so proud of him, like a father watching his son pass his driver's test. Now they were preparing to move into an alien concentration that had formed to stop them. Adrenaline already coursing, Mike couldn't remember when he felt this alive. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz,\" a young private called out breathlessly as he ran up to the now advancing lead party, \"Captain Winters needs you back with the command group right away.\" \"Okay, I'll be right back once we've moved into position,\" Mike confirmed, not really paying attention. \"He said right now, and it was an order.\" \"Right now? We're about to go into a fight,\" Mike questioned testily. \"Right now,\" the Marine answered nervously. \"He made that point really clear.\" Mike bit his lip, angry at the order but knew there was nothing he could do about it. The inexperienced platoon commander looked at him imploringly for guidance. \"Keep them moving sir. Don't slow down and don't let any gaps with the other units happen. I'll be right back when I find out what's going on.\" Mike swore quietly to himself at having to leave just when things were starting to get rolling. He trotted behind the private as they wove their way through oncoming troop's frustration starting to grow. Finally making it to not only the rear of the company but rear of the battalion advance he found himself amongst the supply people prepping material for the advancing Marines. He saw Captain Winters standing with a Major he didn't recognize and several other junior officers so he jogged over to them, throwing up a quick salute. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, come with us,\" the major ordered, speaking for the group. \"You're coming off the line so get in the truck,\" he pointed to the idling Humvee they stood in front of. \"What's going on sir?\" Mike looked imploringly at Captain Winters, not sure what was happening but instinctively knowing it wasn't good. \"We're about to head into some action. The troops need me.\" \"I'm not sure Staff Sergeant but it's out of my hands. This comes straight from General Daily. Listen, I need to get back to my guys,\" Winters said awkwardly, obviously not happy with the situation. \"We wouldn't have survived yesterday without you out there. Thanks.\" The Marine captain walked off with a small security detail and his signaller to rejoin his unit as Mike stood there, mouth slightly open, reeling from what he'd just been told. Just when he finally felt he belonged again, the carpet was being pulled out from underneath him again. \"Come on Staff Sergeant. I know this can't be easy but it is what it is. Time to go,\" the major told him, trying to sound empathetic but instead sounding glib. This couldn't be happening, it was a nightmare.[Chapter 29] Chapter 29-Alternatives \"No way. There's no way you're taking me out of an operational role,\" Mike raised his voice. \"That's not in your control Staff Sergeant,\" General Daily responded testily as LCol. Ritchie looked away, not liking where the conversation was going. Despite the general's sympathy he didn't appreciate the NCO's attitude. Mike had remained silent during the two hour ride from the front to the operational headquarters. At first he'd been confused by what was going on but anger had slowly crept back in as he began to see what might be going on. This was not a reassignment he realized before arriving, they were taking him out of the fight. No, this can't be happening. They'd not let this happen. It must be some mistake , Mike thought to himself, trying to rally his spirits. They'd get it all sorted out. When he arrived and had been taken in to see General Daily his heart began to sink. He'd brusquely demanded to see LCol Ritchie, who still was his battalion commander. The exchange between Mike and the officers had not gone well. He been told he would not be allowed back into combat, the risk of his death too high. \"Please, sir, don't do this to me,\" Mike implored his voice dropping. Suddenly feeling very tired, he fought hard to keep his eyes from tearing up. \"I need this, more then you can ever know.\" Daily sighed heavily, his irritation at the man melting away. His heart was heavy. He couldn't give the man what he desperately wanted. \"It's outside my control son,\" the general finally admitted, dropping the pretense of command. \"I don't like it any more then you do but we all report to someone. I have my orders and so do you. You're being transferred effective immediately from 2nd battalion to Area Headquarters. We'll give you a couple of days to adjust then we'll find something useful for you to do.\" Mike stood stunned at the finality of the order. His shoulders began to heave and he felt himself getting choked up, unable to hold his emotions in check. \"Sir, there has to be another way,\" LCol Ritchie finally ventured to speak, unable to stomach what was happening before his eyes anymore. \"Can't we…\" \"There isn't colonel,\" Daily snapped back. He felt impotent and that made him angry. \"We all have our orders, including you. Just get it done.\" \"Yes sir,\" Ritchie responded coldly. He snapped off a salute then stormed out of the office. The die cast, Mike numbly followed suit, saluting and robotically walking out of the office into the warm fall sunlight, his heart cold as winter in Alaska. \"Damn,\" Daily said to himself as he stood alone feeling incredibly frustrated. Mike returned to his battalion area, not knowing what else to do or where to go. The familiarity gave some comfort but the events of the past couple of days felt like a roller coaster ride at Magic Mountain. The thing with Michele still didn't sit right with him. What was she doing out on a date? He mused. She'd probably heard about the stuff with Amanda, it was all over the press, but he thought that all would have been cleared up. Could she have given up? Found some other guy? he pondered to himself. It didn't make sense. That was bad enough, then to finally be of some use after nearly two months away from the front on his tour and to be pulled off because he was more valuable as a figure head then a soldier made him sick. It wasn't right and it wasn't fair. \"Hello Michael.\" Father Alexander came and sat down beside him. The priest seemed hesitant, not his normal optimistic self. He sat, saying nothing and avoiding eye contact. Something wasn't right. \"I've been pulled from combat,\" Mike declared without emotion, beginning to feel numbed by everything going on. It was too much, overwhelming him like quick sand. \"I heard. That's why I wanted to find you,\" Father Alexander replied. \"I wanted to see if you were okay.\" No, I'm not, but I'll get over it,\" Mike confessed bitterly. Then he saw an opportunity to perhaps have some questions answered. \"Listen, what's up with Michele? I went to see her and she was gone for the day on some date I was told. Do you know anything about this?\" he demanded. \"I didn't know, but I did have my suspicions,\" the priest confessed awkwardly. \"What do you mean you suspected something?\" Mike demanded. \"Well, I saw…no, I sensed…I mean, I….I just suspected things weren't right,\" the usually confident priest stammered, confused and upset himself. \"And you didn't think to tell me?\" Mike exploded. \"I walked in blind! Don't you think it might have helped to tell me something was up?\" he raged. \"I…Michael. I just, I just didn't know what to say…didn't want to believe it,\" Father Alexander tried to explain, miserable at the whole situation. \"That's just perfect. This is all just unbelievable. I thought things were bad on the tour,\" Mike declared sarcastically. \"First Michele, then the military and now you.\" \"That's not fair Michael. It's not like that,\" Father Alexander tried to defend himself. \"Isn't it? I thought you had my back,\" Mike responded coldly, his words cutting like a knife. He turned and stormed away. \"Michael, wait…please, wait,\" Father Alexander implored. \"Leave me alone!\" Father Alexander's head slumped as tears rolled down his cheeks. He felt ashamed and helpless. He did the only thing he knew to do: he prayed. Mike stumbled through the rest of the day, hurt, confused and angry. All he'd tried to do was his best, serve his country, honor his commitments and everything seemed to be falling apart around him. How can this be? he raged at God. Why is this happening? He heard only silence in reply. Then, almost mocking him, he caught snatches of conversations of people he passed, they who were oblivious to the misery he felt, going about their lives. As if coming out of a stupor he realized dusk was beginning to descend and he'd wandered aimlessly into the civilian area. He needed a respite, something to ease the pain, to dull the senses. He found it in a neon sign across the street. Nightclub. He walked into the dimly lit establishment and heard pop music pounding out of the sound system. The place was bigger then it looked outside, fanning out into a triangle. A long bar was on the left with tables scattered around the right. At the back a dance floor sat waiting for people to get lost in the music. Being early in the evening few people were in the place, better for Mike who wanted to be alone. He slid over to the bar and sat down on one of the pleather covered stools. A male bartender wearing a white collarless dress shirt and earrings in both ears approached him. \"What can I get for you sir?\" he asked politely. \"Sir,\" Mike snorted, \"I'm no sir. I'm just a grunt who follows orders.\" \"Okay,\" the civilian answered slowly, taking a half step back, not sure what he'd just walked into. \"What would you like?\" \"A lot of things…a lot of things,\" Mike reflected. Seeing the confused look on the twenty-something bartender he shook his head and answered, \"Get me a Bud.\" Then he paused. \"No wait, give me a Jack Daniels and make it a double.\" Hours later and more JD then he could count, Mike was finally beginning to feel mellow. The music had gotten louder as the place had begun to fill up. The dance floor was packed with people gyrating their bodies, as if urgently trying to take themselves some place else. Mike smiled goofily, the alcohol dulling his senses, mission accomplished. \"You're Staff Sergeant Mike Nantz, aren't you?\" a female voice purred from beside him. Mike turned awkwardly, not entirely in control of his faculties to look square into the painted face of an attractive dark haired woman holding a drink seductively in her hand. She sat on the stool beside him. No, she was perched on it instead, a long leg dangling along the high slit in the tight dress she wore, accentuated by black stiletto high heel shoes. The mid-20's woman's dark eyes drank him in and he, in turn, began to lose himself in the fragrant aroma of her perfume. He sat and stared at her for a long moment, his brain unable to process what was happening. \"You are him, right?\" the woman asked again, a smile erupting on her face. Finally his brain computed. \"Yes, yes I am.\" \"Wow, this is amazing. My name's Libby. You probably don't remember me, but I work at the military hospital as a nurse. I was there one time when you came in wounded. I've read all about the things you've done. You really are a hero, thank you for all your sacrifices,\" she gushed. \"Thanks. It's no big deal. I'm just doing what any of the guys would.\" He liked the fact that someone seemed to appreciate him for a change. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked, changing the subject. \"I thought you'd be...\" \"On the front? Yea, I should be,\" he responded bitterly. \"It would take hours to explain. I wouldn't want to bore you with the details.\" \"I've got all night,\" she answered, looking deep into his eyes. She put her hand on his forearm and left it there. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" Mike smiled, enjoying the seductive woman's touch. Something in the recesses of his brain shouted warning, like an alarm going off, but he mentally turned that switch off. The pair sat and talked and drank for longer then Mike could recollect. He didn't want to remember. He didn't care instead wanting to live the moment. Everyone had let him down: Michele, the Marines, Father Alexander, it was time to get lost so he sat with this woman who hung on his every word seeming to get closer with every sentence. Head swirling he unburdened himself as Libby continued to stare at him, captivating him like some Medusa. Mike next found himself on the dance floor with Libby. Though the song was fast the pair were intertwined in a slow dance as others hedonistically gyrated around the couple. She had her leg wrapped around and in between his to draw him in tighter. Their arms were around each other and her head was buried in his chest. His head was dropped into her sweet smelling hair which was more intoxicating then the drinks he'd had. Mike could feel her hot breath on his chest and sensed himself stirring within his manhood. She looked up at him, longing in her eyes, her arms pulled him tighter, she began to reach up, her lips parted slightly, moist with anticipation, breath shallow, longing. Mike, involuntarily began to lower his head, he closed his eyes, surrendering. He held her tighter as well, feeling her body tighten and press against his. He was prepared to lose himself in this oasis. The moment of contact was inches away. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz? Hey Staffs!\" The voice broke the hypnosis. He involuntarily pulled back though Libby still clung to him. He looked towards the voice and saw to his surprise it had come from Cpl. Harris who was dancing nearby with his fiancée Cherise. The pair moved closer so Harris could talk to them. \"What are you doing here?\" Harris asked in shock as he looked at Mike and the situation he was in. Then, looking closer he got a better sense of his condition. \"Are you okay?\" \"He's just fine,\" Libby snapped back, glaring darts at the couple. Mike's head began to swim as the alcohol seemed to take over. He swayed and almost fell to the floor, breaking out of the clinch. \"Hey, Harris, man…when did you get here? Man, its good to see you out of hospital,\" he slurred. \"Come on, let us take you back to the base,\" Harris declared, getting a confirming nod from Cherise who looked hard at Libby. \"I know you,\" she stated to the glaring woman. \"You're a nurse at the hospital.\" \"Whatever,\" Libby shot back testily. \"Listen, we were having fun so why don't you go back to whatever it is you were doing and leave us alone?\" \"I don't think so,\" Harris answered, stepping between the pair. \"I think its time for him to get back to the base.\" \"Well I don't,\" Libby shot back belligerently. \"Who do you think you are?\" \"A friend who's watching his six,\" Harris replied, standing his ground. The turning to Mike he declared, \"Let's go Staffs. Time to go.\" \"No...I'm okay…having fun…,\" Mike slurred, but not resisting, finding the room starting to spin. Harris and Cherise took the now slumping Mike and began to lead him from the dance floor. Libby intercepted them and grabbed Mike. Kissing him on the lips she whispered in his ear, \"We're not done yet, call me okay?\" She slipped a piece of paper in his pocket, allowing her hand to linger. \"Come on Staffs,\" Harris ignored Libby, encouraging Mike as he tried to stop. \"Time for bed.\" The following morning Michele entered the hospital, desperately searching for Kelly. She had successfully avoided Dr. Chevreau the previous day, spending it instead thinking. She wanted to talk to her friend, if the nurse would still talk to her. The things she said still burned in her mind. Michele had begun to look at things differently and maybe she had been mistaken about Mike. Guy was on her mind. Though handsome there was something about him that didn't sit right. Maybe it was guilt. She needed to talk, to sort things out before she made another mistake. Rounding a corner in the corridor she saw the familiar outline of the woman. \"Kelly, can I talk to you?\" Michele asked hesitantly. \"Good morning Michele,\" the nurse responded coldly. \"Kelly, I'm sorry about what I said to you the other day. I was confused and angry,\" Michele confessed. \"You were only trying to help. Can you forgive me?\" The woman paused for a moment, as if seeking out the sincerity of the comment. Seemingly satisfied, she smiled and replied, \"Of course I do. And I need to apologize as well. It's easy to make pronouncements when it's not your life. I should have been a bit more understanding.\" The pair hugged. \"So what is going on with you?\" Kelly asked pointedly. \"I don't know,\" Michele confessed. \"I'm so confused.\" \"Have your feelings for Mike changed?\" \"Well no. I'm not sure. When he left I was sure but then all that stuff in the papers came up and then Guy has been so sweet,\" Michele answered. \"But you tell me Mike came to see me and he even brought a flower, then all that other stuff. I just don't know.\" \"You should talk to him,\" Kelly counseled. \"At least hear what he has to say. I think you owe it to him and yourself. And besides, Guy has a bit of a reputation.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \"It's not really my place to say…,\" the nurse answered hesitantly, thinking she'd overstepped her boundaries. \"Kelly, please. This is very important.\" \"He has a rep as a bit of a ladies man.\" Michele could feel her heart rise into her throat. \"Really?\" \"Come on. You never heard?\" \"No, I've been kind of isolated from a lot of that stuff. I just haven't paid attention.\" Michele thought back to how their relationship had built and some things started to make sense. \"Have I been a fool, Libby?\" she wondered, pausing to think for a moment. Then burying her face in her hands she cried out, \"What must Mike think?\" \"I don't know, he seemed pretty upset. But love conquers all. You guys can work through it, I'm sure of it,\" Libby encouraged her. \"I have to talk to him, right away. There's been too much lack of communication lately. I'll talk to him today.\" Her bright face suddenly clouded. \"What is it?\" \"I…I don't know where to find him.\" \"I'm sure…\" Kelly's response was cut off by the sound of a loud female voice coming from around a corner in the corridor. \"The guy is totally all man. 100% grade A. Like oh my god, when we were dancing, it was like electricity. I was totally lit up.\" Raucous laughter greeted the comment. \"And it was really him?\" another voice questioned. \"It was really Mike Nantz?\" Michele and Kelly froze as they heard the question. \"Yea, for sure. I think I'd know the guy. I mean his picture is everywhere,\" the voice replied that each of the women realized belonged to the nurse named Libby. \"And he was hot?\" another female voice asked with anticipation. \"Totally. I mean smokin' hot,\" Libby replied enthusiastically. \"What's he like?\" still another joined in. \"Amazing. The guy is such a dream. We talked for a long time and then…well…you know,\" Libby answered demurely. Michele felt like she was going to be sick. She looked to run away, to get out of the place. But before she could leave Libby and her entourage rounded the corner and ran right into the pair. Libby gave them a predatory smile, realizing they'd likely heard the previous conversation. \"Oh hi Michele,\" the nurse spoke familiarly not using her title of doctor. \"I'm surprised to see you here. I thought you'd be…well, busy.\" The dark haired woman made to continue walking on but stopped instead and smirked. \"No offense, but you've got pretty bad taste, passing up Mike for Guy.\" \"What do you mean?\" Michele choked, the casualness of how she said 'Mike' causing her heart to race. \"I guess I shouldn't say that. I guess I should thank you for dumping him so he could see there are others out there who would appreciate him more.\" \"She didn't dump him,\" Kelly retorted, stepping in. \"Really? Then why is she making out with Dr. Chevreau and why is he in a club drinking alone?\" \"I didn't…I haven't,\" Michele stammered, face turning red at the realization others knew about her embrace with Guy. \"Mike and I are…\" \"Finished? That's how I see it and that's how he's taken it,\" Libby declared confidently. \"But don't worry, he wasn't alone for long.\" Michele's face dropped, the words and meaning sinking in. Had her actions driven him away? Was it true that he'd moved on? Libby's cell phone went off. Delicately taking it from her pocket she looked at the screen. \"Well isn't this a pleasant surprise? I think that's him right now.\"[Chapter 30] Chapter 30 – Holding Pattern Before Mike opened his eyes he felt it-the relentless hammering on his skull of someone beating him with a ball peen hammer. Steeling himself for the next inevitability, he opened his eyes and yelped as they adjusted to the light of day. \"Oh man,\" he groaned in pain. Eyes adjusting Mike blearily saw an attractive African American woman with an amused look on her face watching him from across a coffee table. \"Kevin,\" she called out, \"the dead have returned to the living.\" \"Who…who are you?\" Mike groaned. Then it struck him. \"Wait, I know you. You're Harris' fiancée. \"Right you are,\" she answered perkily which made him groan again. \"Hey Staffs,\" Cpl Harris greeted him, coming into what appeared to be a living room. \"How you feelin'?\" Mike groaned and closed his eyes as the hammering shifted to a big bass drum banging in his head. Cherise snorted. \"Serves you right for going and getting all liquored up last night.\" \"Baby, come on. Have a heart,\" Harris implored her to which she snorted and laughed. \"Is there anything I can do to make this go away?\" Mike pleaded in misery. It had been years, likely since he'd been a buck private that he'd gotten drunk like that. It was not a familiar memory and the pain in his head caused a degree of panic. \"Yea, it's called 'don't drink so much'.\" An imploring look from her fiancée caused the woman to relent. \"All right, I'll go and get him something.\" Harris and Mike sat in silence for a moment then the young corporal finally spoke. \"So what are you doing here Staff Sergeant?\" \"I don't know. You tell me. I don't remember much about last night. How did I get here?\" \"No, no. I don't mean here as in Cherise's place. We brought you back. I mean what are you doing back in LA? We saw you at the club and I couldn't believe it was you.\" \"Long story,\" Mike groaned again, trying not to remember. Cherise returned with a glass of water and two extra strength Tylenols plus a glass of V8 juice. Mike choked them all down then sat quietly for a while as the two went about their morning business. About an hour later Cpl. Harris checked in on Mike. \"Feeling any better?\" \"Yea, a bit. Thanks for looking after me.\" \"No problem. I don't want to pry but is everything okay?\" \"I don't know Harris,\" Mike answered honestly. \"I keep trying to do the right thing and yet it seems I keep rolling donuts. I just don't get it.\" The young Marine wanted to press the man but knew better, allowing him to get his equilibrium back. \"Want to try something to eat?\" Mike sat with the young couple, feeling awkward and out of place though appreciative for their kindness towards him. Drinking black coffee and chewing on some dry toast he began to feel better though his head still pounded. The reflective man saw it as fitting punishment for his foolishness. After some small talk an awkward silence fell over the trio. \"So what are you doing off base?\" Mike asked, desperate to chase the demons beginning to haunt him again away. \"I'm on medical leave as I rehabilitate,\" Harris replied. \"With facilities all messed up the docs thought it would be easier this way.\" Cherise beamed. \"Plus it has some fringe benefits,\" the young man smiled in return. \"But another couple of weeks and I'll be cleared for action. I want back in the fight.\" Mike noticed, surprisingly, Cherise's countenance didn't change. \"I'm glad you guys found each other after everything and have had this time to reconnect,\" he reflected quietly. \"We're thankful to the Good Lord for looking after us. I'm lucky to have such a good woman behind me,\" Harris agreed. Mike nodded in agreement but the pain of his own situation stabbed him worse then the hangover. \"What about you? I thought you had a woman?\" Cherise inquired pointedly. Mike choked on a piece of toast, then answered. \"What do you mean?\" \"Cherise, come on,\" Harris implored. \"No Kevin, I'm serious. I mean the one you were all over last night wasn't her,\" the woman answered testily. \"What's up?\" Then it came back to him. Libby…their time together. \"I don't know. She seems to have found someone else.\" Mike felt his chest tighten. \"I don't know. Everything is all screwed up.\" \"And what was last night?\" the woman pressed. \"I'm not sure,\" he answered honestly. Cherise opened her mouth to continue on but a look from her fiancée caused her to hold her tongue. The conversation was awkward after that. Mike wanted to leave as quickly as he could, not wanting to have to think through another thing. So within the hour he was preparing to leave. \"Do you want a ride back to base?\" \"No, the walk will do me good. It'll help clear my head. Hey, thanks again for looking after me,\" Mike thanked him humbly. \"Listen, if you love your woman you have to fight for her.\" Cherise shrugged off the glare from her fiancée to continue speaking on the subject. \"If you're done fine but don't just let it drift away. True love takes work. We know that first hand. You're a bit of a celebrity so you won't have any troubles finding women if that's what you're in to but I don't think that's who you are. If you've got troubles, work them out, but don't give up so easy.\" Mike pondered the thought for a moment then slowly shook his head in agreement. \"Thanks…for everything. See you around.\" The troubled man left, his mind conflicted. Though still addled from the night before that wasn't what had him troubled. The chain reaction that led to the incident was stronger in his mind. The stuff with the military, with the tour, he could discount that. It was politics and he was a soldier. He understood that combination. He'd been in Iraq and he'd been in Afghanistan. He understood how those far from combat made decisions. But all roads kept coming back to Michele. That was within his control. He had a choice here-to give into the fear and anger building over how things seemed to be turning out or do something. Then thoughts of last night flashed through his mind, some things came clearer to mind and he found himself pleasantly distracted. He fished the piece of folded piece of paper out of his pocket. On it was written the name 'Libby' with a heart around it and phone number. He remembered some more. Mike turned the piece of paper around in his hand. He thought about what Cherise had said about other women and began to realize that perhaps he did have other options. The sensations of the previous night and the joy of simple, uncomplicated conversation gave him something to think about. He looked at the name and number again then neatly refolded it and safely tucked it back into his pocket. Returning to base he went to the guest billet he'd stored his gear before wandering off the day before. It felt like a week since he'd been back, so much had gone on. Showering then shaving, Mike pressed his uniform then walked over to headquarters. Though General Daily had told him they'd figure things out in a couple of days he wanted to move forward. Also, he had a suspicion that his situation had already been determined for him and command was only giving him some time to get on the same page. He was correct in his assumption. Moving past the guards at the entrance he entered the bustling command area, talk of the offensive continued to swirl around the busy office as people moved about to support the initiative. Mike presented himself at the orderly desk and the female corporal manning it recognized him right away. It seemed in a way that she'd been expecting him. An Army major, who Mike recognized as one of General Daily's aides, came out of the throng of people to greet him. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz, good to see you. I'm Major Hoyle.\" The tall, barrel-chested officer shook his hand with an iron grip. \"I know the general told you yesterday to take your time but I get the sense you're ready to get down to business?\" \"Yes sir, I am,\" Mike replied with as much enthusiasm as he could muster. \"I'm ready to be useful.\" \"Outstanding!\" Major Hoyle responded. \"First off, I have some good news for you. I'm happy to report that your exemplary service during this campaign has been recognized and so your promotion to Gunnery Sergeant has been confirmed. Congratulations Gunny.\" Boy, they must be giving me a crappy job if they need to promote me to sweeten the deal , Mike thought sarcastically. \"Thank you sir, I appreciate the confidence I've been shown,\" Mike answered to the beaming officer. \"All right, now let's get down to business. I know you want back in combat, I can sympathize with you. I really can,\" Hoyle stated honestly. For the first time Mike looked at the man's pressed uniform and saw the purple ribbon along with several campaign awards. So this guy's not only seen combat but been wounded too. Okay, I'll hear him out. \"Just because you can't be in the fight doesn't mean you can't be useful. You have as much experience fighting the squids as probably any NCO in theatre so we want to put that experience to good use. So, we're assigning you to the training unit. Your job is going to be prepping newly arrived senior NCO's and getting them ready to lead out of the gate. You showed you could handle that recently so it's a good fit.\" \"Makes sense sir,\" Mike answered hollowly. He knew it was coming but to hear the finality rubbed him the wrong way. He really was being taken out of the fight. Hoyle could sense the unease but he had his orders. \"Okay then, report when you're ready to . Wingate in building 3. Good luck Gunny.\" The pair shook hands and parted. Mike went outside and found where building 3 was located on the base. Instead of entering in he walked away from the structure and the people bustling about, found a quiet place and pulled out the cell phone he'd retrieved from his gear. Fishing the folded piece of paper he'd transferred out his jeans, he dialed the number. \"Hello?\" Libby answered expectantly. \"Hi, this is Mike Nantz.\" \"Hi Mike! I was wondering when you'd call,\" Libby responded, looking at the gathered women, Michele in particular. \"Sure. Listen, I want to apologize for last night in case I did anything stupid. I was pretty drunk and I'm not sure what I said or did.\" \"You were amazing,\" she gushed. \"I can't wait to see you again.\" Michele grimaced as Libby beamed. \"What?\" responded, a bit confused. \"Okay, maybe. Let me think about it. I have some stuff to sort out and we can go from there. But I did want to thank you for listening to me. I've…I've been going through some stuff and it was good to have someone to talk to.\" \"Okay, until then. And no, it was my pleasure, really,\" she responded. \"Well I have to run. I'll be in touch, good bye.\" And he hung up. Libby looked at the others. \"All right. Well you keep being awesome and we'll see you then. Bye.\" The nurse delicately put her phone away then looked at the collective group who seemed to be holding their breath. Raising one eye brow she said coyly, \"What?\" The ones with her burst into excited chatter, wanting to know the details of the conversation which she feigned to not want to share. They began to move away without saying anything to Kelly and Michele though Libby did give a knowing smirk to Michele before they disappeared. Face reddening and teary eyed Michele didn't know what to do. \"Michele. Don't read too much into that. You know how Libby is. She probably tracked him down,\" Kelly tried to reason. Michele could hardly breathe. She'd determined to talk to Mike, clear the air, and now it seemed like he'd gotten himself someone else. And with all the women in the world it had to be her. She felt herself losing the ability to control her emotions, like a dam about to break. \"Is everything okay?\" Through teary eyes she looked into the handsome face of Dr. Chevreau. \"Oh Guy,\" she cried out. Without a word he took her in his arms and held her affectionately causing the distraught woman to feel like she was spiraling down into a pit. Mike shook his head at the strange conversation. He'd not really thought of connecting with the woman. But her enthusiasm made him reconsider. From what he remembered she'd been pretty hot and was a good listener. Best of all, she seemed uncomplicated. Uncomplicated was definitely something he needed right now. It seems he had something more pleasant to ponder now. With a renewed spring in his step he headed back towards the building he needed to report to. Entering in, he was struck by the difference in pace from the headquarters. People in uniform moved about at a controlled and orderly pace, not seeming to have any sense of urgency. The contrast to the excited buzz in the other building deflated what air had been filling in Mike's balloon from his conversation with Libby. He went to stand before an orderly desk that was manned by a stern faced female Army Sergeant who seemed engrossed in something on her Apple laptop computer. Mike stood there, awkwardly waiting, until she seemed to notice him. \"What can I do for you Sergeant?\" she asked curtly. \"I'm here to report to Colonel Wingate.\" \"And you are?\" \"Staff Sergeant Nantz.\" Looking unimpressed she looked in a file before responding, \"Yes, we've been expected you. Wait here.\" Leaving him to go to the back of the building Mike made a mental note to spend as little time in this place as he could. His speaking tour suddenly seemed to be a pleasant tasking compared to this one. A pudgy, balding man with glasses wearing an Army uniform walked quickly towards him and thrust out his hand. \"Staff Sergeant Nantz! A pleasure to meet you. When I heard from General Daily he was assigning you to my staff, well I was thrilled.\" Mike saluted instead of taking the offered hand. \"Thank you for your welcome sir. I'll do the best I can to live up to it.\" \"Oops, sorry about that!\" Wingate apologized, returning the salute. \"Old habit. I'm a Reservist, as if you couldn't tell, huh?\" he confessed self-deprecatingly. \"In the civvie world I'm a director of personnel with IBM. Anyway, that doesn't matter here. Come with me. I'd like to share with you what I have in mind for you.\" Leaving the stern-faced Sergeant who seemed displeased by the exchange the pair went to his modestly appointed officer. The offered Mike a Brisk which he took and bid him sit down. \"Staff Sergeant, I'm glad to have you with us. I'm sure as you looked around you could figure out this unit is lacking in people with not only field experience but also combat experience. I also can figure out that this is likely one of the last places you want to be. I don't know the circumstances but I can figure that out. It sucks for you but this is an opportunity for me that I've desperately wanted.\" Mike was taken aback by the honestly of the seemingly out-of-his-element officer. I bet this guy's a real pro at IBM he thought. He instantly perked up and began to pay attention. \"We're starting to get a steady flow of troops coming into the area which is good but few of them have any combat experience and none against the alien threat. This has caused some pretty major problems and higher then acceptable casualties as a result.\" Mike could attest to this and appreciated the accurate assessment. This rear-area guy was doing his homework and seemed to have a good grip on the situation. Point for him. \"We desperately need especially to get the senior NCO's us to speed so they can manage their troops more effectively. This is where you come in. I want you to develop then implement an arrival training plan to brief then prep them for the front. It needs to be quick and practical to they can hit the ground running.\" \"You want me to develop this sir?\" Mike asked in surprise. Never had he been trusted with something like this. \"Listen, I'm not going to BS you. I know nothing about combat but I do know about quality people and you are one, Grade A. You are a gift from God to me and you can do some real good to the war effort here, more then you could on the front. Are you effective leading? No one is going to argue that. But think of the impact of training potentially hundreds of NCOs in your methods.\" Mike was stunned by the implications. He'd never thought about it before. But this seemingly unremarkable reservist had been switched on enough to figure out the big picture. He was embarrassed for how he'd judged the admin Colonel. Now the choice is yours,\" Wingate told him frankly. \"I'm not going to dog you, and I won't report it up the chain if you decide to mail it in because this wasn't your choice. Maybe I'm too corporate for the military but you're a big boy and you need to make up your own mind. I need you for this and I want you for it. But I also want your co-operation on this project not some coerced toady. Am I clear on this?\" Mike was stunned by the declaration. He was not only being given a choice, he was needed. Looking around the room he could see the reality of the situation. Thinking back to his experience the other day with young Sergeant Lipton he could see not only the need but urgency. This was an honorable calling, one he could sink his teeth into. \"Yes sir!\" he sat ramrod straight, filled with resolve. He had the chance to shape the early combat experience of potentially thousands of men, saving lives and helping the war effort. He'd been selfish. This unassuming man he'd written off had not only shown him this but challenged him to do something about it. \"So, are you on board?\" Wingate asked pointedly. \"I'm your man sir,\" Mike answered enthusiastically. \"All right then, let's get down to work.\"[Chapter 31] Chapter 31 –Things not as they appear Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Michele sat rolling the foam cup holding cold coffee around in her hands. The troubled woman looked intently at the dimples in the cup, avoiding the captivating eyes trying to ensnare her. The pair had been sitting in the coffee shop for two hours since Michele had overheard the conversation on the phone between Mike and Libby. At first she had denied it bothered her but the patient doctor had steadily chipped away at her tough exterior façade. She'd begun to cry, something she'd pledged not to do with him around at this point. She wanted to get away from everyone, to clear her head and collect her thoughts. Unfortunately he wouldn't leave and she didn't have the strength or will to walk away. It would be so easy to give in, to drink deep of the pool of affection he offered, to lose herself. Yet something inside of her would not let go, would not cross the line. Was it stubbornness? Ignorance? Or something more? She needed to think. \"I know you're troubled, Michele,\" Dr. Chevreau said understandingly. \"To be conflicted is natural considering everything you've gone through. But I want you to consider this: where does affection end and obligation begin?\" \"What do you mean by that?\" she asked, confused yet curious about the strange question. \"It's simple really. This soldier saved your life. He's handsome; you're vulnerable having gone through a trauma. Are you attracted to him? Of course, but what's the motivation? Is there a depth of feeling or is there something more? That puts me at a disadvantage.\" \"How so?\" She was getting drawn in. \"Well, I have nothing to recommend me to you other then my feelings.\" Michele physically sat back in her chair as if she'd been pushed. Was this true? Were her feelings for Mike based on what he'd done? She'd often thought that if they'd met in different circumstances things would have been different. \"Then there's his feelings,\" Guy continued. \"What do you mean by that?\" \"He saved your life, he protected you, even got wounded for you. Don't you think that creates a strong reaction?\" he reasoned. \"Well yes, of course. Its natural,\" she had to admit. \"Yes, but think of the long-term implications. Does it last if this is what it's based on?\" \"You might have a point.\" The doctor satisfied smile didn't reveal the chess game he seemed to be playing but the next statement did. Confident he had the woman in checkmate he moved to muddy the water just a little bit more. \"And besides, he's a soldier.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" Michele asked pointedly, a cautionary tone in her voice that the confident doctor missed. \"I mean they have certain character traits. It makes them effective in combat, desperately needed really in times like this, but beyond…well, you told me about his being out with Libby,\" Guy added not able to suppress a smirk. Something snapped in Michele, like a light switch had gone on. This man who had never put his life at risk for anything was making character judgments on not just Mike but those who were sacrificing their lives for him to have the luxury of these opinions. Suddenly he didn't seem quite so handsome. \"Guy, I need to go,\" she declared, pushing her chair back. \"I have some things to think about.\" Instinctively knowing he may have overplayed his hand, Guy tried to backtrack. \"Listen, Michele, I'm upset because you're upset. If I said anything to hurt you, please forgive me. I care about you, deeply, and want to be with you.\" He shot forward, taking her hands in his and gripped them, looking deep into her eyes. \"Please, I want to be with you. I know I'm not perfect but I can give you so much and believe I can make you happy. Just give me a chance.\" Michele was taken back by the passion of his plea but not entirely moved. She knew she needed some time alone to process this but already a few things were becoming clearer. She stood and walked away, avoiding the gaze, determined to clear up her conflicted feelings. The first week in his new position went by like the blink of an eye for Mike. He'd thrown himself into the task of developing a plan to prep new NCOs for combat and before the end of the week he'd already had the chance to begin to implement it. No time for scenarios or computer models. It had to be easy, quick and right the first time. Surprisingly, he found the men coming in eager to learn what he could share. Many had combat experience in Afghanistan or Iraq and yet they sat intently listening to his counsel and running through the simple drills and exercises he put them through before sending them on their way. Many were appreciative, thanking him for the insights. One in particular, a grizzled Army Chief Warrant Officer even shook his hand. The next test would be if anything he shared even made a difference or not but at least he felt like he was doing something that could make a difference. Also, he liked working with . Wingate and found the officer a bit of an enigma. The man was clearly out of his element in the military, constantly making mistakes with protocol and such which seemed to irritate most of the staff but he also clearly had a brilliant mind and knew people very well. Despite his clear civilian demeanor Mike found he liked the man and was learning from him. For his part, Wingate seemed to see something in Mike he wanted to learn from so the two spent a fair amount of time together. Libby had called him several times through the week. How she'd gotten his number he didn't know but he found their conversations a welcome distraction. She seemed to hang on his every word and her enthusiasm was attractive. The nurse kept pressing him to get together but he didn't have the time and part of him still wasn't sure. But he knew he couldn't put her off forever, nor increasingly did he want to. No, things were turning out better for him then he'd thought. Somewhere in Alhambra, LA The alien stopped retreating and turned to fire its wrist-mounted machine guns. Anticipating the move Imlay acted faster. Dropping to one knee he directed a burst of 5.56mm rounds into the chest area of the infantry caste creature. It squealed then crumpled to the ground. Two more aliens off to the leading Marine's right did the same thing but a trailing member from Imlay's fire team lobbed a grenade overhead from his M203 launcher the explosion tossing the would-be attackers high in the air like rag dolls. Imlay smiled despite the action going on around him. They were working well together and making a difference. Lockett and his fire team moved through to the next bound, the steady pop pop pop from his M4A1 setting the tone. The 2-5 had been pushing the aliens forward all morning. The squids had seemed to break again so had been falling back in disarray block by block. The pace had been rapid though and units began to get separated in the chase. For the Marines of Lt. Gordon's platoon they were advancing towards a Target store. The parking lot to their front now visible on the horizon was still scattered with abandoned cars. A pair of low-rise buildings burned off to the left throwing a plume of smoke up into the air. A steady breeze blowing from the east though carried a wispy grey fog over the soldier's line of advance, obscuring visibility and making it more difficult for them to see. Things got suddenly quiet after the cat-and-mouse game of seek and destroy that had been going on all morning. Imlay moved up parallel with Lockett to confer since they were leading the advance. \"Hard to see through the smoke,\" Lockett commented tensely. \"You're right brother,\" Imlay agreed. \"Those buildings sure are throwing it off.\" \"Ready to move the next bound? I'll take us up to the edge of the objective and you take us through.\" Imlay nodded his head and the group stood up to move but something didn't sit right in the seasoned combat veterans mind. \"Hold position,\" he yelled out, then spoke into the microphone in front of his mouth confirming, \"Echo-2-Mike, holding. Echo-2-Mike consolidating position.\" \"What's up?\" Lockett asked in confusion. \"The buildings man, how are they burning?\" The light went on for the African-American. \"Yea, we've had no arty in the area or air support. It stinks.\" \"We need to get some eyes on and know what's up ahead before we press in,\" Imlay commented wisely to which Lockett nodded in agreement. \"What are you doing?\" A voice yelled from behind. The pair turned to see their platoon NCO Sgt. Gutierrez come trotting up. \"Keep moving we've got them on the run.\" \"Doesn't feel right Sarge,\" Imlay answered. \"Squids may be up to something.\" \"No way. We've got them on the run. There's no way they had the time or smarts to do anything. If we stop we'll lose contact.\" Seeing the look of concern on the faces of the two Corporals the Sergeant declared with frustration, \"Fine, I'll lead us in.\" \"Shouldn't we talk about this with Lt. Gordon?\" Imlay asked, trying to be respectful but get his point across. \"He's too far back,\" Gutierrez shot back tersely. \"There's no time so get your guys wired up and follow me.\" Imlay and Lockett shared a look with each other in response to the gung-ho NCO's declaration but there was nothing they could do. The Latino Sergeant who had joined them earlier in the week was already moving off with a pair of replacement Marines. \"Let's go, press forward,\" he ordered to the rest, waving his arm for the others to join him. The remainder of those in the front reluctantly got up and began to move towards the open area to their front. They never made it that far. Gutierrez turned back and ordered, \"Imlay, bring the…\" A familiar ripping sound filled the air and the next moment Gutierrez's head exploded from a direct hit like a pumpkin smashed with a baseball bat. The area around the Marines suddenly sizzled with alien machine gun fire. Several grenades were launched in sending the humans scrambling. The two young Marines who'd been with the Sergeant were incinerated by several explosions while the others clambered to find cover. \"Cover fire! Cover fire!\" Lockett screamed as he bobbed and weaved his way around, trying to set the soldiers who'd been ambushed into a defensive position. Aliens rushed out from both sides to flank them, proving the Marines had allowed themselves to get overexposed. Fortunately they had two M249 machine guns up so Imlay directed suppressing fire that checked the alien's progress allowing the others to find whatever cover they could. They were still too exposed though, without proper cover. Several more Marines went down in the continuing rain of fire coming from the surging aliens. \"This is Echo-2-Mike, we need air support on our mark,\" Imlay screamed into his radio knowing they couldn't do it alone and praying someone friendly was in the area, \"we're being overrun and need help, over.\" \"This is Yankee-3-Niner,\" a voice reported back right away, \"we have your position and are inbound to provide close air cover. Pop smoke south and west of your position, we'll take care of the rest. We're four mikes out so hang tough.\" \"We got gunships inbound!\" Imlay yelled out for the others. \"Four minutes out. We need to pop smoke to mark their position. After throwing three smoke grenades, which only added to the fog of war, the beleaguered Marines hunkered down and held on. For Lockett and Imlay that was the longest four minutes of their lives. The air sizzled with intense alien fire, hungrily seeking targets. Then the familiar whomp whomp whomp of helicopters could be heard above the din of battle. Appearing above the trees that lined the street the Marines had been following a trio of deadly Apache gunships popped up to loose a salvo of Hydra 70's from their rocket pods. The ground erupted in flame and explosion as dirt and pavement was churned up. Aliens were thrown about, checking their advance but a covering group directed their fire on the helicopters successfully hitting one. Smoke began to pour from the back and it was forced to limp away to safety rather then stay exposed and risk a crash. The remaining pair turned their attention on the new threat. The air ripped angrily as they let leash their 30mm chain guns. Checking the aliens progress, that allowed the remaining Marines to go on the offensive as others arrived to provide support. Knowing they'd been beaten, but seeming happy for the damage they'd inflicted, the aliens melted into the urban jungle and disappeared. The helicopters hovered around but had nothing to engage. \"Appreciate the help Yankee-3-Niner, we'd have been toast without you,\" Imlay thanked their rescuers over the radio. \"Happy to help, 2-Mike. We don't want you grunts to have all the fun. Happy hunting,\" the leader of the Apaches replied. The lead craft dipped its wings then the remaining pair zipped off in hunt of new prey. Lt. Gordon came running up to the area of battle, anger marring his handsome face. \"What the hell happened up here?\" he demanded. \"We got ahead of ourselves sir and the squids jumped us,\" Imlay answered evasively. \"And how did that happen?\" Neither of the remaining Corporals answered, looking away instead. Gordon could figure it out as he spotted the body of his dead platoon Sergeant. He sighed heavily, already knowing how the loss of yet another senior NCO was going to look. He'd heard the whispers already. \"All right. Police up the area, look after the wounded. We're too banged up to continue so I'll have the Captain rotate another platoon through us.\" Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Mike finally had the opportunity for a break after his hectic transition to the new role. . Wingate allowed him some time off so he decided to use it to his advantage. Libby had been pestering him for a date so he finally relented and would meet the woman later in the day. Though he looked forward to being with the attractive, enthusiastic nurse he'd also been thinking about Michele. He'd not heard from her since receiving his initial information about her though he in return had made no effort either. That didn't sit right with him. There needed to be some sort of resolution to this festering wound. But first he needed to see Hector. That was some unfinished business too. He seemed to have too much of that lately. Regardless, he wanted to spend some time with the orphan and re-establish their relationship. Walking to where the boy lived gave Mike some more time to reflect. So much had changed in the last six months yet in many ways little of substance was any different. He continued to be reactive rather then proactive, trying to deal with what came his way rather then fulfilling any sense of destiny. Destiny? He'd not felt that for a long time. Yet what had he been experiencing ever since the aliens invaded and his life had been turned upside down? This certainly wasn't random. There definitely seemed to be a flow, a direction. But who was controlling it? Was he a pawn in a big celestial chess game? No, not quite that. He could see, as he looked back, that the choices he'd made had an impact on what was going on. Then it struck him. It wasn't an either/or proposition but rather a combination of the two. Mike chewed on that thought for a while and it put a spring in his step. He had a new perspective one that told him it did matter and so did he. Before he knew it he stood before Hector's non-descript home. Suddenly he realized he hadn't contacted the boy's aunt about a visit. He prayed things would go different then the last two times. Hector opened the door without looking. Seeing Mike the heavy air of oppression fell off the boy and his face lit up. \"Staff Sergeant! You're here.\" Then seeing the new insignia on his uniform he exclaimed, \"You've been promoted!\" \"Hi Hector. Yes, they've made me a Gunnery Sergeant. Got some time?\" The boy's sunny disposition faded. \"No, not really. My aunt's not here and I have work to do.\" \"Not here huh?\" Mike answered trying not to show his delight at the report. \"Why don't we do it together? That might make it more fun and we can spend some time together.\" \"Would you really? That would be awesome,\" Hector responded enthusiastically. For the next ninety minutes they worked through the various mundane tasks Hector had been left to do. Mike kept his anger in check at the way the boy was being used by the selfish woman. Not only did he find out the boy was doing all the housework but he also held a number of jobs to bring money in. The unfairness of the situation stuck in his throat. Yet the boy didn't complain, instead he seemed to make the most of whatever fell on him. Mike spontaneously patted Hector affectionately on the back at the thought of the selflessness he was seeing. The boy recoiled as if stung, pain etched on his face. \"What's the matter?\" Mike asked directly, surprised by the response. \"Nothing. I…I'm fine.\" Mike looked at the boy hard and a horrible thought came into his mind. \"Lift up your shirt.\" \"No, really, it's okay,\" the boy answered evasively, resisting the request. \"Lift up your shirt Hector,\" Mike ordered. Sheepishly the boy complied though he looked at the ground rather then the Marine who watched with fearful anticipation. Ugly welts, raw and puffy, marred the boy's smooth back. \"Who did this to you?\" Mike demanded tersely. \"I…I fell down. I was just clumsy, that's all.\" \"Don't lie to me Hector.\" \"I'm not it was my fault.\" The boy was becoming upset so Mike backed off though inside he was seething, anger at what had happened welling up inside. He knew what was going on but Hector would never tell. The tough Marine felt impotent. Their conversation was stiff after that, the realization building a wall between them. A short time later they parted company. Mike needed to talk to someone about this, needed to know what to do. But he wasn't sure where to turn.[Chapter 32] Chapter 32 - Refocusing Mike had sat listening to the attractive nurse chatter on for over an hour. He hadn't had much to say but that created no difficulty, Libby was able to carry the conversation. Not that it was a problem, the conversation had been pretty light which in some ways was good for the man whose mind seemed full to bursting. Plus she wasn't too hard on the eyes. Her silky long black hair seemed to catch the light as it hung straight between her shoulder blades. Then there were her eyes. Deep green pools of emerald that swallowed him up into a land he wasn't sure he wanted to come back from. Those weren't her only appealing features. She had other obvious assets amply displayed. No, not hard on the eyes at all. But something also wasn't sitting right with him. Something in the back of his mind wasn't allowing him to totally relax with this woman. Something wasn't adding up. Try as he might to push the nagging thought from his mind and focus on the woman who was obviously interested in him he couldn't. Then the dots all connected. \"You were the woman at the hospital,\" Mike declared suddenly cutting Libby off. \"Yes,\" she replied hesitantly, unsure of where he was going, \"I'm a nurse at the hospital. I told you that when we first me.\" \"I mean you're the one who told me about Michele and that doctor,\" Mike clarified. \"Uhm, yes, that's true,\" her eyes darted away from his. Then regaining confidence she countered, \"I hope that's not a problem.\" \"I'm not sure. It does seem like a strange coincidence.\" Libby knew she was trapped but she was also skilled at this game so knew how to maneuver the tight turns. \"I thought you deserved to know,\" she countered. \"It wasn't fair for her to be carrying on that way with him and you be in the dark. You've done so much for so many people. You didn't deserve that. So I told you. But I never meant it to upset you.\" She let the words sink in then added, \"As for us, well, I'd just like you to be happy.\" The bluntness of the statement disarmed Mike. The attractive woman stared at him, her big eyes drinking him in. He pondered it for several minutes while she remained silent, continuing to look at him with affection. \"So, you're a pretty good dancer,\" Libby declared, seemingly satisfied Mike wasn't going to pursue that train of thought so changing the subject. Mike snorted. \"Sure, maybe when I'm half in the bag.\" \"No, I'm serious,\" Libby radiated. \"You were great. It was too bad we were interrupted. We'll have to do that again sometime.\" \"Yea, that might be fun,\" Mike replied, but something in her comment made him uneasy. He knew he'd been 'interrupted' by people who cared about him. Unfortunately he didn't remember much about the end of the night so tried to put it out of his mind as paranoia. The next three hours flew by as afternoon turned to evening. It was an altogether pleasant time for Mike. Libby was vivacious, full of life and obviously interested in him. When it was time to leave he walked her back to the building where she lived. It was a clear night, stars filling the sky. Mike never once thought about which star their attackers had come from as he often did, instead simply enjoying the beautiful canvas of light. \"Would you like to come in for a night cap?\" Libby asked invitingly. \"No, thanks for the offer but I have an early morning so I should get going,\" he answered, though tempted. Some things still weren't sitting right with him. \"Oh, that's too bad,\" she pouted a bit, her lips sticking out which made her seem even more attractive. \"I had a great time Mike.\" \"Me too,\" he replied then stuck out his hand to say goodbye. She laughed lightly like tinkling bells at his gesture. \"Well at least we can say goodbye properly.\" She glided in and placing her hands behind his head kissed him hard. The kiss was electric and he found himself responding. His arms found her waist and the two began to intertwine. She pushed his head closer, as if that were possible, as if trying to swallow him. He could feel the firmness of her body, the heat beginning to emanate and the beating of her heart all simultaneously. His senses were alive with the sensations as the woman drew him in. Suddenly, as if blinking and opening his eyes he realized they were now inside her room rather then the hallway and her hands had strayed low and to his hips. \"Whoa,\" he said as much to himself as to her as he pulled away trying to catch his ragged breath. \"Call me old fashioned but I'm not ready for this yet.\" She gave him an intense look for a flash second that he couldn't understand which then morphed into a sweet demeanor. \"Such a gentleman,\" she cooed, lightly running her fingers over his face. \"Of course darling. Whatever you want, we have all the time in the world. I just want to make you happy.\" She gave him a light peck on the cheek and led him out with a pledge they'd see each other soon. Mike stumbled away, a bit unsteady as if he were intoxicated. If he'd thought things were complicated before that was nothing compared to this. The next day Michele was doing her rounds at the hospital. Guy had tried to get in touch with her several times but thus far she'd avoided him. She was still confused, unsure what to do, but thoughts of Mike continued to flood in. It wasn't what he had done for her and her nieces though that was significant. No, it had been later, when they'd been together. She'd forgotten that in the confusion of everything going on lately. There was more to this then simple gratitude. She'd forgotten and felt ashamed. \"Come on girlfriend, don't hold out on us. Spill it.\" The shrill voice coming from down the hall broke Michele's concentration. She immediately saw a small group of female hospital workers huddled around Libby, a smug look filling her face as she looked past them and down the hall to the new observer of the conversation. \"Well, if you really want to know about what Mike and I did last night…\" she let her voice trail off to build suspense. \"You're so evil! Of course we do. Stop holding out!\" . Libby had big news but knew how to draw it out to gain the biggest impact. With a sense of flair the young nurse began to share what they'd talked about and what they'd done during their date. She seemed skilled at spinning a story and had the rapt attention of the small group around her who hung on every word. Michele pretended she was intently looking at the chart of a wounded National Guard soldier who had finished surgery earlier in the morning. But she wasn't concentrating. She couldn't with Libby's star dominating not only the nurse's station but the area. The troubled woman found herself getting drawn into the conversation. Worse still, she could see it unfolding in her mind: she could see the expressions on his face, the reactions to Libby's witty conversation. It was killing her! Why couldn't she be like that? Why couldn't she be carefree and spontaneous? No wonder Mike's not interested in me , she thought miserably. I'm nothing more then a brooding cauldron of emotion . Maybe she should give Guy's offer more serious thought. Kelly was separated from the gossiping group but watched Michele out of the corner of her eye. She could tell her friend was becoming increasingly troubled by what she could obviously hear. The wise nurse knew that Libby was embellishing the story for effect but could also see the impact this was having on Michele. She began to pray silently for her friend that this wouldn't undo some of the thoughts building within. \"And then we…well, you know, a lady doesn't kiss and tell,\" Libby finished cagily. \"But…,\" a listener implored her breathlessly. Libby gave a coy shrug and raised her eyebrow sending the other women into fits of ecstasy as their imaginations ran wild. Theirs were not the only imaginations going off to the races. Michele could stand it no longer. She closed the chart and briskly started to walk away. Where she didn't know and didn't care, she just wanted to get away. Cheeks flushed red hot she didn't know what she felt-angry, hurt, confused, jealous, all of them. The tormented woman felt someone grab her by the arm to stop her. Wheeling around with a retort she saw Kelly holding her arm, concern etched on her expressive face. \"What?\" Michele demanded testily, more embarrassed then angry. \"Talk to me,\" Kelly implored. \"What's going through your mind?\" Michele sighed heavily, the adrenaline propping her up already bleeding away. Tears filled her eyes. \"What do you want me to say? It's over. I waited too long and Libby has him now.\" \"You don't know that Michele,\" Kelly implored. \"Besides, Libby is a wicked exaggerator.\" \"So what? I can't compete with her.\" \"I never thought of you as a quitter.\" Kelly held up her hand to stop Michele from rebutting. \"She's an air head. You have way more going for you then her enhanced features. You love him; I know it so you need to fight for him.\" Michele paused, remaining silent as she pondered not only the statement but the implications of what was being said to her. \"You're right,\" she agreed quietly. \"I've been on the fence for too long. I need to be in all the way or get out,\" she nodded her head in agreement to the statement. \"You've given me a lot to think about. Thanks.\" Mike stewed at his desk, shuffling papers back and forth. He was more confused then ever. Memories of his date with Libby kept flooding in especially their kiss but thoughts of Michele shared equal space. Then there was Hector and the welts he saw on his back. There was something disturbing to that but he didn't know what to do. And he thought combat was tough! . Wingate came in to his office holding a ream of folders. \"You ready for the next intake Gunny?\" Seeing that Mike didn't seem to catch the question the astute manager asked, \"Is everything okay?\" \"Yea, no problem Colonel, we're good to go,\" Mike responded without any zip. The business executive turned Guard officer looked at the NCO carefully, his quick mind assessing what he saw. \"Bull,\" he stated bluntly, \"something's bothering you so spit it out.\" \"Its no big deal, I can handle it, sir,\" Mike responded with a note of panic at his personal problem being discovered.\" \"Listen Gunny, cut the crap. If something's bothering you as much as this obviously is it'll impact your performance. So out with it.\" Mike couldn't argue with the logic and he had to admire not only the perception but also wisdom of the odd officer. \"I just got some personal things to sort out. My heads not screwed on straight so I need to take care of it.\" \"Personal problems?\" \"Yes,\" Mike affirmed, averting the gaze of the perceptive officer in embarrassment. \"You have the right to tell me to suck it up and get the job done. Maybe that's what I need 'cause I don't want to be no drama queen. But this stuff is weighing heavy on me.\" The officer didn't reply, but gave Mike a penetrating look, as if seeing into him. He nodded his head as if satisfied with what he saw. \"Listen, Mike. I need you focused and your head in the game. If you're distracted you're of no use to me. So take some time off to get it sorted out then come back when you're ready.\" \"But I just had some time off.\" \"I don't see that as the same thing and I suspect it only contributed to the problem,\" Wingate surmised. \"So do what you need to do and when you're ready report back to me. God knows you've earned this after everything you've been through and been put through.\" Mike was floored by the declaration and compassion he was being shown. \"Sir, I can't express my appreciation. But I don't know how long it'll take.\" \"Don't sweat it. I trust you. Come back when you're ready.\" Trust. His superior trusted him. That meant the world and a number of things changed at that instant for the torn Marine. Mike had left his office with the blessing of his boss shortly after that. The compassion Wingate had shown plus the confidence he'd put in him gave the troubled man a spirit of optimism that there was a solution to his growing list of personal problems. Miraculously, he found a quiet spot on the base away from the hustle and bustle of activity at the back of a vehicle repair faculty and sat down to think this all through. For several hours he pondered and mused but things continued to be cloudy. The Marine knew he couldn't do it alone, he needed some guidance. But who to turn to? Whether he'd been praying or just meditating he didn't know but a name came to mind almost immediately. He tried to press it away considering all that had happened between them. Yet another complication. But it kept coming to him, a voice in his head speaking with a growing volume: Father Alexander. Knowing what he had to do, Mike walked the short distance to the administrative building where he knew the priest had a chapel and office. Entering into the dimly lit place of worship he allowed his eyes to adjust. Seeing the altar with the simple wooden cross on it he suddenly felt uncomfortable, knowing how he'd drifted spiritually. Off to the side he could see the priest sitting in a small, brightly-lit office, the door partway open. Embarrassment welled up within causing Mike to feel like he'd stepped into quicksand at how he'd acted the last time they'd been together. He hesitated. How would the priest react? Would he be angry or cold towards him? Maybe he should just leave and figure this out on his own. But then he realized: this is Father Alexander. This man knows about grace and forgiveness. This guy knows God and he lives like it. He walked the several remaining steps and knocked on the door. Father Alexander turned from the reading he was doing and his eyes lit up at what greeted him. Leaping from his chair he bounded to the door. \"Michael, I'm so glad to see you,\" the priest declared, eyes getting watery. \"I thought that after what happened, you'd…\" Mike saw anew the humble character of this man in action. He practiced what he preached and that gave him confidence to share what was heavy on his heart. \"Never speak to you again?\" Mike answered, ashamed he'd acted that way towards the man who'd helped him significantly over the past several years. \"Listen, I'm sorry. I was hurt and overreacted. I acted like a jerk. You were a convenient target so I took my frustration out on you. You've done so much for me, I could never forget that. I just let my anger get the better of me.\" \"Thank you Michael,\" the priest said quietly, \"that means a lot. I'm sorry too. I should have told you about what was going on. I just didn't want to believe it and then things happened so quickly. I guess I forgot that God is perfect and I'm not.\" Mike chuckled. \"I don't have any problem remembering that.\" He paused. \"Maybe the God part but not my part.\" \"Well that's the great thing about his forgiveness and grace,\" the priest replied. \"You look troubled. What's on your mind?\" \"Perceptive as always. It's the boy that I know, Hector. There's something going on with him I can't figure out.\" \"The one you rescued at the beginning of the war, right? What's happening?\" \"He lives with his aunt and she's been making him work way harder then is fair for him.\" \"That is unfortunate,\" Father Alexander affirmed, \"but I don't think there's much you can do about that. It's a matter of choice as unfair as that might be.\" \"There's more,\" Mike confirmed, with a grim look. \"I think she's beating him.\" The clergyman's face clouded at the report and his tone became grave. \"That's a pretty serious accusation Michael. Do you have any proof?\" \"I saw some nasty welts and bruises on his back. When I asked him about it he said he fell. He wouldn't talk about it.\" Mike had trouble containing his emotions. \"If she's doing that to him I don't know what I'll do! I get so mad thinking about it I could…\" \"I understand. To abuse a child, especially from your own family, is a heinous crime.\" \"I feel so helpless,\" Mike confessed in frustration. \"I don't know what to do.\" \"I think I can help you,\" the priest confirmed, trying to channel the Marine's outrage into something positive. \"Even though the civilian infrastructure may be shot this city is under military rule which means the force of law is in place. I know some people from Child Protection. Let me talk to them and see what our options are.\" Our options , Mike thought, he's on my side. I'm not in this alone . \"Thanks Father Alexander that would be great.\" The priest nodded his head in agreement, and then changed subjects. \"What about Michele? What's happening with her?\" Mike winced at the pointed question. \"I don't know. Things are all messed up.\" \"What do you mean by 'messed up'?\" the priest pressed him. \"More importantly, what are you doing to make it right?\" \"It's complicated,\" Mike responded evasively. \"Plus I've met someone else. I'm just not sure the hassle is worth it.\" Hassle? Love a hassle? Well yes, but then anything of value comes at a cost. We're lazy by nature as humans so will settle for less then what we can achieve. If we want something, we have to work for it. It's like with my running. I'd like to run a marathon and not have to train but I do. Love and relationships are the same way. You get out what you put in and that means sacrifice sometimes.\" \"Sure, I know that. But I was down that road with Amanda,\" Mike countered. \"I did the work and it still ended in disaster. Michele is getting so complicated. Libby is simple and that's not so bad.\" \"I was with you when you wrote to Michele before your tour, remember. Have your feelings changed?\" the priest asked gently. \"I don't know. Maybe…maybe not.\" \"Well unless you're absolutely sure you owe it to yourself, and to her, to be sure. The Lord knows you've both been through a lot and are under a lot of pressure. Things have become complicated but love can conquer them all and the reward on the other side of the struggle is something you can't put a value on.\" Mike chuckled. \"I didn't know you were so sentimental.\" \"That's true, I guess I am,\" Father Alexander replied a bit sheepishly, \"but it's also taught to us by Jesus and found in the Bible so it's not just fluffy sentimentality. Michael, I will support whatever you decide but if you don't try to set things right with Michele I can't see you having any lasting peace.\" The thoughtful Marine pondered the idea for a moment, absently rubbing the cleft in his chin. \"You're right. Annoyingly right but right. I do still have feelings for her. I'm just not sure how deep they go. I thought I knew but now…well, there's so much white noise in my life it's hard to know what voice to listen too. I will talk to her though.\" He paused for a moment and for the first time tried to look at things from Michele's perspective. \"I can only imagine what it was like to hear all that crap about me and Amanda all over the news. I can't blame her if she was hurt and confused by it. I do need to clear the air and see if anything is left.\" \"You're a heroic man Michael,\" the priest beamed. \"Not because you fight but because you're willing to see how you've contributed to the problem and then try to do something about it.\" The concept caught Mike off guard. He'd not thought of it that way. All he wanted to do was the right thing. He was beginning to see that perhaps he had more character within then he'd thought. Suddenly, he looked forward to seeing Michele and clearing the air.[Chapter 33] Chapter 33 - Responses They saw each other almost at the same time. The surprise registering on each of their faces was evident to the other. Both stopped, as if sizing up the other in order to determine just what would transpire and a long, awkward pause ensued. Mike and Michele had both resolved to seek the other out in order to talk and try to clear the air. Leaving their respective places of work with determination they confidently went to where they'd hopefully find each other. But as each got closer the resolution began to melt away with doubt replacing. What would they say? How would the other react? Apprehension began to creep in. Then, just about halfway for each, they spotted each other, neither prepared for the sudden meeting but neither wanting to lose the moment. \"Mike, hi. I…I was just coming to see you,\" Michele began, breaking the ice. \"Funny coincidence. I was just heading over to the hospital to try and find you,\" he replied, a knot growing in his stomach. The two looked at each other, neither knowing what to say next. \"How've you been?\" Mike finally asked, not sure where to begin so choosing a safe opening. \"Okay. A lot's been going on since you left but I've been trying to stay busy,\" Michele responded. The strained look on Mike's face let her known he'd misunderstood what she meant by 'busy'. \"I've been doing extra shifts at the hospital plus also been helping with some church groups doing relief work for those who've lost everything.\" \"Good for you,\" Mike said, genuinely impressed. \"I'm glad that after everything you've been through you can still think of other people.\" She was happy for his answer. \"There's a lot who have it way worse then me. I'm just trying to do my part. How about you? Are you back with the guys in your platoon?\" Again, she seemed to have caused the man discomfort. \"No. I've been reassigned to a training company in the rear area.\" Seeing a look of surprise on Michele's face at the unexpected report he added, \"Someone in Washington it seems thinks I'm too valuable as a PR figure to fight so I got pulled off the line.\" \"I'm so sorry to hear that Mike,\" Michele responded, genuine concern etched on her face. \"Are you okay?\" \"It was hard at first,\" he admitted, \"but I've got a good CO to work with and can help prep guys for the front. I guess I'm trying to do my part too.\" The tension seemed to ease though another awkward pause ensued. \"I heard you've met Libby,\" Michele blurted out nervously. \"What if I have?\" Mike answered tensely. \"Nothing, I just heard it. She's very attractive.\" Mike could see the pain this seemed to be causing Michele at the implied comparison. This not only caught him off guard but also impressed him. Still, there was the issue of the doctor. \"Yea, we've talked a few times. I've heard you met someone too…a doctor at the hospital.\" \"Yes. And we've gone out a few times,\" Michele admitted honestly. \"But….,\" she paused, having trouble keeping her emotions in check. \"Oh Mike, everything has gotten so confused. I just don't know what to think anymore these past few weeks. I'm miserable.\" \"Really?\" Mike responded in genuine surprise. \"Really. Ever since the stuff on the news about you and Amanda…and people started talking…things just got…confused.\" Suddenly Mike could see the torment in the troubled woman so forgot his own story and saw things from her perspective. It must have been terrible. \"That stuff…,\" he began. \"You don't have to say anything. You don't…\" \"Yes, I do,\" he cut her off. \"Amanda just showed up one day during the tour. It caught me off guard and I wasn't sure what to do. She did want to get back together. But not for me. She was no different and only was interested in what I represented. It took me a bit of time to figure that out. Unfortunately there was someone on the tour who thought he could get a story out of this so leaked all that stuff and even kept it going once I got my head screwed on straight. I never seriously thought about her.\" Mike then looked down to avoid Michele's intense gaze. \"I only ever thought of you when I was gone.\" \"You did?\" Michele declared breathlessly. \"I did. But then I returned and….found out what you were doing…,\" he let his voice drift, not sure how to conclude. Now it was her turn to feel terrible, seeing the torment she must have caused him when he came back and found out how she had dealt with her conflicted emotions. \"Mike, I didn't know.\" \"And neither did I.\" The two stood looking at each other for what seemed like an hour, not knowing what to say or do. \"Can I buy you a cup of coffee?\" Michele asked, taking a risk by asking but desperately wanting to break the ice. \"I'd like that.\" They found a coffee shop and sat for hours in a corner booth away from the hustle and bustle of the world around them. They talked about nothing in particular, catching up on some topics, sharing thoughts on others. It was light and altogether pleasant. Michele kept putting off leaving, though she had a shift at the hospital she needed to get too. \"I liked this. It was really nice,\" Michele declared, spontaneously grabbing his forearm and giving it a squeeze. Suddenly aware of what she'd done, she pulled back cautiously. \"Me too. I'm sorry we let things get away from us,\" he responded, pushing a wisp of hair away from her face with his hand. \"Can I see you again?\" she asked with anticipation. \"I'd like that,\" he answered with a broad grin. Later while doing her rounds at the hospital, Michele couldn't help but smile. Despite the fact nothing really had changed with Mike and her, the conversation had been a starting point between them and reminded her of how she really felt. A new determination to try to rebuild what they'd once had started to percolate. Despite the Libby-factor she began to gain confidence that she could win him back. Kelly's encouragement to fight buoyed her spirits. \"Michele, can we talk?\" It was Guy. She turned to face the doctor and saw he had an irritated expression on his face. \"I'm not sure Dr. Chevreau. I'm kind of busy right now. Maybe later, okay?\" Michele answered, caught off guard. \"Doctor?\" he replied in surprise. Putting his hand on her arm he asked, \"Why so formal Michele? Is anything bothering you?\" She gently but firmly pulled her arm of out his grasp which he noted. \"No, everything's fine. I've just had a chance to think some things through. Yes, we really do need to talk. How about in an hour in the staff room?\" \"The staff room?\" he responded in surprise. He gave her a penetrating look but Michele stood her ground. \"So be it,\" he said with a sigh. \"I'll see you then.\" Guy turned and walked away in a huff, his lab coat billowing in his wake. Michele watched him leave, saddened by their exchange yet in some ways even more buoyant with renewed resolution. \"So Michele, I heard you had a nice little chat with Mike.\" It seemed to be her day to deal with agitated people. Michele turned to face Libby. The attractive nurse glared at her, an irritated look marring her normally vivacious face. \"Yes, as a matter of fact we had a real nice visit,\" she responded cheerfully which seemed to bother the nurse even more. \"Well isn't that just special,\" Libby responded icily. \"What did you talk about?\" \"China patterns,\" Michele deadpanned as she watched her protagonist's eye's bulge. \"It's none of your business what we talked about.\" \"Fine,\" she spat back. \"You're yesterday's news Michele. Everyone knows it so why don't you just give up?\" Libby pressed, trying to intimidate the woman. \"Mike doesn't and he's really the only one whose opinion counts here,\" Michele answered, standing her ground. \"You're pathetic. You run around with Guy, with Mike, whoever. You're lost and Mike's not interested in that kind of woman. So just step aside and let him be happy and content.\" Despite growing anger, there was an element of truth to what the nurse said. Mike did deserve someone who would stand with him. She would be that kind of woman. \"In a way you're right Libby. I have been torn but now I'm not. Thanks for the reminder.\" Rage filled Libby's face at the comment. \"You don't have any claim on him. He can choose for himself and he's chosen me. \" \"What? You go dancing with him when he's drunk and then out once and you have some sort of connection?\" Michele retorted. \"Mike and I have history.\" \"Sure, whatever,\" she retorted, \"something based on the past. He and I have chemistry and that's…well, explosive.\" \"You don't know anything about him!\" Michele shouted, finally losing her cool. \"You don't know what he's been through. You're only after him because he's famous.\" \"Oh, I know all I need to about him. He's got a lot more going for him then fame,\" she batted her eyes. \"He's got natural assets too that, yea, are pretty appealing. And yes, he is famous. What a great combo.\" \"You slut!\" Michele spat out in disgust. \"That's rich coming from you! You're nothing more then a…\" Libby shot back but was interrupted by Dr. Chevreau. \"Enough you two! You need to get ready to get back to work,\" he ordered. \"Listen Guy, this is none of your business. This is between your little girlfriend and me,\" Libby declared angrily. \"I am NOT his girlfriend,\" Michele spontaneously proclaimed, the sound of it causing a massive shift as reality seemed to crash in. She wasn't and she wouldn't be. She wanted Mike. Guy looked at her with a strange expression on his face and swallowed hard. \"It has nothing to do with your conversation,\" he declared in a clipped tone. \"We need to prep for a massive intake of casualties. They'll be starting to arrive from the front in less then 15 minutes. Something big has just happened so it's all hands on deck.\" Somewhere in Ladera Heights, LA The Marines from the 11th Regiment had been making good progress all morning. They'd begun their push just before dawn and resistance had been unexpectedly light. They'd let LAVs of the already reformed 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion pass them by. With the Highlanders out in front they could relax a bit since it was unlikely they'd be jumped. Other then a few scattered infantry caste aliens their foe had been largely absent. The soldiers still moved cautiously, conscious of ambush, but this had been their experience for the last several days. Many were beginning to whisper that the squids were beaten and the war would be over soon. A halt was called and some of the troops were breaking out MREs to get a snack. A number grabbed HOOAH! Bars and began to munch on them contently. The sun shone making it a pleasant day after the rain they'd experienced the previous two. Being a regiment from California a number began to speak about surfing and the anticipation of getting back in the water once the war had been finished and life could carry on. No one expected things to be totally normal anymore, how could it? It would take a long time to rebuild but there would always be waves and boards. Perhaps the simple things in life would seem more satisfying afterwards compared to the restlessness people seemed to have before the war. A low pulsing sound off in the distance was missed in the din of conversation but a series of explosions and fireballs visible to their front where the LAVs had gone got everyone's attention. \"Incoming!\" a Marine on overwatch yelled. The pulsing sound grew deafening as a dozen alien Wedge Ships flying in saucer formation flew low over the trees towards the place where the soldiers had been resting. A deafening hum built up as the Marines tried to scatter before a concentrated blast of energy erupted in combined fire. The ground boiled with flame as asphalt, concrete and even some abandoned cars flew into the air raining deadly debris. Crisply the Wedge Ships broke their formation and flew out seeking to destroy any humans they could. High-powered blasts from their Direct Energy Weapons systematically chewed up the regiment that was now retreating in disarray. None of the beleaguered Marines took the time to look into the sky to see four more saucers of Wedge Ships flying overhead. It seems somehow the aliens had been able to re-establish air power. The Marines had never seen it coming. And so the units pushing forward to their next objective in the liberation of LA now found themselves the hunted, suddenly obliterated in what turned out to be a massive counter-attack. Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations \"Sir,\" the orderly yelled urgently to General Daily who'd just come back from a run. \"Something major is going on at the front. We need you in the command centre right away.\" Still sweating from the workout but now feeling the pressure of the buzz in the tactical operations area he allowed his eyes to dart around to assess the urgency of what had greeted him. Seeing the frantic movement and hearing the voices yelling back and forth he knew this was no over-reaction. Something major indeed was going on. \"I want a Sit-Rep,\" Daily ordered, accepting an offered towel from a female clerk. \"Sir, the aliens have seemed to have launched a major counter-offensive within the last hour,\" the Colonel in charge of the Operations Centre reported. \"We've lost contact with the headquarters companies of the 11th and 4th Marine Regiments as well as the 41st Infantry Brigade. Information coming in is spotty but best we can figure, massive formations of infantry caste aliens supported by walking guns and other mobile artillery platforms have pushed out from Inglewood at least engaging and it appears routing our elements on a broad front.\" \"What counter-measures do we have to support our troops that are engaged?\" the General asked, gritting his teeth in frustration. \"We've got some Apache gunships helping out plus a few flights of A10's from the 355th Fighter Wing. But that's all we've been able to scare up to help. We also have some B1's inbound from the 7th Bomber Wing but they'll take a while.\" \"What about armor?\" \"Most of that is already engaged and the reserves are out of position.\" \"So we allowed ourselves to overextend and got caught with our pants around our knees?\" Daily questioned rhetorically, already shifting his focus from re-establishing the lost momentum to damage control. \"It seems like it sir,\" the Major responded, avoiding eye contact. \"They've got to have been reinforced,\" Daily burst out in frustration. \"Where did they come from?\" \"Unknown sir. They also have new air assets and are pounding our staging areas.\" Daily swore. \"How did we not see this coming?\" he yelled in frustration. He allowed the luxury of the flash of emotion for a minute then became the cool tactician. \"All right. It is what it is and we need to act, NOW. Get the Air Force to bring their Predator drones in to sweep the area. I need to know what's up with the squids and what we're facing. Also, everyone's going to fall back here, to Rally Point Tango,\" he pointed along the line of the Santa Monica Freeway on the tactical map. \"Give the signal for a fighting withdrawal and we'll consolidate there. It'll give us some good fields of fire and a decent killing zone against their ground assets. I want the 7th and 44th Air Defense Artillery Regiments to move up and support this new position. Get the 820th Squadron to get their birds up flying sorties until we tell them to stop,\" he clicked off. \"Also I want any of the 16th Cavalry you can round up to put pedal to the metal and get there. We've got to hold the line until we can sort out what just happened. So everyone strap in, it's going to be a long day.\" The signal was given to fall back and the units responded immediately, desperate to get back to a position they could hold. Reports began to stream in from various groups and casualties seemed to be mounting. It was all around a grim morning. The headquarters was a hive of activity with logistics and supply people trying to support the effort to shore up the defensive position. By mid-afternoon the units had fallen back to their new defensive positions. The aliens seemed content to consolidate their gains allowing the beleaguered soldiers the opportunity to breathe. Back at the area headquarters it also allowed General Daily and his staff the opportunity to try to figure out what had just happened. \"Sir, Predators coming on station and over target area,\" an operator reported to the commanding officer who still was in his running gear. \"All right. Bring all feeds to these terminals,\" he pointed out the area he was using to co-ordinate the actions of the day. \"Captain Blatchford,\" he called out to his new intelligence chief, \"I want you in on this too.\" The drones flew over the area abandoned by the humans that morning showing live the destruction that had occurred in High Definition. General Daily winced as he saw the smoking vehicles and bodies lying where they'd fallen. Worse still, they caught glimpses of what appeared to be wounded soldiers being executed by aliens as they advanced. \"I want any Special Forces assets we have to insert into the area we withdrew from as soon as they can and bring out any wounded they can find. Make it happen.\" As the drones flew in a search pattern they continued to see a steady stream of aliens advancing to the new front supported by a variety of hovercrafts. For the most part the aerial crafts were left alone though several were shot down by drones. \"They're definitely reinforcing,\" Blatchford stated, adjusting her glasses to get a better look. \"Yes, but from where?\" Daily asked. The reporter turned intelligence chief didn't reply. Instead she looked intently at the monitors showing the live feed from the remaining Predators. \"Look, they seem to be breaking out here,\" she pointed to an area where the Harbor Freeway and San Diego Freeway intersected. \"Let's redeploy some of the drones to see what's down there,\" she pointed down the 110. \"Do it,\" Daily ordered. Several drone operators efficiently tapped away on their computers to send a pair of Predators on the course laid out. Within minutes they had their answer. \"There, see?\" Captain Blatchford pointed out to Terminal Island. They could see at least a dozen large space craft partially submerged on the edge of several piers all disgorging infantry caste aliens in addition to a variety of vehicles. \"What the hell?\" the General choked in shock. \"Where did they come from?\" he yelled out to those in the room. \"I don't know,\" Blatchford replied absently, barely able to breath. Already her quick mind was doing calculations on the numbers they would be facing. \"But they're definitely reinforcing. This changes everything.\" \"All right people, I need answers,\" Daily called out. \"Download satellite images, whatever but I need to know how they got in and how we allowed this to happen.\" \"Sir, we have the 7th Bomb Wing with one squadron of B1b's now on station and waiting for orders,\" an Air Force Major acting as a liaison reported. \"All right, have the Lancers nail their staging area,\" Daily ordered. \"I want to cut them off at the root. Make sure they have a strong fighter screen to get in.\" The liaison relayed the orders and waited for confirmation of receipt of the mission. \"Bombers inbound, they'll be over the target in less then three minute,\" the Air Force Major reported \"Green light. Bomb them back into the Stone Age,\" the commanding general confirmed grimly. \"Valkrie Lead this is Whiplash, you have are clear for delivery. Deploy full package into the strike zone.\" \"How many ships are we talking about?\" Daily asked tensely, trying to kill time. \"Eighteen, sir.\" \"And what are those B1's carrying?\" \"Each bomber is carrying 30 CBU97 cluster bombs,\" the Air Force Major answered matter-of-factly. Daily winced. \"There won't be much of Terminal Island left once they're done.\" \"Cost of doing business sir,\" the Air Force officer replied without emotion. \"So be it. How long now?\" \"Fifteen seconds. We'll get a report from the trailing craft on the damage in probably three minutes. Put it up on the squawk box,\" he ordered a Corporal. Daily watched the clock on the wall almost stop. He hated to do more damage to the city, especially to an area that had a key economic element to it. But this was a cancer that needed to be cut out. \"Whiplash, this is Valkrie Lead,\" the voice coming over the speakers caused all conversation to stop. \"All craft have delivered their ordinance but there is zero impact. I say again, zero impact. Mission is buster.\" \"Say again. Confirm Lead. What happened?\" \"I confirm: no bombs landed in the target area. Its hard to report but there's some sort of energy shield or something around the island.\" The voice coming over the sound system sounded anxious and confused. \"All the bombs just bounced off it and exploded in the air. There's no damage, the hostiles continue to ferry in fresh units.\"[Chapter 34] Chapter 34 – Back to square one Reports started to come in from around the world of alien counterattacks in a variety of countries. In each case they had seemed to be reinforced and were now working vigorously to re-establish bridgeheads at strategic points. In China, England, Australia and the Middle East, forces that previously had been near victory it seemed suddenly faced a fresh onslaught on both the land and sea. Europe was pressed anew and the aliens were expanding their hold in Brazil to neighboring countries. Everywhere, the nations had seemed to be caught unprepared for the severity of attack. In the United States, aliens reappeared in the New York theatre of operations pressing the surprise to their advantage. Fortunately, fresh armored units from the Ohio National Guard had just coincidently come into the area to provide support at the critical time. The breakout the aliens had attempted didn't materialize. The Abrams tanks of the 145th Armored Regiment stopped them cold. Unfortunately casualties among the \"Steel Panthers\" had been high. Still, compared to LA, the New York response had been deemed more successful. Everywhere the story was the same: new alien units had somehow been moved into position unknown to the human defenders to devastating consequences in some cases. The harvest of water had resumed, after several months of inactivity with fresh alien Water Extractors being reported filling as quickly as they could. Speculation began to run again in the scientific community about the impact of the dropping water table. But a more immediate, and therefore important, question was why? It was known the aliens used water to fuel and lubricate their vehicles and soldiers so why the sudden rush to aggressively gather and store more water? Victory, which had seemed to be within grasp only days earlier now stood at a tipping point and could again go in the alien's favor. The United Nations continued to be paralyzed as an organizing body with nations not directly engaged in the fighting squabbling about providing material and military aid. Petty selfishness gave way to a growing isolationism among those who did not see the longer-term global impact. This was a true World War, for the survival of the human race, and all needed to be part of it. Unfortunately, pride and xenophobia still prevailed. The resulting imbalance and disruption of trade placed an enormous new strain on the world economy continuing to make the previous year's crisis in the European Economic Community seem like a spring shower. Yet there were pockets of strength in international politics. Canada continued to vigorously support the United States. Their small, but highly efficient army had contributed significantly in the New York theatre of operations and would be called upon to do so again while CF18's of the Royal Canadian Air Force flew sorties along with their American counterparts on the west coast. In other parts of the world, China and Japan continued to world well together giving the hope for a relieving of tension in the Pacific if they ended up surviving. Unfortunately in the Middle East Al Qaeda has used the recent turmoil to reinvigorate their flagging campaign for control in the vital region, oblivious to the threat to not just their religion but all mankind. The upside had been that followers of Mohammed had finally begun to see these people for what they were: radical terrorists bent on twisting the world to an outdated worldview. Now unsupported by the super powers of the world as they engaged in their own life and death struggle, the people of the nations impacted began to rise up to fight not only the alien invaders but the religious fanatics as well. But if the attackers from a still unknown location were not defeated all these great strides for mankind would not be worth anything. First they had to win. Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations \"We can confirm sir that the squids are marshalling their forces from Terminal Island and feeding them into their counter-offensive from there,\" Captain Blatchford reported to General Daily pointing to several locations on photos that had been taken from the Predator Drone fly-bys. \"We still don't know how they got in without anyone noticing but at this point it really doesn't matter.\" Daily looked at the aerial images of the island that the intelligence officer had provided showing the concentration of alien personnel and resources. He could see that two of the three bridges connecting the 4 ½ square mile island between Los Angeles and Long Island harbors still stood, including the Vincent Thomas Bridge. \"So lets drop the bridges and at least make it harder for them to bring their assets into the fight,\" Daily commented. \"The Air Force already tried that sir,\" Blatchford responded. \"They were able to destroy the Gerald Desmond Bridge but then that damned energy field seemed to be extended to cover them too.\" Daily rubbed his burning eyes. He hadn't slept since before the attack started and wouldn't anytime soon. \"They've not had anything like this before! They didn't have it in the initial attack and we've not seen anything like this before. So where did this shield come from?\" he demanded. \"I don't know,\" Blatchford replied. \"I don't know if it's new tech or something they've just been holding in reserve. But they've got it and its effective.\" \"All right,\" Daily sighed in resignation. There was little point in debating what was. It was time for solutions. Okay, so what can you tell me about this shield?\" \"Very little,\" the aggressive reporter responded with irritation. \"We checked satellite images, thermal scans, everything. All we know is the source of origin is within it, somewhere on the island. It radiates up and out. Though we're not sure of the generators exact location we figure its somewhere in the central part of the island. We've also discovered the squids seem to be able to move back and forth through it, we've got video of that, but so far it's been impervious to anything we've hit it with.\" \"Options?\" \"I'm working on that General,\" she replied tersely, a look of frustration on her face. \"Okay. Keep working on it. This is priority one right now. I need to know how to deal with this thing or we're pooched. What do you have for me?\" he asked his operations officer. \"Well the reports are mixed,\" the third in command answered tensely. \"We've established a defensive line with good secondary support roughly along the Santa Monica Freeway. The squids have renewed their assault but so far we're holding. Casualties have been higher then usual especially amongst our armored elements. Their drones knocked the hell out of us before we could get our AAA up and running. But now it's fairly stable.\" \"What else?\" \"Unfortunately we've committed all our tactical reserve to stem the flood and most of the strategic reserve.\" \"So we've got nothing left?\" \"No much sir. We have some unit's fresh in but just bits and pieces. We've had to pull them from their work up training and send them to the line to fill in some gaps.\" \"Right into the meat grinder,\" Daily huffed to himself in anger. He hated to see the soldiers be sent right in without being properly prepared. It seemed like in one day they had erased months of progress. Worse still, if the line broke they could be pushed right out of the city again. \"So what are you telling Colonel?\" the commander asked, knowing the answer already but wanting to hear it confirmed. \"If they punch through this line they could conceivably move unobstructed all the way to here,\" the Army officer confirmed, perspiration beginning to bead on his forehead. \"All right. Then we need more troops,\" Daily affirmed. \"I've talked to Washington about getting more units but they're…well….they have their own issues to deal with apparently.\" Daily pounded the table he stood over in frustration. \"What issues?\" he screamed, losing his cool. Then calming down continued, \"Leave that to me. We need more troops or we won't be able to hold our line let alone gain any initiative.\" He paced back and forth, considering his options as others waited for him to decide their course of action. The General had never felt more alone. \"We've got to take that shield down,\" he declared definitively. \"That's the key to this whole thing. As long as they can stage without us harassing them they'll be able to counter anything we do.\" \"I agree sir but so far we've not found anything that works.\" \"Okay. Everyone, I want options,\" he called out to the assembled headquarters staff. \"I don't care how crazy or stupid they sound. Be creative, watch old Sci Fi movies if you have to but we've got to get that thing down. Until we've got that sorted out I want the Air Force to concentrate on this sector,\" he pointed on the map, \"and destroy anything coming off those bridges,\" he shifted focus to his Air Force liaison officer. \"Slow the flow. There's only two ways they can get off that island so let's stop them before they can deploy. I want planes flying continuous sorties to keep the squids bottled in. All right, all of you, stay on this.\" The staff officers began to walk away, heads slumped and forlorn. The General looked around the headquarters and could sense the dejection. What only a day before had been a hive of optimistic activity now carried the stench of defeat. \"Everyone, listen up,\" Daily's voice boomed across the room gaining everyone's attention. \"You've all done a great job with this. I'm proud of you. Yes, we've taken some hits but if you all hadn't been tuned in this would have been way worse. Everyone,\" he said pointedly, \"has made a difference here. I know it looks bad but we've been in this place before and we'll come back. We'll regroup then we'll take the fight to these bastards because that's what we do. No one attacks America and walks away from it, hooah?\" \"HOOAH!\" the room erupted in response to the encouragement. \"All right then. Stay at it. I want ideas. I don't care how stupid they sound or about your rank. We're in this together. No let's get it done.\" The tone in the room shifted and people began to work with renewed vigor. Daily was proud of his people but he also knew there was only so much he could get out of them and the troops in the field. He needed help and he needed it now. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA \"So the squids'll use this firepower to their advantage,\" Mike explained the alien weapon systems to the NCO's arrayed around him, \"their tactics show that. They're pretty linear but effective. That also makes them predictable.\" Mike was taking a new group of Sergeants and Warrant Officers through their pre-deployment training and so far it had gone well. They were in a partially destroyed part of the suburbs that had been turned into a training facility to prep the troops for deployment for urban combat. \"So let's do a walk-through to see what it looks like. Then…,\" his voice trailed off as an unexpected Humvee came roared up to the group. An Army Captain hopped out before it stopped and yelled, \"Orders for CALCOMM. You all need to report back to your units immediately. The aliens have launched a new offensive and we need all troops on the line right now. All training is cancelled, you'll be deploying to the front as soon as your units are assembled. Now move.\" He then jumped back in the idling vehicle which sped off to the next group to relay the orders from the Commander of all forces in California. The soldiers scrambled to get back to their companies as quickly as they could without any words being exchanged. In less then two minutes Mike was by himself, consciously aware of how alone he was. It reminded him of how he'd felt in August when the training he'd been leading had been cut short. The same feeling of hopelessness he'd felt back then began to creep in again. The training company office was not its usual hive of activity. People sat at desks or on tables wondering what to do. With all the soldiers who'd been going through training pulled away there was suddenly nothing to do but shuffle papers. The early reports of the losses at the front made that an undesirable activity. Mike seethed as he sat inactive. He'd finally felt like he was getting into a rhythm and now the rug was pulled out from underneath him again. \"Listen up,\" LCol Wingate called, getting everyone's attention. \"With the alien offensive training operations have been suspended until further notice. With the push to get everything to the front you're being reassigned to the supply and logistics group. Once things settle down we can resume our operations here but until that point,\" the balding officer paused for a moment as if wondering if that would happen again,\" that's where you're needed. Tie things off here and be ready to move within 90 minutes.\" Everyone sat stunned at the news, trying to process the depth of what was happening. Wingate saw this and awkwardly concluded, \"Guys, you've done a great job here. I'm really proud of you all. This may not be what you want but you can still contribute there. Give it your best.\" Mike waited for the people in the unit to start robotically following the order before he approached his commanding officer. \"Sir, I don't want to go and count MRE's. I want back in combat.\" \"We've been over this before Gunny,\" Wingate replied in exasperation. \"That's not going to happen.\" \"Yea, but the situation is different now. I want a combat assignment sir, not to be some log wog! They need people who know what they're doing at the front.\" The personnel executive Reservist opened his mouth as if to rebut the comment but instead stayed silent, pondering the request. \"You're right. That's a waste of your talents.\" \"Then you'll assign me to a combat unit heading to the front?\" \"I can't do that, Gunny,\" Wingate answered, avoiding eye contact. \"Why not? You're my CO.\" Mike testily declared. \"Because you're outside my control, Mike. Anything to do with you has to go through General Daily's staff,\" Wingate replied. Then seeing the anxious look on the Marine's face he continued, \"Go see him. It's the right thing to do.\" \"Thank you sir, I appreciate this,\" Mike shook Wingate's hand. \"You're a good officer. I'm glad to have worked with you.\" Yet again Mike was impressed by the unusual officer. \"Good luck Gunny. You're a good man. Don't ever forget that in all this crap,\" the perceptive IBM executive responded intuitively. \"I look forward to hearing what you do with yourself. And hey, if we survive all this and you ever need a job, look me up.\" Mike was buoyed by the brief conversation, eager to get into the action and contribute. He walked quickly over to the headquarters building to get a new assignment. He'd love to return to the 2-5 but at this point he'd be happy with an M16 and a squad leader's role in the North Dakota National Guard. Approaching the single story building he noticed an increased guard and a pair of M6 Bradley Linebacker Anti-Aircraft weapons scanning the sky. Entering the building he was stopped by an orderly in the vestibule. \"What can I do for you Gunny?\" a female Army Sergeant First Class asked tersely. \"I'm Gunnery Sergeant Nantz. I need to speak to General Daily,\" Mike answered, watching the frenzy of activity within the headquarters. \"I know who you are,\" the graying NCO snapped back. \"He's busy right now. What do you need to see him about?\" \"Well…I need him to change my assignment. I want to be posted to a combat unit at the front,\" Mike responded awkwardly to the challenge. \"I see,\" the Sergeant responded unimpressed. Wait here.\" Mike stood shuffling back and forth as people came and went for a half hour before the Army Sergeant returned. \"Sorry Nantz. It's a no-go on the reassignment. You're to stay in a support role and in the rear area.\" \"But…come on,\" Mike protested. \"Listen,\" the Sergeant interjected, \"we don't have time for this stuff, get in1? We're fighting a war and don't have time for your personal thoughts. Carry on and do your job.\" The Marine shuffled out of the building as everyone around him ignored him. Do my job , he thought, that's what I want to do! Why won't they let me? He began to feel like some trophy dog. Sure, they'd take his picture, run his face on TV as a big hero and role model but they wouldn't let him do what he'd been trained to do; what he wanted to do. Frustration built into anger as he walked away disgusted with the system that seemed to be grinding the life out of him. Leaving the building he watched the frenzy of activity as soldiers jogged in formation towards the air field and truck after truck rumbled down the road loaded with supplies for the front. A pair of A-10 Thunderbolts roared overhead. It was a scene guaranteed to get the adrenaline flowing. That is for anyone doing anything. For Mike it only made him feel more frustrated and useless. \"Hi Mike.\" He heard a familiar voice purr his name. Mike turned to see Libby standing a few feet away from him. She wore a tight black corset-style club dress that came down to just past the top of her thighs. The thin strap holding it up seemed to strain to hold her breasts in that stood mounded at the top. Ruffles at the hemline gave it a playful look but the look in the attractive nurse's eyes was anything but playful. She stood in patent black stiletto heels with a hand provocatively on her hip. Mike not only forgot what he'd been raging about a moment before but his own birthday at the stunning sight. \"You look like a man who needs a drink,\" Libby declared with anticipation, knowing she'd caught his eye. Mike looked around at everyone seeming to be going somewhere or doing something but him. Then he looked back at the inviting sight before him. Screw them , he thought. Let someone else count combat boots. They won't miss me. \"Yea, that sounds good,\" he answered belligerently. \"Let's go.\"[Chapter 35] Chapter 35 Times running out The Pentagon, Washington DC The analyst looked at the series of photos that had been relayed from the Hubble Telescope and then looked again. A chill of disbelief flooded over the young woman who had joined up after 9/11, passing up a chance to work for the Rand Corporation to serve her country. \"Sir, you better see this,\" she called out to her section head. \"What is it Captain Dutton?\" Colonel Osprey McLynn asked, coming over to her cubicle. \"Have you figured out how the aliens reinforced themselves?\" \"Yes sir, I did,\" she confirmed. \"It seems they were tucked into a comet cloud and dropped in as it passed earth. The thing with this one though is it may have been mechanically produced to shield them.\" \"Like a smoke screen?\" \"Kind of.\" \"And we missed it?\" \"Well yes, we did,\" she confirmed a bit testily. \"But we weren't really looking for anything like that if you remember. Plus our access to the satellites was spotty. NSA has been a bit stingy at giving access. Apparently there are a lot of people interested in satellite taskings.\" \"Politics,\" McLynn spat out in disgust. \"Even in war we still have to deal with this crap. We're the ones who're supposed to watch space and we're not given the resources we need.\" \"Part of it too was we were spending our time looking down at the earth and not out to space which I guess makes sense,\" Dutton reflected, trying to shift her boss' attention from what should be to what was. \"Anyway that's not really important because I think I've found something pretty big.\" \"Okay, what have you got?\" the Colonel asked, his curiosity rising. \"I was able to get access to the Hubble Telescope's recent captures. I figured if another group came after the initial invasion we might want to see if there are any more.\" \"Makes sense.\" \"It's a bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack but I found something. Take a look at this,\" Dutton declared, pointing to some satellite photos she pulled out. The Colonel adjusted his glasses and looked at the images she spread out on her desk. \"Okay?\" he said, not sure where to look. \"Look at this,\" Dutton circled a cluster with a grease pencil. \"What does this remind you of?\" The electrical engineer officer suddenly caught the drift. \"My god. Is that what I think it is?\" \"Yes, the same type of meteor clusters that the initial invasion came in.\" She pulled some other photos out to lay them beside. \"These are images and scans that we got back in August when they first hit us. Now they're taken closer then these ones but are bang on. There's also another thing.\" \"What's that?\" McLynn asked, feeling his pulse quickening. \"I've calculated their size based on distance away compared to the first ones and they're bigger.\" \"You're sure?\" \"Positive,\" Dutton nodded her head for emphasis. \"Where are they coming from?\" the section head responded, still not wanting to believe what he was being told. \"This is the Epsilon Eridani region of space sir,\" Dutton answered. \"How soon until they get here?\" \"I'll need some more time-lapsed data from the Hubble to know for sure but my rough guess at this point is 12 to 14 days.\" \"12 to 14….,\" McLynn's voice trailed off as the severity of what he'd been told sunk in. Then his head snapped towards a waiting orderly. \"Get the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on the phone. This is a priority one. We need to show this to him right away. Get your stuff together Captain. We're going to the White House.\" Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations \"Everyone, stop what you're doing and gather around right now,\" General Daily ordered tersely, holding a copy of the message he'd just received from Washington. Scanning the gathered group who looked at him curiously he asked, \"Where's Captain Blatchford?\" \"I'm not sure sir, I think she left the headquarters a few hours ago,\" the duty officer answered. \"All right then,\" he responded in irritation, \"this can't wait. We've received a flash message from General Dempsey and the Joint Chiefs. In fact this has gone out around the world. The Hubble Telescope has spotted massive alien movement heading towards earth from outer space.\" He allowed the sobering news to sink in. The room became even quieter then it had been before. No one moved or even shuffled, it was as if everyone had the breath sucked out of them by the news. \"What…what does that mean sir?\" an Army Lieutenant working in communications asked. \"The Chiefs are not exactly sure son. It could either be more reinforcements or it could be civilians coming to colonize. But this we know: it's a bigger group then came last summer. Neither option has much optimism to it. This is likely why they've counterattacked- to push out in preparation for this arrival. Washington figures the squids will be here in somewhere around two weeks.\" \"Two weeks?\" a Logistics Major gasped involuntarily. \"Does Washington know how they reinforced at least?\" an Army First Sergeant asked. \"Yes, they figured out they came hidden in a fake comet trail. They've scanned around to make sure they're aren't any other surprises…\" \"Besides this one sir,\" the Sergeant cut in grimly. Daily didn't allow the interruption to bother him. He understood what the troops must be feeling right now since he shared it with them. \"Yes, besides the bomb I just dropped on you Sergeant. So we know what we're up against and yes, the clock is ticking.\" Then with grim determination he declared, \"I want all section heads to meet in 15 minutes. We need to begin to plan for this new element since you can be sure a chunk of this group will be coming here. And someone find Captain Blatchford, I need to talk to her.\" Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA It was after 9pm when Michele finally finished at the hospital. The day had been a nightmare with casualties non-stop. She'd thought her experiences with the war thus far had hardened her to this type of thing but the volume, severity and misery of the wounded and dying had taken her nearly to the breaking point. In some ways the experience had been comforting to the woman since she'd begun to fear that she was losing her compassion in all of this. Coupled with her personal troubles she feared what she was becoming. This reminded her she did care and still felt. The tears streaming down her face as she left the building bore testimony to that. \"Michele, I need to talk to you about something.\" She heard Kelly calling out to her and turned to see the nurse standing in the doorway motioning her back. \"Today was pretty hard Kelly. I'd like some time alone if that's okay.\" \"Sure, I know. We all do but this is kind of time sensitive,\" Kelly responded with a grim look on her face. \"Okay, so what's up?\" Michele asked curiously, knowing the nurse to not be alarmist. \"Libby's out with Mike.\" \"What? Now? How could that happen with everything going on?\" Michele shot back in surprise. \"That's not possible…you have to be wrong.\" \"No, it's true.\" \"How do you know?\" Michele asked, still not willing to believe the report. \"Because I told her so,\" another nurse named Rosa that Michele recognized as part of Libby's group declared, stepping into the conversation. \"So what happened?\" Michele inquired, suddenly coming out of her fog. \"She'd planned to go see Mike today,\" Rosa reported. \"She'd brought her clothes, shoes, everything in and planned to kind of 'bump into him'.\" \"But how did she get away with everything going on?\" Michele asked, still wary of believing this could happen. \"Everyone was supposed to be on duty.\" But then she thought back and couldn't recall seeing the dynamic nurse all day. \"She said she wasn't feeling well so left,\" Rosa answered, a sour look on her face. Michele didn't want to believe it but knowing the self-centered woman she had too. \"Why are you telling me this?\" she asked, wondering at the motivation of one who was intimate with the woman in question. \"I don't think it was right to skip off like that with all these casualties. It was such a hard day…seeing all those wounded men and stuff…\" Emotion was thick on her voice and her eyes began to well up. Rosa paused for a moment to collect herself before continuing to speak. \"So it got me thinking, maybe what she's doing with Mike isn't right either. She likes to spotlight, likes to have attention. I'm not sure she's good for him. But I've watched you Michele. I've watched you with the wounded and watched you with people. You're different then her, you're a good person. So I wanted you to know.\" Michele was deeply touched by the admission and for how she was viewed. Her heart leapt that perhaps what she was doing made a difference after all. That it did count. \"Thank you Rosa, that means a lot.\" \"So what are you going to do?\" Kelly asked. Michele allowed herself to linger on the glow of what Rosa had said before the grim reality of what she'd been told about Libby settled in. The warm glow seemed to ignite a spark. \"Where would they go?\" \"There's a club Libby likes, it's called Inferno. She'd go there,\" Rosa replied. The spark lit into its own inferno. Despite fatigue and weariness from the day, her senses were alive and she knew what she had to do. She wouldn't give up without a fight. \"Tell me how to get there,\" she demanded with a steely voice. Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations \"Sir, Captain Blatchford's here,\" on orderly called out to the commanding officer reporting the arrival of the Army intelligence officer as he'd ordered. It was nearly 11pm and the Marine General had been preparing to leave to get a few hours of sleep. Spotting the woman walking in with tossled hair he charged over demanding, \"Where the hell have you been? You've been gone for hours and I need your assessment.\" \"That's what I've been doing General. I took a recce of the shield,\" she answered calmly, not intimidated by the imposing African American Marine. \"You did WHAT?\" Daily exploded in disbelief. \"I know you needed a good assessment of what we're up against and video and photos from the drones just weren't cutting it. So I talked a Pave Low crew from the 20th Special Ops squadron that had come back from a SAR flight into taking me to see it for myself,\" she reported with a slight look of amusement on her face. \"That's crazy. You could've gotten yourself killed,\" Daily raged but in growing admiration. \"A good reporter goes to the source of information,\" she responded, nonplussed. \"A good…,\" Daily shook his head in disbelief but then looked anew at the plain-featured woman who had just risked her life going deep behind enemy lines to get him information. \"Okay, so what did you find?\" \"Quite a bit which I think you'll find interesting,\" she adjusted her wire glasses. \"First off, they have all their forces concentrated along the front. It actually wasn't as hard to get there as you might have thought. We stayed a mile behind the Santa Monica Freeway until we got to the Pacific then followed the coast line then hooked around Redondo Beach back inland. We came in low and hard, figuring we might get a pass or two if we were lucky.\" A number of other headquarters personnel had drifted over to hear the story as word got around about what the reporter-turned-intelligence officer had done. \"But there was virtually nothing there General,\" Blatchford continued. \"Other then some light patrols there was nothing else or to the front. Terminal Island is virtually empty.\" \"But what about all those big ships we saw on the drone images and other troops?\" \"They've been moved up. I suspect they fast-tracked them due to the Air Force sorties. I saw a fair amount of wreckage just off the bridges but there's not a lot there.\" \"That's good to know,\" Daily stated, relieved by the information. \"I think we can hold what they've got then. But you may not have heard: the squids have reinforcements coming.\" \"I did hear,\" Blatchford confirmed. \"That's one of the reasons I went to see this shield for myself.\" \"What?\" the Marine General choked. \"And you didn't think to tell me you were doing this?\" \"And would you have let me if I did?\" the intelligence officer asked coyly. Several soldiers listening in the on the conversation chuckled involuntarily at the cheeky statement receiving a glare from the General but he didn't say anything. \"So what about the shield? Did you learn anything useful about it?\" \"Yes, I learned we can pass through it,\" Blatchford stated calmly. Daily did a double-take. \"And how did you find that out?\" \"I walked through it myself.\" \"Don't tell me you…\" his voice trailed off in disbelief, not wanting to hear the answer. \"Since there really were no squids around I thought I could take a quick peak,\" Blatchford confirmed the incredible story. \"We've seen them go back and forth so I thought why not us? So I convinced my pilot to drop down and give me ten minutes to check it out. He gave me five, which irked me a bit, but that was all I needed. I could pass through unobstructed. You can see it when you're there. There's a faint glow but it looks like an umbrella or maybe a mushroom would be a better explanation. A beam of light shoots up and then disburses into the shield. So there's nothing at ground level.\" \"This is incredible. We have the best special ops teams in the world and it takes a reporter to get us the information we need,\" General Daily mused incredulously. \"You deserve a medal for this.\" \"I don't want a medal,\" she shot back harshly. \"I want these bastards dead and I think I have a plan to do it.\" Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Michele saw the red neon sign glowing the name: 'Inferno'. When she'd left the hospital she'd been hot for a confrontation, to put Libby in her place and once and for all let Mike know where she stood. But now, standing outside the club Michele wasn't so sure. She could hear the deep bass beat of techno dance music playing and suddenly felt like she was about to enter enemy territory. Libby had prepared, had dressed for the occasion whereas she had come from the hospital in comfortable clothes and her hair pulled back. Came I compete? Should I even try? Then a thought hit her like lightning. This is what it has been like for Mike going into combat against a dangerous enemy and he never shied away. Suddenly she began to understand something about his character and courage as the same fear and hesitation he must feel each time threatened to handcuff her. The dark haired woman mused about that for a few moments, chewing on the thought and what it meant. He went into combat because he cared. She cared too so would overcome this fear. Resolutely she strode forward, pushing the door open and entering into the club. It took Michele's eyes a few minutes to adjust to the bright pulsing lights and ears to accept the loud sound assaulting it. Why Mike would ever come to a place like this was beyond her and a moment of disgust overcame her sensibilities. Then she saw Libby and knew why. Or more correctly, she saw Libby in a form-fitting black dress and stiletto heels clinging to Mike on the dance floor. While his movement was automatic, almost like he was on a parade square, she gyrated and contorted around his body like a snake, writhing with an ecstatic look on her face. Is this what he wants in a woman? She wondered to herself in disgust. Because that's not me. If that's what he wants maybe I'm wrong about him. Michele stood transfixed in the shadows of the club watching this spectacle for ten minutes. Several times she was jostled by anxious patrons but never propositioned. She felt quite alone as she watched the connected pair moving to the rhythm. \"What's the point?\" Michele said to herself though no one heard. \"I'm wasting my time.\" She turned to walk away and then everything hit her at once like a data upload from the Matrix. She had felt like she was going into combat LIKE MIKE and yet Mike was not in combat and didn't appear like he was going there anytime soon despite the fact that nearly every healthy soldier who could had been moved to the front to stem the new alien offensive. Except Gunnery Sergeant Mike Nantz. The thought hung there for a moment and then she cursed herself for being so foolish to miss it. He was out of his element. This was not his world and maybe, just maybe, he wanted to be rescued from it. She had to find out, one way or the other. Steeling her nerves, she turned and pushed her way through the crowd to the pair who still danced blissfully unaware on the dance floor.[Chapter 36] Chapter 36 – Choices Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations \"So you have a plan?\" one of the area operations officers responded to Captain Blatchford's declaration skeptically. \"Yes Major Cramner as a matter of fact I do,\" she shot back, not giving any ground. \"So now you're a tactics expert too,\" the Army officer retorted. \"Sir,\" he turned to General Daily, ignoring the Reserve officer, \"no disrespect to Ms. Blatchford but that's not her role. She's a newspaper reporter. The Ops group will take the intel she's brought back and have a working solution for you within 24 hours.\" Daily watched the career officer huff at the confident female Captain. \"You know what Major?\" he responded evenly but firmly, \"this reporter has given us solid intel right from the start. And now to boot she goes and does a recce of the site on her own. I think she deserves to be heard and I for one would like to hear her plan.\" Blatchford beamed appreciatively to the commanding officer but also smirked obviously at the perturbed staff officer. \"Thanks for the vote of confidence sir. It's really quite simple. The squids have reinforcements coming so we have to get them before they get us. We need to break their line, deny them a fallback point and eliminate their ability to reinforce.\" \"Oh that's brilliant!\" Cramner snorted sarcastically. \"It's just that simple huh? Break the line, deny reinforcements. Do you know how hard that would be?\" \"Go on Captain,\" Daily ignored the tantrum of the Major. \"Let me hear how you plan to do that.\" \"I know it won't be simple,\" she shot back to Major Cramner, but then to General Daily continued, \"they're thick at the front and have a small reserve. I've seen it and we can confirm this both by drone flyovers and satellites. We also know they've reinforced through Terminal Island. But they've concentrated everything there. I've checked, they don't have any other staging areas and very little held back. Everything has been thrown into this offensive.\" \"Yea, because they have a shield over top of it and we can't hit them,\" Cramner pointed out, \"or did you forget that?\" \"Major, stop interrupting,\" Daily cut the man off threateningly. \"I want to hear what she has to say. Keep going Captain because I know you're heading somewhere.\" \"I am,\" Blatchford confirmed, furrowing her brow. \"If we could break their line they'd fall back all the way to the Island I believe. That's been their tactic thus far when pressed: consolidate in a position of strength.\" \"Okay, but they fall back and then what? They reinforce and push out again like just happened,\" the General mused. \"That's just it. This time we deny them the opportunity to fall back. WE cut off their safe haven.\" \"You don't mean…,\" \"I do. We drop troops behind enemy lines as the main assault commences and hold the two bridges denying them the opportunity to fall back to their shield. We set up several kill boxes out front and pound the crap out of it when they get there,\" Blatchford declared with a grim look on her face. \"It's risky for the troops at the bridge,\" Daily pointed out. \"True,\" the Captain agreed readily. \"They'd need to hold until the main attack can get to them but I bet they'd only need to do it for a few hours.\" \"You ever see the movie 'A Bridge Too Far'? Ever study the World War 2 campaign at Arnhem? Its suicide,\" Cramner countered fiercely. \"It's a calculated risk,\" Blatchford countered. \"Sir, we can't sit back and we can't afford to trade blows with them anymore. Times running out. We need a bold stroke and this could be it.\" All eyes turned to General Daily who was obviously mulling the idea over. He folded his hands behind his back, deep in thought, as if playing it out in his mind. \"What about the shield?\" he asked, showing the plan had captured his attention. \"While the main force holds the bridges Special Ops teams would move across onto the Island to find and destroy the generator. It'll be guarded but I would suspect the force would be manageable.\" \"Hmm…it might just work,\" Daily mused. \"Sir, this is crazy,\" Cramner pressed doggedly. \"Even if this was viable, which I still don't think it is tactically, we don't have the manpower for a thrust that'll break their line let alone troops to drop behind lines.\" \"It shouldn't take more then a battalion to hold sir,\" Blatchford added trying to catch the man's eye. \"We have the airlift capacity between the Ospreys and Blackhawks here to drop them in.\" She saw Cranmer open his mouth to rebut but cut him off. \"I checked to make sure. We have just enough operational to do it.\" Daily took several paces away from the two officers who glared at each other. The remaining staff gave the man his distance knowing the weight of decision on his shoulders. The Marine officer rubbed his eyes then looked up at the ceiling as if saying a silent prayer. He nodded his head as if he'd made a decision. \"Okay, I like it,\" Daily held up a hand to silence the coming protest of Major Cramner. \"Its risky but we don't have time to pussy foot around. Its time to go for the end zone. Captain Blatchford, I want you to co-ord this idea with the ops team and come up with a working plan. You've painted a good picture but I want to see some flesh on those bones. I want to see timelines, troop movements, logistics, C and C, all of it and I want it in 12 hours. Got it?\" \"Yes sir!\" Captain Blatchford agreed, beaming. \"But what about the troops we need?\" Major Cramner asked, knowing he'd been defeated. \"Even if we put the plan together we don't have the manpower and we're desperately short of armor support after the alien's attack to pull this off.\" \"You leave that to me. I'll get us troops even if I have to go to Washington and kick some Pentagon arse myself. You get me that plan in 12 hours, I'll take care of the rest but first I need to get some sleep.\" For the first time since the surprise alien counter-attack Daily felt like he could allow himself that luxury. The Inferno, Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Michele pushed her way through the pulsating crowd at The Inferno moving steadily towards the dancing pair who were unaware of the coming confrontation. There was no doubt or hesitation in her mind. She was a warrior on a rescue mission, not the timid, scared woman who had walked into the hedonistic place. Though her heart raced in anticipation of what was to come she stayed calm. Michele had no clue what would happen; he could laugh at her for coming, or worse, declare once and for all he no longer cared about her. She could be humiliated and left alone in this place but that didn't stop her. She had faith, as crazy as it seemed that some force was rooting for them in the Heavenlies and in the end it would work out. Libby spotted her first. The nurse's eyes bugged out in shock and her body tensed up involuntarily which Mike felt. \"What's the matter?\" he asked, picking it up despite the fog of alcohol on his brain. \"Nothing,\" she responded tersely, her mind already starting to work. The clever woman knew this to be a threat so needed to respond accordingly. Then Mike spotted Michele coming through the crowd towards them, a determined look clearly etched on her expressive face. The pair spontaneously stopped dancing despite the others gyrating around them, waiting for the arrival of this unexpected visitor. Michele spoke but the loud music drowned her out so what she said couldn't be heard. She adjusted to speak again but Libby beat her to the punch. \"Hey Michele, how're you doing?\" she greeted the woman in a friendly tone at the same time pulling herself closer into Mike, resting her head on his chest. \"I'm surprised to see you here. I didn't think this was the kind of place you and Guy,\" she emphasized, \"would hang out.\" Michele ignored the jab of the catty nurse, speaking to Mike instead. \"Trust me, it's not. I came to see Mike.\" She paused, allowing the declaration to sink in. But before Libby could respond she added, \"and let me make one thing perfectly clear to both of you: Dr. Chevreau and I are not a couple.\" \"Really?\" he responded in hazy surprise. His mind though began to put the pieces together. \"And you came to see me? Why?\" Then his mind seemed to shift. \"Hey, would you like to dance?\" \"What?\" Libby shot back in surprised outrage pulling back to glare at the man. \"Sure, why not? We've been dancing the whole time, maybe she'd like to.\" Michele couldn't help but chuckle. Despite the fury she felt at seeing him here and with this woman, the boyish look on his face touched her heart. \"Maybe. But that's not why I'm here. I wanted to see if you were okay. I thought that maybe with everything going on in the war and you still being here away from the front you might be feeling bad or maybe left out and unappreciated. I just wanted to see if you were okay and if there was anything I could do to help.\" \"You?\" Libby snorted. \"He's fine and he's with me,\" she emphasized, rubbing his chest with her red painted nails. \"I think that's for him to decide, not you,\" Michele retorted, standing her ground. As much as Libby infuriated her and seeing Mike allowing this woman to hang all over him angered her, something stronger then that was at work. While part of her screamed to ditch the guy another part began to grow, a part that was seeing this differently. Mike was lost, like a man without a compass, and he needed to be found. He'd spent his whole life trying to help other people in need now he was the one in need even if he didn't acknowledge it. No, she was seeing things with new eyes, eyes of revelation, which gave her a strength and resolve she'd been seeking her whole life but have never attained. It seemed as if she had finally gone through that intersection of life and now was on the right road. And she knew she wanted to share that road with Mike Nantz. \"Well I think its pretty clear who he's chosen,\" Libby hissed, intertwining her body around his even more. \"Has he?\" Michele responded coolly. \"Why don't you let him go and see?\" Then she turned to the man she hoped to spend the rest of her life with and told him, \"Mike, I care about you, I love you. I've not shown that and I've not been there when you've needed me. I'm so sorry.\" She paused to allow the apology to sink in before continuing. \"I've been afraid to let myself go and fully commit but if you'd give me a chance I'll be with you the whole way from now on.\" Libby smirked at the bold and vulnerable declaration while continuing to rub Mike's chest as he stood seemingly transfixed. \"Nice speech. Are you done now so we can get back to having fun? No one wants you around.\" \"You don't have to settle for this,\" Michele declared, \"you can have so much more.\" \"Why you little slut!\" Libby huffed. \"Me?\" Michele shot back. \"I'm not the one who looks like they should be on a street corner.\" Libby's eye's bulged in rage. Swiftly she uncoiled herself from Mike while balling her fist and threw a punch at Michele's face. The woman recoiled from the coming blow but couldn't get out of the way. Quick as a flash Mike's hand shot out and he caught Libby's punch in mid-swing. \"Don't do that,\" he said in a commanding tone holding her hand fast as the nurse venomously glared at both of them. Michele felt her heart sing. He'd come to her defense. There was only one more thing to do. \"Listen, I'm going to leave because I don't want to cause more of a scene. But Mike, I want you to know how much I care despite some of the things you may have heard about me. I will admit I was confused for a bit but I'm not anymore. There's no one else in my life and I'd like to be in yours if you'll allow me.\" She turned and walked away, melting into the crowd. Still holding Libby's fist Mike stared in disbelief while the enraged nurse unintelligibly called something out that was lost in the noise of the club. Then Michele was gone and the remaining pair turned to look at each other. Defensive line, Alhambra, near the Santa Monika Freeway The Marines had fought off another aggressive alien attack. They'd been doing this all day but finally had a respite. The drones who had initially caused a lot of damage had finally been countered and pushed back beyond their line which the soldiers holding the human position was told was only about a half mile away. Things were quiet for the first time in hours. But they knew it wouldn't last. After nearly two months of seemingly half-hearted effort the aliens had not only been reinforced but reinvigorated in their campaign. For the Marines of the 2nd Battalion 5th Regiment it couldn't have come at a worse time. They had finally been rotated off of the front line after fighting nearly for the whole war. They'd only had three days away, just enough to relax and let down their guard. The unit had lost nearly half its men over the course of the campaign so replacements had started to be slotted in but had yet to be integrated. That would have been fine if they'd been allowed the promised month off. But then the squids attacked and everyone, including the 2-5, had been rushed to the newly-formed defensive line. The soldiers of Lt. Gordon's platoon of E Company found themselves holding a position guarding the I10's South Atlantic Boulevard off-ramp over to South 9th Street. At this hour of the day the streetlights would have been coming on, kids would be getting called in for bed and people would be settling in for the night after another busy day of carrying on with life. But not any more. It had been months since this neighborhood had been abandoned. There was no power for streetlights and no one around to enjoy the calm of night. No one other then the Marines and they were far from calm for they knew night brought increased risk. Lockett and Imlay slumped down in their improvised shelter at a cabana of a home's pool about 50 yards back from the main defensive line to tear into a couple of MRE's. They'd checked their troops to make sure they had good cover and understood their arcs of engagement before finally getting a breather. \"Everything square here?\" Ollie Horton, their new platoon Sergeant asked as he trotted up the driveway past an abandoned sports car still covered with a blue tarp. The Reservist from the 14th Marine Regiment out of Spokane Washington had just been moved up after the recent alien surge. \"You should stay low Sarge, kind of bob and weave as you move in the open,\" Lockett suggested as the replacement came into their position. \"Don't move in a straight line. Even though the Squids have pulled back they usually keep a few back looking for targets.\" \"Thanks,\" Horton responded, appreciative of the suggestion. \"You sound like Gunny Nantz when he was prepping us for the front. I never thought there'd be so much more to learn and I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan.\" \"Aw, don't worry about it Sarge, you'll get it,\" Lockett encouraged him. Gunny Nantz?\" Imlay asked, picking up on the name. \"You don't mean Mike Nantz do you?\" \"Yea, he was our training Sergeant before we moved to the front.\" \"Mike Nantz?\" Imlay confirmed. \"Yes and he did a great job too. But it was a crash course so I'm still trying to process everything,\" Horton confessed. \"What's he doing in the rear area?\" Lockett asked. \"I thought he was with G Company. And when did he get promoted?\" \"I don't know about any of that,\" Horton responded, a bit confused. \"He was heading up a training unit prepping NCO's for the front.\" \"Wow, I can't believe they took him out of the fight.\" Imlay shook his head sadly in disbelief. \"That's got to be hard,\" Lockett agreed. \"Give the guy a promotion and then keep him from doing the very thing that got him promoted. That would suck.\" \"Right on brother,\" Imlay added. \"Sorry, I don't get what you mean,\" Horton confessed, not on the same page. \"Anyway, you guys good up here?\" \"Yea, we're good Sarge,\" Lockett replied, dipping his spoon into the container of chili and macaroni he'd chosen to eat, \"good lines and good fields of fire. The guys'll hold as long as need be.\" \"We could use a resupply though,\" Imlay added. \"I'd like us to overstock on grenade rounds for the M203's plus extra boxes of ammo for the SAW. If we get into a firefight like today I want to make sure we can keep up the heat.\" \"Make's sense,\" Horton agreed. \"I'll take care of it. All right, get some rest but stay alert.\" The Sergeant prepared to move to the next position. \"Thanks Sarge,\" Imlay said. \"I'm glad you're with us.\" Horton stopped. \"What do you mean?\" \"Well..,\" Imlay suddenly felt awkward so stopped what he was going to say. \"What do you mean Corporal?\" the Reservist demanded. \"We've had some troubles getting a new platoon Sergeant,\" Lockett explained. \"So it's nice to have you here. We think you're doing a great job.\" \"Thanks. But why the trouble?\" Horton asked. \"Lt. Gordon seems like a good officer.\" \"He is,\" Imlay confirmed. \"It's just we've seen a lot of combat and have lost a few platoon senior NCO's so it seems like guys have been avoiding us.\" \"Really, so you're the ones,\" Horton replied a bit nervously. \"I didn't know that.\" Then he shook his head as if trying to get rid of growing fear. Then getting back on track he changed the subject, \"That's a load of crap. It's just an old wives tale…doesn't mean anything. Anyway, take it…\" A familiar whistling sound filled the air. \"RPG!\" Imlay screamed. \"Find cover!\" The pair and the others around them scrambled but the new Sergeant froze for a moment, unsure where to go. Too late he tried to dive to the side. The alien grenade landed a short distance from the man and exploded on impact shredding his body.[Chapter 37] Ch.37 Going Deeper Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA It had taken Father Alexander a few days to find the information he sought but it had been worth it. Though Child Protection Services still existed on paper the reality was with Los Angeles still under military authority that had become the avenue of enforcement. Those social workers left from the county department had been working solely thus far of trying to reunite families or find places for the hundreds of children orphaned in the war. The priest had also found out that a number of clergy had been seconded to the agency to help out with the effort of restoration. It seemed that bureaucracy had given way to practicality. Of course bureaucracy still ruled, even in a war, and so it had taken him several meetings to find all this information out. Records were spotty and so much was being re-created. But finally the priest had found a willing, and sympathetic ear, to discuss what was going on with Hector. The middle-aged female social worker's dull expression had darkened when she'd heard of the alleged abuse of the orphan. The woman gave him some contacts in the 185th Military Police Battalion which had been helping her team and in the end he'd been deputized to work as an adjunct of the agency. In fact the woman had been eager to have his offered help since they were so swamped. His first assignment then was to investigate the report about Hector Rincon and his aunt Maria. The place they lived was easier to find then working through the bureaucracy of the LA Child Protection Services so he'd been able to find their small home with a minimum of effort. The priest had decided on the direct approach so went mid-morning to the home to talk to the woman and Hector. He knocked on the door and a severe-faced Latino woman with her hair pulled back in a tight bun answered the door. \"Si, what do you want?\" she asked sharply but then her eyes adjusted to the morning sun streaming through the open door to see the priest standing before her. \"Oh, Padre, forgive me. Are you here to bless my home?\" she asked. \"No, my name is Father Alexander McNair and actually I'm here to talk to you about Hector,\" he responded. \"May I come in?\" \"No, you cannot,\" she responded, the edge returning to her voice. \"We are very busy. Perhaps another time. \"I must insist on speaking to you and I'd also like to see him as well,\" the priest pressed. \"I'm not here representing the church but rather as an agent of Los Angeles County Child Services.\" \"What is this about?\" the woman stood belligerently blocking the doorway, her voice rising. \"I think it would be best if we talked inside,\" he gestured with his head towards several neighbors who were taking an interest in the conversation. \"But we will talk about this, one way or the other.\" \"Si, very well,\" she said with a tone of resignation, stepping aside to allow the priest to enter. They went into a sparsely furnished but clean living room. The observant man scanned the room and noticed no family pictures or any other signs of family connections. Other then a large wooden crucifix hanging on the wall there were no decorations. Father Alexander tried to make small talk to break the ice but the woman was tight lipped so he decided to get straight to the point. \"Ma'am, I'm here to ensure the welfare of Hector and make sure he's being properly looked after. There have been allegations that perhaps things are not going well here.\" \"That is nonsense! Who would say such lies?\" she demanded. \"I am his aunt, his only family. I know what's best for him, no one else. Who is saying these things?\" \"That doesn't really matter. What matters is the welfare of the boy. So is there any other of his family members in the area that you know of?\" \"No, I am his aunt,\" she emphasized though strangely, \"and there is no one else interested in looking after the boy.\" \"And you make him work?\" the priest began to probe. \"Si, work is good for boys. He needs to help provide,\" she shot back. \"Yet you're living in a military refugee camp,\" Alexander replied. \"Most of your needs are being provided already. What could a boy his age possibly contribute?\" \"That is my business, Father, not yours. I am his relation.\" Though he found the woman abrasive there was something evasive in her, something she seemed to be hiding, so he decided to play a hunch. \"Ma'am, can you tell me the exact nature of your relationship with Hector's father.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" she huffed, \"I am his aunt.\" \"So Joe Rincon was your blood brother?\" She saw the woman's eyes flare in fear. \"Well, yes, of course, he was,\" she responded but without the same bluster previously. \"And can you prove this?\" the priest pressed in, beginning to become more suspicious. \"We...we were brother and sister by marriage,\" she stammered, \"in a manner of speaking.\" \"What exactly do you mean by 'in a manner of speaking'? And don't lie to a priest,\" he pressed, becoming exasperated by the woman. \"My mother and his father were never formally married,\" she crossed herself as she turned red with embarrassment. \"Thank you for sharing that,\" he affirmed but mentally noted she used the last name Rincon. \"I'd like to talk to Hector now if I could.\" \"You can't…he's…he's not here.\" A sound of movement in the kitchen betrayed the lie she'd just told. \"Then you won't mind if I see for myself.\" Father Alexander moved for the door before the woman could block his way. Passing through he found a Latino boy he knew immediately to be the one he sought. \"Hello Hector,\" the priest greeted the lad. \"Who are you?\" Hector asked, a bit frightened when he saw his aunt appear over the man's shoulder. \"A friend. Someone you can talk to. My name is Alexander McNair.\" \"I know you! You're Gunny Nantz's friend.\" \"You're right.\" Then looking at the boy's aunt he said firmly, \"I want to talk to him alone. You can wait for me in the other room.\" \"What are you doing here?\" Hector asked, unsure what was going on. \"I'm here to see how you're doing and if there's any way I can help you,\" the priest responded kindly. \"I'm fine,\" the boy responded sullenly, dropping his eyes down to the floor. \"Gunny Nantz is concerned about you. He wanted to see if there was any way he could help you.\" \"No one can help me,\" Hector whispered, tears filling his eyes. \"God can help you if you ask.\" \"I have. It didn't work.\" \"I'm here aren't I?\" the priest responded with a twinkle in his eyes. Hector seemed surprised by the statement and paused to think about it. \"How can you help me?\" \"I need to know what's going on,\" Father Alexander asked. \"Nothing, everything's fine,\" the boy responded with a note of fear. \"Raise your shirt.\" \"No…I…ah….can't,\" Hector answered with a note of panic. \"It's okay. I can help you.\" The boy reluctantly began to comply but not before looking in fear at the closed door. Father Alexander figured the woman was listening at the door but that didn't matter. Hector raised his shirt and turned sideways revealing ugly purple welts on his back. Some looked to be healing with time but a trio of fresh ones were obvious. \"I can explain…\" the boy said woodenly. \"There's no need to say anything,\" the priest replied compassionately to save the anguished boy. But inside the priest seethed with anger at the obvious signs of abuse. \"You don't need to say anything more Hector. I know what's going on and I'm going to help you. Give me some time and I will get you out of this situation.\" Tears flowed out of the boy's deep brown eyes and he spontaneously hugged the priest at the declaration. \"Gracias, thank you,\" he whispered, melting the priest's heart. \"You wait here. I need to speak to Ms. Rincon.\" He walked decisively through the door and caught the woman backing up away from it. Good , he thought, she knows what's coming . \"Ma'am I'm going to be straight with you. I suspect you've been abusing this boy and its going to stop right now. I will be monitoring this situation from now on and if there are any fresh marks or a hint this is continuing I will have you arrested. And this will be by the Military Police who don't take kindly to this kind of thing. So I suggest you think and pray hard about this situation because things are about to change. You got that?\" \"Si,\" the woman replied dejectedly, knowing the truth had come out and she had no leg to stand on. \"Good. I'm leaving now but I will be back soon and I will be watching. God help you for what you've done.\" With that he checked in on Hector and left the house to make his report and begin the next phase of a plan that had begun formulating in his mind. Area Command Headquarters Logistics and Supply Area, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations It wasn't even 11am and Mike was already bored. Despite a hangover from the previous night at the Inferno he'd reported as ordered to the supply company he'd been reassigned to three hours earlier. He'd met the CO and been given his assignment-ensuring quality control and timely distribution of resupply to the 40th Infantry Division. Sitting alone on a crate in a warehouse he snorted to himself. Quality control at a time like this? To him all that mattered was the right stuff got to the right people at the right time. What it looked like and how it was stacked was not very important. It was a total make-work project. The sour-faced Army Major who managed the building he'd been assigned to had a thin mustache and seemed to constantly be fidgeting, like he had a nervous condition. Mike could get used to that but he could already tell the man was a micro-manager and wanted things done a certain way. It hardly seemed necessary. The 40th had been so banged up over the course of the war they were in a support role, plugging gaps as they came, so had little need for rapid resupply being off the main line. But that had no impact on the Major. He had his schedule, flowcharts and models. What happened on the front had no impact on his priorities. He was totally G-4, all logistics, that was his world and his passion. To each their own, Mike thought. Still, it gave him time to think. The previous night was a bit of a blur. His disappointment at not even being considered for the front had led him to taking Libby's offer to go out. Sure, she'd looked hot and that had helped but more importantly he was mad at what was happening to him so wanted to act out and throw a bit of a tantrum. He wanted to prove he was his own man so acted foolishly but it made no difference. He was still sitting on a crate and still had personal problems. He had nothing against logistics. He knew how important timely supply was. It just wasn't his calling. Still, it was no excuse for how he'd acted when he'd been posted here. Libby had been at the right spot at the right time and had been a welcome harbor. Then there was that dress. Mike chided himself though for allowing his frustration and anger to get the better of him. He needed to start acting like a soldier and not a spoiled school boy despite how he felt. Then there was Michele. Her showing up at the Inferno had been a total shock and had enraged Libby. But the concern Michele had shown for him had touched him deeply. Libby wanted something from him and in some ways he wasn't unwilling to give it, but with Michele, there seemed to be something more-concern for him rather then herself. Certainly Libby's reaction after Michele left showed where her loyalty lay. The attractive nurse had alternatively sulked and raged at him for the next hour for how he'd talked to Michele. He knew the two didn't get along but the hatred Libby had towards her rival was a bit unsettling and he began to wonder if that was driving some of her actions. But did it really matter? This was not a contest and he certainly was no prize. Yet Michele had gone well outside her comfort zone, into enemy territory in some ways to see if he was okay and to express her feelings for him unprompted. That showed a depth of character Mike had to stop to consider. As the fog of Jack Daniels began to clear, like the sun burning off the early morning haze, some things became clearer to Mike Nantz. He needed to find Michele and they needed to talk, really talk because something had become clear in his mind. He was about to make a decision when a voice echoed in the warehouse he sat musing in. \"Michael? Are you in there?\" It was Father Alexander. \"Yes, I'm here. I'll come to you,\" he called back. Mike walked briskly to the roll-down door entrance and vigorously shook the hand of the priest. \"It's good to see you sir. How have you been?\" \"Good. Busy on a project I want to talk to you about but good,\" the priest responded happily. Then, as if he'd connected some dots, his face clouded and he asked, \"What are you doing here?\" \"I've been transferred to G-4 Supply Logistics.\" \"I thought you were in the training cell.\" \"No, that got shut down with the squid's new push,\" Mike confirmed. \"Everyone got sent to the front so there was no need for a training group at this point.\" \"Everyone but you,\" the observant priest declared, probing for a reaction. \"You okay with that?\" Mike shrugged his shoulders. \"It is what it is. I wasn't at first but I've had some time to think about it. You know I want back in combat but it's just not to be.\" The priest pondered the statement and his face brightened. \"Perhaps the Lord is working in this and its part of his plan because if you had been at the front I couldn't tell you what I've discovered.\" \"What do you mean?\" Mike asked, his curiosity peaked since he hadn't considered his situation as anything other then a disaster. He also then realized he'd not be in the position to talk to Michele either. \"Small blessings,\" he whispered. \"Pardon?\" Father Alexander asked, not hearing him. \"Nothing. So what's up?\" \"I checked into the situation with Hector and even met with the boy and his aunt. Or I should say his alleged aunt.\" \"What do you mean?\" Mike shot back in surprise. \"Her relationship to him is arm's length in a way. I'm not certain her claim to be his aunt would stand up to close scrutiny.\" \"But she's acted so confidently about that,\" Mike responded, stunned by the news. \"She's also been so pushy about it. How could she be like that?\" \"While these are desperate times,\" the priest mused, \"they're also times that people can exploit for their own gain. With civil authority non-existent and people focused on the war domestic matters like these fall off the radar screen. Sadly, I would imagine there's lots of stuff falling between the cracks.\" Mike couldn't believe what he was hearing and even more so that someone would be so self-centered they would take advantage of a child in this situation. His blood began to boil. \"So what about the abuse then?\" \"I checked myself and have pretty firm suspicions its happening. I confronted her about it and think I put the fear of God, literally and figuratively, into her,\" Father Alexander reported. \"So I suspect Hector will be safe for the time being. But, people like that tend to slip back into their own patterns if things are allowed to go on for too long.\" \"So what can be done to save Hector from this?\" Mike asked. \"He needs to be removed from that situation.\" \"How could that happen though?\" Mike asked. \"He'd need somewhere to live right? Someone would have to look after him.\" \"Well, that is the point,\" Father Alexander agreed. \"So if someone were willing to step forward and become Hector's guardian, or better yet, be willing to adopt, he could be freed from the situation.\" It took a second for the light to go on for Mike. \"Whoa! Wait a second. I can't…\" \"Why not? You care for the lad and he clearly loves you,\" the priest pointed out. \"Who better then you?\" \"Yes, but there's more to it then that,\" Mike held up his hands in protest. \"There's commitment and a need for stability for the boy. There's…\" \"All things you've told me you've desired in your life Michael,\" Father Alexander stated quietly. \"What better incentive to finally step up and do it then this?\" \"Okay, but besides, you don't just decide to do something like that and do it,\" Mike countered. \"There's a process, children services and stuff. This is a court thing, and she's family. You can't fight that.\" \"Process is easy and I can walk you through it. She's distant family and her claim is pretty sketchy. And remember, LA is under military authority so that means things like this are handled by the JAG, not civilian courts.\" Sure, but how will the Judge Advocate look at that any differently?\" Mike asked, feeling as if the walls were closing in. \"They follow the same set of rules don't they?\" The priest smiled. \"You've looked into that already, haven't you?\" Mike declared, shaking his head at the thoroughness of the priest. \"I have. There's only one other thing that would strengthen the case to help free the boy from this horrible situation.\" \"Yea, what's that?\" Mike asked suspiciously. \"How are things with you and Michele, by the way?\" Father Alexander asked instead, his grin breaking into a warm smile.[Chapter 38] Ch. 38 – Time for action Defensive line, Alhambra, near the Santa Monika Freeway A rocket whooshed overhead and slammed into the ground throwing a fireball into the air. By now the beleaguered Marines on the front line barely reacted since they knew its range was off and they were safe. \"Watch your ammo guys,\" Cpl. Imlay reminded the men holding the defensive position. \"Don't shoot at something you can't see.\" \"No problem Corporal,\" one of the soldiers replied, \"I hardly have any ammo anyways,\" with a bit of gallows humor. \"Don't worry about it,\" the NCO replied, trying to sound nonchalant but inside concerned about the situation, \"we're supposed to get resupplied this morning and then we'll be good to go. The squids are hanging back so we'll be okay til then.\" While the situation had evolved to a bit of a standstill the human forces holding a make-shift defensive line along the Santa Monika Freeway were at the disadvantage. With mounting casualties and the inability to reinforce any concerted enemy effort would break the line. Plus the rumor had been running rampant among the troops that massive alien reinforcements were coming from space in a matter of days. None wanted to consider what that meant. Still, what choice did they have? This was no longer a war of political will or of ideology like the ones in the past; this was a war of survival against an enemy that sought to annihilate them. They'd already seen what the aliens did to civilians that got in their way last August when they'd unexpectedly attacked earth. So each one working to cling onto this position in the face of a fresh onslaught knew what the stakes were. Grimly determined the soldiers held fast knowing they were the only thing between this relentless enemy and the tens of thousands of exiles from their homes only miles away in the refugee city. No, they had to hold. There was no other option. Imlay and his friend Jason Lockett moved up and down the line checking fields of fire and generally just encouraging their troops. More then half were replacements so getting them integrated into the unit also was a priority so as they moved they would call out the nicknames they'd made up for the guys. While tense as a guitar string on the inside each Corporal gave off the aura of calm despite the rocket grenades occasionally dropping in. Confidence at this stage of the game was of critical importance. They'd do their part to hold the men together and hold the line to the end. The rumble of approaching trucks from the rear brought a measure of relief since it signaled their much-needed resupply had finally arrived. \"Supplies here!\" Lockett announced to the gathered group seeing the first M1078 FMTV roll up. \"It also looks like the squids'll be polite enough to let us off load the trucks without shooting at us.\" \"Decent of them,\" Imlay deadpanned. \"All right, 1st squad, help the Log Wogs empty the trucks. The rest of you, eyes up, stay sharp.\" The Marines got out of their defensive position and trotted over to the waiting FMTV's while the convoy's escorts swiveled .50 caliber machine guns in their coaxial turrets to cover the approaches. \"Okay guys, first truck, let's…,\" Imlay stopped short in shock. \"What the heck?\" he exclaimed. \"What's up Lee?\" Lockett asked curiously, catching the surprised declaration. \"Look in the cab…it can't be…\" \"Gunny Nantz?\" Lockett declared, unwilling to believe his eyes. \"What the heck's he doing on a supply run?\" Imlay wondered aloud. \"Who you talking about Corporal?\" one of the Marines with them asked. \"Nothing, forget about it,\" Imlay shot back, trying to deflect the question. But the young soldier's curiosity was peaked so he looked over to where the pair had found their surprise. \"Hey, I know who that is. That's…\" \"That's Gunnery Sergeant Nantz,\" Lockett answered, \"our old platoon Sergeant.\" \"The Nantz that won the CMH, right?\" the nineteen year old reservist replacement declared with awe in his voice. \"Yea,\" the African-American NCO responded. \"So what's he doing babysitting a supply convoy?\" a seasoned Marines named Yantzi who had lived through the initial assault on LA asked with a note of disgust. \"I heard he got pulled off the line by the brass,\" a new Lance Corporal interjected joining the conversation. \"They didn't want him getting killed. It would be bad for morale.\" \"Unlike us, right?\" the skeptical Marine spat out. \"What about us? We're out here putting it on the line. Why does he get a pass?\" \"Shut your mouth Yantzi,\" Imlay growled. \"You know the Gunny'd be right in the thick of it if he could be. It is what it is. Now start unloading those trucks.\" Mike hopped down from the cab and immediately saw the group of Marines in a cluster looking over at him. Great , he thought, more men wondering why I'm sitting things out. This is so frustrating. Then he saw more closely who the men were. These were HIS men. Lockett, Imlay and several others. He wanted to crawl into a hole and hide in shame but knew he couldn't. Instead, as the supply people and Marines unloaded the trucks he walked over to get updated on the men. \"Hey Gunny,\" Lockett greeted him. \"How's it going?\" The pair embraced. \"You know, same old same old,\" Mike replied. Imlay shook his hand and asked, \"What are you doing in supply? I thought you were running the training cell.\" \"The group got shut down when the squid's put on this last push. There's no one to train so I got shifted to this.\" \"Sounds good,\" Imlay replied without conviction. \"I bet you can be a real asset there.\" \"Bull,\" Mike snorted. \"It sucks.\" Knowing he shouldn't be speaking like this he let his frustration out anyway. \"You know I'd rather be on the line with you guys then doing this but orders are orders.\" The other Marines nodded their head in approval, seeing anew the heart of the man which made Mike feel a bit better in some ways and more useless in others. He looked around to see what their situation was. His keen eyes noted a glaring absence. \"Who's your platoon sergeant these days?\" \"Don't have one,\" Lockett answered suddenly sullen. \"What do you mean by that?\" Mike queried. \"You guys are in a key position here. That's too much pressure to put on you two. You need someone.\" \"Well….\" \"Lockett, spit it out,\" Mike demanded. \"What's going on here?\" Lockett opened his mouth to speak but Imlay silenced him with a glare. Grabbing Mike by the arm the pair steered him away from the other Marines. \"No one wants to take the role Gunny,\" Imlay said in frustration. \"There's talk about us being cursed. We've had 5 Sergeants killed in the last 2 months. People seem to be avoiding us. We can't get any replacements in the role.\" \"That's ridiculous,\" Mike shot back. \"You guys have been in the thick of the fighting since day 1. Casualties happen.\" But he saw the look in the faces of the two seasoned combat veterans and knew also that perception could become reality. As if to emphasize the point, a rocket fell near one of the trucks causing the gunner in one of the escort Humvees to open fire with his .50 caliber in response. Lt. Gordon saw the trio and came over to see what was going on despite the activity starting up around him. \"Hey L.T.,\" Mike greeted the man. \"Nantz. Good to see you.\" The pair shook hands. \"You got promoted to Gunny? Good for you.\" \"Thanks sir.\" Mike looked to see that the trucks were nearly unloaded and with small arm fire starting to pick up knew they had to be rolling out shortly. \"Lockett, Imlay, you're doing a great job. Keep your guys squared away and watch your arcs. They're in good hands,\" he encouraged the two young NCO's. Then he turned to the platoon commander. \"Can I have a quick word sir?\" \"Sure\" Moving a short distance away and alone the two could talk openly. \"You okay sir?\" Mike asked in genuine concern. \"You know,\" Gordon answered evasively. \"I heard about the platoon Sergeant thing,\" Mike declared. \"Yea it's stupid,\" the African American officer responded, his face twisting in frustration, \"but there's a lot of units short of NCO's and it seems like we're starting to get passed over. It's making it pretty hard on the squad leaders. \"That sucks.\" \"Well, it's an imperfect world.\" \"It's still not right. Listen, you're a good leader sir,\" Mike stated matter-of-factly. \"Don't forget that. The men respect you. You're making a difference.\" Gordon paused, mouth open, and Mike could see his eyes get glassy. \"Thanks Gunny, that means a lot. Listen, I've got to get back to work. See you around.\" The Lieutenant in charge of the convoy signaled they were clear as the shooting all around intensified. It seemed like the last few boxes were thrown off the back so the supply people could get away but in a matter of minutes they were heading to the safety of the rear area. Mike had a lot to think about on the way back to base. The conversation he had with the men from his former unit stuck in his mind plus he continued to think of his conversation with Father Alexander the previous evening. Then there was Michele. It was like he didn't have time to fight a war. No wonder God had taken him away from the front. He was so distracted he would be a liability. That's a happy thought. He needed to resolve these issues so he could move forward. Mike pondered what he'd witnessed and the implications of it not just for the campaign but for himself. Sitting in the lead FMTV the M1078 rolled up to the supply depot. Mike could see his CO standing with arms folded and an irritated look on his face. Instinctively the Marine knew he was the cause of the Major's problem. Grinding to a halt Mike gave the young reservist Private some instructions then hopped out of the cab and strided easily towards to the waiting officer. He hoped the time would give the man time to calm down. He was wrong. \"What the hell do you think you're doing Nantz?\" the officer exploded, not caring who heard the statement. \"I'm sorry Major Swan,\" Mike responded calmly, trying to defuse the situation with an apology. \"I know I'm not supposed to be at the front but no one was willing to travel with this packet so I volunteered to do it myself.\" \"The front? What do I care about that?\" the man blustered, his thin mustache twitching. \"Your assignment Sergeant is senior NCO for resupply of the 40th Infantry Division, not the 5th Marines.\" \"What?\" Mike shot back, forgetting decorum in genuine shock at the unexpected comment. \"Your job is to look after your division. When you left it to go on that resupply you compromised the efficiency of this operation.\" \"How do you mean sir?\" \"What I mean,\" the Major answered through gritted teeth, \"is that if a supply situation came up for the 40th we might not have been able to meet it.\" Mike couldn't believe what he was hearing. \"The 40th is at less then half strength sir and has been pulled back to a secondary blocking position. Their situation is good, I confirmed that this morning.\" That's not the point!\" the man screamed, causing heads to turn. \"The point is that you work for me and that means you work for them. I don't tolerate that kind of free thinking. It causes the system to break down and then where would we be?\" \"Needing to show some initiative and thought,\" Mike muttered under his breath. \"What was that Gunnery Sergeant\" Swan demanded \"It won't happen again sir. My bad,\" Mike choked the words out then added despite how much it stuck in his throat, \"I apologize for the mistake sir.\" \"Good. See it doesn't happen again,\" Swan stated and sauntered away. Mike couldn't believe after all these years in the service his career had come to this. Things needed to change. He avoided the temperamental officer for the remainder of the morning and into the afternoon. There was nothing to do so he had lots of time to think. The conversation with the guys from his old unit bothered him. They couldn't get a platoon Sergeant and he couldn't get to the front. There had to be some sort of irony somewhere in this. That was one thing. The other was Michele and Libby. He was tormented thinking of both of them. The nurse was attentive and hot, but there was something almost plastic about her, like she had no depth. An inch deep and a mile wide. Michele on the other hand didn't seem to stack up well but there was more to her-depth and strength of character. As he saw her face in his mind he remembered her cry when he'd roped out of the helicopter back in August to go find the first alien command-and-control center. He'd never seen anyone so beautiful at that moment. One woman seemed a fun distraction while the other something you could build a life with. For too long of late he'd been thinking selfishly of himself, reacting like a petty school boy who couldn't get his way. Mike began to realize his relationship with the nurse had been a reaction to his circumstances-first his poor treatment on the tour, then the misunderstanding with Michele when he returned, his reassignment to the rear area by General Daily, even his temporary anger at Father Alexander. Each time he'd reacted poorly and reacted selfishly. Mike reluctantly realized in many ways that he didn't deserve to be at the front. He was thinking only of himself and not others. He hadn't thought about the pressure the General was under, he hadn't understood what Michele had gone through when he was gone and seeing the false reports about Amanda and he sure didn't sure any grace towards the priest who'd been nothing but a friend and confidant to him for years. He wasn't even being fair to Libby, letting her believe he had any sort of feelings for her other then lust. No, looking into the mirror of his soul he didn't like what he saw. Finally tying all these threads that had seemed to be blowing in the wind together a tapestry formed in his mind, a new, or perhaps renewed, resolution took over. It was time to stop acting like a child with a broken toy and step up as a man does and finally commit to something bigger then self once and for all. Mike checked his watch. He had enough time. Despite the fact he was still on duty, knowing Major Swan wouldn't be by and knowing nothing would be needed by the group he was responsible for, he left the supply depot and headed towards the civilian area. He had a destination in mind but first made a slight detour to pick something up. Mike arrived at the hospital within the hour. Although trying to look casual inside his heart raced. How would it go? How would she react? he thought to himself. Taking a deep breath he walked through the main doors in search of his objective. Michele had finished her rounds, almost as if on autopilot like she'd been for the past several days. She'd not heard from Mike after the night at the Inferno and with each passing hour her heart sank. While she kept telling herself to be patient in reality her mind was calculating when he would come for her. And each hour past the time she'd set in her mind a little bit of her died. She was so sure after she'd bared her soul and shared the truth of her feelings that he'd come to her. But Libby was not only gorgeous but also convincing, and a lot less complicated. Maybe she really couldn't compete and had lost him. Dr. Chevreau walked past her and pressed in as he passed though there was lots of room in the corridor. He gave her a wink and smile as he went by letting her know where his thoughts lay. She knew what she wanted but what if she had no choice? Then suddenly Michele saw Mike from down the corridor and her heart began to race. He was looking around, a single orange desert wildflower in his hand. Her breath became shallow and she felt herself begin to perspire. Michele took a step forward and then her heart exploded. Libby breezed in front from another corridor and glided over to him, an easy smile on her face. She put her hand on his forearm and leaned in close. Even from a distance Michele could hear the tinkle of her laughter and knew instinctively that she'd lost. A glutton for punishment, lamenting what could have been, the tormented woman watched the happy couple for longer then she'd wanted. Finally able to stand it no longer, Michele turned and began the forlorn walk to where she didn't know, unsure of what the future held for her. She got less then ten steps away when she felt a hand on her shoulder. Turning slowly around she came face to face with a grinning Mike holding the flower up in his hand. \"This is for you Michele. Can we talk?\" Mike asked, giving her the beautiful desert bloom. Michele felt as if she couldn't breathe her heart suddenly in her throat. She looked past Mike and saw Libby glaring at them, a venomous look on her face, then also saw Dr. Chevreau come walking to see what was going on. She'd been oblivious to it all. Had Mike called to her? It didn't matter. He was there, with a flower, a flower for her. \"Are you okay?\" he asked, concern on his face. She flushed in embarrassment. \"Yes, yes I am. I was just got caught up in thought.\" \"I can come back another time if it's a problem,\" he said, a look of disappointment on his face. \"NO!\" she yelled, startling everyone around, herself included. \"No, please, no. Where…where would you like to go?\" she stammered, suddenly overwhelmed. Mike caught this and knew things were not going as planned. His conversation with Libby had blown up and she'd had some choice words for him and now he was blowing it here. He decided to throw caution to the wind once and for all. \"Screw it. Michele, I love you. I've loved you for months. I got kind of messed up and I'm sorry about that. I hope you can forgive me for being such a jerk. But if you'll have me, I want you in my life.\" \"Mike…oh Mike. I'm so glad. I've loved you too. I'm so sorry for how I made things difficult for you. I was scared and began to think too much. I love you so much.\" The two stared at each other, unsure what to do next. \"Well, what are you two waiting for?\" Kelly called out from the side. \"Why don't you two stop talking and kiss for crying out loud.\" The couple laughed at the comment and then followed the wise counsel, falling into each others arms and drinking deep of the other as the gathered staff cheered at the happy moment. Libby looked over at Dr. Chevreau who stood off to the side watching the scene with a frustrated look. She tossed her hair over her shoulder and gave him a smile. He nodded and winked in return and the two made their way together towards the exit of the building. The kiss lasted several minutes, each exploring the other and losing themselves in the moment until the spectators became bored and drifted back to their own lives. The pair broke the clinch finally but held on to each other, as if scared of losing each other. They tried to talk though each kept cutting the other off in their excitement to make up for lost time until each broke into fits of laughter. Finally able to have a proper conversation the couple found it increasingly difficult to speak as the sound of roaring engines and the rumbling of machines began to fill the air. Though people tried to continue their business the noise became so loud it wasn't possible to concentrate. People began to drift towards the exits to see what was going on. Mike and Michele joined a group of spectators outside the hospital. The sight almost took their breath away. Rumbling down the street a line of M1A1 Abrams tanks clanked past interspersed by trucks and Stryker Combat Vehicles with a bald eagle painted on the side. Overheard dozens of CH-74 Chinook helicopters roared past. \"Thank God,\" Mike whispered with a mixture of awe and relief. \"What is it?\" Michele asked, gripping his arm. \"Reinforcements have arrived.\"[Chapter 39] Chapter 39- Here comes the cavalry! Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations For several hours tanks, AFV's, Humvees and trucks rolled through the refugee city to a new staging area that sprung up from their arrival. The Screaming Eagles of the 101st Airborne Division had arrived along with the bulk of the 1st Armored Division. The M1A1 Abrams tanks of Old Ironsides provided a lethal punch to this significant reinforcement. Tents were set up, temporary office and storage space unpacked as a hive of activity continued. Military Police and logistics personnel ensured everything was done quickly and efficiently. General Daily watched with satisfaction the arrival a smile filling his expressive face while the rest of his staff could only stare in wonder and confusion. \"How did you make this happen?\" Colonel Weeks, the S3 for the LA Battle Group shouted in amazement above the roar of engines and steady chop of overhead helicopters. \"I asked nicely,\" the commanding officer deadpanned. \"Right sir,\" the S3 huffed a bit. \"And the Pentagon was waiting for someone to say please. We've gotten nowhere for weeks on this and you get us two crack divisions in a matter of days.\" Daily chuckled. \"I knew the right people to ask, I guess. It doesn't matter. They're here and we have some options now.\" Turning away from the impressive spectacle he announced to his gathered staff, \"Okay. We move from theory to reality. I want to know how you're going to make our battle plans operational within the hour people. The clock's ticking so I want solutions now that we've got assets.\" Several of the staff officers looked at each other uncomfortably but none said anything. The general's instructions were interrupted as a Humvee bearing a flag with two stars on in pulled up in front of the group and an airborne Major-General jumped spryly out of the front. The square-jawed, no-nonsense looking paratrooper walked purposefully over to the watching officers. \"Ron, it's good to see you,\" he greeted, shaking General Daily's hand warmly. \"Hi Mike, I'm glad you could make it. How was the trip?\" Daily returned the shake and patted the man firmly on the back. \"Helluva drive, I tell you but there was no other way to get all our gear here. Rest of the gang will be coming in by plane tonight.\" \"Well, we're just glad you're here.\" Daily turned to his staff and said, \"People, I want to introduce you to Major-General Michael McConville, commanding officer of the 101st Airborne. We've spent a lot of time chewing dirt on God's green earth together.\" \"Damn straight,\" McConville replied. Then he said with a piercing look on his face to the gathered officers, \"You've got a great leader here. One of the best, even if he's a jarhead ground pounder.\" Daily let out a booming laugh, the first his staff had heard in weeks. \"This from a guy who thinks it's smart to jump out of perfectly good airplanes.\" Seeing the strange look on the face of his team he filled them in. \"General McConville and I go back a ways. We both ran track in the same district back in high school so we got to know each other through that.\" \"Yea, I'd even say he was good enough a guy to be my friend,\" McConville interjected. \"We both joined up after that then our paths seemed to keep crossing in the military. Iraq, Afghanistan…now here.\" \"What took you so long to get the green light to be re-tasked?\" Daily asked. \"Well, you know the swinging dicks from Washington. It took them a while to figure out the real action was on the west coast. You know them, anything within 300 miles and they're in a panic. I've said all along the east coast was a feint; the real battle for America has been on the west. We were wasting our time there. Finally they figured it out and shook us loose so we could make a real difference.\" The bravado faded for a moment as he looked around then his voice quieted and he added, \"You guys have been carrying a pretty heavy load on your own.\" \"We've got some good people here. We may be a scratch team but everyone knows what's at stake and have given it their all,\" Daily replied, his mood darkening as he thought of the many thousands who had already sacrificed themselves in the defense of LA. He changed the subject, \"Who's commanding the 1st Armored element?\" \"Pete Cooper. I wanted the whole division but two brigades was all they'd give me. I hope its enough for you.\" \"Hey, I'm happy for anything I can get. Listen, I'm having an O group with my team in an hour. Why don't we get together at 2100 and I can bring you up to speed and you can formally meet everyone.\" \"Sounds good. See you in a bit.\" McConville jumped back into the idling Humvee and roared off with the vehicles still passing by. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Despite the impressive show of firepower and the relief it brought to the beleaguered west coast Mike and Michele had other things on their minds. With everyone occupied watching the arrival of the reinforcements Mike saw an opportunity for them to get out of the spotlight. Taking Michele by the hand, he said, \"Come on,\" and began to lead her away from the action. Still clutching the desert flower in her hand she'd received Michele complied immediately. The pair walked silently for several blocks before Mike found a spot that seemed to suit them, a small park that had sprung up on the edge of the temporary buildings used for housing. Despite the distance the sound of engines still invaded the space but in some ways it was welcome since it forced them to sit closer together to talk and no one in the area could overhear. \"Mike, I…\" \"Michele, listen…\" The pair spoke simultaneously, cutting each other off. Mike laughed while Michele giggled nervously at the spontaneous outburst. She spoke first. \"I want you to know that I meant what I said back at the hospital. But I also want you to be happy. I…I've not always been the easiest to be around and I'm sorry. I jumped to lots of conclusions and wasn't there for you when you needed me. So if you think being with Libby would be easier I'd understand and not cause you two any problems. I care about you a lot…I love you…but I want you to be happy.\" Mike shook his head in disbelief at the selfless statement. She took it the wrong way, that she'd lost so began to pull back. Instead he took both her hands in his and leaned in. \"Michele, if anyone should be apologizing it's me. I allowed myself to be distracted by my own problems and didn't bring you in on them. I left you vulnerable…I…I was self-absorbed and I'm so sorry about that. You're the only one for me. I've known that since I roped out of that chopper back in August but I've been afraid to admit it. I've put a wall around me after what happened before and didn't want to trust. But I want to. I want to live again and I want to live again with you. I love you.\" Michele's eyes were glassy with tears. \"Mike…\" Instead of speaking, the pair spontaneously fell into a ferocious hug as each let the walls around their heart crumble in a final defeat of individualism. A bridge was built between the chasm of their hearts and a new life began at that moment though it would take time to figure out what it would look like. Totally absorbed in the moment, feeling the electric energy of the embrace coursing through them the pair failed to notice a Latino woman leading a reluctant boy past the fringe of the park who was being pushed by a stocky Mexican man. Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations \"Okay, so I've looked at the attack plan Captain Blatchford worked up. It's a bit rough but doable. So, what are our options?\" General Daily asked to his assembled staff signaling the beginning of their meeting. For the first time he'd brought together not just his own S level staff but also the G level commanders of the various elements that made up the LA theatre of operations since he wanted to be sure everyone was on the same page. With the 101st Airborne and 1st Armor arriving in force they finally had the resources needed to go from theory to reality. As the two groups settled into their new staging areas and before their commanders met with Daily he wanted to have a plan of action for using them before they met so that the trio could work on details. \"Well sir, Major Cramner from my team has worked up some new lines of defense,\" Colonel Weeks who acted as the operations officer for the battle group reported. Spreading out a map he pointed to several freshly drawn lines. \"With the muscle of the 1st Armored and the flexibility of the 101st we're certain we can contain any new alien influx.\" \"I agree with Colonel Weeks,\" a Brigadier General who acted as a staff officer confirmed, added his influential voice to the discussion. \"Their lines look good, I've checked our satellite images and they've got excellent fields of fire and the approaches are good for us plus the interior lines are tight for resupply and reinforcement.\" A different Colonel who worked in logistics piped up. \"We're already planning advanced supply depots sir. We're confident we can get everything the troops need to hold these positions as long as we need to.\" \"We also have some great fall back positions now here and here,\" Brigadier General Marion Grayback pointed out on the map. With the added manpower we'll also be able to have a proper reserve force again, something we've been sadly lacking. Colonel Weeks has put together a solid plan.\" \"What about the attack plan?\" General Daily asked in confusion. \"I thought we were going with the plan of assault you guys worked up.\" \"Well sir, we've determined as a group that it's unrealistic and unachievable,\" General Grayback responded confidently. \"This new plan is wiser and more suited to our situation. We've been working off that template.\" The other officers from the operations group nodded their heads in agreement and voiced their support for the new direction causing Daily to sag in discouragement. \"This is crazy. We have to attack,\" a low female voice could be heard from the back of the cluster of officers. \"I think we can begin to deploy the forward elements of the 101st in the morning if that's agreeable to their G-3 people,\" General Grayback said, ignoring the statement from the back. \"I said we should go with the original plan and attack,\" the rising voice persisted, with an edge to it. \"We heard you the first time Captain Blatchford,\" Grayback stated, with obvious irritation. \"When we need an Int assessment we'll ask.\" \"Let her speak General,\" Daily demanded. \"I want to hear what she's going to say.\" \"Thank you sir,\" Blatchford said, adjusting her wire glasses as she shot the gathered officers a sour look. \"We have significant reinforcements and supplies now and the clock's ticking. The plan of attack we worked up was a viable, doable solution. We need to use these reinforcements to attack and break this stalemate. So let's stick with the original plan and not panic and go all conservative because we've got some breathing space with these reinforcements.\" \"Panic? That's crazy sir,\" Colonel Weeks interjected in outrage. \"Ours is a sound strategy, not panic. Hers is reckless. We were fortunate to get the help and no others are available. As she said, the alien reinforcements will be here in days. If we were to lose ours we'd have nothing left. Instead, we can build up a strong position and respond as the opportunities come.\" \"So you're new plan is to concede nearly half of LA to these bastards?\" Daily growled at the other officers. \"That's my point exactly sir,\" Blatchford stepped in, holding her ground. \"This is not a theoretical model or scenario. These are people's lives and homes we're talking about.\" \"Unfortunate but necessary sacrifices,\" Weeks declared with a nod of support from General Grayback. \"We don't have time for sentimental thinking. We need to think coolly and to the future.\" \"That's what I'm trying to tell you. If we allow the squids to land and deploy we'll be fighting them here for years,\" she stated, her voice rising with emotion. The reality of the declaration had a sobering impact on the gathered command staff and for a moment the conference room fell silent. General Daily was obviously moved by the conviction of the statement. He opened his mouth to speak but General Grayback spoke first. \"No one wants this to go on longer then necessary so let's get off that. The Captain's assessment is flawed. We can keep them contained after landing and then systematically beat them back with what we have.\" \"Come on,\" Blatchford countered, standing her ground. \"These are paratroopers we're talking about. We now have troops trained for the advance. These are not reservists they're combat troops, guys who are geared towards gaining ground. They're not suited for a defensive posture.\" \"Did you ever hear Bastogne?\" General Grayback interrupted her. \"Airborne can do defensive or whatever else they're ordered.\" \"Did you ever hear of 'it's not polite to interrupt someone when they're talking', General?\" Blatchford shot back with irritation. Daily snorted out loud at the comment, unable to contain himself. He held up his hand to stop the outraged General from speaking again. \"Easy Marion. We're all pretty tense but we all want the same thing: the liberation of LA and end of this war. Go on Captain Blatchford, I want to hear what you're thinking.\" \"We need to stick to the original plan. Use the reinforcements to break through the line while a group holds the bridges to Terminal Island and takes down the shield generator. We then grind the squids up into fish bait in the killing zone in between,\" the reporter turned intelligence officer outlined passionately. \"Helluva plan Captain,\" a voice boomed from behind the clustered officers. \"If Ron doesn't treat you right you come and work for me. We need people with fire like you.\" Everyone turned to see General McConville as he pushed his way aggressively into the center of the group. \"And let me assure you 101st didn't come all the way across America to do defensive. We came to kick these mothers in the ass.\" Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA The first echelon of the reinforcements arriving at the refugee city provided cover for a decision that had been made days earlier. A stocky Mexican man with heavily tattooed arms slunk up to the Rincon residence looking in all directions to ensure no one spotted him before lightly knocking. \"Are you ready?\" the man asked in a thick accent as the door opened slightly. \"Si, Javier,\" Maria Rincon answered, scanning the street out front. The sound of the military convoy rolling through several blocks away had seemed to attract everyone's attention. She handed him an envelope bulging with bills. \"The bags are in the next room. You grab them as we leave and trail us.\" \"All right,\" Javier replied, moving to hide at the side of the building. \"Hector!\" Maria yelled. \"Come with me I want to show you something.\" \"What is it Aunt Maria?\" the boy replied coming to where she stood. \"Never mind that,\" the woman responded crossly. \"Get your shoes on and follow me.\" The boy innocently followed the scheming woman away from the house as Javier slipped inside and grabbed two bags that had been stashed away then he began to follow the pair. The arrival of the fresh troops had seemed to empty the streets of people so Maria was able to lead Hector away from their neighborhood at a rapid pace. The boy had stayed quiet for the trip thus far but finally became curious as they moved farther away. \"Where are we going aunt?\" he asked curiously. \"You'll see when we get there,\" the woman replied with an edge to her voice. Hector picked up the tone and became concerned. \"What's going on?\" \"Nothing. Keep moving and be quiet,\" she ordered. Hector began to look around, a growing unease filling him. Then he noticed the stocky Mexican following them. \"Hey, who's that?\" \"A friend. Someone who makes sure we get to where we're going.\" \"Why is he carrying suitcases?\" Hector demanded, stopping in his tracks. \"Enough questions!\" She gave Javier a look and he came over to stand behind the boy. \"Keep moving,\" the man demanded, gripping Hector's arm in a vice-like grip. \"Ow! You're hurting me. Aunt, make him stop, please.\" She ignored the plea and began walking again. The man leaned down as he began to pull Hector along and hissed, \"If you what's good for you boy you'll stay quiet and not resist.\" Panic filled Hector and he thought to call out but no one seemed to be around at the moment and he was scared. Cowed into submission the boy followed obediently along not knowing but fearing what was to come. By the time they skirted around the edge of a park he was so forlorn he didn't even notice the Marine and woman embracing. He'd given up, instinctively knowing he was heading to a dark place.[Chapter 40] Chapter 40 –Going Deeper Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations General McConville loved Captain Blatchford's plan. The aggressive paratrooper almost knocked the diminutive woman over pounding her on the back congratulating her for the boldness of the plan. Any alternative thoughts from various areas of the command group to move into a defensive posture were immediately shelved so everything was put into motion to attack as soon as they could get organized. The following afternoon, the key commanders for the battle group were assembled from brigade commander's right down to battalion commanders. Some simple maps with form-up points and lines of assault were marked as were alien force concentrations were presented to give the assembled group a picture of how things were to unfold. Between drone and satellite images the intelligence and operations people were able to pinpoint the alien strongpoints and build their plan off of that. The good news was the aliens seemed to be holding in a static position, waiting as they were for the anticipated reinforcements. The human forces would continue to monitor this but Captain Blatchford was certain the enemy was confident in their ability to hold the line against the forces they were arrayed against so would remain static. Little did the aliens know the human forces had just received an injection of fifteen thousand soldiers and three hundred tanks. They needed to strike fast and strike hard to be sure this advantage could be exploited. \"All right people,\" Daily began the briefing after packages of information were distributed. The plan's pretty straightforward but it should be able to bring a devastating effect breaking the backs of the squid resistance and deny them a base to work from when their reinforcements arrive. At H-hour a fifteen minute artillery and rocket barrage will pound a one klick line as marked on your maps. It'll be enough to soften them up but not so long it'll allow them to adjust. After that 1st Armored will plunge through the line along the entire front led by the 2nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team pushing forward relentlessly and destroying anything in their way. They'll be followed by 1st Stryker BCT who will press forward and through on a narrow front as fast as they can. Their objective is not to engage on the front but push through to reach our objective, here,\" he pointed, \"which is Terminal Island, the squid staging area. Two reinforced companies from the 101st will have dropped in from the sea at the time the first assault happens and hold these two bridges,\" he pointed to an area map that showed the island, \"until 1st Stryker gets there. It shouldn't take more then six hours. While this is going on a Delta Force unit will move onto the island and neutralize their shield generator thus allowing us to use air cover to pin them down.\" \"What about their drones sir?\" the 1st Stryker commander asked. \"We'll have three fighter wings tasked to the assault. They will tie up the enemy air assets thus allowing us to use our superior ground forces to win the day. Other questions?\" \"Why not use more then two companies to hold the bridges sir?\" An Ops Colonel from 1st Armored asked. \"It seems to me that's a pretty big assignment for a relatively small group. That'll especially be the case until the shield is taken down. They'll have no air cover to assist.\" \"Good question Colonel Briggs,\" Daily responded. \"The reality is we don't have the airlift capability to bring in more then that and support the main assault. But we're confident they'll be sufficient to hold for the 6 hours needed. But yes, it is a big thing to ask. I believe we have the right people for the task.\" The answer seemed to satisfy the man though none would voice the unasked question about what would happen if they didn't get relieved in six hours. The risk was huge but it was a gamble they needed to take. \"Sir, I'd like to request that that 2-5 be allowed to provide the force that holds the bridges.\" All eyes turned to the gruff voice that had made the unexpected request. Colonel Ritchie moved forward to emphasize, his blue eyes blazing with determination. \"I don't think that's wise Ken,\" General Daily countered firmly but with compassion. \"You've been in the fight from day 1. I'd think you guys would be looking for a break. Besides, the 2-5 is pretty banged up.\" \"That's exactly why we should do it sir. Not only have we earned the right but no one knows how to fight the squids on their turf like my guys. No offense to the 101st. General, this is a company level action. I can put together a group that's ready to fight.\" Daily pondered the bold request for a moment then looked over to General McConville who gave a slight nod that was hard to perceive. \"Okay. 2-5 drops in and holds the bridge. 101st roll the squids back east and west from the breach and exploit opportunities to destroy the enemy. We need to be ready to step off in 48 hours people so get your troops dialed in. Brigade commanders from the newly arrived elements, I have some people who will bring you up to speed to know what to expect from our enemy. We've also set up in the warehouse next door several models you can walk through plus all the satellite and Predator imagery you can stomach. Battalion commanders, you're welcome to use this too. I want you all as well prepared for this as you can be.\" The commanding General paused then grimly declared, \"Make no mistake, we're risking everything on one throw of the dice. If we get this wrong they'll be nothing left, and the squid reinforcements'll be here in less then ten days. So make sure you're squared away.\" Daily looked around at the gathered staff noting the sour look on General Grayback's face and the tension on the others. Everyone knew what was at stake and also the risk they were taking. He took an extra couple of minutes to scan the room and make eye contact with everyone. \"Gentlemen, I want to not only throw a blanket on them I want us to then kick the crap out of them until they've got no more fight left. Do you get me?\" Despite the high rank of the officers in the conference room the place erupted in cheers like a locker room before the state football championship. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Father Alexander walked with a spring in his step as he travelled through the refugee city. He'd received a text message from Mike earlier in the morning that he and Michele had talked and were working out their problems but ultimately they wanted to be together. He praised God for this encouraging news and his mind meditated on several possibilities. Though in a civilian area the sights and sounds of preparation for war were evident. Supply trucks roared past and helicopters flew overhead. It was obvious something was about to happen. With the arrival of the 101st Airborne and 1st Armored the people in the refugee city had a renewed sense of optimism but he also knew that not so many miles away a relentless enemy waited whose desire was to not only defeat them but destroy them in the process. He prayed whoever was planning what was to come knew what they were doing as he watched two children innocently playing tag near him. He'd spent some time with Lt. Col. Ritchie before leaving on this mission and knew the grim reality the man faced. The Marine officer had a significant task but was agonizing about how to execute it. In a moment of vulnerability Ritchie had said he feared he'd 'bitten off more then he could chew' and didn't want to let the coming operation down. So he'd sent for the priest to pray for him. The priest reminded himself he'd have to pray for all the leaders. Arriving at his destination Father Alexander knocked on the door of the plywood building. He'd come for his regular checkup on Hector. The two times he'd been there before had gone well. The woman who called himself Hector's aunt had been polite and the boy seemed happier. But there was something about Maria Rincon that the priest didn't trust. Rage seethed below the surface, ready to break out. He hoped his plan could come together before something bad happened. As he waited at the door a strong sense of foreboding came over him. He felt a deep chill despite the heat of the late morning and instinctively knew what he'd feared had come to pass: Hector was gone. He knocked again with a greater sense of urgency. The priest chided himself for his belief the woman's devotion to the church could have held her there. With still no answer and no sound from within he turned the handle and let himself into the small home where the boy and his aunt lived. Had lived, Father Alexander corrected himself since they were no longer there. He looked around but knew he was no detective and would find no clues as to where they'd gone to. But even his untrained eye could tell this was not an unplanned flight of fancy. The woman had moved with precision and had planned the escape well. This meant that finding her would not be easy. He'd report this to the MP's and they'd begin some form of investigation but in reality finding a boy taken by a relative was not a high priority for the beleaguered unit. Should he tell Mike? That question weighed heavily on him. They needed a miracle. Automatically his hand went into his pocket to finger the well-worn rosary he carried around with him and he began to pray. Defensive line, Alhambra, near the Santa Monika Freeway Alien machine gun fire erupted from a hidden position as the officer ducked and weaved to the fortified observation post that Imlay and Lockett used to direct their squads on the front line. Rounds skipped behind Lt. Gordon as he showed a trace of the speed that had once made him a potential Olympian. \"Walker,\" Lockett called out to a Marine in position a few feet to his right, \"Target at 2 o'clock by that pair of burned out SUVs. Take that sniper out.\" The whump of an M203 grenade launcher going off was followed a few seconds later by the explosion of the precision shot hitting its target. A high pitch chirp could be heard after the sound of the grenade going off signaling a direct hit. \"Way to go Walker, you da man,\" Lockett encouraged the young Marine, \"score another one for you.\" \"Nice run L.T.,\" Imlay encouraged the officer as he skidded to a stop, breathing heavily from his dangerous run. \"You would have been a lock for the London Olympics if you hadn't gotten hurt.\" \"Yea, well at least now you don't have to worry about not going with them being cancelled and all,\" Lockett added with a touch of gallows humor. \"Kind of hard to have some games when someone's trying to destroy your city.\" Gordon grunted. \"I guess the squids did ruin those plans when they invaded last year. Well who knows? Maybe I'll make a comeback when all this is done. I think I've learned to run faster since I joined the Corp.\" \"Getting shot at will do that to you,\" Lockett commented. \"So what's up L.T.?\" \"Platoon's getting moved off the line. Hummee's are coming to pick us up within the hour.\" \"See, I told you we'd gotten reinforcements,\" Imlay said to his friend \"I'm just glad we're getting a break,\" Lockett replied with a look of relief. \"Sorry guys but I don't think that's what's happening,\" Gordon countered gravely. \"What do you mean?\" Lockett asked, a frown filling his face. \"The order came direct from Colonel Ritchie,\" the officer answered. \"I think we're going to be used for something major.\" \"With no platoon sergeant? Yea, right.\" The African American NCO couldn't believe what he was hearing \"Hey, at least Harris can rejoin us. I heard he cleared his rehab and is good to go. You can get him back, right L.T.? Because that's what he wants too,\" Imlay implored \"Sure, I can sort that out,\" Gordon agreed. \"The other part'll take some work but I'm not leaving the guys hanging. Anyway, get your people ready to move. We'll take it one step at a time.\" Area Command Headquarters Logistics and Supply Area, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations The following day, as preparations continued in earnest for the big push, Gunnery Sergeant Mike Nantz, Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, though still unawarded, sat at his desk in the supply warehouse shuffling papers from the right hand side, reorganizing them then shuffling them to the left then starting over again. He'd have the privilege of doing this all day long. His CO, Major Swan had been by earlier in the morning with his clipboard to ensure everything was going as he wanted. The officer's thin lips had curled into a satisfied grin of delight with each check on the list he'd been carrying. Happy with what he'd seen, he patronizingly patted Nantz on the shoulder and carried on with his life ambition of ensuring everything fit into his flowchart. Mike felt like driving his steel peg into his temple. Outside he could see the buildup and outflow of supplies. He could see others as he'd stood at the door moving with a sense of urgency and instinctively knew something big was coming up. The base was energized with a sense of anticipation. For everyone, that was except his commanding officer which meant the same held true for him. Despite this all, he had a sense of peace about it and not the anger he'd had before. Its not that he didn't want to be in the fight, he did, more then anything. But now he left his fate, and things beyond his control, with another and trusted that all this was unfolding for a reason. Mike thought of the divine and instinctively knew this wasn't random, or without purpose, but that he was part of a bigger drama and so he'd start to go with the flow, rather then fight it. Besides, Mike Nantz had lots on his mind. He thought about Hector again, as he'd done since Father Alexander had talked to him. He remembered the first time meeting the boy at the police station when they'd rescued him and his father Joe. Mike remembered that despite being terrified the kid had shown a spark. He remembered holding him after his dad had died at the destroyed FOB in Santa Monika. All his life he'd wanted to help people in the generic sense, people he didn't know. It was a macro, big picture-type of thing. But now he wanted to help in the personal, in the one-on-one, in the micro. He knew what he wanted to do and surprisingly it didn't terrify him despite how crazy it seemed. Then there was Michele. She fit into this bizarre puzzle too. They'd spent time together talking long into the night, just talking. He felt a sense of relief at this as he thought of Libby and her appetite for the physical. Michele was a welcome relief. Not that she wasn't attractive. He reminded himself there was something about her that got his motor running too. It just wasn't as overt as the flashy nurse. No, it had been a pleasant night. They pair had talked and talked and by the end it was as if they'd never been apart for weeks. It felt good and he wanted to continue with that feeling regardless of what happened with the war. It was time to go deeper. \"Hello Michael.\" Mike snapped out of his happy thoughts at the familiar voice. \"Father Alexander! Great to see you! Listen, I've come to a decision. I'd like to look after Hector if I'm allowed. I need to talk to Michele about it but I'm sure she'll be on board.\" Rather then look excited the priest had a grim look on his face. \"Michael, I don't know how to tell you this…something has happened…. \"What\"\" Mike exclaimed in sudden panic. \"He's not hurt is he?\" \"No. At least I don't think so,\" the priest reported awkwardly, \"but his aunt has taken him away somewhere and I don't know where he is.\" \"What do you mean 'she took him away'?\" Mike pressed going stony in his expression. \"I went to their home and they were gone. It also appears that they left permanently. I'd ordered her to say but…\" Mike buried his face in his hands. He couldn't believe he was hearing this. He'd finally come to a decision to help and now it seemed too late. This seemed to be happening to him on a regular basis and he wondered if God was playing some cruel game with him. \"You're sure?\" \"I'm sure,\" the tormented priest confirmed. \"I looked in the house and a lot of stuff was gone plus I asked some of the neighbors. They hadn't seen them for a bit.\" \"What can we do to get him back?\" \"I don't know. I've made a report with the MP's who are working with Child Protection and a contact I have in that agency but…\" \"Yea, but a lost orphan isn't a priority when there's a war going on.\" The priest hung his head, obviously dejected. \"It's my fault,\" he whispered. \"What? That's crazy. You can't carry that one,\" Mike countered. \"No, I knew something wasn't right with her but I thought I could keep her in check…that my position as a priest would carry some weight…I never thought she'd run…,\" his voice began to choke, \"if anything happens to the boy I don't know what I'll do.\" Mike had conflicted emotions. Rage at the woman's selfish actions, fear for Hector, but stronger was an overwhelming sense of compassion for the suffering priest. For so long he'd seen the man as almost untouchable, that the clerical collar was some form of armor, but he saw now a man like him with hopes, dreams and fears. His admiration and affection for the priest soared. Putting his arm around the miserable clergyman he said, \"We'll find him, I know we will. And I promise you, I won't let anything happen to him again, I'll look after him.\" Father Alexander wiped a tear from his eye and said with hope, \"You mean…\" \"Yes, I want to adopt the boy if I can.\" \"Well all right then. Lets find Hector.\" \"Okay, what's the first step?\" Mike asked, ready for action. \"First we need to talk to God about this and then we figure out a plan,\" the priest answered, confidence restored, as he pulled his rosary out and began to pray. As the afternoon drew to a close, and after Father Alexander withdrew Mike was left with his thoughts again. He needed time to think and had that in abundance since nothing was happening at the depot. But he also needed a change of scenery since the walls of the place started to close in. He knew Michele was busy at the hospital until the evening so leaving instructions with an Army Corporal he headed over to the NCOs club. Though late in the afternoon the place had numerous customers, a testimony to the constant state of action the base witnessed. All elements of the military were represented in the pub reflecting the composition of the force trying to retake LA. Mike got a cold Budweiser and sat alone at a table to think through everything going on. He nodded to a couple of Marine Sergeants who sat at the table beside him and began to reflect. The situation with Hector burned within him, only solidifying the decision he'd made. Yet the point was moot unless the boy could be found. It should have never come to that , Mike chided himself and his frustration spilled over to his irritation with his current situation. A big push was coming and he'd be left out of it again. He chewed on these thoughts, they becoming almost circular going around and around until a piece of the conversation at the next table hit him like a punch to the nose. \"I tell you, no ones going to serve with Gordon.\" \"The widow-maker? No kidding. Ritchie was crazy to pick his platoon to go in first place.\" \"Who else do they have though? Two companies? Give me a break! 2-5 shouldn't be handling it anyway. Those guys are done.\" \"Yea, and with them supposed to hold the bridges…well, I'm glad I'm not part of 1st Stryker.\" Mike had an idea what was going on but he couldn't bring himself to believe it. He shelved his thoughts on Hector for suddenly a more pressing matter. Getting up he moved over to the table beside him, getting the attention of the two Marines. \"Hi guys, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. What's up with the 2-5?\" \"Buy us a beer and we'll tell you,\" the one answered casually, a sarcastic grin on his hard face. Mike signaled the bartender for another round then said, \"So what's going on with the 2-5? I served with Gordon.\" The other Sergeant took a pull of his beer and looked more closely at the name on Mike's utilities. \"Hey, you're Nantz. What you doing back here?\" \"He got pulled to be some figurehead,\" the sarcastic one said to his buddy, then turned to Mike, \"Hey, why aren't you at some officer's cocktail party?\" \"So, anyways, what's happening with Gordon?\" Mike redirected, trying to stay calm in the face of the one who was baiting him. \"He's a widow-maker, or a jinx. Either way, he's lost six platoon Sergeants in four months,\" the one reported. \"Yea, count yourself lucky you became famous before it happened to you. The guy's got the smell of trouble.\" \"Really?\" Mike couldn't believe what he was hearing, knowing Gordon to be a solid officer. \"Yep. No one will serve with him anymore,\" the talkative Sergeant answered. \"The last guy they tried to move into the unit flat out refused and is up on insubordination charges. The guy before that mysterious twisted his knee the day before he was reassigned.\" \"And those poor sods are going to be in the thick of it when the big push happens,\" the sarcastic one added wit a wicked smirk. \"They don't stand a chance. I just hope it doesn't screw up the operation.\" Mike was stunned by what he heard. He could feel his heart beginning to beat faster at the thought of what was to come to the guys. Reaching into his pocket he pulled out some cash and handed it to the two Marines. \"Thanks for the info guys. Buy yourselves another round.\" \"Hey, what's your hurry? Its not every day we get to drink with a genuine hero,\" the sarcastic one called out as Mike walked towards the exit. \"Another time,\" Mike replied not looking back. \"I have someone I need to talk to.\"[Chapter 41] Chapter 41 – In all the way Area Command Headquarters and staging area, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations \"I want back in sir,\" Mike implored Colonel Ritchie. \"We've been over this before, Gunnery Sergeant, it's not my call,\" the commanding officer of the Marine battalion answered in exasperation. After the conversation with the two Sergeants at the NCO's club the previous night Mike had been restless and unable to sleep. The thoughts of the men from the 2-5 going into combat lacking proper leadership didn't sit right with him. But what could he do? He was stuck in the rear area. Then, there was his renewed relationship with Michele. Plus the issue of Hector being missing hung over his head. He had a lot on the go. But almost as the thoughts entered into his mind they were pushed aside by a stronger call to duty. He knew what he needed to do despite his personal feelings. So as soon as he could the following morning Mike checked in at the supply depot then left for battalion headquarters of the 2nd Battalion 5th Marine Regiment and demanded to talk to the commanding officer. The Colonel had been none too pleased to see the NCO. \"But things are different,\" Mike doggedly countered. \"I know you're about to go into some pretty serious stuff and no one wants to serve in Gordon's platoon. I don't want them going into this fight without a proper NCO.\" \"That's not your problem Gunny. Besides, where did you hear that?\" Ritchie demanded. \"Come on sir, let's cut the crap and talk straight. You know it's true so let's move past that,\" Mike rightly surmised. \"You know I'm best suited for action. Training was okay but I'm dying in supply. This is killing me. I'm a combat Marine, a combat leader, not a boot counter. Please, just give me a chance. I want to help.\" Ritchie opened his mouth then closed it, looking away for a moment. He folded his hands behind his back then looked up at the ceiling. \"Screw it, let's go talk to General Daily,\" he emphatically declared. Less then thirty minutes later they were at the area headquarters and in the commander's office. LCol Ritchie had bullied and pushed his way to this audience and General Daily was none too pleased. \"I don't have time for this and neither do you,\" Daily chastised the Colonel when he heard the request for reassignment. \"So why are we going over this again? The point is not up for debate.\" \"Things have changed though General,\" Ritchie countered. \"We're having troubles staffing the platoon NCO role with Lt. Gordon. We need them at full efficiency and Nantz will allow that to happen.\" \"Yea, I've heard about your staffing issue Ken,\" Daily shot back. \"I hear no one wants to serve with the guy. And this is one of the platoons going in on the mission?\" \"You know what, we can talk about that afterwards okay?\" Ritchie responded testily. \"For now, I have a little more then 24 hours to put my team together and I need Nantz.\" \"And there's no other platoon in your whole battalion you can use instead but this one?\" Daily pressed. \"Despite the talk, they're the best one in their company,\" Ritchie held his ground. \"They're ready for this fight.\" \"Ready except they have no platoon Sergeant. That's not ready in my book,\" the commanding officer grunted angrily. \"Maybe I should give the assignment back to the 101st if you're not ready.\" \"Come on General,\" that's not what this is about,\" Ritchie reacted, his voice dropping, stung by the comment. Daily realized the heated conversation had gone too far and he'd spoken out of turn. \"I know your guys can do it Ken,\" he changed tone. \"You know my hands are tied on this. The order comes down from Washington.\" Switching to Mike he declared, \"And you, Gunnery Sergeant we've been over this before. You've got your orders like I do. Are you not willing to fulfill them?\" \"Sir, come on,\" Mike stood his ground, trying to stay cool. \"I've been doing nothing but that for months. I just want to serve where I've been trained: in combat. I didn't ask to get a medal I didn't deserve, I didn't ask to go on the dog and pony show across the country but I did. I didn't ask to be stuck in training and then supply but I've soldiered on. This is different! This operation has a chance of ending the war. I'm not asking for special favor. I'm just asking to do what I've done all my career. Dammit sir, take me off the bench and put me in the game, let me be a Marine. What would you do if you were in my shoes?\" Mike reddened at the profanity but didn't apologize, instead fixing the stocky African American senior officer with a steady gaze. Daily pursed his lips and gave a wry grin. \"Well Gunnery Sergeant I'd like to say I would follow orders but I expect I'd be doing the same thing.\" He paused for a moment, chewing on his lip. Then, with a look of fire in his eyes responded, \"Enough of this! I'm not letting some pencil neck geek in Washington dictate to me anymore. Nantz, you're in.\" Mike and LCol Ritchie withdrew from the office after receiving the assurance and left the headquarters. Wisely they left to allow the General to get back to what they'd interrupted him from. \"Okay, so that's done. I want you to come with me to battalion right away. We don't have any time to lose. I'll take care of the paperwork and letting your CO know. Anything you need from me?\" Ritchie asked. \"Well I'd like to see the look on Major Swan's face when he finds out. This'll ruin his whole chart.\" Ritchie snorted. \"Anything else?\" \"Just one,\" Mike replied, feeling a like a weight had been lifted off his chest. \"I'll let you know on the way.\" As plans were coming together for the attempt to break the stalemate in Los Angeles before the anticipated alien reinforcements arrived similar events were happening around the world. Though efforts had been made by the UN initially for some form of co-coordinated response the initiatives had fallen to the squabbling of politics especially among some of the fringe nations that were not being directly threatened. Though the President, Prime Minister of Britain and other G-8 world leaders had spoken of the common threat politics and selfishness overwhelmed the common good. But all was not as bleak as it seemed. Among the nations under assault information sharing had gone to unprecedented levels and new relationships built on mutual need were being formed outside the bloated bureaucracy of the UN. The most critical piece of information shared was that discovered by an unassuming newspaper reporter turned Army Reserve intelligence officer. Captain Blatchford had been awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal for her actions around discovering the weakness of the alien shield though she didn't know it yet. Her information had gone around the world and had led to most nations coming to the same conclusion: attack was a necessity. Almost organically the countries came up with similar strategies for attempting to dislodge the enemy who hung on doggedly like a tick. Though none of the world leaders or their military commanders would admit it, each was preparing to make their own throw of the dice to win it all. With the war for the world having gone on nearly a year and the costs huge, none wanted to see it protracted conflict although how to end it was still being fiercely debated and there were still those who advocated suing for peace. But the soldiers on the front line knew from experience what many of the politicians still didn't. There could be no peaceful co-existence with this invader. Theirs was a mission of annihilation and colonization. One only needed to look at the alien water extractors and the impact they were having on water table levels to have that emphasized. The coming battle would define the future of humanity. So Los Angeles almost became a proxy for what was going on around the world. They would be the first to attempt a breakout and the rest of the world would be watching. Within the hour Mike was back with the 2-5 at their battalion area. After clearing intake and being formally reinstated into a company he had a chance to meet with his beleaguered platoon commander. Lt. Gordon had an obvious sense of relief as he came over to greet his new platoon Sergeant. He shook Mike's hand vigorously and pounded him on the back even before the Gunnery Sergeant had finished his salute. The pair conferred for a while ensuring each was up to speed on what was going on and what was needed. Then the junior officer left to continue the preparations for their insertion the following day. As he walked away it seemed there was a renewed spring in the Lieutenant's stride. Mike couldn't help but smile at the change of circumstances and what they meant for him. Finally, he was useful again. Coming out of the company headquarters Mike saw two familiar figures striding towards him. \"Gunny Nantz! Welcome back,\" Corporal Imlay greeted him warmly. \"We heard from the L.T. you'd been reassigned to us.\" \"Yea, we didn't think we'd see you again so soon,\" Lockett added with an obvious sense of relief. Mike tried to think of a clever one-liner to throw back but nothing came to mind and nothing seemed appropriate. \". \"I've really missed this…and missed you guys. It's good to be back,\" he said quietly. \"Back where you belong!\" Imlay declared enthusiastically. \"Word,\" Lockett agreed. \"Listen, we heard you volunteered to come back. After everything we've been through…,\" his voice trailed off uncomfortably. \"What he means is…I mean with all the talk and stuff…,\" Imlay didn't know how to finish. \"We're just grateful, that's all. So are the guys,\" Lockett stated awkwardly. \"Okay guys, let's get one thing straight,\" Mike said with an edge in his voice. \"This talk about jinx's and curses is bull. Gordon is a straight-up leader. You were in good hands and you are in good hands. Let's put this crap behind us and focus on our objective.\" \"Yea, right on!\" Imlay cheered. \"Damn straight,\" Lockett grinned. \"So, what's the state of the platoon?\" Mike asked, knowing the point had been made and there would be no more distractions. \"We're in pretty good shape,\" Imlay reported. \"We're a bit light in a couple of the squads and could use a good leader for the machine gun det but the guys are squared away and they all know how to fight. They're all experienced so we're ready for whatever happens.\" \"Outstanding,\" Mike answered in genuine happiness. \"Let me look into some of these things and also make sure we've got what we need. Also, I want the troops together so we can run through some drills before supper all right? Then we'll run through things again before we turn in. I want the guys sharp when we go in tomorrow.\" \"No troubles Gunny,\" Imlay affirmed. \"We'll make sure the troops are squared away and ready to go.\" The two Corporals left with renewed enthusiasm. Mike went about the rest of his business with a spirit of vigor and happy purpose. He felt a sense of vitality surge through him he'd not had for months. Things finally seemed to be looking up for him. \"Michael, what are you doing here?\" The familiar voice of Father Alexander brought reality crashing in on the new state of bliss. Mike could tell the priest was agitated by his tone. \"Oh, hi Father Alexander. I just got transferred this morning back to the battalion so I didn't get a chance to touch base.\" Mike paused then decided to come clean. He didn't want to hedge anymore. \"No, I volunteered to come back. The battalion needed me so I asked to come back.\" \"And what about Hector? What about your promise to help me look for him? Have you forgotten that?\" the priest pressed, obviously unimpressed by what he'd heard. \"I haven't forgotten,\" Mike held his ground. \"Some things have changed.\" \"What's changed? How could things change in one day?\" the priest pressed. \"Michael, you can't keep being so inconsistent. At some point you need to stand up and stand for something.\" \"Hey!\" Mike retorted, losing his cool. \"That's not what this is. Remember, it was never my idea or my desire to be stuck in the rear area. I'm a Marine, a combat soldier. That's what I should have been doing all along, looking after my troops and doing what I can to beat these aliens back. The only way we'll be able to deal with things like this is if we have peace. I'm just trying to do my part to see that happen.\" Father Alexander rocked back at the strength of Mike's passionate rebuttal. His face reddened at the realization of what he'd just accused his friend of. \"Michael, I'm...I'm sorry. It was wrong of me. I should never have accused you of that. I know that. It's just…just I'm worried about Hector and scared what's going to happen. With him disappearing like that after I warned his aunt….I lost my head. Please forgive me. I know how hard this has been on you.\" Mike was instantly mortified by how he'd treated the priest who'd stood by him for years. He could see the anguish on the man's face and knew how concerned he was. In truth Mike was too but had temporarily forgotten in his excitement to be getting back into the action. \"No, I'm the one who should be apologizing to you. I know you didn't mean it. I'm sorry I jumped on you like that.\" \"Thank you Michael,\" Father Alexander blinked his eyes rapidly as he tried to maintain control of his emotions. \"So you're going in tomorrow?\" \"Yes, first wave.\" \"I'll be praying for you,\" the priest said quietly, avoiding eye contact. \"Thanks, I appreciate that,\" Mike answered, genuinely grateful. \"But what about Hector? What can be done?\" \"Well, the right people have been alerted but it's like finding a needle in a haystack. For now, all we can do is pray.\" Again the priest pulled out his rosary. He thought to himself he'd been doing a lot of that lately but then maybe that was the way it should be. Mike and Father Alexander spent some time together praying about the situation but then each had to get back to their duties. Mike didn't have as much snap in his actions as he'd had before. It wasn't the priest's fault. He too had a heavy heart for Hector and began to feel guilty about leaving after pledging to try to help find him. He could understand the reaction of the priest. Then another thought hit him like a brick to the head: he had to tell Michele. She'd likely be as thrilled as Father Alexander had been. Mike checked in with Lt. Gordon and got permission to leave for an hour. Fortunately the hospital was close to the 2-5's staging area so he jogged over but before he arrived he made one quick stop. Heart beating in anxiety and anticipation he entered the hospital then found Michele in between rounds. \"Mike! What a pleasant surprise,\" she greeted him with a peck on the cheek. \"Listen, I'm in the middle of rounds but give me a half hour and I can get away for a bit of time.\" \"Michele…I…\" Mike suddenly didn't know what to say. \"What's the matter?\" Michele asked, picking up on his apprehension and becoming cautious herself. \"Is everything okay?\" \"Uhm, yes, but I'm going back into combat,\" Mike answered suddenly feeling incredibly selfish. \"I've been reassigned back to the 2-5. No, that's not entirely true. I requested a transfer back in. We'll be leaving for the front early in the morning. I had to see you before I left.\" \"Back to the front? To combat?\" Michele said breathlessly as if she'd been punched in the stomach. \"But how? I thought you weren't allowed back at the front.\" \"I wasn't but I talked to the Commanding General and he made the arrangements.\" \"You…you asked to go back in?\" the dark haired woman asked incredulously, her eyes flaring. \"Yes, I had to. Some things came up. They need me,\" Mike implored. \"Okay, I see,\" Michele responded evenly, trying hard to keep her emotions in check. \"Listen, I need to get back to work. I'll be praying for you. Take care of yourself.\" She turned and began to walk away. Mike grabbed her hand to keep her from leaving. She was crying and trying hard to not let the tears fall down her face. \"Michele wait, there's more. I didn't just come to tell you and I'm not abandoning you like I did before. I have to do this but it doesn't mean I want to leave you because I don't.\" He paused and fumbled with his pocket as Michele stood transfixed by the implication of his declaration. \"I know this is lousy timing,\" Mike began as he went down on one knee and brought a small box out of his utilities. \"I don't want to hedge anymore, I want to be in all the way.\" Opening the box a diamond ring sparkled. \"I love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?\"[Chapter 42] Chapter 42- Game Time \"YES!\" Michele cried out, so loud others looked to see what was going on. She charged into Mike with such force he nearly fell over, embracing him fiercely. \"Yes, I'll marry you.\" \"Even after everything I just told you?\" Mike asked, making sure she understood what was going on. Michele's eyes filled with tears but these were not of regret or fear but rather joy. \"I heard what you said Mike and I don't care. I know the risk. I still don't care. I love you too and I'm tired of hedging myself or waiting for the right moment. You want to marry me and you're the one going into danger.\" \"I'm really glad. I can't live without you,\" Mike responded, not having thought much beyond popping the question. He wasn't sure what else to say. \"That you would think of me when you're getting ready for something like this means so much,\" Michele continued her thought, sliding the simple but elegant engagement ring onto her finger. There really wasn't anything else to say so instead the two looked deep into each others eyes then kissed passionately as a gathering of staff and several patients cheered. \"What's going on here?\" Dr. Chevreau demanded angrily, pushing his way into the middle of the cluster of people. \"This is a hospital, not a club. Get back to work. You, Sergeant,\" he referred to Mike, \"you can't just come in here and disrupt things like this. We have work to do even if you don't.\" \"He came to propose to Michele, doctor,\" Kelly explained, joining the group. \"Well, isn't that just special,\" Chevreau responded icily. \"Regardless, Michele you have your responsibilities so I expect you'll get them done,\" he demanded, trying to dampen the elation of the situation. Kelly took the chart out of the disappointed woman's hand and gave it a quick look. \"Listen, I can take care of this for you. Take a half hour with Mike then come back.\" Chevreau looked at the nurse angrily but a murmur from the crowd who'd picked up what the doctor was trying to do causing him to back down. \"Fine,\" he muttered and stormed off. \"You're the best Kelly, thanks,\" Michele gushed, unhooking herself from Mike to give her friend a hug. \"Yea, yea,\" she deadpanned. \"You kids go and have fun.\" Mike and Michele left as if floating on a magic carpet. The next thirty minutes seemed like thirty days to them and was enough to sustain each for the stressful days to come. Each drank deep of the other now that all the obstacles to their relationship were gone. Though they set no details for their wedding, in truth how could they, that wasn't the point. Mike had asked, he'd crossed the line, and Michele had accepted, allowing herself to fall off the cliff with him. For the time being, nothing more needed to be said. A state of bliss ensued. But time marched on and each needed to leave the blissful cocoon they were enjoying and return to the reality of their lives. \"I don't know when I'll see you again,\" Mike declared quietly. \"It's okay. Go knowing I love you and I'll be waiting for you,\" Michele answered, trying to keep her voice steady. \"Listen, if I don't make it back,\" Mike said urgently, \"I don't want you to-.\" Michele cut him off by putting her hand gently across his mouth silencing the coming declaration. \"I'll be here waiting for you,\" she re-iterated. \"Thanks,\" he said, looking down to avoid her seeing the tears welling in his eyes. \"This has been a magical time. I wish I could capture it in a bottle and take it with me.\" Michele's face lit up in a radiant smile. \"Do you have your phone?\" \"Sure, what about it?\" he asked in confusion. \"Here, give it to me.\" She took the phone from him, scrolled through the options and set it to camera. Then, holding it at arms length and putting her other arm affectionately around him she said, \"Say cheese!\" Rather then think, he responded as he felt at the moment sensing the woman he loved on his arm. She scrutinized the picture with a look of satisfaction. \"There, now the moment's been captured,\" Michele confirmed, handing him back the phone. \"Now just before you head out on your mission I want you to send this to me so I know you've left. Then when you come back we'll take another one to celebrate.\" Her voice began to break, betraying the mixed emotions she was feeling as she tried to stay calm. \"I'll see you when you get back.\" She hugged and kissed him hard, lingering for a moment. Mike could taste the salt of her tears mixed into the kiss. \"Please come back,\" she said then left quickly so as to not prolong the agony of their departure. Mike stood alone, his own eyes wet, emotions heavy. He held the phone up to look at the picture and was surprised by the look of spontaneous joy on his face. She had captured the moment. This would sustain him until he got back. \"I will be back,\" he whispered. Mike returned to the unit's staging area, no his unit's staging area he reminded himself. The Marine practically floated the whole way, almost giddy for how things were turning out. Though the future was uncertain the present was clear for the first time in months. He knew what he was doing and he knew what he felt. Mike couldn't help but let out a deep sigh of contentment. Upon returning and getting back into the preparations for the next day's action, Mike didn't tell the guys in the platoon about him and Michele. They didn't need the distraction and neither did he. The decision though not entirely spontaneous had also not been completely thought out. Perhaps it was best that way. If he'd spent too much time analyzing it he would have backed down waiting for a 'better time'. The reality was there wouldn't ever be a better or perfect time. He did love her. He did want to spend the rest of his life with her. Now he needed to make sure he stayed alive to see it happen. Abandoned industrial complex, somewhere outside Military Command Los Angeles Protective Zone, LA A rat scurried across the floor kicking up little clouds of dust as it ran. Hector lay on the worn-out mattress watching the creature run away as the man known as Javier tried to catch it for fun. The stocky, tattooed Latino had already captured and broken the backs of four previously for his own amusement. Hector had no idea where he was, only that it looked like an old factory that hadn't been used for years. All he knew was the place and the people who made it home scared him. The boy had been taken to an area on the fringes of LA, closer to the war zone and away from the refugee city and military operations area. The neighborhood was dotted with abandoned warehouses and industrial buildings once a haven of commerce in the early 20th century but now a forgotten footnote in history. The only thing growing in a place where once hundreds worked were weeds that dominated the landscape. This was a no-man's land on the periphery between the two opposing sides where those wanting to live by their own rules had gravitated towards. A small community had formed in the buildings of the complex by those seeking to do things their own way while not caring what happened to anyone else. The echoing sound of heavy equipment moving in the distance was heard as if calling out something of significance to the human inhabitants was about to happen. But to those in this area, they could care less. Theirs was a land of their own, a personal fiefdom where they made the rules. Occasionally an alien Wedge Ship would pulse over the area or a human aircraft but beyond that the area was left alone. The war was further to the west and this part of the area had been deemed insignificant so forgotten. In truth it had been forgotten even before the war by the progression of commerce so the current situation only furthered its legacy as a haven for those looking to live outside the law. Hector felt his stomach tighten again. The miserable boy tried not to cry as he thought again about what had happened to him. The priest, Father Alexander, knew Gunny Nantz and was trying to help him but Aunt Maria didn't want that to happen. He'd begun to realize during that time perhaps what had been happening to him was not normal, that him going out to work while she didn't and giving her all the money wasn't normal, that the packages she'd arranged for him to deliver for some shady men was not right either. She'd tricked him into leaving their home then beat him when they'd arrived while the man named Javier watched as a warning of what would happen to him if he tried to leave. But he'd realized it too late. Before he could have run away and known where to go. Now, he had no idea where he was and the people around him scared him. His fear of the consequences of trying to escape was the strongest lock on his prison. Hector was trapped. Hot tears formed little rivers as they flowed through the caked-on dirt on his face. He lay on the mattress, not wanting anyone to see, knowing what would happen to him and did the only thing he could think of: pray. 2nd Battalion 5th Marines staging area, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations The morning was already hot, promising a scorching day but none of that mattered as the NCO's went over their kit and supplies one last time before loading up. \"Claymores-yea, check,\" Imlay called out, sweat mixing already with the eye black he wore signaling his readiness for combat. \"Extra Predator SRAW's-check,\" Lockett added for the benefit of their platoon Sergeant who checked everything off on the list he'd written on a page in his Field Message Pad. \"Everyone equipped with NOD's?\" Mike asked. \"Yea Gunny, we all got our Night Optical Devices,\" Lockett confirmed. \"Extra SAW and GPMG ammo?\" \"Everyone has two extra belts for the 240 and 249 each,\" Imlay confirmed. \"How about you Doc? You got all the extra med gear on the list?\" Mike questioned Jibril Adukwu. \"Yes Gunny,\" the Corpsman answered in his thick African accent. \"Everything is packed and ready.\" \"Awful lot of kit for a six hour mission,\" Lockett commented, wiping sweat from his face with a camo neck cloth. \"It is if you think its going to be a six hour mission,\" Mike returned, checking his list again. \"And you don't think it will be?\" Imlay questioned. \"When does it ever?\" the Gunnery Sergeant answered. That got the attention of his squad and team leaders. \"You think things are going to go FUBAR? Is this a suicide mission like some people are saying Gunny?\" a Lance Corporal named Dave Milne asked nervously. \"No, not at all,\" Mike answered with more confidence externally then he felt inside. \"The mission's well thought-out and planned. We need to break this stalemate. But things do happen and we should be prepared for them. Mission success is based not just on guts but also preparation. You don't win battles with happy thoughts and good intentions.\" \"It's a pretty heavy load though,\" another newly minted fire team leader named Taylor Lake commented. \"Yea, are we a rifle platoon or a weapons platoon?\" Milne griped. \"Good question Milne. Maybe we're both for this mission,\" Mike mused. \"Yes, it would be a lot if we were making a long hump,\" he agreed, \"but the LZ we're dropping in is close to our position. The extra gear will come in handy if things start to go south on us. So we have the luxury of being almost a hybrid weapon's platoon when you look at the overall gear the Colonel's having us bring in. Be glad I'm not having you guys carry more bombs for the mortar!\" That brought a chuckle from the assembled leaders in the platoon, their relief at Mike's thorough analysis and preparation evident. \"Reporting for duty Gunny,\" a familiar but recently unheard voice broke into the conversation. \"Harris!\" Imlay shouted. \"Hey, Specs, man,\" Lockett joined. \"You back with us?\" Imlay asked with anticipation. \"Sure am. I've been cleared to return to action and found out someone had requested me for your machine gun detachment.\" I'm glad I didn't miss out,\" Harris said enthusiastically, adjusting his black, thick-rimmed glasses. All eyes turned to Mike who watched the Marines greeting each other with a content look on his face. Yes, the Gunnery Sergeant thought of everything. \"Good to have you with us Harris,\" Mike shook his hand, \"back where you belong huh?\" \"Yea, for both of us,\" the bespectacled Corporal added. \"I'm just glad I got here before you left. I couldn't live with myself if you guys went in without me.\" The group nodded their heads in appreciation at the simple yet heroic comment before a new voice joined the conversation. \"Is there room at this party for another?\" a Latino female voice spoke above the others. All conversation stopped as Tech Sergeant Elena Santos sauntered over with a slight limp to join the group. \"Santos? Whoa, you comin' on this mission?\" Lockett asked in surprise. \"I didn't think you've been cleared for front-line duty anymore,\" Harris added. \"Well, that's technically true but I guess this situation called for someone with my unique talents,\" the spunky Air Force NCO replied. \"What? The only woman to let a squid into her mouth?\" Harris laughed, remembering their desperate ride the previous year to the last LZ left in LA at the time. Santos smacked him in the arm for the mischievous comment. \"Funny.\" \"Naw, I'm kidding. It's good to have you back.\" The two hugged and others from the original team welcomed her back. \"But seriously, what are you doing here?\" Imlay asked, thinking she'd never be back. \"You need someone to call in and co-ord airstrikes once the shield comes down. That's my job. Plus, I made myself enough of a pain in the ass in the rear area my boss wanted to get rid of me so when the call came in he was happy to release me.\" That caused a new round of laughter further lightening the mood for the tense NCO's who clustered around her. \"So you got everything you need?\" Mike asked, bringing things back in focus. \"We're about to load up.\" \"Sure thing. I got my weapon, my code book and my good looks,\" she added cheekily, giving him a wink. Noticing his new chevrons she said genuinely, \"Hey, congratulations on being promoted. Glad to see someone is doing something right for a change.\" Mike snorted but didn't comment. \"It's good to have you back Santos.\" The Latino Sergeant moved away from the other Marines so she could speak to Mike only. \"Listen, I know you requested to have me back even though I'm less then 100%. Thanks for that. I was dying at the rear. I won't let you down,\" she declared with an intense look in her eyes. \"I know you can get the job done. Mind you, where we're going you may not thank me but I wanted people around me I knew I could trust,\" Mike answered honestly. \"Also, I know what its like to be stuck in a place you don't belong.\" \"Yea,\" she chuckled. \"I know where we're going. I wouldn't want to be any place else right now but with you guys.\" \"Good. You'll be in the second chopper with me. Go report to Lt. Gordon and let him know you're here.\" The sound of engines and the rumbling of heavy equipment in the distance signaled final movement for the operation was beginning. The tanks and carriers of the assaulting force were beginning to move out to their staging areas in preparation for the coming attack. At the 2-5 battalion area everything had been packed, checked and re-checked. The loads had been weighed to ensure they wouldn't overload the helicopters and now all waited for the signal to mount up. LCol Ritchie called all the company and platoon commanders along with the Sergeants together as the helicopter pilots began their pre-flight checks. The assaulting force Marines sat edgily around in their chalks waiting to load up. Everyone knew what was coming up and knew the stakes. \"All right people, listen up,\" Ritchie got their attention. \"Nothing has changed in the plan. We're inserting from the south-west landing in-between and as close to the bridges as we can in two packets. Intel tells us we should be able to get within one klick and resistance will be light. We do a quick assault securing both ends of the bridges. E company, you have the Vincent Thomas Bridge. B company, yours is Commodore Helm. Headquarters and a small reserve force will set up at the SA Recycling facility between the two when the area has been secured. We need to do this quick because Delta Force is inserting behind us fifteen minutes later. They'll leapfrog past our strongpoint at Vincent Thomas Bridge then seek and destroy the shield generator on the island. Once that's down Air Force will provide overhead cover. Then, 1st Armored will relieve us six hours later. If all works well we'll be back in time for evening chow. Any questions?\" \"Who will have overall operational control on the ground sir?\" one of the two company commanders asked. \"You haven't told us yet.\" \"I will be,\" Ritchie answered, a gleam in his eyes. For the first time the other leaders realized the senior officer was in full fighting order with pack, Modular Tactical Vest and weapon. \"Is that a problem?\" he continued. \"No sir,\" the Captain who asked the question replied. \"But what about the rest of the battalion?\" \"They're LOB for this operation so the XO can look after them,\" Ritchie answered, reminding them the remainder of the 2-5 was not going to participate in this operation only 101st Airborne and 1st Armored. \"So I didn't want to stay behind and let you all have the fun.\" \"Outstanding sir,\" the Captain replied. \"Good to have you with us,\" another added. The collected leaders broke into grins at the declaration from their fiery commander. Mission confidence had just gotten a boost. \"Excellent. Then return to your troops, we take off in fifteen minutes. I'll see you all at the bridges,\" Ritchie signaled the end of the briefing. \"Retreat…\" \"HELL!\" the others erupted. \"2-5,\" the Colonel answered, glad to be going out. \"Let's get it done Marines.\" The officers and NCO's returned to their men and word spread rapidly through the two companies that their CO would be coming with them. Smiles lit up faces and several cheered the news. Any gloomy spirit was chased away, replaced with an edgy desire to get on with it. \"Mount up!\" The command was yelled out and relayed over the radios. Each Marine had the new encrypted radios the aliens couldn't pick up so their communications were expected to be excellent between themselves and back to the operations centre that would be co-coordinating the operation from the rear area. At least they hoped it would be. Marines trotted over to the waiting aircrafts, instinctively ducking away from rotor blades and hopping into their places, waiting for their ride behind enemy lines and the chance to finally win the battle for LA. In the second helicopter of the 1st platoon of E Company the whine of the Blackhawk's rotor turned to a scream as the helicopter jerked slightly fighting gravity. As the bird lifted off from the ground Mike hit the send button on his phone sending the picture Michele had taken of them the day before to let her know he was departing. Beneath it he added the simple tag line: I love you. He felt his chest tighten and throat constrict as he looked at the picture before shutting down his phone. It seemed so long ago. He had no time for that now. He had to put those emotions away just like he did with the phone. There would be no room for distractions on this mission, he was going back to combat and he needed to have a laser focus. It was game time.[Chapter 43] Chapter 43 into the breach The helicopters and tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft carrying the 2-5 Marines to their objective moved away from land then out to sea as the 1st Armored and 101st Airborne forces moved towards the front line for the attack. The morning sun glinted off the water and it was an altogether peaceful scene. Mike watched from the doorway of the helicopter he sat in the tranquility of the picture, wondering if they'd ever be able to experience the joy of nature again like days past. Could the innocence lost last year when the world was invaded be restored? It would if he had anything to do with it. The airborne armada had flown well behind their own lines then out to sea away from the city. Reaching their outer mark they made a left hand turn and began to fly back towards LA. The Marines had flown far enough out that the sprawling city was not even seen on the horizon the plan being they'd come in low, fast and hard in order to achieve an element of surprise. Dropping to less then one hundred feet the aircraft increased speed roaring towards their objective. Mike looked at his watch and noted the time for the bombardment prior to the assault on the main line was about to begin. He wondered how it would go and what type of reception they'd have saying a quick prayer for all involved. He could see through the windshield of the Blackhawk that LA was now visible which meant they could be seen as well. They would find out soon enough if anyone was paying attention as they reached land knifing on an angle towards their objective. After a short time the call came from the helicopter pilot: \"Five minutes.\" \"Five minutes people,\" Mike yelled above the roar of the helicopter engine, feeling his heart rate increase, \"get hot!\" The Marines in the chopper began to wiggle around, adjust straps on their gear, set helmets in place and the countless other rituals soldiers perform before combat. Mike surveyed the troops with a seasoned eye, noting with satisfaction the look of determination on their faces. Then his gaze fixed on Elena Santos. The Air Force Tech Sergeant, who had every reason not to be there, had a gleeful snarl on her face, seemingly itching to get back into the action. He wondered what he looked like shifting his gaze out the open door again at the approaching Knoll Hill Park where they would be landing. Prominently beyond that was the Vincent Thomas Bridge puncturing the skyline. Everything was in place, now it was time to do it. Without warning the helicopter shook violently as an explosion nearby sent a shock wave through the air. The Marines were pitched into each other, trying to maintain their position as Mike grabbed a restraining strap to keep from falling over. Another deafening explosion filled the air and threw the Blackhawk in another direction causing the passengers to fall in a different direction. \"Enemy contact. We got a hot LZ!\" the pilot screamed into the communications as he ducked and swerved the bulky helicopter. So much for light resi s tance , Mike thought as he watched with horror a Blackhawk get hit by alien ground fire then plunge to the ground. The door gunner opened up with his M240 to try to take off some of the pressure hosing the ground with fire as the aircraft began to descend to the landing area. \"It's too hot for us to set down Gunny, you're going to need to do a quick insertion,\" the pilot reported to Mike. \"Roger that, we won't leave you exposed longer then needed,\" Mike replied flicking the safety off his M4A. \"Thanks. God be with you,\" the tense pilot answered. \"Get ready,\" Mike yelled to the troops, watching the ground rise slowly towards them as alien machine gun fire picked up. Several rounds pinged off the armor plating of the helicopter as the door gunner swung to engage this new threat. Mike noted the location just as the Blackhawk went into a hover several feet above the ground. \"Move! Find cover!\" he yelled, jumping out onto a baseball field then running for cover as enemy rounds chewed up the green grass of the outfield around him. Looking left and right Mike saw that enemy fire was coming from a group of buildings that made up the Harbor Occupational Centre across the street from the park which was to be their landing point. He recognized the structure from the aerial photos and knew it provided excellent cover so would be tough to assault. He swore to himself, cursing that they'd dropped into this hornet's nest. Continuing to run for cover he noted only a couple of helicopters had landed so far which meant there wasn't a lot to work with in dislodging the seemingly entrenched enemy. Where did these guys come from? , Mike thought to himself as he burned through a magazine to buy himself a few more steps. Slapping a fresh one in place he let off a three round burst. And how'd they figure out to set up here? A Marine in front of Mike went prone in the infield in order to return fire. The experienced Sergeant knew the danger of this move so grabbed him by the back of his tactical vest and hauled him up as he ran past. \"No, don't stop! Keep moving until you find cover.\" The pair moved to a dugout where Mike pointed to one of the buildings across the street and ordered the Private to fire. He looked behind him and saw the rest of the platoon firing and moving into position. \"Harris,\" he yelled, \"set up a base of fire with the GPMG and supports us.\" To the rest he ordered, \"When the machine gun opens up we go. All of us. We need to hit their line and roll them back away from the LZ or the rest of the company is going to get fried.\" \"Ready Gunny,\" Harris reported. \"Rock and roll!\" Mike yelled. The M240B opened fire on the alien position, its heavy staccato overwhelming all other sounds. Tracer rounds flitted through the air as the 7.62mm shells eagerly sought a home to lodge in. The alien fire weakened at the salvo from the medium machine gun and two LMG's that joined the chorus. \"Go! Go! Go!\" Mike screamed, \"All the way to those buildings,\" he pointed to the training centre across the street. \"Look for targets of opportunity. Set them on their heels.\" Popping several grenades from their launchers to soften the area up and firing as they moved, the Marines spread out and sprinted the 200 odd meters down the hill from the park then across the street crashing into where the aliens had been set up to fire upon the landing helicopters. Nerves tense with the anticipation of contact they found the location was empty. The aliens were gone. The Marines fanned out and one fire team swept around the buildings as helicopters took advantage of the lull to begin landing again. They found nothing. \"Looks like the Squids have bugged out,\" Lockett commented. \"That's weird. They had the jump on us and good ground to fight from.\" \"Maybe there was only a few of them and we spooked them,\" LCpl Milne said hopefully. \"I don't know about that,\" Mike injected skeptically. \"Regardless, we'll take the break to get the rest of the company in. Lockett, you take your team and sweep forward and see what you find. Milne, you let the L.T. know what's going on. I'll stay here with the rest and hold this position. We need to get to that bridge. Time's running out and we need to secure Delta's LZ.\" Human Defensive position and Front line of assault, Santa Monika Freeway, LA \"Fire!\" the command squawked over the radios. \"All batteries commence firing!\" Along the one kilometer front dozens of artillery pieces and multi-tube rocket launchers erupted, pounding the alien position. The ground churned as round after round landed in the kill zone. For the allocated fifteen minutes Army and Marine artillery units mercilessly rained deadly explosives down on their objective. From the human defensive position they could feel the ground shake from the impact as they watched thick plumes of black and grey smoke rising in the air from a variety of points of impact. Rounds screamed overhead as the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Armored Division waited edgily to get into combat. More then one trooper wondered if there would be any aliens left to fight once the vicious bombardment ended. They didn't have to wait for long. \"Assault force forward!\" \"Old Ironsides advance!\" The order came from the command centre to move forward so their arrival would coincide with the end of the bombardment. General Daily didn't want to allow the aliens a chance to regroup so the timings were kept purposefully tight. Engines roared to life in Abrams tanks and AFVs. Springing forward they leapt towards the smoking breach in the line. A sudden silence hung thick in the air as just as quickly as it had started the bombardment ceased though secondary explosions could be heard in the distance. Where once alien units had harassed the human defenders now there was only carnage and destruction. The lead elements of the 1st Armor eagerly fanned out looking for enemy targets while the 1st Stryker BCT surged forward not stopping in their mission to reach Terminal Island. Beleaguered Marines and soldiers who'd been holding the line for days cheered wildly as the reinforcements passed them to punish their ruthless opponent. Punctuating the totality of effort A10 Warthogs and Apache gunships flew overhead providing cover while looking for targets of opportunity. On the edges of the front the 101st Airborne began to deploy with their mission to push the front out and back. One kilometer quickly became two then a three kilometer front that also steadily pushed forward consolidating their gains. Once the initial front had been captured though the attackers slowed their pace to ensure a continuity of the front and to not get overly extended. Reconnaissance units pressed street-by-street and block-by-block looking for the enemy and pockets of resistance. The aggressiveness of attack, sheer numbers thrown in and the amount of fire seemed to do the trick. Resistance along the front line was light as the shell-shocked aliens crumbled so progress was rapid and ahead of schedule. Other then several running fights with retreating alien units there was no sign of the enemy. Several squadrons of Wedge Ships had attempted to counter-attack but between flights of F15 fighters and even several F22 Raptors supported by ground fire the outmatched drones were overwhelmed and destroyed in their entirety. At this rate the operation would be over in less then five hours. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Michele tried the best she could to stay calm though she could feel her heart beating rapidly. She attempted to focus on her work, looking at the chart she carried for the seventh time. Again though the distracted woman pulled out her phone and looked at the message with attached picture. I love you , it called out to her. Michele felt her heart flutter as she read and re-read the simple message. She'd received it less then two hours before. With any luck he'd be back before it got dark. She'd already made plans to slip away and greet him when he returned. Hope that the war would be over filled her, thoughts of a future that only days earlier seemed impossible chased away the fear that tried to gnaw away at her. Things are going to be different , she whispered to herself. \"Prep for casualties!\" the head nurse of the division called out, running down the hall. We've got incoming ten minutes out. All stations prep for triage and surgery stat.\" Michele grabbed the woman as she ran past, stopping her in her tracks. \"What's going on? I didn't think we were looking after casualties from the front? That's the field hospitals job.\" \"These aren't from the front,\" the nurse answered, yanking her arm free and beginning to move away. \"These are from the Marine assault force sent to take the bridges. There's no place else to send them so they're ours.\" \"But there wasn't supposed to be that much resistance,\" Michele declared shakily. \"Yea well tell that to the poor sods who got hit going in.\" Michele felt her heart race almost out of control as the breath left her. The hospital became a whirlwind of activity minutes later as the first batch of casualties came in. Michele did her best but couldn't help but be distracted. Every time the door opened and more Marines were brought in for treatment she looked for Mike. Each time she'd have a soaring sense of relief when he wasn't part of the group but then her heart would sink seemingly lower as it was called out more were standing by. She wanted to run out and see but held her position and did her job. No one around her knew the anguish she was suffering, pressing on to help where needed. Then, as suddenly as it happened, it ended and they were finished so could look to the comfort of the casualties they'd treated. In the end, there hadn't been too many and most had light wounds. Michele got her breath back and began to calm down, catching fragments of a conversation two Marines with light wounds were having sitting on a bench in the hallway waiting to be transferred. \"I'm glad I'm out,\" the Marine sitting in an undershirt with a dressing over the wound on his shoulder stated with a sigh of relief. \"Me too. Especially since we were next to the Widow Maker's platoon,\" his friend, a dressing over a laceration on his forehead declared. \"Were we? I don't believe it. How'd they let him on the mission with no platoon leader?\" the first responded in surprise. \"He got one,\" the other stated emphatically. \"Who? Who would be stupid enough to volunteer to serve with the Widow Maker?\" \"Nantz.\" Michele froze in the middle of her writing, the pen stopping in mid word. Suddenly all the noise and bustle of the hospital was gone as she listened to the two Marines. \"Really? I can't believe it. Does the guy have a death wish?\" the one with the shoulder wound said incredulously. \"Beats me but the mission was bad enough without Gordon being there,\" the other said, fidgeting with the dressing on his head. \"Now it's not just stupid, it's suicide. Yea, what's he lost, like six platoon Sergeants?\" \"I heard it was more like ten,\" his friend exaggerated. \"Now he's going to jinx his platoon and the company. Sounds like we're lucky getting out with minor wounds.\" \"Amen to that.\" Michele could feel her heart racing and found it difficult to breath. The conversation had not only stunned her but hit her like a load of bricks. The woman's legs became wobbly as she recounted what the pair had said about where Mike was and who he was serving with. \"No,\" she whispered, \"no, it can't be,\" she implored, willing it not to happen. \"You okay Michele?\" Kelly asked, a look of concern on her face. \"You don't look so good.\" \"I'm…well…no, I'm feeling a bit woozy.\" \"Come on, you need some fresh air.\" The nurse took Michele's arm and led her from the building outside. \"What happened?\" she asked. \"You were fine before. This seems pretty sudden.\" \"Mike...he's…he's in danger,\" Michele gasped in return. \"Well yes, he would be because he's in combat but why is that suddenly so upsetting for you?\" \"More then that…the officer he's serving with…,\" Michele then went on to explain the conversation she'd overheard between the two wounded Marines and the fear that now seemed to be crippling her as the nurse listened compassionately. \"Okay, now I get it, but Michele, you need to be careful listening to that kind of stuff,\" Kelly spoke cautiously. \"There's no such thing as jinxes. You can't let old wives tales like that bug you.\" \"But they've already taken casualties,\" Michele countered, \"we weren't expecting any for hours from that group.\" \"Well yes, that's true. But that's also war, not some curse. Besides, Mike knew what he was doing going in, he's not a foolish or reckless man. Trust his judgment and have faith.\" Michele didn't say anything in reply but mulled the words silently. \"You're right, I was being stupid,\" she answered, nodding her head in agreement. She pulled out her phone that had the picture Mike had sent her earlier that morning on it of the two of them. \"I will have faith. I will trust. Come on, let's get back to work.\" Vincent Thomas Bridge, Terminal Island, LA After the initial alien attack was beaten off the remainder of the company was able to off-load without incident. LCol Ritchie congratulated Mike on his quick thinking as he received the report on what had happened at the beginning of the landing. After the initial danger casualties had been light and were already being sent back with the helicopters that had landed them. Mike wasn't sure about how good their fortune was as things didn't seem to make sense but held his thoughts since they needed to move. With heavy flanking guards the Marines pressed forward to reach the bridge under the command of the company commander. The Vincent Thomas Bridge was a distinct landmark rising majestically from the shore and connecting it to the island so there was no need to use maps. Besides, the leaders of the assaulting force had studied aerial photographs so knew the area around it well. After the initial resistance at the landing zone they'd barely seen an alien so were able to make up for lost time. The lead platoon from E company paused for only a moment to assess the level of defense and alien activity before moving in. Seeing none on their end they moved fast laying on a quick assault capturing the landward end without resistance. With support behind them including LCol Ritchie's headquarters group they didn't stop to consolidate, charging along the 1,500 foot span to the other side. A small group of aliens attempted to hold that end but the swiftness of the Marine attack caught them off guard and they were overwhelmed in a matter of minutes. Immediately they began to fortify the position to hold against any counterattack while signaling success back to the theatre commander. The same thing happened at the other end as no one expected the aliens to just give up the key access point to the island. LCol Ritchie stayed with Lt. Gordon's platoon on the landward side deciding to remain until the Delta Force team moved through. He'd already received a report the Commodore Helm Bridge had been captured so thus far the mission was unfolding as planned. While the aliens had put up more of a fight there, ultimately they had not been able to stand. So far so good. The sound of helicopters beating in from the distance signaled the operation was right on time. Punctuating that thought the HQ radio come to life. \"Black Jack 1-1 this is Joker 2-1, we're inbound to your position,\" the lead helicopter pilot confirmed. \"Roger that,\" LCol Ritchie took the radio and acknowledged himself. \"Be advised there are hostiles in the area 2-1. Look for red smoke in your LZ.\" \"Affirmative. We're four minutes out.\" Ritchie signed off and turned to the gathered Marines. \"Delta's inbound! Give them some cover.\" The sound of helicopters grew until two MH60K Blackhawks came into view. Mike held a position to the right of the bridge watching the surrounding area rather then the Marines who anticipated the operation being completed. Something didn't feel right. He couldn't pinpoint it but he remained unsettled about how things had progressed. They'd been challenged on landing but not at the bridge. The alien forces they'd initially encountered had seemed to melt away. It just didn't make sense. So yelling at the troops in his platoon he tried to keep them focused on their arcs and not the approaching Special Ops helicopters. Someone to the left had popped smoke at the landing zone in a large parking lot north of the ramp onto the bridge nearby as the helicopters flared then began to descend. Then Mike saw it. Movement to his right coming out of the maze of shipping containers housed in the area had been missed by the other platoons in the company. \"Contact,\" he screamed but it was too late to stop several groups of aliens who swiftly moved into the open. \"Joker 2-1 this is Blackjack 3-2, abort, abort.\" It was too late. Six missiles streaked through the air towards the helicopters that tried desperately to pull out of their landing. Three hit each chopper, exploding on impact. Wreckage plummeted to the ground as the area in front of the bridges came alive with alien activity. Several missile launchers unleashed on the Marines as two walking guns came into view. As that happened, the shield overhead seemed to begin to move outwards, farther inland. A Navy F14 tried to streak in to provide support for the forces at the bridge but hit the edge of the alien shield as it continued to press out and burst apart. The Marines regained their faculties quickly so returned fire but their position was tenuous. Reports had already come from the end of the bridge that they too were being engaged as well. It appears as if the aliens had been waiting for them. After conferring with the company commander to ensure the troops were in a good defensive position LCol Ritchie got onto the radio dialing into the area command net to report the unexpected development. \"This is Blackjack 1-1. Be advised Joker is down. I say again, Delta is down. The shield is moving further out and we have no air support. It looks like an ambush. Comms may be compromised, advise, over.\"[Chapter 44] Chapter 44 – Finding courage \"Joker is down,\" LCol Ritchie reported, confirming again the destruction of the Delta Force team over the radio. \"Their primary objective has not been achieved. Shield is still in place, over.\" There was a long pause at the unexpected report sent back to the area headquarters miles away. Ritchie wasn't sure if that was due to the suspicion the radio might be tapped or indecision about what to do. He also knew this would go right up the chain to General Daily. No one was about to make an alternative call now that the perfect plan was going to pot. Despite the continued sniping action coming from a residential area near the entrance to the bridge as well as a forest of shipping containers on the opposite side the senior officer removed his helmet and ran a hand through his crew cut hair. It was pretty clear the squids had known where they were coming in and when. The 'how' was the question. There were obviously no security leaks. The aliens had also not had time to react when they heard the helicopters coming in. So that left only one option. The human's new secure radios were not. Ritchie remembered back to the early stages of the war when the invaders had used the human communications net to triangulate their attacks. If this were the case again it could spell disaster. The Marines tasked with holding the bridges would need to be cautious with how they used their radios again. \"Blackjack 1-1 this is Diamonds Actual,\" the radio crackled signaling the area commander was responding. \"There are no other assets available in theatre to assist with that phase of your mission.\" \"What about scrambling an alternate team?\" Ritchie asked, fearing what he'd hear in return. \"Negative on that. There's no time to put one together to assist based on the timetable. New orders: you'll need to discover and destroy the generator with the resources you have on station and continue to hold the bridges. Do you understand me?\" \"Loud and clear. We're on our own for the time being.\" \"Get it done Marine. We're counting on you,\" the commander declared. \"Understood. Blackjack 1-1 out.\" Ritchie handed the microphone back to the radio operator and massaged his temples. Suddenly he had a splitting headache. The sporadic gunfire melted away within several minutes providing a lull in the action. It seemed as if the aliens knew they had the upper hand. LCol Ritchie waved his hand to call together a hasty O group. \"Here's the situation gentlemen. Delta's down and there's no one else available. Our radios may be compromised by the squids so we'll also have to use them sparingly. No help is coming so we have to take care of this situation ourselves. Therefore we're sending a team in and take that generator out. Any suggestions?\" Despite being stunned by the news, showing the resilience of the Marines at the bridge, a response came from the shocked leaders within a minute. \"The team needs to be small enough to slip in but strong enough to fight without support,\" Captain Harvel, the company commander declared, stating the obvious but also showing he bought into the plan. \"They know we're here and they seem content to keep us pinned down. So whoever goes will need to be able to fight their way through the cordon then disappear. That'll be tough because if the squids have half a brain they'll know what we're going after.\" \"A reasonable scenario. We can work up some options to give them some cover. But first off, who goes?\" Ritchie asked. Mike cleared his throat. \"No way Nantz. After the crap we had to go through just to get you here?\" the battalion commander growled. \"I'm the only one who's done it before. I can get the job done,\" Mike stated with a confidence he didn't feel at the moment but knew it to be true. Ritchie looked at the Gunnery Sergeant hard then over to Captain Harvel who merely shrugged his shoulders. All knew their options were limited. \"Okay Nantz, you're in. But if you get yourself killed you're in a load of crap with me.\" Mike chuckled. \"Understood sir.\" \"Just like last year at the Golden State Freeway ramp, huh?\" the company commander commented, reminding Mike of when they had first come in to take LA. Mike also remembered he'd been wounded there which wasn't a happy reminder considering what he'd just proposed to do. \"Who do you want to take?\" Captain Harvel asked. \"Eight man team like Delta was going in with,\" Mike answered. \"I'd take Imlay, Lockett, Ortega and Rapetti along with Harris and Jackson with a 240.\" \"That's only seven,\" Ritchie pointed out. \"I wasn't quite done yet,\" Mike stated looking over to a group of gathered NCO's who watched the conference with interest. \"I'd also like to take Santos.\" \"Air Force? What the hell for?\" Ritchie retorted. \"Because she's been in the thick of it before and proven herself. Plus, when we take this thing down I suspect we'll find ourselves in a hornet's nest so I'd like someone who knows how to get us some help.\" \"Okay,\" Ritchie replied, sounding unconvinced. \"Your call. Captain, what's your assessment.\" \"Looks like a solid team sir,\" Harvel commented. \"What about you Lt. Gordon? He's stripping away most of your experienced squad leaders. You okay with that?\" \"We don't have a lot of choices in this. Those are the one's I'd pick sir,\" Gordon answered honestly. \"Yes, it'll be a bit of a strain but the rest of the platoon can pick up the slack.\" \"So how do you want to play this Gunny?\" Harvel asked. Mike grabbed a pair of binoculars and began to survey the area. He took nearly ten minutes looking at several options despite the obvious agitation from the others around him for an immediate solution. They'd only get one shot and it had to be done right. Finally, his experienced eyes spotted what he sought. A thin smile came to his face. \"I got it. We can't move to the other end of the bridge or we'll be spotted so we need to do a crossing on the channel.\" \"You'll still be seen,\" the Captain surmised. \"Not if you create a diversion,\" Mike replied to the skeptical officer. \"Lay down a base of fire from this end of the bridge with the mortars and feign a breakout attempt from the other side. You drop some smoke along with HE and that should keep their heads down plus give us a screen. We then hook around to here,\" he pointed to a large white-roofed building to their right which housed the World Cruise Center. There should be some sort of tender or boat there we can grab then we pop across to the shipping off-load center there,\" he pointed to a series of idle cranes, \"and lose ourselves in the containers just behind on the island. You open up in say thirty minutes to create our diversion and give us another thirty to work with. I'll move my team and go from there.\" Harvel nodded his head in approval. \"Outstanding. Solid tactics. It might just work. All right Gunny, prep your group to move out.\" Then he turned to his radio operator, \"Get me 2nd Platoon at the other side of the bridge. I want to talk to them.\" \"Sir, didn't you say our comms might be compromised? Won't the squids figure out we're up to something if we use the radio,\" the Sergeant asked nervously. \"That's exactly what I'm counting on. I want them looking at that end of the bridge,\" the Captain responded cagily. Mike had indeed picked well since each member of the team chosen willingly agreed to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Very little needed to be done as it was going to be a quick assault so after an inventory check they were ready to go. With an area only a little over four square miles he didn't expect it would take them too long to find the generator. Whether they'd be able to destroy it or not was another story. Private Rapetti was detailed to bring along two satchels of TNT plus they would bring several disposable rocket launchers and claymore mines with them as well. The key though would be to move fast and hit hard before the squids could respond. Mike and his team were ready to go in twenty minutes. Ten minutes later the three M224 60mm mortars in the company fired pop pop pop in rapid succession followed by the deep bass whump of the 81mm mortar that had been added to bolster their firepower. The rounds screamed over the bridge and impacted in likely areas of alien concentration opposite the Marine forward defensive position. Each tube fired three rounds in rapid succession then the 60's dropped several rounds of smoke into the target area. At the island end of the bridge the reinforced platoon began to move cautiously forward behind the mortar screen supported by an M240 GPMG. The activity seemed to work as it was obvious to LCol Ritchie and Capt. Harvel observing from the other end that the aliens were responding by shifting infantry caste units to bolster the blocking force at the bridge. With two squads covering them from the land side of the bridge Mike and his team moved away from their position and into a residential area. Then sprinting across a road that led to the bridge they moved into the large parking lot for the cruise ship line. There were numerous abandoned vehicles so they were able to dodge about and stay in cover making it to the building without attracting any attention. Now came the moment of truth. Mike had been praying there'd be a suitable boat available or they'd be trudging back to the bridge prematurely. Rounding a corner of the building they found tied to the dock what looked like a harbor master's launch. The small tender had an enclosed cabin and would fit the whole team comfortably. \"Ortega, fire this thing up and prep to go,\" Mike ordered the Private who he knew had a family background as a fisherman. \"The rest of you cast off the lines.\" The sound of the Marine mortars steadily firing, supported by their machine guns and being responded to by alien counter-fire meant Mike had to yell to be heard by the members of his team. A growing fog from explosions and smoke canisters began to shroud the view of the channel separating the island from the mainland. It was exactly what Mike had hoped for. So under the cover of a firefight going on above them, the team slipped across the channel and landed unobserved on the other side. Using ropes and grapnel hooks they climbed up the steep sea wall then made their way in open order after securing the boat and hiding their ropes. They were across now making their way towards the heart of Terminal Island. LCol Ritchie and Captain Harvel observed the crossing only because they knew where to look, catching glimpses of them through the fog. Satisfied the team seeking the generator was away they called their troops at the other end of the bridge back and ordered the mortars to cease fire. Unfortunately they'd stirred the hornet's nest so the aliens pressed them not only from the island side but a new group at least company size engaged them on the land side of the bridge coming out of the area containing storage containers that they'd used to hide before shooting down the Delta Force helicopters. With the company's ranks depleted LCol Ritchie and his headquarters team were pressed into action, bolstering the forces trying to hold the end of the bridge. Though pinned down the Marines had a good defensive position so the alien attackers were not able to get close enough to be a significant threat. Yet the defending officers knew that if the aliens continued to press the Marines would have to dig in to hold until relief arrived. Six hours couldn't come fast enough. As things started to get touchy for the bridge defenders the intensity of firefight again slowed down to random grenade and machine gun attacks, probing the line for weakness. They were being given a breather as the aliens seemed to pull back to reorganize their attack. \"Sir!\" the company radio operator called out to Captain Harvel, \"I'm picking up a SART hit on the rescue net.\" \"Who's it from?\" Harvel asked, ducking his way over to where his company HQ had been set up. \"Check's out from the F14 that got hit by the shield earlier. The transponder appears to be from the Radar Intercept Officer sir. Seems he's about four klicks out.\" \"Okay, call it into the Tac headquarters and have them send a SAR team to get him out.\" \"Roger that.\" The radio operator changed frequencies and put in the request. The conversation took longer then expected until finally the Signals Corporal returned with a frustrated look on his face. \"No go on a rescue bird sir. Command says it's too hot plus they have nothing available. Things are apparently heating up at the front.\" \"Okay. Switch back to monitoring the battalion net,\" Harvel ordered, shifting his focus back to the disposition of his troops. \"What's going on?\" LCol Ritchie demanded, injecting into the conversation. \"I heard we got a rescue signal from a downed pilot.\" \"Yes sir, we did. But HQ isn't able to send a rescue bird,\" the company commander answered. \"How far out?\" Ritchie asked. \"Just over four klicks.\" \"All right then, we're going to go get him.\" \"What sir? You can't be serious,\" Harvel responded in surprise. \"That area's crawling with aliens. We can't take the risk.\" \"And I won't leave any man behind enemy lines for the squids.\" \"I know that Captain,\" Ritchie shot back, glaring at the officer. \"Regardless, I'm not going to leave that man alone. I want a team to go out and get him.\" \"Any suggestions?\" Harvel asked coldly. \"As a matter of fact I do,\" Ritchie held his ground, not flinching as an alien grenade impacted several meters away. \"Gordon's platoon has had its command structure gutted. Send him and a team to get the man. Roll the rest of them into Flannigan's platoon. We've got a lull in the action. They can be there and back in an hour. Get it done and get it done quickly.\" The battalion commander looked at his uncertain subordinate and could see the uncertainly. Pulling him in closer he said in a low voice. \"We need the morale boost Bill. With part of the company already gone, Delta down, Nantz's team away, things are going into the crapper here and the troops are on a razor's edge. We need to show we can strike back and do this.\" Captain Harvel got the point immediately and his face reddened in embarrassment for not figuring that out himself. \"I understand sir. Sorry I doubted, I…\" Ritchie cut him off. \"No time for that son. Let's get the initiative back.\" Harvel nodded his head with vigor. \"Yes sir. Gordon!\" he called out. \"On me.\" Lt. Gordon moved over and received the orders. He didn't share his feelings on the matter instead taking in the orders and all the information he could get. \"Put your team together and get moving right away,\" Captain Harvel stated, signaling the time for action. \"Anything else you need?\" \"Just a Corpsman in case the pilot is injured,\" Gordon answered. \"Adukwu, grab your bag, you're coming with us.\" Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Father Alexander slumped into the chair in his small office just off from the chapel and massaged his temples with his hands. Fatigue hung heavy on him, like a blanket. The chapel was quiet; no one had been around lately since most in the headquarters area were occupied with the current attempt to break the stalemate. That suited him fine since it allowed him to be out almost constantly the past two days searching for clues to the whereabouts of Hector. All his efforts had proven unfruitful. The priest found people cooperative but despite his best efforts none could help him. Bitter disappointment welled up like bile while fear for the innocent boy grew. \"What are you doing God?\" he called out in frustration. He looked at the crucifix on the wall opposite his desk silently staring at him and he felt like a failure. There was a quiet knock at the door. Startled from his pained musings Father Alexander got up to see who had come to see him. He was surprised to find a well dressed young Latino man standing before him. Though the priest had little interest in clothes he could tell expensive ones when he saw them. The man in his twenties had slicked-back black hair and wore an expensive gold watch and chain. The faint odor of cologne filled the air. Yet despite the picture of prosperity there was something unusual about the confident looking man. His eyes seemed dull and lifeless, looking closer the priest could also detect some redness and puffiness, like he'd been crying. \"How can I help you?\" Father Alexander asked curiously. \"I'd like to make my confession Father,\" the man declared. \"I'm a military chaplain son. But I could introduce you to a priest not far from here if you'd like.\" \"No, I'd like it to be you I confess my sins to,\" the man replied, becoming increasingly nervous. \"And…I've heard you've been asking around about a boy who's been missing. I think I can help you with that.\" \"Who are you?\" Father Alexander asked suspiciously. \"My name is Raul Santos. I've…I've been dealing drugs and doing other bad stuff. I've been profiting from the war.\" \"So why are you here?\" \"I'm not a bad person…or I wasn't once upon a time. I made some bad choices…hung out with some bad people…I was weak and gave into temptation. I want to make things right with God. I want to go on a different path. Maybe helping you to find the boy might be a step in the right direction,\" Raul declared. \"Why the change in attitude?\" Father Alexander asked, uncertain about the sincerity of what he was hearing. Raul began to weep. He opened his mouth to speak but nothing could come out in his anguish. Father Alexander waited for the tormented man to calm down, praying silently for wisdom. Finally Raul took a deep breath, shuddered, then seemed to regain control. \"I have a cousin, in the Air Force. I found out she volunteered to go back to the front, into a combat situation, even though she'd been injured before and didn't have to,\" he explained. \"I've worked hard to be a man people fear and yet I see I'm a coward compared to her.\" \"Okay.\" \"But then…but then….in the last day I found out my best friend was killed at the front. We joined the Marines together right out of high school. He stuck with it but I quit during Basic. I didn't want anyone telling me what to do. I came back to LA and started….well, you know,\" the young man confessed. \"We were tight though…bros. He kept trying to get me to fly right. And he died on the line defending people like me. Then last night my grandmother died. She just couldn't take anymore heartbreak. She'd always believed in me, believed that I could be more but I wasn't,\" he hung his head and tears splashed on the tile floor. \"I have all this stuff and I have NOTHING,\" he screamed. \"Everyone who has ever believed in me is gone.\" \"God still believes in you,\" the Priest whispered. \"That's why I'm here,\" the anguished man replied. \"I want to change, make something positive of my life.\" \"Tell me how I can find Hector,\" Father Alexander got to the point. \"Have you ever heard of the Foundry?\" Raul asked, gaining control of his emotions. The priest had indeed heard the name. As little as he'd found out about Hector, the more he kept hearing about a place called 'The Foundry' that was outside the protection zone, a place people whispered about with awe and fright, a place where people who wanted to follow their own rules went. \"Yes, I have,\" he answered quietly. \"That's where he's been taken,\" the man trying to make things right with God stated. \"How do you know all this?\" Father Alexander asked, curiosity growing. \"Maria Rincon worked for me sometimes. She had the boy, Hector's his name right? She had him run courier for me, do some drops, stuff like that. I know she paid off some punk named Javier a few days to help her with something and has disappeared. That's the only place people can go around here and do that. He has to be there.\" \"And you can show me where this place is?\" \"Yes.\" Father Alexander closed his eyes and pondered the information. He knew in his heart this was where Hector had been taken. \"Thank you Raul, this is very helpful.\" \"Then you'll hear my confession?\" Raul asked eagerly. \"Yes, I will. But first, there's some things you need to do to get right with God. You need to turn from your life of crime.\" \"I don't want to do that anymore,\" the young man affirmed, resolution in his voice. \"And you need to turn yourself into the police,\" the priest stated bluntly. \"What? Are you crazy?\" Raul jumped from his chair aggressively, eyes wild. \"I don't want to go to prison.\" \"It's the right thing to do,\" Father Alexander countered. \"You know you have to do that. You need to come clean and be honest. Only then will you honor your friend and your grandmother. And I'll speak for you and stand with you.\" \"You'd stay with me?\" the troubled man asked in surprise. \"All the way,\" Father Alexander answered confidently. The young man blinked several times then wiped a tear from his eye. \"Okay. I'll do it,\" he said firmly. Placing his hand tenderly on Raul's shoulder the priest felt his heart gripped at the courage of the young man. Optimism returned. \"Kneel down and confess to God.\" \"Father forgive me for I have sinned….,\" Raul began. Despite the tears now streaming down his face he seemed to be at peace.[Chapter 45] Chapter 45 A little more then six hours Despite the offensive going on things were still humming at the headquarters of the 185th MP Battalion with the details of maintaining order in the rear area continuing unchecked. There was military and civilian traffic to organize, crimes to investigate and civil affairs to work out with the remnants of the LAPD who had been rolled into this unit. Though under martial law the refugee city and rear area were being patrolled by civilian police as much as possible in an attempt to suggest some form of normalcy. But after the efforts by Senator Gary Sharpe to force civil government on the military district collapsed at his death during his premature attempts to establish peace with their vicious assailant things had gone back to the status quo. Father Alexander arrived at the two-story building which used to house an accounting firm with an increasingly nervous Raul Santos. After being forced to wait while others ahead of him were allowed to make inquiry he requested the chance to speak with an MP Officer he'd worked with on several occasions in the last four months. The Sergeant manning the front desk put in call to Lt. Gwen Langois. Langois was a female Cajun from Louisiana originally. Though small in stature the intensity of her look and passionate conviction intimidated many much larger then her. She was no-nonsense but also a cop the priest knew could be counted on. \"Father Alexander,\" Langois said in her thick Cajun drawl as she invited the pair to come into her cubicle. She was all professional from her blonde hair back in a tight bun to her crisp uniform. \"Good to see you again. I'm sorry ah can't give ye any more information on the missing boy.\" Then she noticed Raul standing behind him and instantly her easy manner was gone, replaced by a cool demeanor. \"And what do we have here?\" \"This is Raul, Lt. Langois,\" the priest answered. \"He can help us find Hector I believe.\" \"Oh can he now?\" she drawled with a hint of sarcasm in her voice. The MP stood up and came from behind her desk drilling the Latino with an unblinking gaze which caused the confident man to shrink back under the glare of her piercing blue eyes. \"And just what do ye know about this, boy?\" she demanded. Raul gulped. \"I believe he's been taken to a place called the Foundry. Have you heard of it?\" \"Oh, ah've heard of it all right. The question is: how do you know about it?\" \"Well…I…\" \"What did you say your last name was again?\" Langois asked. \"Santos. Raul Santos.\" \"Hmm.\" The MP returned to her desk but didn't sit down. With one hand she tapped lightly on her laptop, the other hand rested on the butt of her M9 9mm pistol. \"Mr. Santos, ah want to thank you for your information but ah'm afraid ah'll have to ask you to put your hands on your head.\" \"Lieutenant, please,\" Father Alexander implored. \"I know of his criminal activities. He wants to turn from them and is willing to co-operate fully with you. But he can also help us find Hector. Please, just wait until that is done.\" The MP rubbed the small gold crucifix that hung around her neck as she pondered the situation and the request that had been made. \"Can you direct us to where this Foundry is?\" she asked quietly, watching his eyes closely. \"Can you also provide us with information on who took him and what we might find when we get there?\" \"Yes, I can and I will. I will help any way I can,\" Raul declared, matching her gaze. Langois thought again. \"Okay. I'll release you to Father Alexander but when this is done we're going to have a talk, be sure of it.\" \"I understand,\" Raul responded forlornly. \"That won't be necessary,\" Father Alexander interjected, \"he'll be coming with us.\" \"He's what?\" \"I'm what?\" the two responded simultaneously. \"He knows the place and he knows the people. I think we need him,\" the priest reasoned. \"This is a bad idea Father,\" Langois countered, her eyes bulging angrily. \"She's right, listen to her,\" Raul added, clearly uncomfortable with the proposal. \"Shut up you!\" Langois hissed. \"Ah don't want your input. This man is a criminal and not to be trusted. He could turn on us out there. The place is no-man's land. He has to stay here.\" \"I've heard his confession and I trust him,\" Father Alexander countered. \"Gwen please, trust me.\" Oh, mon dieu,\" Langois responded in frustration, making the sign of the cross. \"You know ah can't resist a priest. Very well. He can come.\" Then to Raul she fixed him with a steely glare. \"Understand this boy, I will be watching you with both eyes and know this: ah always carry a back-up piece.\" Axis of Advance, Florence, Los Angeles In hindsight they should have seen it coming. The initial assault of the 1 Stryker BCT from the 1st Armored Division had gone much better then expected. Rather then move cautiously they pressed forward rapidly and ahead of schedule believing alien resistance to have totally collapsed. They were wrong. Several miles from the front and with an extended line the advancing tanks and AFV's got hit. First they found that at least five blocks worth of the Harbor Freeway had been destroyed forcing the main body onto side streets. Then they had been attacked in densely packed residential neighborhoods but had been able to push through with light casualties. But passing Slauson Avenue the lead squadrons got into an industrial area that the aliens had set up with numerous guns forcing the Armored Brigade to narrow their front back into the confines of another residential neighborhood. Once they passed into this zone the aliens not only stiffened but began to push back unleashing a fierce counter-attack. It seemed as if some message had been sent to all the alien units because virtually at the same time they began to fight back in earnest. Whether this had been a prepared strategy or something they came up with on the fly didn't matter. A number of Walking Guns and hovercrafts mounting deadly Multi-Purpose Weapons supported by fresh battalions of infantry caste aliens hit both sides of the advancing humans simultaneously in a vicious pincer move. At the same time several squadrons of Wedge Ships roared into the theatre to neutralize and tie-up the human air cover. The advance ground to a halt. 1st Stryker was forced to do a fighting withdrawal back beyond Slauson and had to move back a half mile to East 55th Street in order to be in a position where they could fight back effectively. Every block they were opposed and casualties began to mount but they had little choice in the matter. Advance at this point was impossible until the bulk of the assaulting force caught up. If they'd continued they risked having the head of the assault cut off. So forced to stop, they fought back against the alien counter-attack setting up a hasty command post at the South LA Wetland Park. Unfortunately, the rest of 1st Armored and the 101st Airborne were in not much better shape. Alien troops, vehicles and air support materialized countering the offensive along a broad front. Advanced human elements found themselves cut off so desperate calls for support began to light up the airwaves of their tactical radios. Even worse, reports coming into headquarters from satellites and AWAC surveillance aircraft seemed to indicate that the alien's shield appeared to be moving out from Terminal Island and towards them. Hasty requests were sent to confirm this unsettling detail. The commander of the 1st Armored Task Force received reports from all his elements and began to formulate a response. Of particular concern to the seasoned combat leader was the predicament of 1st Stryker. The whole operation hinged on them being mobile, striking deep and linking up with the Marines at Terminal Island. Having to dig in and hold a position would not win the day. \"We need some help here,\" Brigadier General Cooper from 1st Armored reported over the net, knowing they couldn't do it alone. \"We're engaged along our axis of advance and 1st Stryker is fouled ahead of us.\" \"You boys hang tight,\" Major General McConville from the 101st responded. \"We'll bring some air support to you and also I can push my reserve brigade to your lead elements to help unplug the cork. Can you hold your position and provide flanking cover so they can get there?\" Cooper looked at his support staff who nodded in agreement. \"Yea, we can do that. Our other elements can hold so you can bolster 1st Stryker.\" \"Good, you hang tough Pete,\" McConville encouraged the beleaguered officer. \"We'll be there as soon as we can.\" \"I'd appreciate that Jim. We've lost the momentum and I'm afraid we've also lost the timetable for this operation. I don't want to leave those guys at the bridge unsupported,\" Cooper commented. \"Well, one step at a time. We need to make sure this whole offensive doesn't fall apart and we get rolled back,\" McConville replied. Back at the theatre headquarters General Daily monitored the conversations taking place with a concerned look on his face. He didn't add any comment since he wanted to allow the commanders on the ground the liberty to run things as they saw fit. He trusted them both and trusted their judgment. They were closer to the action and needed to make the ultimate call. Still, that didn't mean he had to sit back and do nothing. \"I want us to re-establish air superiority,\" the Marine General called out to the Air Force Colonel who acted as a liaison. \"I want additional fighter intercept squadrons up and flying cover. Push those damn Wedge Ships back so we can support the ground troops. Also, see if there are any bombers available to hit the squids new position before 101st gets to 1st Stryker.\" The Air Force officer turned to his laptop and began to tap out a series of orders avoiding eye contact with the theatre commander. Everyone in the operations room could feel the tension grow and the hoped-for victory slipping from their grasp. \"What do we have to provide support on the ground if things go south?\" Daily asked his G-3, Brigadier General Grayback, quietly. \"Not much sir,\" the General replied with a thinly veiled smirk that said 'I told you so'. \"We can pull together a few battalions of infantry and likely four squadrons of armor. The rest are committed to the original defensive line and maintaining it…if needed of course.\" \"All right. Keep monitoring. I want assessments and asset status reports every fifteen minutes. Got it?\" Daily declared, trying not to sound exasperated. \"Yes sir,\" General Grayback fixed a glare at Captain Blatchford who hung around the periphery of the command group with a frustrated look on her face and added, \"I guess its going to take a bit more then six hours for this mission.\" San Pedro neighborhood, near Terminal Island \"Hey L.T., is the shield moving?\" a Marine Lance Corporal asked Lt. Gordon as they moved along West 13th Street. \"Because it looks like it's following us.\" Gordon looked up from the first time, almost afraid to take his eyes off the arc he'd been sweeping. His team that had been sent out to rescue the downed F14 RIO had not been harassed as they'd anticipated when they left their defensive position at the land side of the Vincent Thomas Bridge. They knew there were aliens in the area, and between them, since they'd been attacked several times from this area earlier yet now things were quiet. Looking up the platoon leader confirmed what he'd just been told-the shield was indeed moving. \"You're right Baker,\" he replied, \"it is moving. That's weird.\" \"Should we call it in?\" \"No, we need to stay off the radios. The Captain and the Colonel will be able to see it too and they can decide what to do. We need to stay focused on our mission,\" Gordon commented grimly. He knew how exposed they were so didn't want any other complications. Moving in a spread formation the small rescue team tried to move in quick bounds and lose themselves in the residential neighborhood around them. They weren't looking for a fight but to move fast, get the downed pilot and get back as fast as they could. Watching their flanks the two squads that made up the team followed the transponder signal their radio operator had a fix on until they spotted a thin plume of grey smoke rising in the air from the backyard of an attractive home. \"Sir, we found the bird,\" a Marine who'd been on point jogged back to report. The rescue team moved cautiously to the crash site. Gordon ordered one squad to patrol the perimeter while the other pressed forward to the wreckage in search of the downed flyer whose signal they'd picked up. The wreck of the F14 Tomcat had cut an ugly scar into the ground. Where once an attractive garden had been someone's pride and joy now it was turned up into raw topsoil. Rose pedals from a destroyed prized rose bush were strewn about as if blown up. The nose of the war bird was crumpled and one of the wings bent, likely from the impact of the shield. The canopy was missing and a pilot sat slumped forward in his harness in the pilot's seat. \"Defensive formation, I want a twenty-five meter perimeter around this yard,\" Lt. Gordon ordered his troops. \"LMGs cover the approaches. Look sharp everyone. Doc, check out the pilot.\" As the Marines fanned out and moved quickly into position the stillness around them became unnerving. Doc Adukwu trotted over and climbed up to the cockpit. Before he checked the vital signs of the pilot whose nickname painted on the side of the plane was 'Grunge' he knew he was dead. The Corpsman made certain then hopped down to report to the platoon leader. \"The pilot is dead sir,\" he reported in his thick African accent. \"His emergency transponder does not seem to be active. The back seat is missing though.\" Gordon raised his hand and snapped his finger twice. The platoon radio operator trotted over. \"See if you can get a tighter location on the SART signal. This isn't it.\" The Corporal fiddled with his equipment for a moment. \"I got a fix on an active transponder. Five hundred meters out, at thirty degrees.\" \"Saddle up,\" the platoon commander ordered calling the other squad in. \"Diamond formation but keep it loose. It's too quiet.\" Continuing to move tensely in residential area they passed through a recreational complex that caused the Marines to twitch. Though everything continued to be quiet they felt as if they were being watched, like a cat observing a mouse. Those in the lead involuntarily picked up the pace in order to get to the location of the transponder signal. Moving from the place marked Daniels Field they passed through another neighborhood then towards a school with the sign Dana Middle School emblazoned on it. \"Thirty meters sir,\" the radio operator almost whispered. \"It should be at the back of the school.\" Moving forward in pairs, weapons scanning all directions, the team moved to the side playground of the school. It was all black asphalt and laid out as basketball courts. Off to the side of the center court they saw a brightly colored parachute on the ground, partially covering an airplane ejection seat. \"Doc, check it out,\" Gordon ordered. \"Collins, Sanchez, go with him. Everyone else spread out and watch the corners. This place stinks.\" Taking a deep breath, Doc trotted over to the seat whose bottom was facing him. Not knowing what he'd find the Corpsman approached cautiously while the two Privates with him kept their weapons trained on the seat. Peering around he saw a Navy officer slumped forward in his seat. He could see the transponder blinking an active signal. The flyer seemed dead but he needed to check it out. Feeling for a pulse Doc almost had a heart attack when the RIO gasped loudly and sat suddenly back in his seat. In surprise Sanchez almost shot the man instinctively. \"Who are you?\" the RIO croaked. \"Friends, Marines,\" Doc replied, checking his pulse. \"I'm a Corpsman. What's your name?\" \"Lewis, Michael Lewis,\" the flyer answered. Doc could see from his uniform he was an Ensign and looked young for how old he should be. \"Are you hurt?\" \"I don't know,\" Lewis answered. My back hurts and my legs are numb. I'm not sure if I can move them.\" Lt. Gordon had come over, seeing the movement at the seat to investigate. \"What do we have Doc?\" \"He's alive sir but I'm not sure what shape he's in. I was about to get him out of his harness.\" Checking for obstructions, Doc Adukwu then carefully released the RIO from his restraining harness. Lewis fell forward and into the Corpsman's strong arms with a yelp of sharp pain. \"I can't move my legs,\" the Navy flier reported through gritted teeth. Gordon looked up into the sunny sky and cursed to himself. \"Austen, LaGuardia, bring the stretcher. We'll need to carry him out.\" The radio operator came over. \"Should we let the Captain know?\" \"Negative. Let's get him buttoned up ASAP and move out fast. If the squids are reading our comms again I don't want them to get a fix on our position. Though something tells me they already know we're here.\" As if prophetically, a Marine from the left called out: \"Contact, nine o'clock.\" Somewhere on Terminal Island So far Mike and his team had been lucky. Maybe it was skill or maybe someone was watching over them but regardless, the group seeking the alien shield generator had moved undetected from the channel inland onto Terminal Island. Right now the eight man team was hunkered down in a small fish processing facility waiting for a dozen infantry caste aliens to move past. This was the third such party they'd spotted in the last fifteen minutes. Each had appeared to be on a set patrol route. This was a good sign since it seemed to indicate they were unaware of how close the Marines actually were. Terminal Island was in the shape of an inverted boot with a long causeway at the center leading to another spur at the bottom of the island. Mike prayed the generator wasn't down there. They'd thought they hit pay dirt early on when they spotted a heavily defended area but seeing the large bulbous Water Extractors he knew they were mining water from the island's water reclamation facility. The number engaged though seemed to show a certain sense of urgency by the alien invaders. They'd moved across Terminal Way and now had hidden themselves among some low-rise buildings watching the alien patrol moving along Cannery Street. The report that alien ground forces in the area were light had turned out to be incorrect. So far they'd seen indications of at least a battalions worth of infantry caste aliens along with several companies of intelligence caste and a large number that appeared to be engineers. From the activity going on it seemed as if they were preparing to receive a large number of ships. Already they'd seen numerous spacecraft docked along some of the inland waterways. This gave a grim reminder to the Marines watching that the clock was ticking and in a matter of days another large armada was expected. Failure or withdrawal was not an option. \"So what now Gunny?\" Lockett asked quietly. Mike looked around to see if he could get a fix on where the shield that was evident above them originated but there didn't seem to be any center point or central core. A chilling thought occurred to him: what if it wasn't simply 'one generator' but a series that brought the shield to life? He wondered if anyone had even considered that possibility. Likely not, he thought. \"Deeper into the island,\" Mike answered, \"towards the causeway.\"[Chapter 46] Chapter 46 Retreat Hell! Somewhere on Terminal Island, LA The patrol made up of alien infantry caste fighters suddenly stopped and scanned the area, the sound of their weapons heating up rising above the excited chirps and whirring sounds they made. The aliens seemed to sense some presence nearby but couldn't seem to find anything. After several minutes of shuffling back and forth an officer caste alien came up to the group and seemed to upbraid them so the group reformed and continued shuffling down the road. Mike and the rest of the Marines breathed a deep sigh of relief and eased their fingers off the triggers of their weapons. Coming out of their hiding spot on the side of the road on the island they continued to move gliding from shadow to shadow in the mid-day sun. The small team pushed deeper into Terminal Island in search of the alien shield generator meaning their places to hide were becoming scarcer. So far the Marines had not been discovered but each knew it was only a matter of time. Several hours had gone by and despite their efforts to cover the peninsula still they'd found nothing that seemed like a generator. After the sobering discovery at the main water treatment plant they'd moved west sweeping that part of the multi-pronged island still coming up with nothing. Mike could feel sweat running down his back not only from the exertion but the mounting pressure of the operation. He knew the defenders of LA's ability to stop the coming alien horde hinged on their success. They'd not found anything and he began to feel they'd be forced to go into the extreme south end which was certain to give them away. Hiding in a forest of shipping containers to the west of the main causeway they were given a good view of the narrow strip leading south towards the ocean in addition to the area around them. So with cover the team stopped to scan the area they could see looking for any clues. All around the chirping and warbling sounds of aliens going about their business could be heard causing the Marines a new level of anxiety. \"Gunny this place crawls,\" Imlay whispered urgently. \"Yea, so much for light resistance,\" Lockett added. \"Now you wouldn't want it to be easy would you? There'd be no challenge to it,\" Mike deadpanned, trying to ease the tension they all felt. Despite the gravity and risk of the situation he felt alive again, like he hadn't in months. Finally he was back in his element, with people he trusted, doing what he did best. \"Santos, anything?\" he asked the Air Force Tech Sergeant scanning the area with a set of binoculars. She paused they fiddled with a small device she carried, toggling a few switches, finally twisting one savagely in frustration. \"Nada. Nothing,\" she spat out. \"I'm getting no energy readings, radiation, nothing. If this thing's here is should give off some sort of reading.\" \"Maybe the power source is shielded too,\" Cpl. Harris speculated, coming to join the group. \"I mean we spanked them the last time when we hit their C-and-C station. Maybe they learned and are masking it.\" That thought didn't encourage Mike. If this were the case they'd need to literally walk up to it in order to discover it. \"All right. We need to look for anything irregular, out of place. We're not likely going to be able to find it without boots on the ground. So scan the area then prep to move.\" \"Do you see that?\" Lockett asked in a low voice, pointing to the causeway that he'd been watching. \"Yea, I do,\" Mike answered, several grim realities hitting him simultaneously like a flash data dump. \"What is it?\" the African American NCO asked in confusion. \"Looks like some sort of docking facility,\" Harris answered. On the long, narrow causeway dozens of aliens could be seen busily working along the ribbon connecting the main part of the island to the smaller outer area. As far as the eye could see what looked like cranes and recovery equipment were clearly being set up at regular intervals along both sides of the causeway pointing out to the water on either side. \"Why do they need something like that if they can just come out of the water?\" Imlay asked. \"It doesn't seem necessary.\" \"It's not unless you got a lot more to offload,\" Mike responded, feeling a sudden chill. \"They're building a harbor here for a lot of squids.\" \"Damn…\" Lockett breathed, the realization of what they were seeing hitting him like a hammer. \"That means…,\" \"We need to get hustling,\" Mike answered. \"And the causeway is closed to us.\" \"So how are we going to get to the other part of the island?\" Imlay asked in growing frustration. \"We're going to have to swim,\" Mike responded grimly. San Pedro neighborhood, near Terminal Island \"Contact!\" Almost before the words of warning left the Marine on perimeter security's mouth alien machine gun fire opened up. The leathernecks in the rescue party scrambled for cover as rounds skipped off the pavement in the school playground while tracer fire flitted through the air. \"Move, move, move!\" Lt. Gordon ordered. \"Rolling withdrawal all the way back to the bridge. Collins, Sanchez, cover the stretcher.\" Privates LaGuardia and Austen picked up the injured RIO strapped into the stretcher and began to trot as fast as they could along the corridor of protection the other Marines provided. Doc ran along side shielding the vulnerable flyer with his body as best he could. Aliens seemed to pop in and out of cover along the path as the rescue team continued to press on. Gordon kept the men moving and tight. Despite them being outnumbered and outgunned his keen tactical sense kept them steadily moving towards safety. Their LMG gunner maintained a steady rate of fire sweeping back and forth to clear the way while the other Marines engaged targets of opportunity all the while moving as fast as the stretcher bearers could move. Ensign Lewis grimaced in pain as he was jarred up and down in the stretcher but remained silent, his eyes wide in fear as he experienced combat at this level for the first time in his life. The upper spans of the Vincent Thomas Bridge could be seen above the trees to their front and they began to believe they'd actually make it. Moving though from one side street to a more major thoroughfare, the rescue team ran into an alien Walking Gun waiting for them. Thump Thump Thump A salvo of deadly grenades flew through the air landing around their position. \"Cover! Find cover,\" Lt. Gordon screamed. The tight formation of Marines was broken up as they scattered looking for cover. A chain of explosions tore up dirt, pavement and ignited several abandoned cars along the road. While none of the Marines received more then a minor shrapnel wound thanks to the quick response of the platoon commander their progress was halted. Smoke from several exploded cars was carried on the stiff ocean breeze beginning to obscure vision or perhaps it was mingled with a smoke grenade. None took the time to figure it out in the scramble to get away from the deadly alien heavy weapon. Collins and Sanchez whirled about firing bursts in all directions, not certain where the increasing alien fire was coming from. Austen and LaGuardia began to move again with the stretcher as quickly as they could while Doc shielded the wounded RIO's body with his. \"They're all around us,\" Collins yelled in panic. \"Keep moving,\" Doc countered, \"don't stop. We have to get back with the rest.\" A grenade whizzed overhead and exploded on the opposite side of the street, turning a small tree into splinters. Collins panicked and dropped to the prone position firing his weapon on full auto. \"Keep moving,\" Doc screamed as the others were forced to stop to keep from running over him. Momentum finished, they group became sitting ducks. Austen grunted as his chest exploded from two machine gun rounds, knocking him backwards onto the stretcher. Two grenades landed nearby so Doc instinctively threw himself over Ensign Lewis to try to protect him from the blast. LaGuardia was shredded by the blast and fell on top of Doc who felt half a dozen lances of pain as fragments hit him. Sanchez went down in a hail of machine gun fire while Collins scrambled to get up then ran away without looking back until he reconnected with the rest of the rescue team half a block away. \"Where's Doc and the pilot?\" Lt. Gordon asked, squeezing off a burst from his M4 as the Private came charging into the group. \"They're gone,\" Collins answered panicky, ducking as an alien propelled grenade exploded nearby. \"You're sure of that?\" \"Yea,\" he shot back, \"I saw it. Let's bug out.\" Gordon held his ground. He balled his fist in frustration knowing what was to come. He'd heard the whispers and the rumors too. Widow maker. This was the last nail in the coffin. He wanted to push back and at least recover the bodies but with over half his team wounded or down he had no way to carry the dead and maintain the fight. Maybe it would be better to go out with them he thought to himself. Looking around at the remaining Marines doggedly defending themselves he knew that was the selfish option. He could see a fresh batch of aliens trying to work their way into position to cut off their avenue of withdrawal and knew he had no option. \"Fall back to the bridge, fighting withdrawal, stay tight.\" Ears still ringing, Doc looked around but saw no movement. Lewis lay still but continued to breathe heavily. Pushing the dead men on top of him aside the Corpsman grabbed an M4 nearby then panned 180 degrees but there didn't seem to be any immediate threat. Beads of perspiration broke into a sweat as he waited for a resumption of the shooting that had shredded their group. None came. Doc crawled to the crumpled Marines lying around the stretcher and checked their pulses. All three were dead. His eyes welled up with tears and he punched the ground with his fist recalling their heroic stand at the same time remembering Collins running away. He could hear small arms fire a block over. The smoke had cleared but nothing could be seen other then houses. Maybe they think we're all dead the Corpsman wondered to himself. Doc Adukwu didn't give his next move a thought. He knew what he needed to do. The Corpsman gathered several more mags of ammunition from his fallen comrades then began to unstrap the Navy RIO from the stretcher. \"What are you doing?\" Ensign Lewis groaned. \"I'm getting you out of here,\" Doc replied in his soft African accent. \"Forget it. The squids are between us and the bridge. Leave me and save yourself. I'm done anyway.\" \"What do you mean?\" Doc asked, suddenly award the RIO's face was going pale. He then looked and saw blood seeping out of the man's flight suit just up from his hip. It looked like a piece of shrapnel had hit him. \"I'm not going to make it,\" Lewis answered, his voice fading. \"Tell my wife and daughter I love them.\" \"No! You are not going to die. Too many have already. You going to live,\" Doc declared with determination through glassy eyes. Forgetting what was going on around them he came up to a kneeling position, then dug into his pack picking out a probe and pair of forceps. He ripped the suit back then went after the piece of shrapnel. Lewis winced, gritting his teeth but didn't cry out. \"Got it!\" Doc declared triumphantly, pulling out the piece of metal, and then packing the wound with several field dressings. \"I don't want to die out here!\" Lewis cried, suddenly changing his tone. \"I want to see my family again.\" \"I won't let that happen. Come on, we're getting out of here!\" Doc picked up the flyer in one smooth motion, throwing him over his shoulder into a fireman's carry. With one arm steadying the wounded Ensign and the other holding an M4 Doc Adukwu slowly began to try to make their way to safety. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA \"More casualties coming in,\" an orderly reported to the surgery area. \"Triage is backing up; you need to pick up the pace.\" \"We're working as fast as we can,\" Dr. Chevreau snarled back, red-ringed eyes glaring. \"The main military hospital needs to take up the slack.\" \"They're already overloaded,\" the orderly replied. \"We're receiving their surplus.\" \"So many casualties,\" Kelly mused, moving a wounded soldier to make room for another. \"I guess things aren't going well at the front,\" another nurse mused. \"Well I heard the attack has totally stalled and the lead groups are having to pull back. They may dig into a new defensive position,\" a third added, changing the dressing on a wounded soldier as she talked. Michele was taking it all in as she assisted with post-op patients. As hard as she tried to not listen she found herself getting drawn in, panic creeping in like the walls of a cage getting taller. What about Mike and the guys who went in deep? If they pull back what happens to them? She looked at the ring on her finger and wondered if Mike was even alive. She thought for a moment and knew in her heart he still was. But for how long? Had she made a mistake saying yes to his marriage proposal? Had they both been presumptuous? \"For better or for worse,\" she whispered to herself. \"For better or for worse,\" and carried on with her work. Area Command Headquarters, Los Angeles Theatre of Operations \"So, where are we at?\" General Daily asked his command staff \"We're bogged down. Progress has stalled at the front and casualties have mounted. The aliens have blocked the advance it appears while the shield at Terminal Island continues to push out incrementally. Much longer and the troops there will be trapped,\" Col. Weeks reported without emotion. \"Okay, so what does that mean to you?\" General Daily asked, feeling suddenly tired. \"It means we're stuck. We should consolidate,\" General Grayback answered stepping in. \"We've made some great progress and given our rear area a nice buffer zone picking up several new neighborhoods in the process. That means we can establish new lines farther away from the rear. We may not have achieved what we set out for but we're in a good position to call this a tactical victory.\" \"Sir, we need to continue to push on,\" Captain Blatchford interjected, joining the conversation. \"If we don't win this before the squids are reinforced it won't matter where our lines are. We'll be screwed either way,\" she declared passionately. \"You've been banging that same drum for too long now Christie. That may make for a good story but it's about time you left this to the professionals,\" Grayback shot back derisively. \"Yea, and it's about time you find some aggressiveness and stop holding back, because that's a formula for defeat. We're running out of time,\" she countered angrily, then added, \"sir.\" Grayback's eyes flared angrily as Colonel Weeks and the feisty intelligence officer began to spar over the plan of attack. Daily wished General McConville was with them rather then out with the 101st. He could have used his counsel as he watched his staff bicker back and forth. \"Enough!\" he yelled, getting everyone's attention in the room. \"Enough of this crap. We don't have the luxury or time for this. We need to start working together or by God we're done. So all of you, grow up and start thinking. I need solutions. Holding the line is not an option. There is no time to buy but we may need a new approach including bringing in our reserves.\" \"What about the Marines at the bridge? They're running out of time,\" Blatchford asked, still not wanting to back down. Daily thought about it, looking at the Reserve officer who had proposed the bold plan in the first place and could see the pain in her eyes. He knew what she was feeling, how she carried a burden of guilt for proposing the men be sent on the dangerous mission and could empathize with her. \"Have them blow the bridges and pull them out. Get Colonel Ritchie on the horn. I'll talk to him personally.\" The connection was established quickly. The theatre commander could hear the sound of intense explosions and small arm fire in the background. The Marine General felt a pang of guilt for those who were now suffering for his inability to successfully enact the plan. He'd promised them relief in six hours, they'd kitted themselves out for that contingency. Now not only would no one be there in six hours they might not even be able to pull them out with the level of fighting going on and the shield moving. No time for that, he thought. Colonel Ritchie on the comms, sir,\" a communications NCO reported, handing the General the handset. \"Colonel, the attacks bogged down and we're not going to be able to relieve you in six hours as planned,\" Daily reported, getting straight to the point. If the disappointing news had surprised the Marine officer he didn't let on. \"When can we expect relief then sir?\" he asked in return. \"Unknown. We're working on solutions right now but it might be some time,\" Daily answered as honestly as he could. \"What's your sitrep?\" \"We're holding our positions so far. Both ends of the bridge though have come under consistent attack. Our ability to reinforce is limited as a result. The enemy is in stronger numbers then we were led to believe but we have good position. Unfortunately we've also not been able to link the company up so we're fighting as two separate entities.\" \"How long can you hold?\" the commander asked, regretting what he was about to order. \"As long as our ammo holds out sir we'll keep the squids at bay,\" Ritchie responded confidently. \"We have reports the shield is spreading outward.\" \"Yes, we can confirm that. It's likely half a klick out from its first position and expanding slowly,\" the LCol answered. \"All right then. I'm pulling the plug on your mission. I'm ordering you to withdraw.\" The words stuck in Daily's throat, tasting like bile. \"Say again, sir,\" Ritchie responded, surprise in his voice. \"Repeat last.\" \"I'm ordering you out. I want you to pull back to base,\" the General commanded. \"Sir, you can't be serious,\" the leader of the troops at the bridge declared. \"Listen Ken, I know how you feel but I can't guarantee we'll be able to support you on the ground and with the shield moving we can't resupply you. So I want you to blow the bridges and pull back to the tertiary extraction point established. Do you understand me?\" \"Retreat? Hell we just got here sir,\" Ritchie shot back. \"This is not the time for nostalgic heroics,\" Daily countered testily. \"Your position is untenable. You need to get out while you still can.\" \"Sir, if we lose this position we'll never get it back. The squids are preparing for their reinforcements. We have to keep a wedge between here and their forward operations.\" \"I understand that Ken but its suicide to stay,\" Daily stated bluntly. No sir, it's suicide to go,\" Ritchie countered, his voice suddenly dropping a bit. \"We can't give up this opportunity. Plus, I have a team in there looking for the generator. I'm not going to abandon them.\" Daily instinctively knew who was likely leading it but didn't ask. \"Plus I've gotten reports from my forward elements that they're also building some sort of docking facility it seems on the island,\" Ritchie continued. \"We need to take it out. No sir, we have to stay.\" The commanding officer paused, unsure what to do. He looked around at his staff knowing none of them could make the decision. It was his and his alone. Neither option worked but what choice did he have? The die had been cast. He'd risked it all on one hand. He needed to see how the cards came out but he also now knew he was sacrificing some good men at the bridge in the process. \"Your call Ken,\" Daily finally deferred, trusting his officer on the ground. \"You know what you're up against and what the situation is.\" \"We're staying sir,\" Ritchie confirmed. \"It's the only option. Retreat….\" \"Hell,\" Daily whispered as he felt his heart rise up to his throat.[Chapter 47] Chapter 47 A ray of light in the gathering storm Abandoned industrial complex, somewhere outside Military Command Los Angeles Protective Zone, LA A sound like distant thunder rolled through the abandoned factory. Hector looked out the dirty window above him and could see the sun shining in. This was a storm of a different type. Miles away a major battle was taking place, everyone in the complex could figure that out. The boy thought of Gunny Nantz and wondered if he were still alive. He'd become resigned to his position. He knew he couldn't escape and doubted anyone would find him even if they were looking. The boy felt insignificant, like no one cared about him. Then he remembered someone did care about him, just not in the way he wanted Aunt Maria cared for the boy but not the way that showed any affection. Hector wondered if he were even his real aunt after overhearing parts of the conversation between the hard Mexican woman and the priest who had come to visit. Shortly after that he'd been taken away. Things seemed to be taken from him often: his father…his home…Mike…now the place he'd been living and making friends…everything. Fatalistic foreboding filled the young boy's mind as he despaired for any future. Now the sound of distant battle drove him deeper into depression. Glancing over from the mattress he lay forlorn on he could see Maria Rincon and the man called Javier who'd helped take him in a heated discussion. They seemed no happier then him. Small consolation. \"How long are we going to stay in this place?\" Javier demanded of Maria, out of earshot of Hector. \"As long as is necessary Mano,\" she shot back sharply. \"I agreed to help you take the boy away but this…this place was not part of the bargain,\" the muscular Mexican man whined. \"You will do what I tell you to do,\" the petite woman growled, unintimidated by the hulking figure. \"I have paid you well for your services.\" \"Do you hear that?\" the man responded. \"That's the sound of battle. We are outside the protection zone here. I don't like it.\" \"You think you're safer there?\" Maria snorted. \"The Gringos will not be able to protect anyone here. The invaders will sweep that area up and everyone in it, you can bet on that. We are safer here, away from everyone else.\" \"Do you really think so?\" Javier asked hopefully. \"Si. And in a few days I will have transportation arranged to take us far from here and away from all of this. Then you are free to go back or,\" she looked at him hungrily, \"you can come along with me if you are of use.\" For a moment the man had a sense of what Hector was feeling, like a mouse being toyed with by a vicious cat. Vincent Thomas Bridge, Terminal Island, LA \"Prep the bridge for destruction,\" LCol Ritchie ordered the Captain commanding B Company at the Commodore Helm Bridge through the radio. \"When we're set I'll give the signal and we'll blow them at the same time. Our new link up point will be along this side of the bridge.\" The 2nd Battalion commander got off the radio wondering if they'd ever be able to link up. Despite his confidence with General Daily and aura with the men inside he had a growing sense of foreboding. He understood the necessity of destroying the structure but he also knew the Squids could swim so any impediment would be short-term at best. Plus, if the shield wasn't taken out the whole thing would be of little value. The seasoned combat leader could see the Squids forming on the island and knew there were significant numbers on the land side of the bridge. He could only imagine what it was like for B Company. With no relief in sight and no air cover things were getting pretty tight. Still, it would be nice to not have to defend both ends of the bridge. With the casualties they'd already taken they were getting pretty thin. Ritchie was confident he could easily defend the channel crossing allowing him to concentrate more troops on the landward side. That was one ray of sunshine in an otherwise increasingly bleak day. He wondered how Nantz and his team were faring. The decision to send them out had been perhaps a bit premature. He wondered if the team was too small and inexperienced for the job. Sure they'd taken the alien C-and-C centre out last year, the story was now the thing of legend, but how much of that had been dumb luck? Any smart enemy would learn from their mistake and be prepared and this enemy was certainly not stupid. \"Damn,\" Ritchie said quietly to himself. He'd sent the men needlessly to their death. But what choice did he have? \"Orders sir?\" an Engineer Sergeant attached to the force asked. Captain Harvel had essentially turned command over to him so it was his call. \"Rig the bridge for destruction. I want the whole thing dropped and dropped hard. Captain Harvel, get your men at the other end of the bridge ready to fall back fast when we're good to go. I don't think the Squids will be timid when they abandon their position. I want lots of cover fire as they come back. Maybe if we're lucky we'll take out a bunch of the suckers with the blast.\" \"What about Nantz and his team?\" Harvel asked cautiously. \"They can get back the way they got in, by crossing the channel.\" \"It'll be hard to support them though,\" the company commander surmised. \"True but we don't have any real choice do we? We do the best we can, just like they do.\" The Lieutenant Colonel shot back a bit crossly, irritated by the situation more then the questions from the concerned Captain. Ritchie could see the man didn't like the answer but neither did he. But what choice did he have? Their perfect plan was quickly unraveling and so they were now trying to fix it the best they could. He looked across the channel to Terminal Island and could see even more aliens moving about. There was at least a battalion's worth that he could see meaning the place was likely crawling with them and knew. He knew the importance of Nantz's task but still couldn't help but feel guilty. Yet without the shield down they were all finished. So if the small team could take it out he'd find a way to get them back even if he had to swim the channel himself. San Pedro neighborhood, near Terminal Island Doc Adukwu moved as inconspicuously as he could through the backyard of the abandoned home. He avoided toys and bikes scattered about the yard, not only making sure not to trip but also not to make any sound. The Corpsman could hear aliens in the distance and knew a number of them were between him and the bridge. He dared not use his radio to call for help so felt quite alone. Shoulders cramping from the weight of the RIO he carried and hands aching from gripping the M4 so tightly he needed to take a rest. Moving to the side of the next yard he found cover under a trio of orange blossom trees in the corner of the yard backing onto a wooden fence. Trying to set the injured airman down gently his gripped slipped and the Navy Ensign hit the ground with a thud groaning loudly in pain. \"Shh!\" Doc tried to urgently quiet him. \"Sorry,\" Lewis responded through gritted teeth. \"I didn't mean to do that.\" \"No, it is my bad,\" Doc consoled him in his thick African accent while checking the dressing on his wounds. Blood was seeping through the patch job he'd done meaning the bleeding hadn't stopped. It had been fortunate they'd stopped so he could try to stop the seepage. Much more and he would have perhaps died from the loss of blood. \"Thank you,\" Lewis said weakly. Doc noticed the Ensign was paler then before and his breathing shallow. He needed to get the man to the Company Aid Station at the bridge quickly. \"For what?\" he asked in response, trying to take his mind off the ticking clock. \"For doing this. For putting your life at risk for mine,\" Lewis answered. \"You can still leave me. I'd understand.\" \"No. I won't do that. You'll see your wife and child again,\" Doc declared, preparing to move again. Standing up he bent over to sling the Navy RIO back over his shoulder taking his eyes off the yard. Too late Doc turned with the man to see a pair of infantry caste aliens had walked into the back yard. The lead one chirped in surprise as the other one seemed to warble in reply. Both seemed surprised but raised their weapons to fire on the Corpsman and wounded flier. Doc though reacted faster loosing a burst from his M4 that caught the alien just above the heart. It stumbled back and collided with the one behind it sending its burst of machine gun fire wide. Doc stepped to his right to get a better angle and drilled the second alien with three 5.56mm slugs. Before the pair of invaders hit the ground Doc was off and running. Despite the sound of him running and the thunder of his heart beating in his ears Doc could hear movement all around him. Dodging and weaving as best he could the Corpsman pressed on to the bridge, praying he'd make it. A burst of machine gun fire tore up the ground behind him forcing him to duck into a back yard. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw an open gate at the end. Running towards it an alien stepped in the way but the muscular African fired his weapon on the run and barreled through the startled alien like a fullback running over a defensive back. Steadily the Corpsman progressed, the Vincent Thomas Bridge becoming tantalizingly bigger. Two grenades landed on either side of him. For some reason he only heard the sound of his breathing and not the explosions going off. He didn't feel the shrapnel rip into his legs, only the burning lungs he pushed as he drove himself forward, totally focused on getting Ensign Michael Lewis reunited with his family. Then suddenly he broke out of the residential area running madly through the approach to the bridge. He was close but he also had no cover. He prayed harder he would make it. At the bridge the sound of approaching light arms fire had gotten the attention of the lead positions as well as the officers commanding the sector. The sight of the Corpsman running wildly towards the fortified position momentarily stunned everyone watching but then they sprang into action. \"Sir! \" a Corporal called out. \"Friendlies inbound!\" \"What the Hell?\" Captain Harvel said out loud. \"What a second…that's Adukwu carrying that guy. Covering fire! Covering fire!\" 1st Squad, move out and provide him support,\" he yelled, rallying his forces. \"Let's bring them home!\" The Marine defensive position lit up like Christmas as every weapon engaged the aliens surging out of the residential area into the open chasing the lumbering Corpsman. \"Squids in the open!\" Harvel called out. \"Mow them down!\" Anger at the enemy who had been harassing them with hit-and-run fire spilled out into action as the Marines responded with a vengeance. Men on the line began to yell and cheer encouragement as they fired, willing the Corpsman on to safety, doing everything they could to get him there. The result was the first wave of pursuing aliens was cut down giving Adukwu a bit of a gap. An audible groan could be heard along the line as Doc was hit in the leg with a machine gun round from the residential area and stumbled to one knee. The Marine relief squad was too far away and too engaged to help him. But with a Herculean effort Doc pushed himself up and keeping moving towards safety, turning to protect the injured RIO. Firing his weapon he walked backwards, again shielding the helpless Navy Ensign. Another round went clear through his shoulder causing him to drop his M4 but still he walked backwards, step by step, not allowing the other man to be exposed. Marines screamed encouragement, firing their weapons. Several jumped out of their protected positions in an attempt to draw enemy fire, others wanting to run to him. Though taking heavy casualties a fresh batch of aliens surged out and continued to press on in their pursuit, understanding the psychological importance of killing the pair. Yet despite their best efforts, Doc had only been hit twice and Lewis not at all. It was as if some shield was around the pair. Yet the aliens continued to gain on the pair slowly walking backwards. Then several rocket rounds slammed into the lead aliens and the chatter of two GPMG's firing on full auto signaled support for the Marines had arrived. LCol Ritchie had moved up with the reserve force from the company adding their firepower to that which was already engaged. Marines surged forward supporting the squad working their way to Doc and Lewis. Finally reaching them Ensign Lewis was gently lifted off Doc's shoulder and carried away protected by a trio of Marines firing and moving. \"No, I must take him,\" Doc groaned, fighting the attempt weakly. \"I must not let him die.\" \"I'm not going to let you die either,\" the bass voice of Lt. Gordon declared. \"You're getting out of here too.\" After the news of the loss of the RIO and Corpsman the junior officer had been buoyed by the report of the pair returning to the bridge. Seeing the enemy advancing on them though he spontaneously jumped the barricade and using his sprinter's speed dodged and weaved his way over reaching the beleaguered pair at the same time as the squad making their way to them arrived. With his burden taken, Doc's energy gave out and he collapsed onto the concrete ramp leading to the Marine's position. He never hit the ground. Two Marines held him up and a phalanx of others from the company most prominently Lt. Gordon surrounded him, not allowing anything to get near him. With most of their force wiped out the aliens couldn't match the numbers or firepower of the angry Marines. While some stayed and died where they stood the remainder turned and fled leaving dozens dead or wounded on the approach to the bridge. Ensign Lewis and Doc were hustled back to the Company Aid Station and miraculously the Navy RIO had no new wounds. Doc on the other hand had a number of shrapnel wounds and an additional machine gun wound to go with the other two he'd had. Still, weak as he was, his concern was for Lewis. \"Is he safe? Is Ensign Lewis okay?\" Doc asked weakly. \"Yea, he's fine. He'll be okay,\" a Marine Doctor confirmed after stabilizing Lewis and working furiously on the now more seriously wounded Corpsman. \"Good…good,\" Doc said faintly, as Lewis reached over, eyes wet with tears, to grasp his hand. \"Now you will see your family again,\" he gasped as he fell into unconsciousness. Abandoned industrial complex, somewhere outside Military Command Los Angeles Protective Zone, LA A green Military Police Ford Explorer pulled up about a half kilometer from the abandoned factories. Gwen Langois jumped out wearing a tan denim jacket and blue jeans. Taking a pair of binoculars off the dashboard she scanned the area around her that seemed abandoned. \"So you're sure dis is the 'Foundry'?\" she asked Raul Santos in her thick Cajun accent. \"It looks abandoned to me.\" \"Si. Yes. This is the place,\" he answered nervously. \"Most stay in the inner buildings in the complex but trust me, people are here and they see us already.\" \"Well then isn't that good we have you along since dey will recognize you,\" Langois responded chipily. Father Alexander began to wonder if this was a smart move as he watched the Latino man flinch at the comment. He wondered if this was smart, if this repentant man would turn on them but he also knew they had to get Hector back and this was the only way. He pulled the collar of his jacket up to cover the clerical collar he wore. The MP Lieutenant had suggested they dress down in order to not attract attention. \"You should have brought some backup. Soldiers or LAPD or something,\" Raul whined. \"These people have guns and aren't afraid to use them.\" \"I guess we'll just have to ask politely,\" Langois retorted, pulling the slide on her M9 pistol and returning it to the shoulder holster under her jacket. \"We can't spare anyone right now and dis could be a wild goose chase. Come on, let's get this done.\" The casually dressed trio moved towards the Foundry unaware that they were being watched. Somewhere on Terminal Island, LA \" Maybe we should wait until night to make the crossing,\" Lockett suggested as they watched the alien engineers busily working on the docking facility all along the causeway. Mike looked at his watch and then up at the sun. \"No, the relief column will be here in less then an hour. We don't have the time to wait,\" he declared not knowing the reality of the situation. \"Plus, the longer we wait the more likely we get caught. The causeway won't work but we need to check out the south part of the island. So we'll need to cross from the west I figure,\" he stated pointing to the spot that made the most sense off of the satellite image and map he held out. \"I'm just not sure how to do it. Any suggestions?\" he asked his other NCO's showing the level of respect he had for them. \"We need a diversion,\" Harris stated, adjusting his thick horn-rimmed glasses. \"What do you mean?\" Imlay asked. \"We need a diversion. Something to get the Squids looking the other way while we cross,\" Harris declared. \"What do you have in mind?\" Mike asked, curious what was going through the man's mind. Harris looked around for a moment then spotted what he wanted to the left of their position. \"There. The APL Logistics building. We set a delayed charge that allows us time to move into position. It goes off and we book it across the harbor from the Coast Guard Station on Seaside Ave.\" \"It's risky. The Squids'll know someone's on the island,\" Lockett joined in. \"They might figure it out or maybe they'll think it's an indirect shot from the bridge,\" the bespectacled Corporal mused. \"Even if they don't, they'll be looking in the wrong area.\" Mike thought about it for a moment. \"We don't have a lot of choices. That's the last main area we haven't searched and the clock's ticking. No, I think it's a solid plan, certainly the best we have. Okay, let's do it. Ortega, prepare the charge and set the timer.\" In short order everyone was prepared and the small search-and-destroy team moved stealthily away right under the noses of the patrolling aliens. They traveled steadily West using Cannery Street as their axis of advance until they got to South Seaside away from the causeway and started moving down. Along the way alien traffic got thinner to the point where there was none. Passing the Federal Corrections Institute facility on Reservation Point they were even able to walk in the open allowing surplus time at the Coast Guard station which was their destination. \"That's a long swim,\" Private Rapetti gulped, looking across the channel to their destination. \"What about our gear?\" Harris asked. \"Let's look for something we can use to keep our stuff dry,\" Mike ordered. A lifejacket locker was discovered and several dozen lashed together to make a raft to float their gear across. There was even one left over for Rapetti. \"Standby. The charge will be going off in less then a minute,\" Mike reminded the group. The explosion could be heard over a kilometer away and an orange fireball rose up into the sky. \"I guess I used a bit too much C4,\" Ortega confessed somewhat sheepishly. \"No, good job. I'm sure that got their attention. Now let's move,\" Mike ordered urgently. The team got into the water and swam as quickly as they could across the expanse, dragging the small raft with their kit behind them. Getting to the other side they were able to find a metal rung sea ladder going down into the water. Fortune seemed to be smiling on them. Imlay went up first, surveying the area. Giving the all clear signal the others began to move up to the docking area under the shadow of a big blue loading crane. One after the other they made their way up. Mike was beginning to think of their next move. They almost made it. Rapetti was three-quarters of the way up the ladder still wearing his life jacket. The Private tried to adjust the bulky garment when his grip slipped on a slick rung and he lost his balance. Shouting in alarm the Marine tumbled headlong off the ladder landing with a loud splash in the water. The noise attracted the attention of several infantry caste aliens across the canal to the north of their position. Though the Marines on top of the ladder couldn't hear it was obvious by their wild gesturing they were raising the alarm. Machine gun fire from the other side sprayed across the water seeking to destroy the team. As Rapetti climbed up the ladder again this time followed by Lockett who brought up the rear a rocket propelled grenade hit him square in the back. The Marine exploded with parts of him flying in all direction. His torso fell like a sack hitting Lockett square on the head causing the Corporal to lose his grip. He flailed around wildly trying to get his grip as the aliens on the other side sought to zero in on him with automatic weapon fire. Reacting at the initial fire, Harris got their GPMG down and embedded opening up. The M240B spit out fire and along with the rest of the team returning fire, they drove the small group of aliens back. Lockett regained his footing and scampered up the rest of the ladder, still shaken by what had happened. For a moment the Marines could see no foes but could hear the excited chirping and warbling of aliens approaching. \"Anything?\" Mike asked Santos. The Air Force Tech Sergeant desperately worked her equipment but the frustrated look on her face gave the answer. \"No. Still nothing.\" Mike desperately looked for cover and a way to melt into the surroundings but the docking area was fairly open. They'd need to make a run for it and Mike feared this was going to become a running fight. They'd lost the element of surprise and now were about to become hunted on a shrinking part of the small island. Vincent Thomas Bridge, Terminal Island, LA \"Charges are set sir, we're good to go,\" the Engineer Sergeant reported. \"Captain Harvel, pull your men back from the other side and then we'll blow it,\" LCol Ritchie ordered. The company commander gave the order praying the aliens didn't surge forward when they saw the troops on the island side of the bridge abandon their position. His biggest fear was they'd be overrun and not able to get back. The platoon rushed along the span but unexpectedly the aliens didn't pursue them as quickly as expected. In fact the Marines were nearly to the landward end before infantry caste aliens could be seen methodically moving up to the peak. \"Do we wait sir?\" the Sergeant asked. Ritchie had hoped to kill more then this in the blast but he didn't want to take any chances. \"Too bad….no, do it.\" \"Fire in the hole!\" the Engineer yelled as the Marines closest to the bridge covered their ears in anticipation of the blast while the Sergeant depressed the plunger on the detonator. Nothing happened. Desperately the combat engineer checked the connections and the RF switch for the remote detonators and hit the switch again. Still nothing. Aliens now began to surge over the crest of the bridge in mass, charging down on the surprised Marines seemingly with the intention of overrunning the defensive position with a quick assault. \"Prepare to repel!\" Captain Harvel screamed.[Chapter 48] Chapter 48 – Closing in Dozens of infantry caste aliens came charging down the bridge guns blazing, in addition two Wedge ships roared over the horizon to support the assault. The platoon that had retreated across the bridge crossed over into the hastily set up defenses giving the troops in position a clear line of fire. The Marine line erupted in machine gun and small arm fire. Despite the ferocity the sheer number imbalance meant the aliens steadily pushed forward. One of the Wedge Ships engaged a GPMG position and with fire from its Direct Energy Weapon blew the position up. The loss of firepower encouraged the infantry caste aliens to press their advantage. The Army engineer desperately tried everything he thought of to detonate the charges on the bridge but nothing happened. \"Something's blocking the signal, sir!\" he reported. \"I can't blow it.\" \"What are we going to do?\" Captain Harvel questioned with a growing note of desperation. \"We're boxed in here. Maybe we should have taken the extraction.\" \"No way, we're going to hold the line,\" LCol. Ritchie growled. \"Push two squads up each side of the bridge to provide flanking fire. We'll envelope them on the descent. Have the main positions support the squads and keep them free from attack. Break out the Stinger missiles we brought and drop those Wedge ships,\" he ordered. Then raising his voice so the others could here him he added, \"Marines, we are going to hold this position and we're going to win.\" A new voice joined the encouragement. \"Come on guys, we can do this.\" Doc Adukwu declared in his thick African accent. The Corpsman limped awkwardly along the defensive position bringing extra ammo despite being in obvious pain. The doctor trailing behind him looked concerned but did nothing to stop the determined man. The Colonel's confidence and Doc's example did the trick. The Marines snapped out of their funk, gritted their teeth and dug in. Despite the numeric superiority of the attackers they were stacked up along the relatively narrow expanse of the bridge so could only bring minimum fire to bear. With the new platoon in position the Marines, on the other hand, were able to concentrate their considerable firepower into that area holding the attack at bay. Several blasts from the Wedge ships DEW's caused gaps in the line but they were quickly filled by others though their position became more tenuous. But then one, then two plumes of smokes streaked up towards the hovering enemy ships from the Stinger anti-aircraft launchers. At point-blank rank they couldn't miss and each went down. One of the Wedge ships plowed into the bridge, taking out a score of aliens and the other crashed into the channel around the island. Unrelenting fire from several M240B GPMGs and a salvo of grenades not only checked the attacker's momentum but actually began to push them back. Without support, progress checked and the Marines having every inch of the descent of the bridge to land zeroed the aliens began to get mowed down. En masse they broke and began to run back towards the other side while those who'd been attacking from landward melted back into the residential area. They'd held. A cheer went up from the Marine position. Corpsmen went out to attend to the wounded and those still standing took advantage of the opportunity to reload and also slake their thirst from their canteens. \"That was close,\" Harvel commented, wiping sweat from his eyes. \"Naw,\" Ritchie countered, holding a handkerchief up to stop the blood from a slight shrapnel wound on his cheek. \"We're in a good position and were never really challenged.\" Looking out, the officers could see dozens of aliens lying dead on the bridge and dozens more wounded withdrawing back to the safety of Terminal Island. \"We're not going to be able to blow the bridge,\" Harvel declared, \"and I doubt we can retake the other side. Looks like we're stuck in this position.\" \"Well, we'll just do the best we can,\" Ritchie answered, looking hard at the Captain. Harvel could see the steely resolve in his commander's eyes so knew they were in for the long haul. So be it , he thought to himself. If it was going to be easy they wouldn't have called the Marines. \"Food should be fine, everyone has rations but water could be a problem,\" the Captain declared. Ritchie nodded his head, observing with satisfaction the new determination in the officer's voice. \"We'll need to sort that out. Detail some men to search the buildings nearby to see if there's any running water. If not we'll have to get it from the channel and use the purifications tablets.\" \"Yes sir. I'll get it done,\" Harvel stated without any hesitation. The man was now in all the way. \"Reporting for duty sir.\" Doc Adukwu came over to the pair, standing with them a bit wobbly but with doggedness in his eyes. \"Adukwu, you're one crazy mother,\" LCol Ritchie snorted. \"If we get out of this mess I'm putting you in for a Navy Cross.\" Then taking him by the elbow out of earshot of the others he added, \"Thanks for that, by the way. The men needed a morale boost. You did a good thing.\" \"Thank you sir,\" Doc replied a bit embarrassed, \"but I was only doing my duty.\" Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Though still steady, the stream of casualties coming into the hospital had dropped off considerably. Michele hoped this meant things were going better at the front though the snatches of conversation she was able to pick up didn't give her cause for optimism. She looked down at the ring on her finger wondering anew if she'd made the right decision. Then the woman whose life had changed so dramatically the year before began to wonder if Mike was still alive. She might not need to worry about the future as a Marine's wife. She had made a hasty decision, in the passion of the moment. She'd not weighed the cost to her of a husband serving in the military. He was asking her to make a tremendous sacrifice for him. No one would begrudge her for being unable to fulfill that. No one would fault her for not wanting that kind of restriction on her life, the anxiety, worry, questions it would cause. Then she saw two orderlies carrying out a body bag. Did that one have a wife? A family? Michele's emotions swirled, unable to lock on a position. Perhaps it was the fatigue of the day or maybe just realization. She felt guilty for thinking such selfish thoughts. Hundreds of thousands of women had husbands serving in the military. Thousands had to face the agony of their death. What made her special? \"Please…please, you need to help me,\" a woman's frantic voice implored urgently. \"He's very sick and if you don't do anything I'm afraid he'll die.\" Michele heard the voice and there was something familiar about it but in her fatigued state she couldn't place it. The next voice, regrettably, she could. \"I'm sorry but there's nothing we can do to help you lady,\" Dr. Chevreau countered coldly. \"We're beyond capacity and have no room for civilian sick at this point. Take your baby to a clinic.\" \"They aren't able to do anything for him and have no supplies,\" the woman pleaded. \"They told me to come here. Please help he can barely breath!\" \"We just don't have the time right now to look at non-priority patients. Come back in a couple of days and check to see if we can see you.\" With that Dr. Chevreau turned and walked away. The woman tried to follow but an orderly blocked her path. Michele saw the woman's shoulders slump then begin to contract as sobs wracked her body. The child she carried began to cry pitifully but everyone ignored her. The woman turned around, eyes desperate and wild and Michele recognized her. It was Kathy Martinez, the widow of the Lieutenant who led the team that rescued her. Michele was taken back to the previous year, after she'd come back from LA after being rescued. Not knowing whether Mike and the others were alive she'd met Kathy Martinez, the wife of 2Lt. William Martinez, and given her the letter Mike had given her to pass along. They'd talked briefly but Michele had been in such a state of shock from everything that had happened it had been short. She remembered the attractive woman had been pregnant at the time. This had to be the child, 2Lt. Martinez's child. She had to do something. \"Mrs. Martinez?\" Michele went over and touched her arm gently. \"Please….please will you help me?\" she sobbed, barely able to get the words out. \"Please don't let my baby die. He's all I have left.\" \"I'll do the best I can to help.\" \"Thank you. Thank you. Wait…I recognize you. Have we met before?\" \"Yes, my name is Michele Trantor. Your husband rescued me and my nieces last year.\" \"You're the one who gave me the letter,\" the distraught woman confirmed. \"Yes.\" The baby cried but it was cut short and contracted as if it couldn't breathe. \"Can you do anything?\" Kathy screamed in desperation. \"He's going to suffocate.\" \"I can't but I know someone who can,\" Michele tried to reassure her. Taking the woman by the arm Michele led her into the hospital. An orderly attempted to bar their progress but a glare from the determined woman caused him to step aside. \"Kelly! Kelly!\" Michele called out to her friend. \"You were a pediatrics nurse before all this right? This child is sick. Can you take a look at him, please?\" Kelly's expression hardened for a moment then softened at the sight. Despite the numbing fatigue from the day's relentless activity the compassionate nurse relented. \"Sure. Let me see what I can do.\" The careful nurse took her stethoscope out and listened to the baby's heart then breathing. \"What's his name?\" she asked kindly continuing the examination. \"William,\" Kathy answered, \"after his father.\" Michele winced at the statement, remembering the handsome junior officer who had died so heroically yet tragically at the bridge. Kelly caught the discomfort of her friend and connected the dots. \"Well, he's a beautiful boy.\" Hanging on to him still she got a serious look on her face. \"Your child has a pretty severe case of Bronchiolitis Mrs. Martinez.\" Kathy's hand went up to her mouth as she gasped. \"Will he be okay though?\" she asked, barely able to keep her emotions in check. \"Sure, we can take care of it. We have what we need here to look after him. Don't worry.\" The relief of Kathy's face lightened the mood of the group. \"Thank you so much. I've been so worried.\" Kelly left and returned with a series of medicines which she administered to William then gave instructions on further medication to his mother. \"Sit here for a bit,\" Kelly ordered \"to allow him to calm down and the medicine to take over. Then give him these based on these instructions.\" \"Thank you so much,\" Kathy gushed, hugging the nurse spontaneously. \"Happy I could help. I need to go,\" Kelly left. \"Please, can you sit with me for a bit?\" Kathy asked Michele. Michele hesitated knowing there was still much to do but seeing the look of desperation on the woman's face relented. \"Sure. I've got some time.\" \"When I met you I hated you,\" Kathy declared quietly. \"I knew before you gave me the letter and didn't want anything to do with you. I'm sorry….\" Michele took the upset woman's hand. \"I understand. I wouldn't want to get that kind of news either. You have nothing to apologize for.\" \"Do you have anyone in your life?\" Kathy asked. Michele looked at her ring. \"Yes, I'm engaged.\" \"Is he in the military?\" \"Yes, he's fighting right now,\" Michele could barely whisper. \"Then you do know what I mean,\" Kathy stated with relief. \"But I'm sorry also because I lost the opportunity to find out how William died….,\" her voice dropped off. \"I wasn't ready then…maybe I'm still not….but I've heard bits and pieces since then but I'd like to know: how did he die?\" Michele took a deep breath. \"He died so that others could live. We were in a desperate place and he gave his life so we could get out. He was a hero.\" Kathy choked with emotion and squeezed Michele's hand tightly. \"Tell me everything.\" For the next half hour Michele went in detail everything that had happened from the time they'd met at the Police station to the time Kathy's husband had detonated the C4 on the bus stopping the alien advance. The woman listened with rapt attention, asking several time for more details. In the end, Kathy Martinez left with a recovering child and a greater sense of peace about what happened to her husband. Michele watched the woman leave with a sense of peace of her own. In some ways she'd been given closure herself and looked afresh at her relatively new relationship. Sure there was risk, she reminded herself. Mike could be dead right now but she'd also forgotten the upside, the joy of the life she desired with the man she loved. He was a man who could only be the way he was, and therefore more desirable then any other, because he was a Marine. Eyes moist, she thanked God for the reminder of what she had to gain rather then wallowing in what she could lose. Abandoned industrial complex, somewhere outside Military Command Los Angeles Protective Zone, LA The trio walked as casually as they could towards the group of buildings known as the Foundry. As they got closer it was obvious people were watching them. \"Walk casually,\" Raul urged Lt. Langois. \"You look like a cop.\" The Cajun MP snorted but didn't comment though she loosened her stride up. \"Some of them have guns,\" Father Alexander suddenly observed. The priest became nervous, wondering if this had been a good idea. \"I told you this was a dangerous place to come,\" Raul responded. \"I told you we need more backup.\" \"Well it is what it is,\" Langois commented but the usual confidence seemed to be escaping her. \"Too late now, we're committed.\" Suddenly things didn't seem so simple. The observation and declaration had a chilling effect on the group. \"So why the change of heart\" Langois asked Raul, trying to ease the growing tension as they walked towards the first building. \"Why do you care?\" he shot back with a forlorn expression. \"You've already judged me and found me guilty.\" \"Well, are you?\" she countered. \"Si, yes…I am guilty of many things,\" the Mexican replied quietly. \"Well den you condemn yourself. But I ask again, why are helping us here?\" Langois pressed. Raul shared his story as they walked closer. Father Alexander was impressed that the young man didn't embellish or try to make himself sound better. He stuck to what seemed to be the facts. Lt. Langois listened quietly and while her tone seemed to soften she still held her ground. \"Yet despite all dat you still turned to crime to support yourself.\" \"You don't know what I went through!\" he raised his voice. \"I know you had a choice!\" Langois shot back. \"You think you da only one with a bad story? You chose that path.\" \"You're right,\" Raul agreed quietly, hanging his head a bit. \"I did. That's why I want to change. That's why I want to help.\" The response disarmed the cynical MP. \"Maybe there is hope for you. Maybe,\" she emphasized. \"We'll see how this all goes and then talk again.\" The conversation had taken them to the edge of the first building. The trio went in from the light of day to the shadows and darkness of the unlit factory office area. Shards of light filtered through dirty broken windows lighting up the dust that swirled around. Though quiet the three knew they weren't alone. \"Hey.\" A voice challenged them from the dark. \"Who is there?\" Raul answered, signaling the others casually to stop. \"It is Viktor, Mr. Santos,\" a voice with a thick Eastern European accent answered. \"Viktor Krakov,\" Raul confirmed, trying to keep his voice calm. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Me? I am always here,\" the man answered coming out of the shadows with three other men flanking him. Then with a quizzical look on his face he asked, \"What are you doing here? We never see you in this place.\" \"Business Mano.\" \"Yea, and who are these people?\" Krakov asked pointedly, as the others brandished weapons. \"They don't look like they belong here.\" Si, you're right. They're military,\" Raul confirmed. Gwen Langois flinched and would have gone for her weapon if not for a look from Father Alexander. \"What?\" Krakov raised his voice as one of his confederates raised the MAC-10 he carried. \"You pick strange friends Raul,\" the Russian probed as the group spread out to encircle them. Gwen Langois' heart beat wildly as she watched not only their avenue of escape eliminated but the gunmen move into solid covering positions. They were completely defenseless. She chided herself for trusting this grease ball. If she was going to go down, it wouldn't be without a fight. The feisty MP prepared to make her move. \"Friends, ha!\" Raul chuckled, confidence in his voice. \"You think I want to come to this place and leave the comfort of my hacienda? They are business associates. I am looking to make connections to move my product into the military base. These are my contacts. We are working on a deal that's why I needed to come. I don't trust the details of my business to anyone.\" \"Hmm,\" Krakov shrugged visibly relaxing causing his men to stand down. \"Okay, makes sense. Next time you come back bring me some whisky. The nights are starting to get cold.\" \"No problem, Mano. I bring you Johnny Walker Blue,\" Raul chuckled. Then signaling to the others he said, \"Come on, vamanos,\" and they walked past the impromptu checkpoint. Out of ear shot Raul let out a deep breath. \"That was close.\" \"Thank you Raul. You were brilliant,\" Father Alexander declared. \"Yes, dat was a good move back there,\" Langois stated, a bit confused. \"You did well to get us past them.\" \"I told you I could be trusted,\" Raul shot back. \"I can be trusted. I want a new life.\" Langois nodded her head in agreement. \"You're right. I was wrong about you and I hope you can forgive me. When you do what I do you get cynical...you lose your faith….\" \"No problems,\" Raul cut her off so she didn't have to be more embarrassed then she already seemed. \"I wouldn't have trusted me either.\" Seeing relief on the woman soldier's face made the man happy for some strange reason. \"Come on, let's go find Hector now.\" They moved deeper in the building coming into contact with a variety of people who seemed to be running from the world for their own reasons. Raul gained confidence with each step, taking charge of the search, asking everyone they met about Hector. Finally they seemed to find the information they sought and moved to another building deeper in the complex. The trio entered into what had once been a smaller storage area compared to the main industrial room they'd exited. Lit by several candles and a number of flashlights, a generator hummed in another room providing light to several overhead lights. Though dim the group could see a boy lying on a mattress in a corner at the opposite end of the room. As if sensing the arrival of people who cared Hector turned and saw three people on the opposite side of the room. Straining to see who'd arrived in the low light his heart skipped a beat as he recognized Father Alexander. A squeak of delight came out of the excited boy but he saw the priest raise a finger to his lips to quiet him. \"That's Hector!\" Father Alexander said in a low voice. \"Let's go get him,\" the priest added urgently. \"Wait!\" Raul cautioned, putting his hand on the arm of the eager clergyman. \"We must move cautiously. You two, stay in the shadows. Say nothing!\" he urged. \"This could get tricky so let me do the talking.\" The Mexican man left the others and walked into the brightest light of the room. \"Maria!\" he called out. \"Maria Rincon, where are you?\" \"What are you doing here?\" the petite woman hissed ominously, coming out of the shadows on the opposite side of the room. \"And why have you been asking around here for Hector?\" If the declaration fazed the man he didn't show it. \"I need to boy for an operation I have going on,\" Raul stated smoothly. \"A simple job really. I need him only for a day or so. I'll pay well for him.\" \"What kind of operation?\" Maria asked suspiciously. \"That is none of your business woman,\" Raul snapped. \"Remember you work for me.\" \"Perhaps things have changed,\" the hard-faced woman responded menacingly. Javier and three other men came out of the shadows to cover the Latino man. \"What's this all about Maria? Are you crazy? Do you know who I am?\" Raul tried to intimidate. \"Soon to be a dead man. You and your friends hiding over there in the shadows. I know who's with you. You've brought the priest so you've sold us out and now you're going to die.\" Several other armed men came into the room from another door. \"Kill them all,\" Maria ordered. Somewhere on Terminal Island, LA \"Keep moving!\" Mike rasped out to the others as they bobbed and weaved through a forest of shipping containers. He fired a short burst from his M4A1 sending an alien spinning that had come charging around a corner. The beleaguered Gunnery Sergeant had passed up several good defensible positions to continue moving knowing that if they stopped the aliens trying to pen them in would swarm. Not only would they be unable to hold the position indefinitely but more importantly they wouldn't be able to accomplish their mission. Despite everything going on he instinctively looked at his wrist watch and realized they were now many hours past the arrival time of the relief column yet there'd been no signs of any reinforcements. Showing the incredible capacity of the mind to multi-task not only did he continue to lead the squad but also processed the implications of what he'd just discovered. There were no signs of relief. Did that mean they were stuck on the other side of the bridge? Did the shield have anything to do with it? Had they even made it? He had neither the time nor the luxury of pondering such things. He needed to find the shield generator and take it out. But how could he do that when they were on the run. The aliens continued to pop in and out of cover taking pot shots but never able to mount a serious attack on the group due to the strength of the Marines concentrated fire. So this boxing match continued of two fighters seeking the advantage over the other. \"Uhnn…\" Lockett cried out in pain, stumbling then falling onto the pavement. The African American grabbed his calf and tried to get back to his feet. \"Defensive formation!\" Mike ordered urgently. \"Harris, buy us some time with the 240!\" As the Marines spread out and increased their fire to keep the aliens hungry for victory at bay Mike went over to Lockett. \"Hit in the leg, Gunny,\" the Corporal reported through gritted teeth. \"Sorry about that.\" \"Not your fault,\" Mike countered, ripping open the leg of the wounded man's combat pants. Examining the wound he reported, \"Looks like the round went clean through.\" He then took a field dressing, ripped it in half to dress the wound then the other part he tied tight above the wound. \"I can still move,\" Lockett declared. \"I can still fight. Help me up.\" An alien round skipped off the pavement and clipped Mike on the cheek. His hand went up automatically and came back with blood on it. Great , he thought , another scar. Michele's going to love that…oh Michele… he had to push the thought of the woman he may never see again out of his mind because the aliens were massing. \"Marines, we are leaving!\" Mike shouted above the increasing fire. \"Harris, cut us a path.\" The bespectacled Marine and his partner concentrated their fire on an avenue of shipping containers and burned through a belt of ammunition risking overheating the barrel of the gun. Seeing the impact Mike yelled, \"Let's go,\" and led the way down the path stepping over the bodies of dead aliens. The others followed suit, firing in all directions as they went. Even Lockett kept pace through a combination of determination, fear and adrenaline. The Marines were able to break out of the alien cordon around them which allowed for some maneuvering. Rather then go the direction they'd been on Mike made a series of right and left turns to try to throw off the pursuit. Though he'd studied the map and aerial photos of the island knowing it inside and out things had been so chaotic he'd lost sense of direction so just went where he felt. He could see an open area to their front and continued to push on. Coming into the open he thought he could see a shimmer of light emanating upwards from what looked like a shipping container but on closer examination was not but in fact some sort of machine. \"Gunny, it's the shield. Let's…\" Private Jackson, the number 2 on the GPMG called out but his statement was cut short. Three rounds from an alien machine gun caught the Private in the chest ripping him apart. They'd found the shield generator. A platoon of aliens moved into position between the Marines and the objective opening fire and forcing the team back. Helping Harris drag the dead body of Pte. Jackson, Mike wondered how they would ever be able to reach it.[Chapter 49] Chapter 49 – Sacrifices South LA Wetland Park, Florence, Los Angeles Major-General McConville entered the hastily set up forward headquarters of the 1st Armored Brigade Task Force. Wiping sweat from his brow he looked around the somber room noticing the lack of fire in the command area despite the sense of urgency with regards to their mission. \"What's the news,\" he called out, getting people's attention. Brigadier-General Pete Cooper greeted the paratrooper. \"Nothing good. Still, glad you're here. What do you have with you?\" \"I've got as much of the division up as I can but we're stacked up going back a few klicks. I peeled off a few units to protect the flanks and also give some air cover but we're good to go.\" Seeing a lack of enthusiasm he ventured to comment, \"Seems like the Squids got you boys bottled up.\" \"Phew,\" Cooper snorted. \"That's not the half of it. We're bottled up and stacked up. We walked into a prepared defensive position best I can assess and they're lodged in tight with good internal lines. We're way past our deadline and no closer to getting to those poor sods at the bridge.\" \"Not much we can do about that Pete,\" McConville commented. \"We have a bigger danger of losing the whole damn war if we don't get unstuck. The Squids are massing on our front. If they punch through they can run all the way to our rear area. We need to turn the tables.\" \"Okay, so how do we do that?\" Cooper said deferentially but with a note of challenge in voice. The headquarters suddenly became still as those who'd been going through the motions of their jobs suddenly became interested in the conversation. McConville caught this shift so decided to lay it all out. \"We're corked up like a bottle here,\" the paratrooper observed as he looked at the tactical map with the current positions laid out. \"We have this narrow front here and are all massed up behind. We can't bring any force to bear because the Squids have us hemmed in. They have enfilading fire and so we're screwed.\" \"So you're saying we need to break out?\" Cooper asked cautiously. \"Exactly. We need to re-establish the initiative and bring more forward to bear.\" \"We've tried that,\" the armor officer countered. \"We can't get close enough with enough force to break through. The front's just not big enough to establish critical mass.\" \"We need a spear thrust here not a broom,\" McConville declared, looking his counterpart in the eye. \"We need a unit that'll unplug the cork. They push hard, break the line here,\" the paratrooper pointed to the spot which showed the centre of the line, \"then that allows the rest to flow through and fan out. If we can achieve this breakout we can turn the tables. Our units can then hit them in their rear and flanks.\" \"One unit?\" Cooper stated as a chill went over the gathered at the suggestion. \"One unit when five at a time has failed? It can't work.\" \"But you weren't able to bring the full five to bear,\" McConville answered patiently. \"The result was no one had maximum force or power. Everything was diluted and so failed. The Squids know that and that's why they pushed you into this box. But one unit, going full on and pedal to the metal could punch through. Once their line is broken it'll fall, I know it will.\" Cooper opened his mouth to rebut but instead thought of what his aggressive counterpart had suggested. He went to the tactical map and looked at the dispositions himself then mulled it over in his mind as the others watched. \"Okay, it sounds good and might even work, except...\" \"Except what?\" McConville asked, pleased the man had seen the benefit of his plan. \"Except the unit that leads this is going to face the full weight of alien fire. They'd be annihilated. I'm not even certain we can bring more then one unit to bear at a time so they'd have no support with no guarantee of success. The aliens have the whole area zeroed; they've set up a kill zone there. We could be wasting good troops needlessly,\" Cooper declared. \"We need to break out and we need to do it fast. We sit here much longer not only will they keep picking us off but they'll be able to close a vise on us. We'll be ground up, \" McConville stated frankly. \"Awfully risky.\" \"For sure, but we don't have a lot of choice.\" \"So are you going to order one of your units to go on this suicide mission because I know I sure can't,\" Cooper declared. \"No, we can't do that,\" McConville agreed. \"But we can ask for volunteers.\" Cooper snorted but said nothing. \"All of you radio operators,\" General McConville called out to the headquarters staff. \"I want an O Group with all available Brigade and Battalion commanders right now. No excuses. Call it in and get me General Daily at the Area HQ.\" Surprisingly, the required officers assembled within the hour. Perhaps it was curiosity or a growing sense of urgency but they all came quickly. General McConville had a long conversation with General Daily who affirmed the plan. \"Listen up,\" the commander of the 101st yelled, getting the attention of the unit commanders assembled. \"We have a situation here. We're jammed up and need to break out. The Marines holding the bridge need our help and we need to break out before the Squids get their reinforcements but we can't deploy the bulk of our troops. That makes us sitting ducks and they're picking us off one unit at a time.\" The paratrooper paused to take a breath. So far he'd stated the obvious but wanted to be sure everyone was on the same page. \"So, we're planning a breakout. We will concentrate our forces at this point here,\" he pointed to a location on the tactical map he stood beside, \"breaking their line and allowing the main body to bust out and re-establish momentum.\" \"That's an awfully narrow front, General,\" an armored Colonel commented. \"Plus the run up to it will allow the enemy to enfilade fire. How many units are you planning to deploy on the lead assault?\" \"Just one,\" McConville replied. The room fell silent and the assembled officers began to avoid eye contact with the commander knowing what was coming. The leader of the 101st looked around and felt the weight of what he was about to ask. \"With that in mind, I'm asking for one battalion or regiment to lead the assault.\" There was an awkward pause. \"75th Cavalry will do it General,\" a voice piped up from the middle of the assembled officers without hesitation. \"You sure about this Steve?\" General McConville asked the officer from the 2nd Brigade Combat team of the 101st. \"You guys are a reconnaissance unit.\" \"The Widow Makers can do the job sir,\" the officer responded confidently. \"We move fast and can hit them hard. As long as we have armor support coming up behind us we'll get you your gap in the line.\" \"What do you think Pete?\" McConville asked the leader of the 1st Armored group. Before their commander could answer a new voice entered the conversation. \"35th Armor will back them up Sir. We'll take that gap and blow the Squids to hell.\" In an instant the air of defeat that had hung like a blanket in the building was lifted, replaced with a grim determination to get the job done. All there knew the stakes and didn't need a pep talk. \"Outstanding!\" General McConville declared, happy for the volunteers. \"We'll get the order of advance to you within the hour and we move in two. You two,\" he said to the volunteers, \"wait for me and I'll brief you further. The rest of you, we need to get this done. There'll be no stopping this time. I believe not only the fate of LA is in our hands but that of America. Dismissed.\" After the assembly had broken up and the officers began to return to their units the Major General spoke to the assembled leaders from the airborne and armored units. \"The Air Force should be able to keep the Squid Wedge Ships off of you but you'll need to push fast and hard,\" he confirmed. \"Ignore fire and concentrate on the end of their line. When you punch through the rest will surge forward. We'll have armored dozers and recovery vehicles in with you and also after the lead echelon to ensure the way is clear. Questions?\" There were none other then if they could do it or not but that would be answered once the assault began. People we need to do this or we're all going to die here and everyone else behind us,\" McConville finished. \"Let's get it done. God speed.\" Two hours later the Stryker combat vehicles and Humvees of the 75th Cavalry Squadron roared forward. At the moment the lead elements moved out of sight the alien line erupted in fire. Abandoned industrial complex, somewhere outside Military Command Los Angeles Protective Zone, LA At Maria Rincon's order Javier moved forward while two of the men with him pushed out to either side. The sneering Mexican woman sauntered over to where Hector sat wide-eyed, a wicked grin on her face. Gwen Langois drew her pistol and barked out, \"Police! Don't do this. Give it up!\" A shot rang out of the dark in response, then another from the same area. The Military Police officer rolled aside just in time as the bullets struck the post she'd been standing behind. Coming out of her roll she squeezed off two rounds in the direction of the first shot. There was a groan and thud as one of the attackers fell to the ground. Father Alexander leapt out of the way as one of Javier's accomplices leveled a Glock 9mm pistol at him. The priest hid behind a stand-up metal tool chest and began to pray fervently. Raul made a run for Maria, hoping to grab the woman and use her for leverage. He only made it half way before another one of the devious woman's accomplices came out of a corner and shot the man in the hip. As he fell to the ground a tattooed teenager with a 2x4 smashed him across the back. The Mexican went down in a heap. Langois and two of the gunmen traded shots but neither could get the advantage. The two though kept her pinned down as others moved to cut her off. Father Alexander saw this from his vantage point. \"Lieutenant, look out!\" he shouted. \"They're trying to flank you!\" Next he saw only stars as someone struck him hard on the back of the head. Regaining his senses he saw a bald-headed thug standing over him with the same teenager who had beaten down Raul. \"Sorry to have to do that Father,\" the grinning thug said, making the sign of the cross. \"Now stand up and keep your hands on your head or I'll have more to share in confession.\" Father Alexander stood up slowly to face the pair. The man with the gun slammed him face first down onto a work bench, keeping his gun at the priest's head. Father Alexander wondered if he was going to die. He thought it a bit ironic considering the times he should have serving in combat and now to die here and like this. He was prepared to meet God, in some ways looked forward to it and a life of peace in heaven. But not yet. There was still Hector. No, he wasn't ready to give up. Gwen Langois knew she only had half a mag left. She also knew how long it would take her to reload. She'd dropped one gunman for sure and suspected she'd hit another which left Javier and one or two more. Not good odds , she thought. They were at a bit of a standoff with neither side wanting to show themselves. \"Come on girlie, let's party,\" one of the gunmen taunted her. \"You show me yours and I'll show you mine,\" she shot back, eyes racing to find where everyone was. She thought she saw a shadow move to her left but couldn't be sure. Not enough cover and too much area to cover. Damn …, she thought to herself. It' s only a matter of time. \"Stop screwing around and finish them,\" Maria Rincon ordered from the other side of the room yet making no move to join the standoff. The shadow Gwen Langois had feared turned into a real threat as Javier emerged carrying a pistol. He had her dead in his sights. An explosion rocked the factory building blowing out dozens of windows including three in the large room the standoff was happening. A stray alien Wedge Ship flying over the area and seeing some movement on the ground had let loose a burst from its Direct Energy Weapon. Shouting could be heard outside as people panicked and tried to flee the unexpected attack. In the confused moment Father Alexander took the opportunity. Spinning away from the gun pointed at his head he rotated right throwing a solid punch that connected with the jaw of the man holding the gun. A crack could be heard as bone broke. The man yelped then dropped his gun to cover his face. The tattooed teen tried to bash the priest in the head with his 2x4 but Father Alexander nimbly ducked below the whistling club, sidestepped and hit the skinny youth first in the stomach then in the face. Nose bleeding the teen went down. \"Father forgive me,\" he prayed quietly as he kicked the gun away and went for Hector. Two of the gunmen fled at the sight of the alien ship, leaving only Javier. The Latino ducked low and came charging up behind the spot Gwen Langois had been hiding behind. He fired two rounds into an empty space. \"You looking for something, cher,\" the Cajun drawled, coming out from the opposite side. \"What? How?\" Javier blustered. \"I moved you idiot. Never stay in one spot too long,\" she declared, pistol at her side. \"Your move.\" Javier thought he had a shot. Dropping to one knee and bringing his gun up with snake-like reflexes he squeezed but Gwen Langois' military issue pistol spoke first drilling him in the forehead. His gun went off into the ceiling as the man fell to the factory floor dead. Father Alexander was eight feet away from Hector when Maria Rincon raised a hidden pistol causing him to stop dead in his tracks. \"Don't do this Maria, it's not worth it,\" the priest pleaded. \"Oh but it is. Soon we will leave this place and no one will see Hector again,\" she cackled. Then with a crazed look in her eyes she squeezed the trigger. \"No!\" Father Alexander screamed, spasiming backwards in anticipation. Instead of being hit a figure leapt across the ray of light from the broken window getting struck by the bullet with the priest's name on it. Another shot rang out from the side and Maria Rincon slumped to the ground with a stunned look on her face. Gwen Langois kept her gun pointed at Maria's still figure until she could collect the woman's gun then went to the crumpled person who had taken the bullet meant for Father Alexander. It was Raul. \"What? Why? Why would you do that?\" the Military Police officer asked the dying man. Father Alexander was at his side instantly, cradling Raul's head. \"Couldn't let the priest take the bullet….wasn't right…needed to make up for so many sins….for letting down my grandmother…my friend,\" Raul's voice started to fade as he went pale. \"Will you pray for me Father?\" Gwen began to cry as she dropped to her knee and took the man's hand in hers. \"Your friend and your grandmother would be proud of you,\" the tough Police officer declared softly. Raul Santos smiled and closed his eyes. The strained look on his face relaxed and he seemed finally to be at peace. The demons that'd been dogging him for so long had been chased away by the truth of what lay deep within the man: character. Father Alexander, face stained with tears himself, took a small bottle of Holy Water out of his pocket and said, \"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, I ask that you receive this child into your arms….\" Somewhere on Terminal Island Ducking alien fire the remaining members of the team hunkered down a distance away to assess the situation. \"We need to bug out then find another way,\" Imlay declared urgently. The usually unflappable Corporal squeezed off a burst at an infantry caste alien who tried to break their defensive position. \"Those Squids at the generator will run us over.\" \"They seem to be content to hold their position and block us in,\" Mike commented after a quick assessment of their situation. \"We've given the others in this sector a good run so they seem pretty spread out. If we pull back that'll give them a chance to consolidate and then we'll have no chance.\" \"So what do we do Gunny?\" Lockett asked through gritted teeth. \"We're with you whatever you decide.\" \"We need a distraction,\" Mike yelled above the cacophony of fire, \"to draw them away so we can get a shot. Harris, base of fire here. Lockett, Imlay, we'll cover you as you move then you open up and pull the Squids left. Santos, you go with them too but have that code book ready to get us some air support once we blow this sucker.\" \"You got it Gunny,\" she replied grimly, tapping the bulge in her breast pocket. \"Good. That should do the trick,\" Mike confirmed. \"I'll cover Ortega and we'll go right with the SRAW. We'll only get one shot so we need to stay focused. Rally point is here. Go.\" Harris opened fire with the M240B, pushing back the infantry caste aliens who'd been creeping forward with a wall of lead while the others began to move into position. He was the pivot, allowing the others the chance to slide left and right. With Anderson dead the bespectacled Corporal was alone so suddenly felt vulnerable. Coolly firing in short burst he traversed back and forth to keep the attackers at bay. He thought of Cherise and wondered if he'd ever see her again. Not likely , he conceded. He thought back to the previous year when they'd been weeks away from getting married and then all this. Stavros's face came to mind. His best man and best friend, killed on the bridge helping to protect the others. Would he be remembered or fade away? Cherise would remember. He thought about their time together when he recovered from his wounds, thankful for the extra time they'd had together. He'd dodged death once so didn't like his odds. He hoped Cherise would mourn him for a while but then find someone else. She deserved that after everything he'd put her through. No, he was prepared to make the sacrifice for his teammates but he wasn't going to go down easily. Yelling at the aliens he continued to hold the line. Mike and Ortega dodged fire and skipped to their right. Mike fired as he went, moving to the spot he prayed would give them a clear shot. Ortega followed behind covering the flanks with the Predator SRAW bouncing up and down on his back as he ran. The pair rounded the corner of a rust red shipping container which blocked them momentarily from the aliens who'd been trying to pick them off. Mike slide into position peering around the corner. While a few aliens trailed after them the bulk of those guarding the shield generator seemed to be occupied with the fire of the three that had gone left. Imlay and Lockett lobbed grenades causing the aliens to duck giving them a window of opportunity. \"Here's our chance Ortega,\" Mike rasped. \"Make it count.\" In one smooth motion the Latino Private knelt down and brought the fire-and-forget missile launcher up to his shoulder. At this range he didn't wait for the required three seconds to ensure a lock on the target. As soon as he had the generator in his reticule he pulled the trigger. With a whoosh the rocket exploded out of the launcher and blazed to the target. It was right on the money. Mike couldn't believe their luck. They'd actually done it. Not only had they found the thing but they were going to destroy it. He almost smiled. Then he watched the rocket bounce off the structure as if it had some shield of its own around it. The Predator hit the ground and exploded, shredding a half dozen aliens who'd been covering it and wounding a dozen more but the structure itself was intact. Mike couldn't believe what he'd just witnessed. He could feel his heart beating faster with the realization of what had just happened. They'd found it despite the odds, he'd lost two men in the process and still it stood. \"Fall back to the rally point!\" he screamed. The trio on the left had been engaged in a severe firefight with the bulk of the force guarding the shield generator but had held their own. Hearing the call to rally Imlay let loose a grenade from his M203 which bought them the opportunity to disengage. \"Come on guys, let's fall back,\" he called out. Lockett began to move but Santos didn't. She continued to kneel at the side of a shipping container. Thinking she hadn't heard Imlay moved over and patted her on the shoulder. The Air Force Tech Sergeant fell forward and rolled onto her back. An ugly wound bled dark red down at her waist. The woman's eyes fluttered open and she moaned. \"Santos!\" Imlay cried in shock. \"Lockett, cover us. Santos is hit!\" With the African American Marine covering them Imlay grabbed the wounded woman and hauled her back to the rally point. Ortega and Harris covered them while Lockett, Imlay and Mike worked on Santos. \"Ai,\" she grunted. \"Damn that stings.\" The wound was stopped and bound with field dressings but it was obvious the woman was in bad shape. Mike looked around to see what was happening. The aliens at the generator were down to less then one-third strength but a larger force was gathering just outside their range and preparing to move in. Once that happened they wouldn't be able to hold their position. They'd be forced to pull out or be annihilated. But what to do? The rocket had not done any damage so they needed a bigger explosion. \"Ortega, how much C4 you got left?\" Mike asked the kneeling Marine. \"Enough to make a half block crater, Gunny,\" the man replied, dropping a probing alien with a precise shot. \"'cept we got no detonators. Rapetti had them and they went down with him.\" Mike swore. They had the TNT but no way to set it off. No way except…. The thought chilled him. Someone would have to do it. Someone would have to set off the charge right beside it. He left the others to assess the lay of the land around the generator and found the shortest point. If done right away, before the Squids could counterattack, it could be done. But who would set off the charge? \"Tighten up people,\" Mike ordered. The group shifted in so they could hear but continue to engage the enemy as needed. \"We have one last shot at this. We're going to push over to that group of containers there,\" he pointed, \"rush the position with a quick assault, set a C4 charge and blow the generator.\" \"But Gunny, we got no detonators,\" Ortega pointed out. \"Who's going to set off the charge?\" he asked, causing the others to start at the realization of what needed to be done. \"I'll be doing it,\" Mike answered quietly, thinking of the picture of Michele and him in his helmet. You'll cover me then fall back. Once you're clear of the blast zone I'll set it off with a grenade.\" \"No, I'll be the one to do it,\" a soft Latino voice countered. \"Santos, you can't,\" Mike implored the woman who had just volunteered to take his place. \"I can't let you do that.\" \"I'm done anyway Gunny,\" she said matter of factly. \"I'm not getting off this island and would only slow the rest of you down. You go and marry that pretty woman from the helicopter.\" \"What?\" Mike said, stunned at the comment. \"Come on, it's obvious the two of you got something going. Go and live a bit,\" she smiled faintly. \"Here, take the code book. Call it in when I do it.\" Mike looked at her for a moment, saw the determination in her eyes and knew it was pointless to argue. She had given him a gift and he wouldn't ruin it by arguing the point. \"Okay, everyone reload,\" he ordered, eyes fixed on the petite woman, trying to keep his voice even. \"Fresh mags, grenades at the ready.\" He helped Santos to her feet. \"All right…GO!\" The group stayed tight and sprinted to the location that would be the jump off point for the final assault a wall of lead flying out 180 degrees. The ferocity of the fire set the remaining aliens on their heels giving them the moment they needed. Harris, Imlay, Lockett and Ortega stopped at the designated point and poured on the fire while Mike helped Santos, now carrying the satchel of C4 explosives towards the shield generator. A few aliens tried to stop them but the precision fire from the other Marines kept them at bay. In a matter of seconds that seemed like hours the pair made it to the base of the shield generator. Santos slumped down, exhausted from the exertion. Mike knelt down and engaged a couple of pressing infantry caste aliens to give her the time she needed to set up. The Air Force Tech Sergeant pulled the satchel over to her front and then fished a grenade out of her pocket. \"Ready Gunny. Get out of here.\" \"Santos, I….,\" Mike stammered, not willing to leave the woman. Go Mike, go!\" Santos screamed as aliens began to surge around the generator perhaps figuring out what the human's plan was. Mike let loose a burst from his M4A1 and ran back to the others who were desperately trying to hold the surging aliens at bay. A machine gun round hit him in the shoulder causing him to stumble but he continued to run back towards the others. Reaching them the foursome did a fighting withdrawal, trying to support Santos while also moving out of the blast zone. Santos saw them leave and the aliens massing. She emptied the clip of her M16 then pulled the pin of the grenade. Dropping her rifle she crossed herself and said quietly, \"Father into your hands I commit my spirit…\" The grenade erupted igniting the satchel of C4 explosives. With a roar a fireball erupted that could be seen all the way to the Vincent Thomas Bridge and beyond. Sacrifices, some that would become famous in the days ahead, another that wouldn't, but all worthy of remembering. All were based on love, love for the cause and for their fellow man. In a world where the title 'hero' is thrown around loosely, a military unit, and two members of the Santos family, one a criminal wanting to change his legacy and another a Sergeant showed the world what heroism truly is. One would be remembered only by a few, the other by millions but both sacrifices were worthy of renown. In a wise and ancient book are found these words: Greater love has no one then this-that he would lay down his life for a friend.[Chapter 50] Chapter 50 - Fresh wind, fresh fire Somewhere on Terminal Island The terrific explosion knocked the remaining members of the team to the ground despite their distance. Intense heat from a shock wave pinned them down for a moment as debris rained down. \"Come on Gunny, we got to get out of here,\" Imlay urged, pulling him to his feet. \"No, we need to be sure,\" Mike countered, throwing off the Corporal's arm despite the intense ringing in his eyes. \"Come on,\" he croaked to the others, throat parched, \"we need eyes on to see if the generators have been destroyed.\" The remaining team members moved cautiously back to where the shield generator had been but for the moment there seemed to be no aliens around. Small fires burned around the dock area and as they moved into view of the where the distinctive machine had been a large black crater was dug out of the concrete. Shredded bodies of aliens littered the ground and none seemed to be standing. Mike looked for the generator but it was nowhere to be found. He looked up and for the first time noticed the shimmer that had masked the sky was gone. Instead glorious sunshine bathed the area. Santos had done it! Their respite was short lived. Alien machine gun and grenade fire erupted all around them as infantry caste squads angrily moved in to destroy those who had eliminated their shield. Mike desperately looked around for a place to hold us in the face of the onslaught. \"Fall back over there!\" he pointed to a defensible spot. \"Diamond formation. We need to move or we won't make it.\" Firing and moving the five remaining Marines sprinted to the refuge and took up a defensive posture. Everywhere they looked aliens were aggressively trying to push into their position. \"We're cut off Gunny!\" Imlay shouted, firing his M4A1 in all directions. \"What are we going to do?\" \"Hold on until help arrives!\" Mike ordered. Retrieving Santos' code book he turned his radio on. There was no need for stealth anymore, every alien on the island knew where they were and seemed to be bearing down on them. Flipping through the book he switched to a direct link to the Air Force tactical network directed on the page, bypassing the area headquarters. \"Raven Main this is Joker Three. Requesting Ground Support Mission Hotel-Three-Three authorization Delta Sierra-One-One-Niner at these grid co-ordinates….\" Vincent Thomas Bridge, Terminal Island, LA The aliens had been pressing both sides of the bridge hard again, trying to squeeze the Marines in a vice-like attack. The 2-5 had been holding thus far but could feel the line buckling under the pressure. Captain Harvel had been moving his troops around expertly but his options were becoming more limited. LCol Ritchie had been in contact with the forces at the other bridge and theirs was the same story. Casualties were mounting and ammo was getting low. He was proud of his Marines. They'd taken the bridges and held them longer then they were supposed to. Though his optimism had faded he was at peace knowing they'd done everything they could. A group of aliens surged though a hole in the defenses along the landward side of the bridge following upon on a grenade salvo. \"Plug the gap!\" Ritchie ordered. Grabbing two Marines he ran over to the spot and tried to stem the tide. Then an explosion on the island lit up the dusk sky. Everyone paused for a moment, alien and man alike, at the unexpected event. Then someone looked up and yelled, \"The shield's gone!\" Ritchie could see the aliens hesitate at this apparent development. He fired a burst from his service rifle dropping an alien who'd paused then looked up to see the shimmer that had been above them gone. The generator had to be down. Reacting swiftly Ritchie encouraged the beleaguered company to push back. Then he grabbed his radio operator and ordered, \"Call this in and get us some air support!\" The aliens started to pull back in disarray at the new development and renewed aggressiveness of the Marines so he took a moment to take a long look at the glorious clear sky, allowing the sun to warm his face. Thank you Nantz he thought to himself. Area Headquarters, LA Theatre of Operations \"The shields down!\" an operator shouted jubilantly. General Daily called out hopefully despite his surprise, \"Confirm. Have Air Force standing by.\" The junior officer checked her computer then spoke to a colleague flying high above in an AWAC. \"Yes sir. The shield is down.\" A cheer went up in the operations center while General Daily pumped his fist in the air. \"Yes!\" the commanding officer celebrated. All right. I want all available air assets in to support the push on the line. Have two squadrons converge from the rear and another to provide cover from any Squid Wedge Ships.\" The place came alive with renewed vigor. \"Are you sure that's wise sir?\" Colonel Weeks asked openly. Daily was shaken from his elation. \"What do you mean by that?\" he asked a bit confused at the somber tone of his S3. \"I think we should be careful sir,\" the operations officer cautioned. \"This could be a trap by the aliens to get us to commit our reserves. If that thing comes back up we're cooked.\" You could feel the air starting to leak out of the balloon of optimism in the headquarters. \"I agree with Colonel Weeks, sir,\" added General Grayback. \"This could be a trick. I would advise we hold off until a more thorough investigation can be initiated. We need to be sure.\" \"Wait while our guys on the line get chewed up?\" Daily countered in frustration. \"What do you think Captain Blatchford?\" The reporter turned officer snorted. \"I think we've been too cautious all along. We don't have the time nor can we afford to hesitate. But if some have a concern why not just contact the Marines holding the bridge, they can confirm.\" Grayback glared at the upstart Reservist but couldn't argue with the logic of the suggestion. General Daily scanned his assembled leadership team and sighed. \"Do it. Contact Lieutenant Colonel Ritchie at Terminal Island.\" It only took a moment for the call to be made. With the sound of small arms fire in the background the commander of the LA theatre sought the information he needed. \"Ken it seems the shield is down. Can you confirm this?\" General Daily asked LCol Ritchie. \"Yes sir, it's down here too,\" he confirmed as a nearby explosion cut him off. \"We're hard pressed and low on ammo. We've been trying to get air support but none is being released. What's the hold up?\" Daily looked angrily at his Operations Group. \"We need to be sure it's down and not a trap. Can you confirm for certain it's down?\" \"Well, it's not up now. There was an explosion on the island and the thing dropped. It's gone. I can assure you of that.\" Ritchie answered a bit testily. \"But have you been able to get confirmation from the team on the ground that they took it out?\" General Grayback cut in. \"No sir, we haven't. With the size of the blast I don't think the team made it,\" Ritchie retorted, a hint of emotion in his voice. \"Trust me, its down. Send us help. We can't hold much longer.\" \"Wait one,\" Daily ordered the Marine officer. He looked at his staff. \"Too risky sir. I smell a trap,\" Col. Weeks declared. \"I agree with him. The risk is too great,\" General Grayback confirmed. \"Clock's ticking sir. We need to move. Now,\" Captain Blatchford stated. General Daily felt the weight of the decision. Things seemed good but if it was a trap they'd be left with nothing. Still, he felt he needed to trust those who were on the line. And what choice did they really have? It was time for bold decisions not just on the front but in the relative safety of the rear also. He got back on the radio. \"Hang tight Ken. Help is on the way.\" He then turned to his Air Force Liaison Officer. \"Release all reserves. I want maximum support and resupply at Terminal Island and a full attack at the front.\" If that didn't shock his more timid officers the next one did. \"And get the command helicopter prepped for take off. I'm going mobile and the ops group is coming with me. Care to join us Captain Blatchford?\" \"I thought you'd never ask,\" the diminutive woman responded happily. Abandoned industrial complex, somewhere outside Military Command Los Angeles Protective Zone, LA The alien Wedge Ship was chased off by a pair of Air Force F16's so the inhabitants of The Foundry began to come out of hiding and assess what had happened. A number had heard the gun battle in the storage area Maria Rincon had controlled so came to investigate. Gwen Langois, still smarting from the sacrificial death of Raul saw several men come into the room to find out what was going on. The Military Police officer sprang to her feet, service pistol leveled. \"Come on, make a move,\" she yelled. \"Hey lady,\" not our problem,\" one responded, raising his hands to show he wasn't a threat. \"You do what you got to do.\" The curious left the room rather then face the wrath of the Cajun woman. Hector, wide-eyed and shocked at what he'd witnessed, finally was able to unglue himself from the mattress he'd been sitting on during the engagement. The boy sprang to his feet and ran towards Father Alexander who had just finished performing the Last Rites on Raul. \"I'll be back to make sure you have a proper burial,\" the priest promised. He turned just in time to keep from being bowled over by the boy. \"Father Alexander! Father Alexander!\" Hector cried. \"You came to rescue me.\" \"Yes we did. You're safe now,\" the priest confirmed. \"How did you find me?\" \"Raul brought us to you,\" Father Alexander answered quietly. \"But…but he was a bad man. My Aunt Maria had me do things for him,\" Hector declared. \"Why would he help you to rescue me? Why did he throw himself in front of my Aunt?\" \"He wanted to change,\" the priest stated. \"No, he had changed. His act was very brave, an example of sacrificial love.\" The answer seemed to satisfy the boy. Shifting thoughts Hector's face lift up, \"Is Gunny Nantz with you?\" \"No,\" Father Alexander frowned at the thought of where he was, \"he's fighting the aliens right now but I'm sure he's okay.\" \"Then what will happen with me?\" Hector asked, starting to put some pieces together. \"You'll stay with me until your friend returns,\" Gwen declared joining the conversation. \"Who's this?\" Hector asked, a bit overwhelmed by everything that had gone on. \"This is Lt. Gwen Langois. She's with the Military Police,\" Father Alexander introduced, pleased by the offer. \"Thank you,\" the boy said quietly. \"Thank you all for rescuing me. I'll never forget what all of you did for me.\" He went over and gave the tough police officer a hug. The praise from the boy warmed Gwen Langois' helping with the pain and guilt she felt at Raul's death. She returned the hug, soaking in the warm feeling but then reality came back in. \"Come on, we need to get out of here,\" she declared, knowing there was still risk in the lawless place. \"But I'll be back to get Raul's body and clean this place up.\" Terminal Island, LA At the Vincent Thomas Bridge the aliens vigorously resumed their attack at both ends, trying to crush the Marine defenses but their thrusts were sporadic and uncoordinated. The dropping of the overhead shield seemed to throw the alien command into a bit of disarray. Lt. Gordon was with his platoon holding the flank closest to the canal on the landward side. They'd taken casualties but were able to hold their position. He heard the sky rip and several miles out saw the growing dots of streaking jets heading towards the island. \"Look!\" Gordon called out, \"air support inbound.\" The Marines cheered but the volume died down as the jets headed past them towards the southern part of the island. What the h eck, he thought but then it occurred to him, someone from Nantz's team must still be alive and called in air support. The opportunity to ponder was short lived. \"Squid Wedges!\" a Marine warned as four alien hovercrafts flew in to attack from the city. The Marines in the defensive position braced for the onslaught but before the alien ships could open fire with their Direct Energy Weapons the lead craft then the others in quick succession exploded. Coming from high and out of the sun Air Force F16 Fighting Falcons streaked in wiggling their wings in salute to the now cheering defenders of the bridge. At the company headquarters, LCol Ritchie and Captain Harvel joined in the celebration until their radio operator called the pair over. \"Sir, we got an inbound transmission for you,\" the Corporal reported. \"This is Viper Lead,\" a southern voice drawled over the radio from the overflying F16's. \"We'll be on station to watch you boys until your reinforcements arrive. Hang tough, it should only be another couple of hours. In the meantime, we've got something that should help tide you over.\" The distinctive drone of turboprop engines grew in intensity until flying low and towards the bridge a flight of four-engine C-130 Hercules cargo planes came into view. The rear ramped lowered as they flew over the 2-5's position and the loadmasters on the ramp pushed bundles of supplies out the back. Their placement was perfect and as the parachute attached skids fell they landed in the center of the Marine position. \"Snug as bugs in a rug,\" Ritchie commented to Captain Harvel and the Marines eagerly unpacked crates of ammo and other supplies. \"Now if only Nantz and his team can make it out.\" At that moment Mike and the remnant of his team were fighting for their lives. Ammunition was low and the aliens had aggressively pushed them into a tight defensive circle. Ortega had been hit in the hip but still held his position. Lockett was weakened from a loss of blood and Mike felt the shoulder wound he'd taken earlier. But none relented, picking their shots wisely and keeping the alien attackers at bay. Then everything changed. The radio Mike now carried came to life with a message of hope. \"Joker Three this is Raven Two-Seven, we are inbound and ready to engage.\" Mike started to laugh, he couldn't help himself. The pressure of the past day overwhelmed him. \"Good to hear you Two-Seven. We'd appreciate the support. Bring the heat, danger close.\" \"Our pleasure. Thanks for dropping the shield. We have your position locked. Pop red smoke on your location and keep your heads down in about one Mike. We're coming in hot, danger close.\" \"Imlay, pop smoke, we got friendlies coming in. One minute. The cavalry's here!\" F15E Strike Eagles came screaming in, their Vulcan Gatling Cannons blazing. The 6-barrelled guns spit death to the surging aliens caught in the open. The invaders broke and ran as another flight swooped in nailing their fall back positions with AGM-65 Maverick missiles. The combination of cannon and rocket fire broke the back of the alien desire to punish the remaining Marines who'd destroyed their shield generator. Instead, they turned and ran. Just over an hour later Lt. Gordon saw a sight that caused him to turn away from his other men so they didn't see the emotion on his face. Gunnery Sergeant Nantz and the remainder of their team appeared out of a forest of shipping containers heading for their launch to cross the channel. Florence, Los Angeles The 75th Cavalry had made excellent progress, even more then Major-General McConville had expected but the cost had been high. Better then half of the unit was down but the Widow Makers had been relentless in their efforts to unstick the offensive. With the punch of 35th Armor's M1A1 tanks they'd engaged the alien line and broken through. Unfortunately, the aliens counterattacked, fighting viciously for every foot. Their casualties had been huge but still the invaders threw more to keep the line blocked. The human forces were tantalizingly close to the breakout they desperately needed. Units were in position ready to surge forward. But hope and good intention don't win battles. The aliens had better position and more resources which meant they could steadily grind the reconnaissance battalion to dust and begin to chip away at their armored support. It was a matter of simple math. Then the Air Force arrived and changed the equation. First F22 Raptors swooped in from the rear driving off the alien Wedge Ship cover. With the air clear it was time for the US Air Force to own the skies. Flights of F15E Strike Eagles screamed over the alien position dropping 500lb laser-guided bombs from their inventory then as they banked away slower moving A-10 Thunderbolts popped out of nowhere to pound the alien line with salvos of Hydra rockets then peppering the position with their 30mm Avenger Gatling Cannons. The alien line collapsed under the vicious assault. 75th Cavalry surged through, followed by 35th Armored and suddenly the road was clear for the rest of the two divisions to break out. Armored bulldozers and recovery vehicles moved in to clear the roads on the axis of advance as engines roared to life and crews loaded weapons. As this was going on a Blackhawk helicopter landed at the command area flanked by a pair of Apache Gunships. To the surprise of the paratroopers protecting the headquarters General Daily hopped out followed by his hesitant senior staff. Explosions could be heard a short distance away mixed with the staccato sound of small arm fire causing several to duck involuntarily. Word was relay to Major-General McConville who came outside to see what he couldn't believe. \"Ron, what the hell are you doing here?\" the commander of the 101st Airborne asked incredulously. \"I wanted to see what was going on Jim,\" Daily replied a bit sheepishly. \"I don't want to get in the way but I needed to see what was happening.\" \"Oaky,\" the paratrooper responded, impressed anew by the area commander. \"Your timing is perfect. The Air Force support you sent us did the job. We just popped the squid line and in about five minutes the wrath of God is going to descend on those bastards.\" \"What do you have going on to support the 2-5 at the bridges?\" \"I got a Stryker Battalion from the 35th ready to go balls to the wall and get there. If you can rustle up some air support to pave the way they can likely be there in maybe two hours.\" That was the best news the commanding officer had heard since hearing the shield was down. \"Major Temperman,\" he yelled to the Air Force liaison officer with them, \"give them whatever they need. This is a priority mission.\" \"How is 75th Cavalry holding out?\" Daily asked, afraid of what he'd hear. \"They got the crap knocked out of them but they gave more then they got back and are still standing. I'm about to pull them back,\" McConville answered. \"We owe those boys a lot.\" Daily breathed a sigh of relief. \"You're right. Whatever they need, they get.\" General McConville's operations officer interrupted the conversation. \"Sir, we're good to go.\" \"All right then, release the dogs,\" the paratrooper answered enthusiastically. Then looking from the General to his helicopters he got a grin on his face. \"Hey Ron, want to watch the battle?' Daily laughed like he hadn't in weeks. \"You're crazy Jim.\" Then pounding his friend on the shoulder replied, \"Let's do it.\" The view from the sky was impressive. With the alien line breached armored units backed up by paratroopers surged through and began to roll the alien line up. It was like a house of cards once it began to fall. Within an hour the whole alien position had collapsed and they were in a full bore retreat.[Chapter 51] Chapter 51- Dawn of a new day Florence, Los Angeles With the alien line breached and the US Air Force owning the sky things began to change rapidly for the human forces intent on recapturing Los Angeles. When the full weight of the 1st Armored Division echelon could be deployed after breaking out the aliens could not stand the ferocity of the assault against their positions. Their tactic had been to hold the humans in check along carefully sighted lines but once that had been broken they had no secondary positions. Instead of a tactical withdrawal to a better position the arrogant invaders threw their infantry caste reserves supported by Walking Gun in to try to stem the human armored flow but it was too late. Units of the 101st Airborne had been mixed in with the tank squadrons providing close-in support adding to their already significant firepower. The aggressive paratroopers swarmed over the aliens like locusts. The invaders had only one option: turn and run. High above the battle General Daily and General McConville watched the action unfold protected by a trio of Apache Gunships. The escort though seemed unnecessary since the Air Force F16s and F22s had knocked most of the Wedge Ships out of the sky and remaining ones had scattered. \"Okay, Squids are on the run, what next?\" McConville asked the theatre commander. \"We don't let them consolidate. No holding back, we go all the way until we break them,\" Daily answered firmly. \"I also want the bridges at Terminal Island relieved as quick as possible.\" \"Already happening,\" the airborne commander confirmed. \"I sent close air support and they've been resupplied. The Strykers should be there in a few hours.\" \"Okay, when they get there they hold until light. I do want units moving through the night and everyone in position to take the island at dawn,\" Daily ordered. \"That'll be cutting it close. The boys are tired,\" McConville answered cautiously. \"I know that be we can't let the squids regroup. We've got them on the run,\" the Marine officer declared pounding his fist for emphasis. \"No let's grind them up. Mostly though I'm thinking about the next phase.\" The squid reinforcements coming?\" \"Yes,\" Daily confirmed. \"We need as much time as we can get to get ready for them. Captain Blatchford, get in touch with Washington and give them a Sit Rep. Let them know we'll be ready to receive what we've been talking about.\" Terminal Island, LA \"Covering fire!\" Lt. Gordon yelled, as others saw the exhausted Marines trying to cross the channel. Mike and the remainder of the team scrambled as best they could down the ladder but progress was slow due to the variety of wounds they carried. A group of aliens appeared to try to stop their crossing. The Marine line on the opposite shore opened up with everything they had driving the infantry caste aliens back into the forest of shipping containers on the edge of the channel. A few alien grenades were half-heartedly launched at the retiring team but none got close. The returning Marines loaded in as Private Ortega fired up the engine on the boat they'd left and with white water churning behind them they began to cross back over to the relative safety of the human position. For their part, the 2-5 contingent at the Vincent Thomas Bridge maintained a steady rate of fire to keep the aliens at bay while cheering their comrades on. Reaching land Mike and the others were encouraged on by their comrades to make the dash to safety. One hundred yards from the defensive position Lockett finally collapsed from exhaustion and loss of blood. The team stopped and surrounded him but none had the strength or energy to help their fallen comrade. Instead, a dozen Marines leapt over the barricades and sprinted to help the man. Strong hands lifted Lockett gently up carrying him back while the remainder assisted the rest of the team and covered their return. LCol Ritchie and Captain Harvel were there to greet them along with several medics including Doc Adukwu despite his own wounds. \"Good to see you back Gunnery Sergeant,\" the battalion commander declared, pounding Mike on the back. \"Good to be back sir,\" Mike winced in pain. \"Well done Gunny,\" Captain Harvel congratulated the man. \"You saved our bacon.\" \"It wasn't just me sir,\" Mike reminded him, \"and we lost some damn good men and one fine woman in the process.\" The elation of the moment was checked by the reality of who hadn't made it back. \"Well, their sacrifice won't be forgotten. Neither will what you went through,\" LCol Ritchie commented. \"Get yourselves patched up and get some food. Rest up, you earned it. Relief's on the way so hang tough and we'll get you evac'ed out of here.\" Mike wandered blankly away, led by a corpsman. Then he saw Lt. Gordon. The handsome ex-track star had a mixed look of pain and relief. His brown eyes were glassy with emotion. The officer said nothing but came and embraced the Sergeant. Mike stiffened at first then relaxed, returning the embrace. \"You're no widow maker sir,\" Mike whispered in his ear, \"you're a damn good officer.\" \"Thanks Nantz, that means a lot…but the rest of your team…,\" Gordon choked out. \"Is on me sir,\" Mike replied steadily. \"Go get yourself patched up Gunny,\" Gordon declared regaining control over his emotions as the words sunk in. \"Aye aye sir,\" Mike responded, snapping off a crisp salute. The curse was lifted. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA Casualties had been dropping off for the hospital in the rear area as the military advance moved farther away giving the harried staff a respite. Michele had been busy the whole day which was a good thing. She'd tried to keep busy, to keep her mind off of what might be happening with Mike. She knew worrying wouldn't help and tried not to but couldn't help herself when there was time to spare. So work had become her refuge. Near exhaustion after the pace of casualties Michele knew she needed to go to her home for rest but the thought of it and the demons who'd haunt her thoughts brought a lack of action. Then she saw a sight that chased away the gloom. \"Father Alexander! Hector!\" Michele cried out as she spotted the pair walking towards her. The priest seemed a bit troubled but relaxed. Hector was dirty and appeared to have lost weight. She'd had insinuations from the priest something was up with the boy but didn't know the details. In truth, she didn't want to know with all her worries about Mike. But she'd thought about the idea Mike had shared with her of adopting the boy and had warmed to the idea so seeing him again and well filled her heart with a strange joy. It was as if she knew something terrible had nearly happened to Hector but couldn't articulate it. Hector broke free and ran to the woman, knocking into her with a massive hug which she returned. The boy held on fiercely and suddenly she knew this was not just a courtesy visit. Something had been going on. Suddenly she became fearful of what it meant. \"Is Mike alive?\" Michele asked fearfully. \"I don't know but I pray he is,\" the priest said quietly, his eyes glassy. \"But…,\" she said, her voice choking. \"We'll just have to trust God. Hector wanted to see you. He has been going through some difficulties lately.\" The priest's voice trailed off as the topic made the boy upset so he tactfully changed the course the subject. \"I did want to tell you though the attack on the front is going well. We've broken the alien defenses and have them on the run. The bridge Michael has been defending will be relieved shortly and I've been told they will be rotating those troops out first thing in the morning. I wanted you to know. Plus Hector wanted to see you.\" \"Will you let me know if you hear anything about him or at least when his unit is coming back?\" the woman asked both filled with hope and fear for the imminent event. She knew she wouldn't sleep tonight. \"Definitely. I'll also keep trying to get a report but it's hard since radio traffic is pretty full right now and that type of communication isn't allowed,\" the priest answered, optimistic his friend was alive but not wanting to give the fragile woman a false sense of hope. The answer satisfied Michele and she seemed to be at peace. \"Okay, we'll wait until morning.\" She paused for a moment, lost in thought. Then her face brightened. \"I believe,\" was all she said but the priest knew she had the same thoughts as him. Turning to Hector her heart warmed for the boy clinging to her side. She'd had her doubts about the adoption thing but suddenly the thought of losing Mike and everything she'd experienced the last few days brought a change in attitude. Not only was she ready for this but she wanted it. Michele knelt down, hugged the boy again and asked, \"So, what's been new with you?\" Instead of recoiling Hector spilled all that had been going on the last few weeks with him, almost as if the recollection had a purging effect. The story the young boy shared took nearly two hours giving Michele much to be distracted about. Abandoned industrial complex, somewhere outside Military Command Los Angeles Protective Zone, LA The Military Police swooped down on the Foundry in force. Armored Humvees rolled in securing a perimeter around the area while several transport trucks disgorged MP's and a large number of LAPD officers who had begun to work with them. As the Humvees ringing the site provided over watch with their 50 caliber machine guns the others swarmed through the buildings. Guns and drugs were seized, arrests were made. Warning were given to those wishing to live in this place outside the protection zone who did not seem to be involved in criminal activity but in the end those who wanted to stay were allowed. As the other MP's searched the various rooms of the Foundry Gwen Langois went back to search the location of her gun battle. Something didn't add up. Why would this woman Maria fight like that over a simple matter of custody? Even kidnapping wasn't worth killing a cop over. So why? A number of attendants from the Coroner's Office followed her in but she treated it as a crime scene. Before allowing them to begin removing bodies she knelt down besides Raul's still form. The Latino had a look of peace on his face despite the ugly wound in his chest. She remembered him jumping in front of the bullet meant for her. The tough Cajun said a prayer for him and then for herself realizing how easily the tables could have been turned. His was a selfless act of sacrifice that had already jolted the woman out of her cynicism. She'd prided herself on being able to read people but she'd totally missed the change in this man because of her past. She vowed to never make that mistake again. Gwen felt a surge of emotion and her stomach begin to knot looking at the man and thinking about what he'd done. She was glad no one could see her face since she didn't want to ruin her fearsome reputation. Spontaneously the MP reached down and touched his cold face. \"Good bye,\" she whispered. Then there was Maria. The contrast between the two dead people only feet apart was stark. Where Raul had given Maria Rincon had taken, causing all this death and suffering. At least the boy was safe. Now it was time to try to figure out why she did it. Gwen searched the woman's effects nearby and found what she was looking for. A sheaf of papers was neatly folded inside a leather bag beside Maria's suitcase. The Military Police officer began to read the contents but had to stop several times. What was on the documents caused a chill to come over her. The letters detailed the impending sale of Hector to a group of people who were going to use him for….she couldn't read any further. The idea that people would still participate in stuff like this even during a time of war sickened the experienced officer. This was bigger then the Military Police. She would be putting in a call to the FBI when she got back to her headquarters. She crossed herself and thanked God again that she'd gotten involved. Hector was safe that was all that mattered right now. No one was going harm him. She'd make sure of that. As for the others at the Foundry, well she'd not get her way but they were done. Taking the papers she needed as evident she turned to the people waiting to clear the bodies. \"Okay, we're done here. Tag 'em and bag 'em,\" she ordered walking from the room. An orderly moved towards Raul's body causing Gwen to stop mid-stride. \"No, not dis one,\" she declared. \"I take care of him myself.\" Grabbing a body bag she went to the fallen hero and tenderly began to wrap him in what would become his funeral shroud. Terminal Island After Nantz and his team successfully returned to the defensive area the aliens did lay on several attacks but with the new air cover the humans enjoyed the efforts had little success and became half-hearted at best. Then after several hours things suddenly become very quiet just after dark. It seemed as if the aliens have disappeared, melting into the darkness of night. Tension mounted on the line, eyes strain into the dark, overcast night looking for signs of an impending attack while those with Night Optical Devices scanned for signs of a renewed attack. Then the beleaguered Marines discover why the aliens had gone from their position. The rumble of vehicles could be heard in the distance. Sporadic cannon and heavy machine gun fire broke the silence of the night. Attack helicopters flying over head cover could be seen in the night sky as the lead elements of the relief column come into view. Elements of the 1st Armored Division, supported by cavalry squadrons from the 101st Airborne pull up to the Vincent Thomas Bridge. Cheers erupted along the line as the remaining Marines greet their overdue relief. Men pour out of both sides and warm greetings were exchanged. The time and cost was forgotten for the moment as those in the defensive positions begin to relax. Corporal Harris slumped down from the GPMG he'd been manning to sit with his back against a concrete abutment. Ortega and Imlay followed suit and began to let their guard down. They knew Lockett was okay but had to be left at the company aid station due the severity of the wounds so for the moment there seemed little to cause them stress. \"You think this is it?\" Ortega asked hopefully, opening up an MRE packet. \"Yea man, for now anyway,\" Imlay answered. \"So now what?\" the Latino Private asked, digging into the food. \"I suspect we'll be shipped back to the rear then the brass will figure out what to do next,\" Imlay answered. That seemed to satisfy the man and his face relaxed. \"I can't wait to see Cherise,\" Harris commented, rubbing his scalp. \"Man, that is going to be a sight.\" \"Your fiancé is fine Harris,\" Ortega commented. \"Yea, she is,\" he agreed, closing his eyes and picturing the woman he intended to marry. Ortega became silent for a moment, deep in thought. Then he blurted out, \"Hey, she got a sister?\" \"Alejandro man, you take it all!\" Imlay laughed. While the three kibitzed Mike had a less than jocular look on his face. Despite his wounds he redressed himself and began to pack ammo. Doc, who was still weak but continued to help in the aid station challenged him. \"Gunnery Sergeant, what do you think you are doing?\" he asked in his thick accent. \"Squids are beat for now and we got help. I'm going back in to get the bodies of my troops back while I still an.\" Adukwu knew it was pointless to argue with the man so told Lt. Gordon what the NCO intended to do. The platoon commander came over to investigate. \"I hear you want to go back in and bring the bodies out Gunny,\" Gordon declared casually but still letting him know he knew what was going on. \"What's your plan?\" \"I owe it to them to bring them back sir. All of them,\" he stated firmly, a look of defiance on his face. The compassionate officer thought about the declaration for a moment. \"That makes sense but you're not going in alone. Let's talk to Captain Harvel and see what we can come up with.\" Mike's shoulders slumped in relief. In truth he was exhausted and didn't know how to go about it. His usually sharp mind had been overloaded by everything going on so he'd not really had any plan but to go. Gordon was a good man and a good officer. Mike would follow his plan. Though the company commander questioned the wisdom of the recovery mission LCol Ritchie didn't. As Mike relayed his desire and Lt. Gordon laid out the plan the understanding senior officer merely nodded his head in agreement. \"Grab some support from 1st Armored,\" Ritchie added once the plan had been laid out. \"No sense going on foot. Plus, you can move fast and hit hard if you receive any resistance.\" \"Thanks sir…for understanding,\" Mike said, smiling faintly. \"Get it done. But when you get back you and your guys will be the first ones off this place. Choppers are coming in the morning to begin to rotate us to the rear,\" Ritchie confirmed, returning to his normal gruff manner. With LCol Ritchie leading the way, Mike was able to secure support for the mission he felt called to. The officer commanding the relief column from the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team in fact was eager to lend support when he found out who it was for. Already word had gotten around about who had taken out the alien shield generator so people were eager to help the new heroes. So the Scout Platoon from 6 Squadron of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, who had been acting in a reconnaissance role, volunteered to take Mike, and now Imlay, Harris and Ortega on the mission. Lockett by this point had passed out from his wounds or he would have gone also. With Abrams tanks from 1st Armored leading them across the bridge the platoon took over once they'd crossed. The M3A3 Bradley AFV's provided not only the speed necessary to accomplish the task but the firepower if confronted. While the three young Marines were spoiling for a fight now that they had the fire support Mike merely wanted to get in, recover the bodies and get out. There was some light resistance initially but several bursts from the Bradley's 25mm cannon caused the infantry caste aliens to melt into the night. From then on they encountered no alien resistance on the island which was eerie. Mike didn't care. Sitting in a turret of the lead armored vehicle as it rumbled through the streets of Terminal Island Mike directed them to the spots where his team members had fallen. Despite the chaos of their mission and how quickly things had happened, the NCO had a surprisingly good recollection of where each had met their end. But then a true leader will not forget those types of things. Working from the first man fallen to the last, where Santos had sacrificed herself to take out the shield generator each was recovered. At each stop the AFV's would fan out and cover the four Marines as they would go to place the body in a body bag. Each time Ortega began to weep openly for the one who didn't make it. None thought the lesser of him. His were honest, open emotions. Mike became quiet each time, saying a prayer for each before returning to the Bradley to get another. With Santos' recovery Mike paused longer. There seemed no threat from the aliens so the platoon didn't seem to have to rush. Kneeling beside the Air Force Tech Sergeant's mangled body Mike saw himself in her place. He'd been willing to blow the charge and she'd taken his place. He was going home. She wasn't. Then he thought of her words: you go and marry that pretty woman from the helicopter. He would marry Michele, not just because of Santos' sacrifice, but because he began to desire for a life more than this. Suddenly he became eager for the end of the mission so he could see her, hold her, and tell her he loved her. The willing sacrifice of this unassuming service woman had solidified in his mind something he'd been afraid of: the need for commitment. He would commit and he would commit to Michele. \"Thank Elena,\" Mike whispered as he zipped her into the body bag. \"I'll never forget you.\" \"You ready to go Gunny?\" the platoon commander asked him, not wanting to break the reverence of the moment but also aware of how vulnerable they were. \"We've been sitting here a while so should move out.\" \"Yea, let's get going, we're done here,\" Mike replied, picking the woman up by himself despite the pain in his shoulder. He'd re-opened the wound, he knew that, but it didn't matter. He owed that to Santos. Sitting with the body bags of his dead comrades in the back of the Bradley Mike could finally begin to relax. They would all be going home. He would marry Michele. They would have a family. He also knew what he'd name his first daughter: Elena.[Chapter 52] Chapter 52 – Forward looking Vincent Thomas Bridge, Terminal Island, LA Elements of the 1st Armored and 101st Airborne Division continued to arrive throughout the night as a sizeable force built up. Before first light they began to fan out and extend their hold beyond the narrow stretch of road they held to relieve the forces at the bridge. Neighborhood by neighborhood they pushed out making excellent progress but in truth there was little difficulty since the aliens had melted away. Things became eerily quiet though everyone knew the invaders were still there in force. But where? Early in the morning a Blackhawk Helicopter ringed by a strong escort of Apache Gunships landed at the 2-5 command post. General Daily and his staff had arrived to not only meet with LCol Ritchie but take charge of the preparation for the coming alien reinforcement from the front. \"Sir, I still think this is a bad idea,\" General Grayback declared nervously. \"We'd get a better idea of what's going on and all the information we need at the rear.\" Captain Blatchford snorted but said nothing. \"I can appreciate that Marion,\" General Daily responded patiently though he was amused but the Reserve intelligence officer's take, \"but we need a real-time assessment of what we're facing here. We don't have time for filters. I want the raw intel and then we'll figure out what we're doing. Plus I want to be here when our help from the Pentagon arrives.\" \"They're going to make it in time?\" Captain Blatchford asked in surprise. \"Yep. I got word while we were flying here they'd reached the rear area all morning. They've been driving straight for two days only stopping for fuel.\" \"That gives us some interesting options,\" Blatchford declared. \"It does indeed,\" Daily agreed. \"Now let's see what we can find out from the troops on the ground.\" The group moved quickly towards the Marines waiting for them while bodyguards maintained a strong perimeter. \"Nice job Ken,\" Daily congratulated the Marine officer, shaking his hand. \"Thanks sir,\" Ritchie responded, fatigue etching his face. \"It was touch and go for a while and we lost some good men but the 2-5 got the job done.\" \"We owe you guys a lot. Prep your people for evac. The 101st will be taking over your position. We're moving you back to the rear area this morning,\" the area commander confirmed. LCol Ritchie motioned Captain Harvel to come over. \"We're going to be moving out shortly. Get the companies ready to turn over the defenses to the airborne. Critical casualties and wounded out first, everyone else from there.\" The Captain saluted and trotted off to begin the preparations. \"So, what now General? What's the plan?\" Ritchie asked his commander. \"Well, your work here was real good but all it does is give us the chance to hold when the squids come in force,\" Daily declared grimly. \"If the reports you sent me are true and they were planning on using this as a staging area we need to hold Terminal Island and regain the coast. We can't let more of them in.\" \"Makes sense. You ready for a tour of what you have to work with?\" Ritchie asked. Less then an hour later the area commander had an idea of what the lay of the land was. From there LCol Ritchie saw to the withdrawal of his forces from the two bridges. It didn't take nearly as many helicopters to bring out the remnant as it took to come in. Though melancholy at the losses the senior officer couldn't have been prouder of his troops. The 2-5 Marines had proven themselves and their sacrifices had made the stand about to come possible. He prepared to leave on the last helicopter out while paratroopers of the 101st Airborne took over the 2-5's position. Going to General Daily he wished him well. \"Well that's it. Good luck to you.\" \"Thanks again Ken for all your boys did. We owe you a lot,\" the commanding officer sincerely declared. \"Thanks for the opportunity sir. Give the Squids hell.\" Ritchie turned to move towards the idling helicopter when something caught his eye and he stopped dead in his tracks. A green Army tractor trailer truck pulling a long flatbed trailer came into view causing the seasoned warrior to do a double take. It was the item resting on a cradle on the trailer that gathered his attention. A long tube that looked like a cannon lay flat surrounded by some sort of derrick-like device. Behind it an Army cube truck followed then another tractor trailer and another cube truck. Two more such pairs were behind the first one. \"What is that?\" LCol Ritchie asked curiously. \"It's a new weapon system the Pentagon is deploying to meet the arrival of the Squid reinforcements.\" \"Yea, but what is it? It looks like an artillery piece but its way too big.\" \"It is an artillery piece but a brand new one developed to reach the Squid ships as they move through our atmosphere,\" Daily explained. \"How can that be possible?\" Ritchie wondered, forgetting for the moment his fatigue and waiting helicopter. \"Only a rocket could do something like that.\" \"I don't quite understand all the technicalities of it but the design is patterned after the railway guns that were used in World War 1,\" Daily confessed. \"The techies from Washington are calling it a Magnetic Accelerator Cannon or MAC gun for short.\" \"Okay, but how is that going to help us go after the Squid capital ships?\" the Marine officer asked. \"I mean it's still an indirect fire weapon with no real tracking. Wouldn't some kind of rocket system work better?\" \"That was my contention exactly when it was presented to me,\" Daily agreed. \"Again, I'm not the expert on this but my understanding is it marries the two systems together. The MAC's launch system allows for a higher rate of fire then rockets. The shell it delivers not only has a depleted uranium core but it emits a magnetic pulse when fired which responds to the particular metal arrangement the alien ships are made of. They figure it'll punch right through them.\" \"Interesting. So it uses a kind of sonar-like approach?\" Ritchie asked, becoming more intrigued. \"In a way,\" Daily agreed. \"But with these when it locks onto the metal it's calibrated for it fires a short accelerator rocket burst which combined with the magnetic pull of the ship it's heading towards…\" \"Compounding the force incredibly.\" \"Exactly,\" General Daily exclaimed. \"Wow,\" Ritchie marveled as he thought of the implications of this new weapon system. \"We might actually have a chance to win this.\" Somewhere over LA Mike found it hard to relax despite the fact he was sitting in a helicopter moving back to the rear area. His shoulder throbbed and he felt bone tired. Looking out the side of the chopper he saw a line of vehicles heading towards Terminal Island including several long transport trucks pulling flatbed trailers with some form of long gun on them. Expanding his view he saw tanks and Armored Fighting Vehicles fanning out and sweeping towards the coast like a broom cleaning a dirty floor. The guilt he felt at leaving the front began to erode with the realization he wasn't needed anymore. It was no longer his fight. Rather then upset him he felt a wave of relief. Mike didn't want to go back to the front. Not that he feared it; no, it wasn't that. He would go in an instant if needed but he wasn't needed anymore. Right now Mike had business with Michele and Hector and wanted to spend time with them. He'd neglected them for too long, now it was time to even things out a bit. Suddenly a peace that not only could they win this fight but he didn't have to be at the center of it filled him. He laid his head back against the wall of the helicopter and closed his eyes. He hoped Michele would be at the helipad to meet him. Refugee Encampment and Military Command Los Angeles rear area, somewhere outside LA \"Michele, they're coming back to the base,\" Kelly reported the news the distracted woman who had been unsuccessfully trying to fill in a simple report for the past half hour had been waiting for all morning. \"Go now. We'll cover for you.\" The nurse hugged her friend reassuringly. \"I'm sure everything will be okay.\" Michele hugged her back with a mixed feeling of reassurance and dread but knew the die was cast and worrying would solve nothing. As she left the hospital several other of the staff wished her well. It seemed far more were pulling for her then she'd ever imagined. The trip to the helipad was a blur of emotion. Hope soared, anxiety plunged, fear crept in but steadily she progressed until she reached the staging area. The word must have gotten around since several other civilians and a few military personnel were shuffling around idly trying to will the time away. Michele joined the group waiting for the 2-5's helicopters ending up standing beside an attractive African-American woman. The two made eye contact and shared the same awkward smile. \"Hi, I'm Cherise,\" the one introduced herself. \"Nice to meet you. I'm Michele.\" \"You waiting for your man?\" Cherise asked. Michele thought back over the past several months and everything that had gone on, the barriers and obstacles she'd had but now were removed. She wanted to be in all the way, there would be no more hedging. \"Yes I am,\" she answered, fingering the engagement ring she wore. She looked at the woman who was in the same boat she was, not knowing whether 'her man' was alive or not. Yet the woman had a look of peace and contentment on her face while she felt like she could vomit from anxiety as each minute passed, the tension rising. \"It's pretty tough, isn't it?\" Michele asked. \"The waiting...\" \"Yea, it is but all we can do is trust the Good Lord and wait,\" Cherise answered. \"But then that's the life we've chosen when we fell for a Marine.\" Michele pondered the wise words from the woman who was likely ten years younger then her. Despite the confidence Cherise exuded Michele could also tell the young woman was edgy and nervous. Yet she trusted. \"So who are you waiting for?\" Cherise asked. \"Mike Nantz.\" \"Gunny Nantz?\" Cherise exclaimed. \"Girlfriend, he's a keeper. He's saved my man's life more then once. That goes for all the guys. He's a good man. You look after him, okay? We all owe him.\" \"They're coming back!\" someone shouted out to the gathered crowd, causing a buzz of nervous energy. The sound of helicopters could be heard in the distance. Black dots morphed into Boeing Sea Knight helicopters steadily chop-chopping towards the helipad. It would be only a matter of minutes. Michele pondered the request and all that had changed. He is a good man. Its time I show him that. She was in all the way. \"Don't worry, I plan on it,\" she replied though the other woman was now distracted, willing the helicopters to land faster. Please, be on the helicopter Mike she thought to herself and may Cherise's man be too. The Sea Knights dropped from the sky and flared just above the ground before touching down lightly. Dust and debris was kicked up by the spinning of the powerful rotors so those waiting ducked away automatically to get away from it. Ground crew ran out to prepare for the disembarking of the Marines on the crafts. The first coming off were the wounded. Medical personnel from the Army Field Hospital along with several ambulances began to urgently remove the critically wounded for a speedy trip to the hospital. Michele watched, biting her lip in fear and hope. She had relief and increased tension all at the same time when Mike wasn't part of that group. Once the wounded were off the rest began to disembark. She was struck by how tired they looked and the minor wounds many carried. As the Marines trudged off there were shouts of joy, questions about others and some spontaneous reunions. Michele heard a squeal of delight beside her and Cherise was sprinting off towards a lean, bespectacled African-American Marine carrying a machine gun. He dropped the weapon and scooped the laughing woman into his arms. Watching the two twirl around in delight she couldn't help but getting choked up at the tender scene. She saw Corporal Imlay joking around with the pair but couldn't catch his eye. The stream of Marines continued but was becoming a trickle and suddenly fear began to build like an icy grip. Mike was not there yet, he wasn't coming back. Then she saw him. Stepping off the last helicopter, walking beside an athletic looking African-American officer, though obviously wounded based on the bandages he wore he was alive and still standing. The two were in conversation so he hadn't noticed her yet. She smoothed out her shirt nervously, wanting to look her best, waiting for him to see, determined to show restraint. That last about two milliseconds. \"Mike!\" she screamed urgently. \"Mike, I'm here!\" Tears filled the woman's eyes until her vision was blurry, she couldn't wait. To hell with dignity. As he turned towards the voice she ran as fast as she could towards him. Mike heard his name called and turned to see Michele running towards him, face filled with tears, arms open. His face lit up as he saw the one thing that now mattered to him most at this moment. His mission was complete. Michele saw him turn and the look on his face melted her heart. Despite the obvious fatigue and dried blood from several shrapnel wounds his look changed to one of obvious joy-filled love at seeing her. The strong smile she'd longed to see for so long broke out as he opened his arms to receive her. For Mike, he saw her running towards him and the look on her face melted his heart. Despite the worry lines and obvious signs of fatigue from the long hours spent at the hospital seeing him brought a look of joy-filled security to her face. The mischievous smile that had captured his heart back on their original odyssey was back as he prepared to receive her. They finally knew not only in their heads but now in their hearts too where they stood with each other and more importantly knew their future held each other. No longer would there be doubts or indecision, temptation or distractions. The two were about to become one flesh and one spirit. The pair collided and their embrace could only be described as explosive. Each clung fiercely to the other, trying to bury themselves into the other. Michele began to weep as tears freely rolled down Mike's cheeks. The seemingly impossible had happened. Months of strife, conflict, the pull of others and a war that had all conspired to keep them apart wasn't strong enough to prevent this intersection. They would become as one. The pair broke from their clench, looking deeply into each other's eyes, drinking deeply of the well of love. Then Michele had the 'movie moment' she'd dreamed of for so long. As if time had slowed down, Mike leaned in as Michele closed her eyes and tilted her head up. Their lips met in a kiss that filled each with ecstasy. Though not overly deep, or terribly long, the significance was not lost on anyone who observed the happy scene. The intersection of Mike Nantz and Michele Trantor had just become a new route they were both about to travel together. The pair was interrupted by a pair of clapping hands. Turning to see who had joined them in their celebration the couple was delighted to see Father Alexander standing not far away with Hector at his side. Without waiting for an invitation the two ran over to embrace the happy couple. Forgetting the dignity of his position the priest threw himself weeping for joy at the happy sight, a balm for all the misery he'd been experiencing of late. There was good to be found after all even in the horror of war he realized and said a quiet prayer of thanks for the realization and the hope it imbued. For Hector, the man who had saved his life and he looked up to was there, holding on to him and that was all that mattered though a small flicker of fear began to grow into a flame. What would happen to him now? The nice female Military Police officer had looked after him since what had happened at the Foundry and she really liked him. He had another dream though, a dream he was afraid to whisper in case it was stolen from him, a hope that gnawed at him. \"We're going to be a family,\" Michele declared to the pair that had arrived to celebrate with them. \"Praise God!\" Father Alexander declared knowingly. \"That's nice Michele,\" Hector said, trying to sound cheery as his heart dropped. \"I'm happy for you and Gunny Nantz.\" \"No, you don't understand Hector. WE are going to be a family,\" Michele responded, kneeling down beside him and taking his face into her hands. \"We're getting married and then we want to adopt you.\" Hector's knees buckled at the pronouncement he'd not even dared dream about. Tears clouded his eyes as he began to weep with joy. Mike put his hand affectionately and protectively on the boy's shoulder and Hector knew without a doubt he'd not only be safe again but happily safe. His intersection had happened too. They were going to be a family.[Chapter 53] Chapter 53: Endings and Beginnings Terminal Island, LA With the 2-5 Marines replaced and the 101st fully in position the push to secure Terminal Island could begin. Several squadrons of Abrams tanks and AFV's from 1st Armored were called up to assist in the undertaking. The first order of business though was the destruction of the alien docking facility that Mike and his team had discovered on the center of the island. Before anyone moved in the structure was saturation bombed by the Air Force using a combination of bombers and precision strikes. After a half-hour the whole area was nothing more then a smoldering wreck of twisted metal and black concrete. No one would be landing there anytime soon. Though he was leaving the coming operation up to the leaders of the units involved General Daily did want to make sure everything was going to go smoothly before returning to his headquarters. The human forces had little room for error since the time they had to prepare for the coming alien reinforcements wasn't very long. \"Okay Major,\" the Daily asked one of the officers from his operations team, \"what have you got?\" Major Cramner looked at the notes he'd taken over the past hour and gave his report. \"All units are in place or moving so we're good to go. The ones who took heavy casualties in the run up here have been rotated back and replaced. We have critical mass but just and very little in reserve. Resupply has been completed or will be by the end of the day. Anything we have left beyond the front line though has been banged up pretty bad and is in a depleted state. So…\" \"So what we have right now is all we have,\" the area commander filled in the blank the nervous ops officer didn't want to. \"Yes sir, that's correct,\" Cramner answered. \"In terms of geography, the two remaining bridges are intact and secure which is fortunate so we have easy access to the island. The coast is in the process of being secured and our supply lines seem pretty good.\" \"Then we're in good shape,\" Daily prodded. \"For the time being, we do seem to be,\" the Major confessed reluctantly. \"Good. Thank you Major,\" Daily responded trying to not show irritation with the hesitant Army officer. He then turned to his intelligence officer. \"What do you have for me Christie?\" Captain Blatchford adjusted her glasses then began to share her findings. \"Squid resistance seems to be broken in the Greater LA area. There are a few pockets where they still seem to have significant numbers but nothing too major. We've hemmed them in and are allowing the Air Force and artillery to deal with the threat rather then risk more of our ground assets.\" \"So we are getting a bit thin on the ground?\" Daily questioned, being able to read between the lines. \"That's not really my area but it does seem like we are a bit stretched,\" Blatchford confessed, \"but I believe we have enough to get the job done.\" Daily nodded his head grimly, mentally calculating the human cost of getting them to this point. He swore to himself he would end this now in order to stop the misery. He wasn't going to hold back. \"So what about Terminal Island?\" he asked quietly. \"We had a couple of aerial flyovers over with Predator drones to freshen up our intel,\" Blatchford continued. \"Colonel Ritchie's guys were bang on with their assessment on what the Squids were building on the island. It was definitely some sort of de-embarkation point. I'm glad we found out about it and pushed the way we did. Anyway, there doesn't seem to be a lot of the enemy there but we do need to go in, finish them off and ensure the docking facility isn't able to be rebuilt in case we can't hold the island.\" We owe those guys who held these bridges and took that shield down a lot General Daily thought to himself. \"Thanks for the assessment. I like what I'm hearing.\" The Area Commander turned to one of his staff officers who stood close by waiting for instructions. \"Give the order to General Cooper to move in and secure the island. I don't want one of those things left standing and I don't want a Squid moving anywhere but into a grave. His boys will have A10 and Apache backup throughout. Tell him to get it done and get it done quickly.\" The Army Captain snapped a smart salute and trotted off to ensure the order was carried out. \"Okay, so that's where we stand. Now let's look ahead,\" Daily proclaimed, signaling it was time to consider the coming threat. \"What assets do we have to work with going forward?\" \"You know our troop situation Sir and where they will ultimately be placed,\" Colonel Weeks answered, \"that hasn't changed. Ground forces are in place and those deployments ordered by you at Captain Blatchford's suggestion,\" the operations officer shot the woman a dirty look but said nothing,\" are beginning now. The new heavy guns from Washington have arrived which you've seen so all we need to do is deploy them. The Navy is on standby and will move into position to meet the drop. We have an Aircraft Carrier Battle Group and two Destroyer Squadrons standing by. We're also getting support from the Western Fleet of the Canadian Navy who will back us up. Air Force has moved several additional squadrons of bombers and fighters into a forward staging area. Everything will be in place when the aliens break through our atmosphere if they come here.\" \"What about nukes?\" Daily asked quietly. \"They have arrived and we've gotten the green light from the President to use them,\" the S3 confirmed uneasily. \"Sir, I don't think that option is one that…\" Captain Blatchford interjected but her voice trailed off, unable to finish her thought for the horror it brought to mind. The usually outspoken officer's voice dropped off, not sure what to say on the subject. No one did. General Daily breathed heavily. \"No one wants to turn LA into a wasteland but we also can't let the Squids get out of this area either. If we can't hold them then we need to contain them,\" the commanding officer declared grimly. \"All right, our job here is done. Let's get back to headquarters and get ready for the main event.\" The Pentagon, Washington DC Before anyone wanted, but all knew was coming, the moment of truth arrived. \"Sir, we have multiple signals just outside earth's atmosphere in a tight formation,\" a satellite operator reported in the operations room that had been set up to monitor the inbound alien arrival. \"Okay, send the information out on the net to all stations. Have them ready to receive invaders,\" The General commanding the area responded. \"It's time to warm everything up.\" This was no surprise, they'd known the new invasion fleet was coming and had been correct in their assessment of when the aliens would arrive to the half hour. No one was about to make the mistakes of the previous year and miss this arriving space-born threat again. The big issue now though was where they would go when they arrived. Thus far the aliens had stuck close together on a trajectory that took them over the middle of the Pacific Ocean so it was anyone's guess as to where they would land. For the human defenders that meant deploying resources ahead of time in anticipation of where they would land since there would be no time to react and reach them before they hit the ground. If they followed the pattern from last time they would disperse to multiple locations but which ones and in what force? \"Sir, alien capital ships are beginning to slow down and break formation. At current decelerating speed they'll hit our atmosphere in less then one hour,\" a female Air Force operator added to the initial report, tension thick in her voice. \"Any destinations determined yet?\" the commanding officer asked with anticipation. This was the moment of truth. The heads of the Pentagon had made a gamble by sending the bulk of their resources to the West Coast, anticipating the major invasion would happen there. If wrong it would turn out to be disastrous. \"No clear indication yet though it looks like the first group is heading to the East Coast,\" the Air Force Sergeant reported. \"Wait one; it should be clearer in about five minutes.\" A groan went up from several of the analysts who were watching the drama unfold. It seemed as if they'd guessed wrong. Several began to move towards computers and phones to report the results but the commander of the unit waved them off to wait. The nearly three hundred ticks of the clock it took to get clarity on the direction and amount deployed of the alien reinforcements felt like it took three hundred years. \"We have a clear pattern sir of the alien deployment,\" the first operator called out. \"They've broken into two groups. The first group appeared to be a feint. The second group comprises nearly eighty-five percent of their arriving force.\" \"Where is it heading?\" \"Los Angeles.\" Area Headquarters, LA Theatre of Operations \"General, an alien deployment report is coming in from Washington,\" Colonel Weeks called out, a note of fear in his voice. \"Talk to me. What have we got?\" General Daily answered in a level tone. \"It looks like we're getting nearly the whole alien force arriving here,\" the Operations Officer's voice broke partway through. Though the commanding officer felt the same wave of panic that was consuming his S3 he wouldn't show it. \"Good. Sounds like the Pentagon was correct in their assessment. We have what we need to get the job done. Relay this information and all the inbound trajectories to our forward command post at the island. Signal the fleet off the coast to prepare, everyone goes to Battle Stations. It's game time.\" Terminal Island and Coast Boom Boom Boom Boom The four MAC guns erupted, spitting their 300lb shells towards the alien capital ships that had slowed down as they broke through the earth's atmosphere. The titanium encased depleted uranium slugs screamed towards their objective, the internal homing system kicked in waiting for a lock on their target. Back at the gun platforms the rear breech had swung open and small forklifts were bringing fresh rounds to the loading conveyor attached to each gun. At the Fire Control Centre technicians were tracking the opening salvo, nervously waiting to see if the theory of how this should work would turn into reality. A full bird Colonel of artillery oversaw the operation and he stood behind the monitors absently chewing one of his fingernails. No one had to tell anyone in the room what was at stake here. \"All MAC rounds have acquired signals. Less then a minute to impact,\" a technician reported to the commander. \"Thank you Sergeant,\" the Artillery officer answered. Then to a communications NCO ordered, \"Patch us in to General Daily at the Area Headquarters. He'll want to know what's going on in real time.\" \"Salvo Two is ready to fire,\" a Captain in charge of Fire Control reported. \"We have good solutions and are awaiting orders. Should we wait for impact of Salvo One?\" \"Negative. Let's get as many slugs in the air as we can before they know what's coming. All guns fire,\" the Colonel ordered. The ground shook in the command centre as the four large cannons erupted anew sending another volley up into the atmosphere. Back at the Area Headquarters General Daily wondered again if he should have left the forward area. He felt helpless back in the rear but then there were still skirmishes going on inside the city besides the coming reinforcement threat from space. In the last ten minutes numerous alien companies had come out of hiding and begun to fight anew, as if knowing their help was on the way. The area near Terminal Island where the MAC guns had been set up were receiving particular attention from the Squids who seemed to figure out the humans were planning a response. Daily was thankful he'd reinforced the area with an additional squadron of tanks and two battalions of paratroopers. But that left the rest of the area between the new front and the rear area exposed. There was even a perceived threat against where they were so tensions were high. They had to stop the alien reinforcements or they were finished. In less then a minute they'd know if their new weapon would help them in this seemingly impossible task. \"What do we have assessing the impact of our artillery?\" General Daily asked his operations people, trying to kill the agonizing time until the report since he already knew the answer but didn't want to be alone with his thoughts. \"NASA retasked a satellite to our AO so we have good eyes on. We also have two AWACS on station for the closer in stuff,\" General Grayback reported. \"We should have a good sense of what's happening in a few seconds.\" Both the Fire Control Headquarters at Terminal Island and the Area Headquarters in the rear had access to the same data at the same time so each group found themselves spontaneously counting down the time to impact. Seven-six-five-four-three-two-one…..impact! \"Talk to me. What have we got?\" General Daily demanded to both teams. \"A Major assessing the impact in the Fire Control Centre feverishly tapped away on the keyboard at his terminal trying to find out what happened. \"Okay, rounds one, two and four hit their target, round three missed. Salvo two in-bound and will impact in less then three minutes.\" \"Damage though! What about damage?\" Daily yelled. \"Ahh…unsure. There was impact but no visible signs of damage,\" the Major magnified the image he studied, looking for information as the satellite relayed both video and still pictures. There doesn't seem to have been any damage from the rounds.\" A load groan spontaneously rose up in both headquarters at the sobering information. How would they stop them now? \"Should we activate our nuclear assets Sir?\" General Grayback asked a bit too enthusiastically. \"No, hold on. We need more info,\" Daily shot back. \"Wait! Wait a second,\" the Major in charge of damage assessment called out. \"I can see two of their ships are listing, they seem to have lost power. The third…yes, the third has visible fires erupting along its superstructure. We've damaged them!\" The groans turned into giddy cheers. \"Pipe down,\" the controller yelled, \"next salvo is about to hit.\" The room fell silent as they waited for the report of continued success. \"Yes,\" the officer pumped his fist in the air. \"Three more impacts!\" he reported then fell silent as the room waited for the assessment. \"Initial footage shows those ships are out of commission. We did it!\" The air filled with more cheering as the MAC guns fired again. \"Stay focused people,\" the Colonel ordered. \"This is far from over. Keep tracking the inbounds.\" Looking over the shoulder of his team he asked, \"Where are we at right now?\" \"Alien ships are trying to break from their approach vectors,\" an analyst reported. \"Are they able to do that and not crash?\" another member of the analysis group called out to his team. \"Unknown but the firing solution of the last salvo is off,\" someone called out. Despite the rising tension the professionalism of the artillery team was shining through. \"Very well, recalculate,\" the officer commanding ordered. \"These Squid ships aren't Jet Skis. They can't turn on a dime.\" The next salvo was a complete miss. The Colonel was correct though. The large alien capital ships began to follow a set course once they'd made their adjustments which gave the humans a chance to respond anew. The MAC's fired again and this time their next series of salvos took out two more ships. The pattern of movement and adjustment between the two adversaries went on for a short while longer. In the time it took for the alien ships to change course while still descending towards the West Coast the humans had been able to cripple or destroy half of the armada. Now it was time for the Navy. \"Admiral Gumataotao, it's up to you and your Battle Group,\" General Daily reported through a direct link to the Rear Admiral commanding Carrier Strike Group 11 that had been standing by off the coast. \"Sounds good General,\" the Admiral responded enthusiastically. \"I'm glad we can get in the fight. I have two squadrons of F18's on the deck ready to go and I'll bring my two Destroyer Squadrons to bear. We have the approach vectors of the aliens from you and will keep them penned in. None of these bastards are going to get to land.\" \"Keep me posted Admiral, we'll be standing by to take out any that don't go into the water,\" Daily noted with relief at the confidence of the sailor. \"Very well. Good luck, God speed,\" Gumataotao signed off then turned to his Executive Officer. \"Captain, I want Destroyer Group 5 covering the North and East, Destroyer Group 7 on the South and West. Also, signal our Missiles Cruisers. I want the Port Royal and Lake Champlain in tight. I don't want anything hitting us. Got it?\" The Naval officer relayed the orders and in short order the Navy was prepared to receive the alien deployment aimed just off the coast. Destroyer Squadrons 5 and 7 posted themselves with their ten capital ships supported also by four destroyers from the Royal Canadian Navy. The lessons of the previous year had been learned. These were no Coast Guard ships but rather capital ships ready for war, their 5-inch guns and Sea Sparrow missiles loaded and ready to engage. As soon as their ship's computers had firing solutions dozens of surface-to-air missiles lit up the sky in search of targets. Those alien capital ships that got through the deadly fire were engaged at close quarters by the deck guns of the destroyers. The few that actually made it into the water were then bombarded by the Navy F18s from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and Air Force F15 Strike Eagles. It was a total annihilation. On land, though most of the alien ships seemed to be aware their docking facility of Terminal Island had been destroyed, a few smaller crafts tried to land on Terminal Island. They were met by concentrated fire from Abrams tanks. After all this, the few Infantry Caste aliens who staggered onto land were mowed down by the paratroopers of the 101st Airborne who were eager for revenge. The aliens left from the original invasion seemed to realize their reinforcements had been obliterated or perhaps they'd been given a general order of evacuation. Regardless, all disengaged in short order and began to make their way to Santa Monika, the site of their original incursion seeming to want to retreat. Alien ships that had been lying below the surface seemed to be remotely signaled to rise in order to receive the several thousand alien soldiers still on the ground trying to get away from the now relentless pursuit of the humans. But Captain Christie Blatchford had anticipated this. The observant newspaper reporter had poured over aerial photographs and thermal images weeks earlier curious as to how many infantry caste aliens had been able to come onto shore after a relatively few number of splashes off shore. She'd been able to determine their drop ships were resting on the bottom in shallow water waiting for a moment like this. The Reserve Intelligence Officer had been right and the humans were ready for it. First B1b Lancer bombers saturated the area dropping a combination of Mk-82 General Purpose bombs and Mk-62 Quickstrike sea mines. The water boiled as the alien ships were shredded. Next a wall of steel formed along the coast as redeployed squadrons from 1st Armored and the remaining Marine units from the West Coast hungry for revenge unleashed their fury on the now-trapped invaders. None walked away. The aliens who had been holding LA tried to leave but didn't get far. The frustration and rage of the past year was channeled into that moment and none left the earth. Over the course of the day what had hours earlier seemed impossible had actually happened. The humans had won.[Chapter 54] Epilogue: after LA Los Angeles The guns fell silent as the last alien ship was destroyed and the final grotesque invader eliminated. The battle for Los Angeles was over. In the aftermath, tanks and AFV's scoured Terminal Island and the surrounding area while attack helicopters roared up and down the coast area around Santa Monika looking for signs of any more resistance. There was none. The alien reinforcements had been knocked from the sky. Pieces of broken ships littered the ground around the greater Los Angeles area. Already scientists from NASA and members of the NSA poured over what lay on the ground. Trucks were standing by and already a number of pieces had been moved away to labs. Though a seemingly routine undertaking it signaled a significant statement: the invaders who had been on the ground for over a year had been stopped. There were no prisoners though, the material remnants of the vicious invader. Any attempt to get the infantry caste aliens to surrender had been met with dogged resistance or in many cases the Squids had opted for suicide. Now all that remained were the corpses and their abandoned vehicles. Those service personnel of the US military that had fought so hard for so long had an opportunity to collect their breath before the daunting task of cleaning up and rebuilding LA began. \"Hellova fight Ron,\" General McConville declared as he and the area commander toured the aftermath of the fight on Terminal Island. \"It was a tough one but the troops did well,\" Daily replied, involuntarily wincing every time they passed a burned out human vehicle or body that had not yet been recovered. He'd given orders that everyone was to be accounted for, no matter what. The African American senior officer knew he would have a lot of nightmares over this. \"Any idea how long me and the boys will be here?\" McConville asked Daily, catching the vacant stare starting to form so wanting to distract him. \"Well, for sure until we know there's no more threat,\" the officer responded, snapping out of it since there was still a task at hand, \"though I suspect that's finished. But we'll also keep you around until things are stabilized in the city and the police can take over. That could take a while,\" he declared looking back over his shoulder at the broken city across the bay. \"We're not going anywhere,\" McConville stated. \"We can stay as long as you need us.\" The pair returned from their tour and rejoined the command group at the forward operating area's headquarters. While most of the officers were talking loudly and sharing stories of the recent events one sat off by herself not becoming involved in the talks of bravado. Captain Blatchford had a notebook computer on her lap and was tapping away rapidly on the keys. Noticing General Daily and the commander of the 101st Airborne approach she stopped, closed the lid, adjusting her glasses. \"So, find anything interesting?\" the Reserve officer with a hint of sarcasm. Daily chuckled and shook his head at the cheeky reporter. \"No, just seeing things for myself. I…I had to…for closure,\" he confessed. \"I understand,\" Blatchford answered with a voice suddenly empathetic and nodding her head in understanding. \"It's going to take some time to process all this.\" \"That's for sure. So, Christie, if anyone thinks this is over, they've got another thing coming,\" Daily declared, suddenly becoming serious. \"The Squids are still out there somewhere and we need to be ready if they decide to come back. I could use a good staff intelligence officer permanently what do you think?\" \"Thanks for the offer sir but I'd like to get back to doing some writing,\" the reporter's brow furrowed showing the offer not only caught her off guard but intrigued her, \"maybe try to remember what a normal life looks like.\" \"I bet you got a few good stories to write,\" McConville interjected. Blatchford snorted. \"Yea, a few.\" Turning to General Daily, her eyes glowed, \"But if you need me, I'll be there.\" The United Nations, New York City The United Nations were finally able to meet after hostilities ended to chart a course for the world's future following the desperate war they'd fought. In the green room behind the platform of the main council chamber a group of military officers waited to be called out for the gathering of a special sitting of the General Assembly of the UN that had been called to not only review the war but share with the world the course of action for the future. So as the group waited to be called for their part of the presentation they watched CNN on a large flat screen TV. A special report on the aftermath of the war was going on and despite the venue none wanted to miss it. In an unprecedented move CNN anchors Piers Morgan, Soeldad O'Brien and Wolf Blitzer had combined their skills to bring this recap of the situation in the United States and around the world. After preliminary comments viewers were given an update on the world situation. The initial report focused on the tough-fought but total victory which was old news. But then they began to report on, and assess, some of the big changes in the new world order that seemed to be coming out of the war. China had suffered attacks second in intensity only to the US and had been on the brink of collapse. Without hope, Japan and South Korea voluntarily came to their aid throwing aside historical differences for the good of the region saving the day in the end. The Chinese' sense of honor drove them to a new relationship and stability in region. Interspersed video clips showed smiling delegations from each country shaking hands in a gesture of friendship. Rippling out from that, North Korea had then been forced to change their ways by their ally who no longer was willing to prop up the vicious regime. Surprisingly, the isolationist nation did a miraculous change, welcoming the new way of thinking. Another clip showed the beginning of dismantling of the DMZ between the North and South. In the Middle East attacks from Muslim terrorists taking advantage of chaos of the alien invasion so revolted the people they rose up and threw off groups like Al Qaeda. Images of leaders who had previously been supported and hidden by oil-rich nations now being led off to prison or execution showed optimism for the volatile region and the rest of the world. Perhaps some good had come out of the horror of this invasion as people finally began to realize we are all in this together so set aside historic animosity and ego for the common good of mankind. After so much darkness the rays of hope broke through the clouds. Overall, the United States' sharing of knowledge and lessons-learned during the conflict had been acknowledged as being critical to the salvation of many nations which changed long-standing hostile attitudes towards the US in the world. This brought the opportunity for a new level of co-operation and development that many were excited about. Though the world had won the destruction and loss of life around the world had been huge. The need to rebuild would require the efforts and contributions of all the nations. It seemed as if people were finally ready to give it and work together. The three anchors then shifted from the world report to a synopsis and recap of what had happened in the United States. The actions on the West Coast were shared with an almost breathless sense of awe by the seasoned reporters. It was a greater story then any author could have come up with, how outnumbered and outgunned the beleaguered human defenders had won the day. Names like Santos, Blatchford, Adukwu, Ritchie, Lockett and Imlay and numerous others joined that of Nantz becoming household names synonymous with bravery and sacrifice. On the East Coast, the one MAC gun that had been deployed had been enough to save New York and the troops in that area that'd in the end possessed more then enough for the small alien contingent. The anchors switched to a correspondent on Wall Street who reported that with the aliens gone the clean up and rebuilding of the attacked cities was already beginning. Some were predicting it would create another economic boom. The stock market had reopened and already showed the optimism of the future. The rapid-fire program then shifted to NASA headquarters in Washington where another reporter had been informed the space agency and the NSA was beginning to study the alien technology with plans to reverse engineer it. Already a critical discovery had been made in space travel courtesy of a grounded alien capital ship. The director of NASA then came on to report that if the aliens, or any others like it, returned in the future, man would be ready for them and given time, could go out into space and get them. From Washington the focus shifted to Terminal Island LA and an update on the heroes of the defense and those who had taken part in destroying the alien shield generator. It was announced that Air Force Tech Sergeant Elena Santos had been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously for sacrificing her life to blow up the device. Gunnery Sergeant Mike Nantz had been awarded a Navy Cross to go with the CMH he'd still not received. The report added he was to receive it at a special ceremony at the White House in two weeks. Other members of the team had all been awarded a Defense Distinguished Service Medal. A curious and intriguing story was also reported about a Navy Corpsman named Jibril Adukwu who had single-handed rescued a downed Navy pilot during the defense of the bridges to Terminal Island. The selfless act of courage had brought him recognition across the nation which went along with an announcement of him being award the Navy Cross. Finally, the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Marines had been awarded a Presidential Citation not only for their bridge defense but actions throughout the campaign. The broadcast flipped to the Pentagon where one of the members of the Joint Chief's of Staff was announcing to a packed gallery the issuing of an Alien Defense Campaign Medal to all who had participated in the war against the invaders. The usually reserved reporters broke into applause at the worthy recognition. Yes, many things were changing. \"Sorry, but we're going to interrupt the press conference at the Pentagon,\" Piers Morgan broke in on the reporter at the Pentagon, \"to take you live to the United Nations Headquarters in New York where the Secretary General of the UN is about to address not only the delegates but the world. We switch you there now….\" Ban Ki-moon stepped before the podium and seemed uncharacteristically nervous. People watching began to wonder if he had some bad news to share or the weight of all that had gone on finally overwhelmed him. Adjusting his glasses he turned and faced the television cameras and the assembly. \"Ladies and gentlemen not only of the United Nations but also of the world watching now,\" he began in excellent English though tinged with a Korean accent, \"I am pleased to announce the cessation of hostilies around the world with our alien invaders. No longer is there any direct threat from them. We have suffered for well over a year under attack without provocation while our attempts to dialogue with these invaders went unanswered or answered by brazen attack. It was only through the unprecedented co-operation of the nations of the world we were able to overcome this. We have learned a valuable lesson in the importance of working together I trust we will never forget. The cost in human lives has been extreme and the economic impact staggering. But we are resilient and we will rise up from the ashes. We still stand!\" A polite round of applause was given for the statement everyone already knew. The never before seen co-operation especially among the most powerful nations was already the talk of the world giving rise to the hope for the dawn of a new era, good coming out of tragedy. That was not why the people were tuning in. Secretary-General Moon finished his preamble and got to the point. \"Though the co-operation we enjoyed has brought change we also must be aware now that we are not alone in the universe. We have been attacked without warning and may be again. Therefore, I am pleased to announce that steps are being taken to address any future threat from space. By unanimous approval of the Security Council I am pleased to announce the formation of our newest division, the United Nations Space Corp. The UNSC will be funded equally by the nations of the Security Council and will act as our military arm for future space endeavors. We have all realized the responsibility does not belong to any one nation to bear so all will be working together on this. At this time I am also honored to announce its first commander, a man who showed his meddle in the recent campaign in the Los Angeles Theatre of Operations. Please welcome General Ronald Daily of the United States Marine Corp.\" The assembly responded with thunderous applause as the delegates broke into a spontaneous standing ovation. General Daily walked confidently towards the podium, a look of resolution on his face to accept the charge. The White House, Washington DC Mike fidgeted in his dress blues, feeling uncomfortable. The fall day had been perfect for the outdoor event, sunny with a nip in the air but he'd always been more at ease in his combats then the dress uniform. The attention he'd been receiving in the iconic uniform made him even more so. Across from where he and the others from his company stood at ease there had to be at least a hundred video cameras and another hundred photographers in the press gallery. Remember, the people need heroes, Michele had reminded him so he stopped fidgeting. Mike stole a glance down at the shining gold wedding ring on his finger then lifted his eyes to scan the crowd. He saw Michele sitting in the front row of the VIP area looking beautiful in a tailored navy blue dress. The look on her face as she stared at him melted his heart: unbridled love. Sitting beside her, holding her hand was Hector who looked handsome in the suit he didn't want to wear but doing it for the occasion. The paperwork for adoption was already going through. Soon they'd be together as a family legally. Father Alexander had married them and Mike could see the priest sitting in the gallery with a peaceful look on his face. The couple had met with him for a brief session of pre-marital counseling and would continue to do so. Mike was determined they would make it and what had happened in his previous marriage wouldn't. Both wanted to experience the same thing: the joy of the two becoming one flesh in more then the physical. Besides, the couple had Hector to look after and neither was going to let him down. The priest had introduced them to a tough-looking Military Police officer named Gwen Langois who he'd told them was instrumental in rescuing Hector from his scheming aunt. Michele and Mike owed her a debt they couldn't repay. The Cajun brushed it off but the couple could see she'd been moved by the experience. The soldier had told them she was going to be leaving the Army to join the reforming LAPD so she could more directly help kids especially in need. The police department was getting a great asset. The newly married couple had discussed what to do with Hector's name and had decided to leave it as it was in tribute to the boy's heroic father. They would allow him the option to change it or keep the status quo when he was of age and could decide on his own. They knew what a gift they were receiving in the new son but didn't need to deny his heritage to show it. The couple was determined he'd keep his identity and they'd build off of it. Besides, they were excited about building their own family. Mike's eyes twinkled as he thought about the pleasant process to get there as he listened to a senior senator of Congress begin to speak following the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \"How much longer is this going to go on?\" Lockett declared to his friends under his breath as the politician droned on and on. The newly promoted Sergeant turned his head slightly to talk to the other survivors of the attack on the shield generator. Lockett, Harris, Imlay and Ortega had all been brought with Mike to the White House to receive their medals along with their battalion commander LCol Ritchie and their platoon commander, the recently promoted Captain Gordon. Each of the men in turn had been promoted. Ortega had been elevated to Corporal, Harris and Imlay to Sergeant. Right now though Imlay was wrestling with the offer he'd received of promotion to officer for the leadership he'd shown. Though tempted by the offer he also felt bad Lockett hadn't been given the same opportunity. The handsome African American had laughed at his friend's sentimentality and told him to do it since they needed good officers. Kevin Harris kept looking at his wife out of the corner of his eye. The bespectacled Marine had finally been able to marry Cherise. His bride sat beside Hector in the VIP gallery looking stunning in a form-fitting white dress. Now Corporal Ortega caught the look and chuckled at the star-crossed lover. \"Your wife is fine Mano. Too bad Cherise didn't have a sister.\" \"Yea, but she does have a cousin,\" Harris reported in a low voice. \"Bro!\" the Mexican Marine beamed and the others couldn't help but chuckle causing a sharp look from the Marine Sergeant-Major at the end of the line who had been escorting them. The foursome of friends did their best to stifle their laughter but couldn't. The elation of the moment, being alive, and now being celebrities was a bit much to take. Though the Sergeant-Major chided them no one else in the assembled group thought the lesser of the men. Their stories were legendary. Everyone knew they'd been to Hell and back so allowed them some frivolity. The preliminary speeches ended and finally it was time for the President to present the medals. They went out in order of precedent and finally there was only Mike's. The seasoned warrior felt a sudden surge of panic at the attention as every camera focused on him as the President walked up to him. Mike looked to Michele who beamed. The President could sense the unease of the warrior so with a twinkle in his eye gave him a wink which set Mike at ease. The President took first the Navy Cross then the Congressional Medal of Honor and pinned them on Mike's dress uniform. Then in a surprising breech of protocol the Commander-in-Chief stepped back and snapped off a salute at Mike. Stunned at the gesture he automatically returned it. The crowd gasped at the gesture then broke into applause. It had been prearranged that Mike would says some words of acceptance so he followed the President to a microphone set up in front of the gallery. He stepped up, gulped and took a deep breath. He saw Father Alexander give him a thumbs up and he spoke. \"Mr. President, members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the honor bestowed on me this day and the recognition you've given me. I've said before I was not worthy of this honor but I appreciate it. I accept this on behalf of all the Marines in E Company of the 2nd Battalion 5th Marines who didn't make it and didn't get the chance to be recognized for their sacrifice. They are the heroes today, the ones who are not with us. I also accept this on behalf of Second Lieutenant William Martinez who if not for his sacrifice I or most of the men before you would not be here. He is the true hero today and one that should be remembered. I accept this in his honor.\" Mike then abruptly stopped speaking as his voice choked and in a moment not on the script he suddenly walked towards the gallery to where Michele sat. Beside her, holding his wife's hand, was Kathy Martinez and her baby. As reporters scrambled to get into position and Public Affairs Officers whispered frantically to slow down, Mike removed his Congressional Medal of Honor and pinned it on the baby boy. Starting to cry Mike declared, \"This should have gone to him. This is from a grateful nation and a grateful man. Thank you.\" Kathy was weeping by this point. The emotional woman stood up and hugged Mike. They held onto each other for a few moments then with still tear-stained eyes Mike marched back to the line ramrod straight, did an about face and stood with the others. That moment would be replayed for years to come and would define the war effort in many ways. With great dignity the President moved from the line of Marines towards a podium with the Seal of Office on it. For a moment he too seemed overwhelmed by the situation and had to stop to wipe tears from his eyes. He paused again as his advisors cringed and the cameras continued to roll. The President of the United in that moment knew this was not about politics. Taking the leather bound folder sitting on the podium which contained his speech he closed it and instead talked to the gathered group and by extension the people of the United States from the heart. \"I have been deeply moved today in a way I haven't in many years. We all know about the courage of those assembled before us and we've heard already about what they've done. But it's time for us to move beyond the observation of these and thousands of other heroes of this war and start to live by the things they stand for. Its time for us to put away false heroes and look to those who selflessly give of themselves willingly for a cause greater then themselves. President Kennedy once said 'ask not what your nation can do for you but what you can do for your nation' and I echo those words today. I am ashamed that it's taken a war of this magnitude to remind me of that need and I want to change. My fellow Americans, I want us as a nation to finally put partisan divisions aside for the good of the country. For my colleagues in Washington, let us forget politics and become statesmen once more like those who built this great land working for the good of it. We have the examples of those who gave so much of themselves. They demand the same thing from their leaders. There once was a dream that our forefathers had, of a strong, free, proud and honorable America. I've allowed this dream to slip away. We've all allowed the land to slip from us. As we rebuild the damage done may we rebuild more, may we rebuild the character of this once proud nation. Let us once again be a people who can have righteous pride. It's time to start afresh and do it a different way. The work at hand starts right now. God bless America!\" The President then walked away from the podium and went straight to the group of Marines. He spontaneously embraced Mike and said simply, \"Thank you for the lesson you gave me.\" He then went down the line and embraced each of the surprised Marines assembled. The ceremony was done and since protocol had seemed to be thrown out the window rreporters swarmed around Mike and the others. Despite the chaos caused by the scrum and the discomfort of the attention Mike felt the soft touch of Michele's hand in his and knew not only it was well but it would be well. He'd gone through the intersection, both of them had, and they were now on a new and exciting journey together. \"Gunnery Sergeant Nantz, we congratulate you on your recent marriage,\" a reporter called out. Then he asked, \"What are your plans?\" As the camera recorded Mike looked first at Michele, then Hector and grinned. \"It's time for a honeymoon. We're going to Disneyland, because it's still standing.\" The End Author's note: thanks for reading! I appreciate all of you who have been along for the journey.
