[{"Movie":"Man From U.N.C.L.E.","Title":"lessons in linguistics","Author":"takingoffmyshoes","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12930572","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Waverly's waiting for them when they burst into the lobby, and halts their headlong charge with a raised hand. He's about as tired and rumpled as they are, dressed uncharacteristically casually in a shirt and cardigan rather than a suit, but doesn't look nearly as harried as he'd sounded on the phone. \"He's all right,\" he says heavily, \"it's not as bad as we thought. They're keeping him overnight as a formality, but he should be free to go by the morning.\" That takes a bit of the weight off of Illya's shoulders and he lets out a long breath, but Gaby still radiates furious tension. She wears her anger proud and stubborn, and is slow to let it go. \"Where is he?\" she asks sharply, words fit to cut. \"I'll take you up.\" The room Waverly leads them to isn't meant for one person, but the other cubicles are vacant, curtains drawn back to reveal empty beds as they pass. Solo is the room's lone occupant, in a bed by the far window overlooking the hospital's courtyard. He's paler than usual, and there's an IV needle taped to the back of his hand, but beyond that he looks like he's simply asleep. \"What happened?\" Illya asks quietly. Waverly had called several hours ago to let them know that he'd had to take Solo to the hospital after finding him unconscious and unresponsive in his flat, but they hadn't heard any more since then. Gaby and Illya were on their way to a mission in Morocco, but the strain in Waverly's voice was enough to turn them around at the airport and put them on the first train back to London. Waverly takes off his glasses and starts to polish them on the hem of his sweater. \"He failed to show up for his debriefing,\" he says, just as softly, \"and he'd called to check in the night before so I knew he was in the city, and that his mission had gone well. He wasn't answering his telephone, so I assumed he'd found something better to do with his time. I went to his flat to wait for him and found him on the floor.\" He puts his glasses back on, and glances over at Solo with a look that seems to match the mix of frustration, relief and concern that Illya himself is struggling with. \"He had a high fever, and I couldn't wake him up, so... Well, you know the rest.\" \"And what exactly is wrong with him?\" Gaby asks tightly, arms folded as she peers down at him. \"Just the flu,\" Waverly tells them. \"He started to perk up once they got some fluids in him.\" Gaby snorts, and Illya has to agree: he wouldn't even think to describe Solo's current presentation as 'perky.' \"Trust me,\" Waverly says wryly, \"he looked considerably worse when I found him.\" \"But he'll be all right?\" Illya presses. \"Oh, yes, of course. A few weeks of rest should have him right as rain ― provided he actually rests, that is.\" He fixes them with a meaningful look. Gaby cracks her knuckles. \"Don't worry, sir,\" she says darkly. \"We'll keep him in line.\" It's another hour or so before Solo wakes up, an hour that Illya spends trying to bring himself down from their frantic flight. It's just the flu , he reminds himself sternly, time and again, but he keeps hearing Waverly's voice over the phone. It's not looking good, he had said. It's not looking good. It must have been bad, to make their normally pragmatic handler assume the worst, and Illya's still riding the high of fear and adrenaline that those words had provoked. He'd thought Solo was going to die ― if not immediately, then from whatever mysterious illness could fell a man so swiftly and severely. But it's just influenza, and Solo's going to be fine. He breathes into his hands, tries to still their shaking. Gaby, sitting next to him, appears to be having no such troubles. She is still, like a snake just about to strike, and she has yet to take her eyes off of Solo. It's enough to make Illya worry about him, just a bit. \"Gaby,\" he starts, carefully. \"I'm going to kill him,\" she says, like it's a reasonable response. \"And you're not going to stop me.\" Illya blinks. \"You're not,\" he replies. \"And I will.\" She rounds on him. \"We should be on our way to Morocco,\" she hisses, \"doing our job , not here , waiting to play nurse for our idiot partner.\" He knows she doesn't mean it, that she's likely dealing with the same holdover stress that he is, but still, it's too harsh. \"You wish Waverly hadn't called?\" he asks flatly. \"You wish that if it had been bad, we returned next week to find that oh, so sorry, Solo is dead? Or you think you too are too good, too important maybe, to take care of your partner when necessary?\" Gaby deflates. \"You know it isn't that,\" she mutters. \"Oh,\" says Solo, \"but there's so much Peril doesn't know.\" They both turn to him. Somehow he looks worse now that he's awake, eyes dull and bloodshot and his usual charm nowhere to be seen. His voice is the same, though, even if it is a bit raspy. Still smooth and flat, nothing in the tone or inflection to suggest that he's anything but fine. \"How are you feeling?\" Illya asks. Gaby just glares. \"Not too bad,\" Solo says. \"Just the flu, you know. I'll be out of here tomorrow.\" Illya nods. \"That's what Waverly said. You scared him,\" he adds as an afterthought. \"He was very worried about you.\" Solo huffs a laugh that has nothing of levity in it. \"My dear Peril, people don't worry about me. They get angry with me, or frustrated, or annoyed, but they don't worry . As Miss Teller so adroitly pointed out, I'm nothing but an inconvenience.\" Gaby sputters, and Solo smiles flatly. \"See?\" he says, cutting off whatever she was about to say. \"Angry and frustrated. Isn't that right, darling?\" He looks back at Illya. \"I'm sure I'll be quite all right on my own, if you two have a plane to catch.\" \"No.\" It's Gaby that answers, and Solo raises an eyebrow at her. He looks so tired. \"We promised Waverly we'd keep an eye on you,\" she says. \"And besides, I think it's time we had a talk.\" \"I'm sure you do.\" Gaby sighs. It seems she's let her anger drop, after all. \"You're something of an expert on socializing,\" she says, \"so why don't you tell me a bit about nonverbal communication?\" Solo looks back at Illya, who sees his own confusion mirrored. \"I don't think I follow,\" Solo says slowly. \"No? Well, I'll assume it's because you're sick and not because you're an idiot.\" \"How kind,\" Solo mutters. \"When two people talk,\" Gaby says slowly and gently, like she's talking to a child, \"they don't just use words. They also use motions and expressions, which is called…\" she trails off expectantly. \"Nonverbal communication,\" Solo fills in, still sounding unsure. \"Paralinguistic, in this case.\" \"And there's something else − I don't know what it's called − when people use the volume and the pitch of their voices as well.\" \"Extralinguistic markers. Gaby, I don't think―\" \"Hush,\" she snaps. He hushes. \"The point is, Napoleon , you don't do that. I know you can , because you do it with marks, but you don't do it with us, and that's a problem.\" She leans forward, puts her elbows on her knees so her face is mere feet away from his. \"We need to know when you're hurt or sick,\" she says seriously, \"and if you won't tell us with your voice, you need to tell us with your words. I know you don't like showing weakness,\" she goes on, \"or asking for help, but miscommunications in our work can be deadly, and contrary to what you may think we do worry about you.\" \"We wouldn't be here otherwise,\" Illya adds. \"Waverly called, told us what happened. We came back at once. He thought you had been poisoned, I think.\" Silence stretches between them. \"It's a habit,\" Solo says at last. \"One I worked hard to develop, and one I can't risk giving up. Just like keeping a gun clean, or an engine running smoothly. It's part of my work.\" \"I know,\" Gaby says. \"But that doesn't mean you have to lie to us. So, how are you really feeling?\" Solo sighs, shifts in the bed. \"Sore,\" he admits. \"Tired. And my head hurts.\" Gaby runs a hand through his hair. \"How long have you been sick?\" \"I don't know. I thought it was just jetlag, at first. It wasn't until after I'd called Waverly that I started to feel like something was wrong, and by then it was late enough that I figured I'd just go to bed and sleep it off. Next thing I know, I'm in the emergency room, and people are yelling and…\" He winces and waves a hand to illustrate his distaste. \"I'd rather have gone to the debriefing, honestly.\" Illya chuckles. \"Good spy would recognize the importance of debriefings,\" he says, and gets an eye-roll in response. \"Be nice to me,\" Solo mutters, \"I'm sick.\" The next week and a half isn't pleasant, but it's bearable. Gaby and Illya take Solo back to his apartment and stay with him as promised, and do their best to help him through. He coughs and sweats and shakes and sometimes has trouble keeping food down, but they make him tea and soup and bring him water and blankets. Illya sets an empty garbage bin next to the bed for when he's feeling sick but can't get up, and wordlessly puts himself in charge of cleaning it. Gaby goes out and buys a thermometer because Solo doesn't have one, and shakes him awake three times a day to take his temperature. It never gets high enough that they have to go back to the hospital, but it's high enough to leave him wrung out and miserable. Throughout it all, though, Solo talks to them. He tells them if he's too cold or too warm, tells them when he's thirsty or unable to face any sort of sustenance, tells them when he needs help to get to the bathroom to relieve himself or rinse out his mouth. And it's not easy, and not comfortable, but he does. And when the second week comes to an end, when he's better but still pale and thin and exhausted, they decide to stay another week, and he thanks them. I wrote this back in December as part of a \"short story celebration\" that marked the third birthday of takingoffmyshoes fanfic. As a thank-you to everyone who'd supported me and encouraged me, I spent two weeks taking writing requests on tumblr, and then posted the finished stories first to tumblr, and then to my AO3 account in February. I initially wasn't going to post them here, but then I thought why not? You guys have been just as kind and encouraging here, and I'll make sure to open up requests on this site as well when December rolls around again. As always, thank you for reading! Any feedback you'd like to leave is welcomed and appreciated.

Their job is to bear the weight, no matter what needs to be done or who you have to give up. Only this time, Ilya isn't sure if he can do that, not with Gaby, and he's running out of time to find another way. A response to The Weight of Us by Insomniabug. Ilya sits on the edge of the uncomfortable couch, watching the hotel room door. A knife-edge of light cuts across the dark room from the open bathroom door. The tub of hot water he drew for her return is tepid and useless. He has given up playing chess. He has given up his book, though he's read Chekov so many times he can recite the words, and he does, moving his lips without sound. A country house on a terrace. In front of it, a garden. In an avenue of trees, under an old poplar, stands a table for tea, with a samovar... Solo would only tell him two things: she was alive and Ilya could not be there when they picked her up. When he called Waverly, the same two things were repeated with the sincerest, politest British apologies. After that, no one told him anything because he broke the phone. Solo left him the briefing as a condolence, but it gave him nothing useful. She was alive. She was at a CIA safe house, requesting immediate assistance with the processing of a prisoner for questioning with crucial information about the mission that had stalled for weeks. She'd done her job. Of course. Never mind the three days they'd spent scouring France, or the dozens of agents looking for her, Agent Gabrielle Teller would waltz right out of trouble when she damn well felt like it, and she'd bring \"crucial information\" with her. His stomach had warmed with pride- had he expected anything else- then twisted again because yes, he had expected something else. He had an inexhaustible catalog of things to expect, but that thought made his hands shake and he'd set the report aside to draw her a bath because he didn't want her to come home to a trashed hotel room. Ilya knew the safe house- he'd memorized all of them, as always, before the mission- and it was not even an hour's drive away. Forty-five minutes with Gaby's driving. One hour. Two hours. Two and a half hours. The bath is cold and he is watching the door and he is trying very, very hard not to think about anything else but Chekov. Some benches and chairs stand near the table. On one of them is lying a guitar. A hammock is swung near the table. It is three o'clock in the afternoon of a cloudy day. Perhaps Solo went to the wrong safe house. Perhaps he was going to break the Cowboy's jaw. A country house on a terrace. In front of it, a garden... The doorknob clicks. Ilya has prepared himself for this moment: he will rise, he will look at her and he will not flinch; he will nod once, to acknowledge her bravery, like he would at any other agent, and then he will pour her a drink. Professional. Polite. In an avenue of trees... A blur of purple brocade and blood. Her hair wet against her forehead, the expensive silver pumps he picked out for her dangling from her wrist. He barely even sees Solo slip back out the door to give them the moment alone. Under an old poplar under and old poplar under an old poplar Ilya doesn't realize he has moved until he is on his knees in front of her, his forehead against her abdomen. The heat of her through the thin brocade. The trembling- hers or his, he isn't sure. Her hands, soft, against his temples, against the still-angry bruise from the crowbar that caught him off guard, the weakness that could have cost him everything and- Her hands, soft against his temple. His hands against her hips, pulling her closer. The heat of her. She drops her hands, and he feels her gaze move beyond him into the darkened room, and it occurs to him how foolish he must look, how weak, clutching her like a child holding a blanket. He stands, too quickly, takes a step toward to the table beside the couch, switching on the light. A sullen yellow glow rises through the room like a headache. She ignores him and walks straight to the liquor cabinet, dropping her high heels behind her. He notes the hitch in her step, the stagger and sway; she needs sleep, hours of it, but if he tells her that she'll probably stay up all night just to spite him. Clink of glass, shine of lamp light on vodka. Something acrid in the air. Her back to him, shoulders bunched, every muscle a knot. Whatever she was holding in is going to tear through the room like a gasoline explosion once she let it out. He watches her drink one glass, then two, and when she pours the third, he coughes. \"Don't\" She throws the word over her shoulder. \"I've earned it.\" \"How did you do it?\" \"What?\" \"How you escape?\" The glass in her hand freezes halfway up to her mouth. She sets it back on the bar top. \"You have the report.\" \"The report did not say.\" \"Vinceguerra's idiots got tired of asking me questions I would not answer.\" \"They let you go?\" \"They put me in a trunk and a man with an ugly sweater drove me out to a potato field to shoot me in the head. But he was distracted.\" She downs the glass in one swift gulp, and does he see her shudder? \"So I got the gun. I put him in the trunk. You know the rest.\" They stand in silence, in that half-drunk yellow light, which hollows the bruises on the back of her neck of they are deeper and angrier than they'd be in daylight. At least he hopes it is just the light. It's what he blames. \"How is your head?\" she asks, her voice small and weary. \"Of no consequence.\" \"My head pounds.\" She rests her empty glass against her forehead. Sweat and glass glimmer. She sets the glass down and reaches behind her for the zipper of her dress, but winces. Tries again. Winces again. Her hand moves down to her ribs and she grimaces. \"Ok, help me.\" She still isn't looking at him. \"But...don't break anything.\" \"Break your dress?\" He doesn't understand. \"Break the hotel room.\" The zipper sticks, and he pulls, then pulls harder. She flinches when it gives way. Ilya is field-trained. He has held the intestines inside into a screaming gut-shot boy soldier. He has retrieved a foot, still in its boot. He's set naked bone. Once it was his own bone. He does not flinch. And all he can see really is the dark line of bruises snaking down her spine and blossoming elsewhere, like an algae bloom, covering places he can't see beneath the dress, bruises made worse by the lamplight. He assures himself she will be no worse than any other field agent in her position. A great deal better than most. There is very little visible blood. A few broken ribs. He knows this is a good outcome. But now that he is closer, he can see the bruises on her neck are fingerprints, a necklace of them. He covers one of the bruises with his thumb, very gently, as if it would rub off. The little finger of his left hand begins to tremble. A coutnry house on a terrace. In front of it is a garden... \"Do you need any other assistance?\" \"I think I've done a pretty good job of assisting myself.\" She walks toward the bathroom. \"Assist yourself out, comrade .\" The dress slips down off her shoulders as she walks down the hall, and in the flash of too-bright light as she opens the bathroom door, he sees the whole story of the last three days illuminated on her back and shoulders, just a flash, like the end of a reel of movie film, then the door is close and she's swearing in German at whoever left cold water in the tub. In an avenues of trees... He breaks the lamp as he leaves the hotel room. Cigarette smoke in the hallway outside the door. Solo's face impassive behind the blue-gray haze, staring resolutely at the one burned out lightbulb in the ceiling fixture. Ilya frowns. The American dislikes cigarettes, as a rule; the smell ruins his expensive clothes. But here he hasn't even bothered to remove so much as his tie. \"Care for a smoke, Peril?\" Still charming. Always charming. Ilya wonders if it's ever exhausting. \"Tell me what you know.\" He growls. \"Not much more than you.\" Solo closes his eyes, takes a long drag from his cigarette. \"She wasn't exactly chatty on the ride back.\" \"Did you know her ribs were broken?\" \"Yes.\" Solo sighes. Smoke, weariness, leaking out, Ilya's hands clench, release. \"She should have seen medic.\" \"She wouldn't.\" \"I wouldn't have given her a choice.\" \"She needed to have a choice.\" \"What is that supposed to mean?\" Solo drops the cigarette and crushes it under foot. \"We need to go.\" \"And who watches here?\" Solo nods at the two men pouring coffee out of a tin flash at the end of the hallway. \"CIA boys. They'll keep an eye on her until we get back.\" He eyes Ilya's frown. \"You can trust them.\" \"Not enough.\" \"We've got two days left to disrupt this arms deal or someone very nasty is going to get a very shiny batch of new toys. Waverly thinks Gabby has brought us someone important. He's digging into things on his end, but in the mean time, it's our turn to ask some questions.\" The American's eyes flash a gunmetal black that Ilya has learned is as dangerous as his own red rages, if quieter. Ilya's hands clench again, tighter. \"I get to ask first.\" The mission was supposed to be routine. A clean up job. Since Italy they'd been systematically buttoning up what was left of the Vinceguerra organization, one cell at a time, and they'd stumbled upon yet another madman-to-madman arms trade. It was textbook. Infiltrate the fancy party. Isolate the mark. Extricate the information, quietly, or not quietly. Save the world. It was almost boring, right until their \"guest\" wriggled free and ran, right until the wrench caught Ilya's skull in just the right place and his last image of Gabby was her bare feet slapping against the pavement as she kept up the chase. She always took her shoes off when it got serious... Ilya is a big man. By the time Solo reached him, he was already halfway on his feet. Already running after her. And it was already too late. Napoleon fills in what gaps he can on the drive to the safehouse, which is a converted bar on the other side of the warehouse district. He'd pulled up to find her sitting on the trunk of the car she'd stolen, clutching a gun that wasn't hers. The CIA was already there- it was their safehouse- but she wouldn't move, wouldn't let anyone touch her or the car or the gun, not until she saw Solo. She had taken his hand, turned it over, put the gun in his palm. Said that she'd seen enough of that scheißkerl so she'd wait in the car. He's got big news , she says. If you can get it out of him. Ilya stares at the blank windows of the warehouses as they pass. \"Did she say what happened while she was gone?\" \"Waverly thought it best to wait for the debrief. I concured.\" \"And you did not take her to medic.\" Ilya says. \"You let her bleed in car. But no medic.\" \"I took her where she wanted to go.\" Napoleon said. \"We'll debrief her tomorrow. Just do your job tonight. We need to know where the deal is going down. And Peril-\" Solo's eyes meet his in the rearview. \"That means he has to be able to talk.\" \"There are twenty-seven bones in human hand.\" Ilya says, flexing his fingers. \"None needed to talk.\" The conversation room, as Solo likes to call it, is in a small concrete bunker below the basement of the bar, which is empty except for a few agents posing as factory workers drinking down their day's work. Ilya follows him without speaking to any of the Americans, whom he tolerates because they are Solo's people and are therefore necessary. The local CIA chief meets them in the basement with coffee, which they accept because Waverly has told them to play nice. The coffee is burned black but Ilya appreciates this, likes the bitterness on his tongue. \"My boys waited for you.\" the CIA man says, yawning. \"Seeing as it was your agent who got the bad end of it. Must be a scrappy little thing.\" \"Agent Teller is quite competent, thank you.\" Solo flashes a dangerously broad smile. \"Do we know who he is?\" \"He won't say. Claims he has never heard of Vinceguerra. He is just a lonely factory worker who offered a pretty girl a ride home only to be stuffed in the boot of his own car while she waved a gun in his face.\" The man shrugs. \"See that green couch in the corner? Wake me up when you're done with him.\" He He takes Solo's untouched coffee cup and drains it. \"Oh, and keep the Russian in check. Remember whose side of the Curtain this is.\" He glares at Ilya then shuffles off to an ugly green couch on the other side of the room. Ilya ignores him, and pulls open the trap door that leads down to the bunker. Just do your job . Do it well and do it fast and you can be back with her before morning. The agent on duty outside the Conversation Room tosses Solo the key. Solo unlocks the door to a bare, boring room with too-bright lights and a table and two metal chairs, one of which is bolted to the floor. The man cuffed at wrists and ankles to the chair is, like Gabby said, wearing an ugly sweater, a pumpkin orange and fungus-green monstrosity that is speckled with blood, some of which is from the gash in his forehead and some of which- Ilya will not think whose it is. Do your job. He looks away from the blood, studies the rest of the man: short, squat, but strong, like a small tank. It'd be easy to think he was just hired muscle if it weren't for his eyes: snake's eyes, small and black and bright with intelligence and malice. The man catches Ilya's gaze and he holds it, mocking. \"When I saw you last,\" he said, his English carrying just a smooth Italian accent. \"you were bleeding from my wrench. I could have killed you then, you know. I did you a favor, amico . Are you here to do me one?\" \"Maybe.\" Solo says, strolling over to the other chair. \"What do you want?\" \"We could start with a nice Chianti. Maybe bring that little girl back to pour it out for me...\" Ilya's fingers tap, tap, tap against his thigh. \" I'm surprised you want to see her again,\" Solo says, lightly. \"That gash in your forehead must hurt like hell.\" \"This is a love-tap.\" The man grins. \"We play rough.\" Ilya calls on Chekov again but he can't get past the first two words. A country house A country house . Twenty-seven bones in the hand. Solo's smile never falters. \"I thought you told the nice men in suits that you were just an unlucky good Samaritan.\" The man shrugs, bunching up that horrid sweater. \"You are not one of the nice men.\" \"No, I am not.\" Solo nods back at Ilya. \"And neither is he. You can chose which of us you'd prefer to talk to. Completely your decision. Although I believe he wants very much to break your fingers.\" \"Because of the little agent girl?\" A wicked, yellow-tooth smile. \"The one we played with?\" Ilya has half-convinced himself that they don't need this man. He's just dumb muscle. A hunting dog. Expendable. He and Solo can find the information another way, after they've snapped this one's neck and burned the body, which in its sweater should be eminently flammable... \"No, he just Russian. Breaking fingers is their idea of a conversation starter\" Solo does this often, this caricature of Ilya, and it works because he is Russian and he has broken fingers at the start of more than one conversation so people tend to believe that he'll do it again. \"Although, professionally speaking, we've got a right to be mildly offended. \" \"Professionally speaking, she begged like a whore.\" He screams next, screams several times because Ilya breaks his fingers one at a time, just three, very quickly, just the left hand. He doesn't scream after that because Ilya's hand closes around his throat, holding his face up, close. Somewhere under the pain-fog, something in the man's oil-slick eyes gleams. Something is triumphant. It occurs to Ilya that he should kill him, and quickly, because there's more than just brute hate behind those eyes. There's something coiled. But then Solo disentangles him, making a show of pushing him back against the wall and restraining him, though it's only half a charade. The red mist is seeping into the edges of his field of vision. \"We should just shoot him,\" Ilya growls, low. The man hears and laughs. \"Yes, you dumb Russian bastard, shoot me. Shoot me and thousands of your little Commie friends die horribly when my customer gets his chemical bombs. But what will it matter?\" Solo steps away from Ilya, straightens his jacket. \"No one is going to shoot you.\" He glares at Ilya, who shrugs. \"Not if you're helpful. You can start with a name.\" \"A name.\" The man grins. \"So intimate. We barely know each other. She wouldn't even give me her name, even after all our time together. And you want my name, right now, after he has broken my fingers and you have given me no assurances.\" \"I can assure you that broken fingers will be the least of your worries if I let the dumb Russian back over to that table.\" \"Threats are boring. If you were going to torture this out of me, I'd have been hooked up to a car battery hours ago.\" \"I can also assure you that if you cooperate, we can guarantee you a good life in some lovely American city. Or, if you like winter and misery, some lovely Russian city. You'll have saved all those thousands of lives. Vinceguerra is dead. Your organization is dying. Do the right thing by yourself.\" \"And do those assurances come with your name?\" The man says. \"I like to know who I am getting into bed with.\" \"You haven't made it to my bed yet,\" Solo said. \"We're still at the part where I decide whether to take you home or dump you in an alley. Tell me who you are and what intel you can offer me.\" \"My name is Michael Araldi. You can check it. It is my real name. I do not hide myself like you spies. I was proud of the Vinceguerras. I was proud to work with them..\" \"And what do you do for them?\" \"I arrange meetings. I make sure the products get where they need to be one time, and I remove... obstacles.\" \"Do you know where the exchange is taking place?\" The man grins. \"I am the exchange. I set it all up. The meeting will not happen without me.\" \"If you are so proud of the Vinceguerras, what makes me think I can trust you?\" \"Like you said. They are dead now. I am still alive. I would like to keep it that way.\" \"We're going to need something up front.\" Solo says. \"Something substantial. If I think it's sexy, then I'll call my boss. If he thinks it's sexy, then we can negotiate.\" \"594 Rue de la Fontaine.\" \"Is that meant to be helpful? France is full of Rue de la Fontaine \" \"It's in Brittany. A chic little flat for the scientist who upgraded the bombs for us. Send the Russian to break his fingers or whatever else you'd like. But call your boss quickly. While I am still in the mood.\" Solo gestures for Ilya to follow him out of the room. In the hallway, away from the Araldi's smug smile and oily eyes, Ilya can take a breath without worrying that he will explode. \"We owe him something\" Ilya said. \"Broken fingers just down payment.\" \"I agree.\" Solo says, his smile gone. \"But he's also right. He's our best shot at stopping something very bad and he knows it.\" \"The car battery would be a better idea.\" \"He would lie. He'd lie very well and very stubbornly.\" \"Two battery. Higher voltage.\" \"There is no time, Peril. We'd have to check out whatever lead he gave us, even if it was a lie, because we couldn't take a chance. Not with this kind of weaponry up for grabs. \" \"So we keep up your flirting?\" Solo's mouth twitches in irritation. \"A little charm is useful in negotiation.\" \"Negotiation with cockroaches.\" \"Yes. A cockroach.\" Solo fixes his eyes on Ilya. \"One who hurt Gabby. Don't act like you are the only one who feels that. But don't act like you can't do your job.\" \"Is not the same. For you\" \"You've said that once before.\" Ilya presses his knuckles into the cinderblock wall, hard enough to scrape off the skin, hard enough for a blush of blood. Every alarm bell in his head, every instinct, clamors at him to open the door and wring that bastard's neck. And every bit of his training, every bit of his experience, tells him that Solo is right, that this is their best chance. Their only chance. He drags his fist along the wall, leaving a tiny trail of blood, thinking how easy it would be to smash everything in this hallway. \"Call Waverly.\" he says. \"Set up the deal.\" The usual phone call follows. A CIA team sweeps the Brittany apartment, retrieves the scientist, and the blueprints for his modifications, which elegant and brutal. Araldi has made his point. His intel is good. The stakes are high. Even though he's handcuffed to a metal chair in a concrete bunker, he's the one with the leverage. The usual negotiations. Ilya leaves all this to Solo because he wants nothing to do with the bastard unless it involves breaking things. He's compiled a mental list during the hours that they've waited. He could disassemble the Italian thug with the same precision that Gabby takes apart a faulty car engine and in less time. This thought takes him back to Gabby, alone in the hotel room with her bruises and broken bones and whatever else he cannot see. He tells himself that Araldi's talk was bravado. Button-pushing. But he will not know for sure, will not know how bad it really was until he can see her in something other than shadow. He should be in her hotel room carrying her to bed, not in a concrete hallway making deals with vermin. The usual bad taste in his mouth, after the deal is struck. But worse. Ilya doesn't realize how much worse until Solo emerges from the room, his flawless smile flagging from more than loss of sleep, and tells him exactly what Araldi wants. \"No.\" \"Waverly has okayed it.\" \" Trakhat' yego. \" \"I told him that.\" Solo closes his eyes, pinches the bridge of his nose. \"Or the English version, at any rate. But the deal stands. This is too important. And you know that. I know that. We've only got two days-\" \"Napoleon-\" Solo waves him quiet. \"I can stall for an hour. Maybe two. Go.\" For the first ten minutes, Ilya paces the worn burgundy carpet outside the hotel room. He has never not wanted to return to her. Not until now. The hotel rooms were the space between the missions and the silences after the missions. Some slipstream out of time where he and Gabby don't have to explain why he needs to wake to the morning light on her cheek and she needs to sleep the weight of his arm over her chest. Not lovers. Not yet, even here. Something else, something ineffable. And now this. When he opens the door, the entire suite blazes with light and Gabby is the darkness at the center: black slacks, heavy black turtleneck, even in this end of summer heat. Every inch of her guarded. Her wet hair in damp curls around her neck, her hands closed around an empty glass. \"I wanted to be drunk,\" she says, her German accent thicker, which means she is exhausted, and he wonders when she slept. \"But Waverly called. We are to expect company.\" \"Solo sent me ahead. We have a little time.\" \"Waverly said he requested me to be present in his security detail. Room service.\" She snorts and then winces. \"He is a small, filthy man who thinks he is important.\" He takes off his jacket, hangs it on the door. \"You took his gun. You put him in the trunk of his own car. Embarrassed him. Now he wants to embarrass you. A stupid man. A k akerlake.\" He uses her language, which brings a ghost of a grin to her lips. \"Waverly says two days. Are we to entertain him?\" \"Not we .\" He sits down on the chair across from her. \"Solo and I can handle him. You do not have to speak to him. You do not have to look at him. If he shows disrespect, I break his other hand.\" \"The other hand?\" He coughes. \"Maybe I already broke one. Just two fingers.\" Her left eyebrow arches. Her eyes pin him, wriggling. \"Or three. Hard to tell.\" He stands, to avoid her stare and retrieves the battered medical kit. \"We should look to your injuries.\" \"Ilya, I'm fine.\" \"You are not fine. You are on mission. You can be not-fine back in England. Here you have to be ready. What is broken?\" He is asking for the mission, of course, and not so he can take it out of the Italian later, bone and bruise. \"Just my ribs. I think. It hurts to breathe.\" Whatever pain she's suffocating flickers into her eyes, like smoke, and dissipates just as quickly. \"Of course it's tolerable.\" \"Of course.\" He sets the medical kit down on the table in front of the couch. She shakes her head. \"Not out here,\" she says. \"Company could interrupt.\" In the bedroom, she won't sit on the bed until he locks the door. Untils she checks the lock and the drawer with her gun and the other drawer with her other gun and the wrench she keeps under the bed. She's double-counting the small black case of knives when he catches her wrist. Stills her. Her blood beating bird-wings against his fingers. \"Enough.\" He whispers. \"This is supposed to be a safe place.\" She drops to the edge of the mattress, deflates. Her hand still in his. \"I will make it a safe place.\" His thumb, scraped from the wall of the conversation room, brushes the broken skin of her knuckles. Rough skin on rough. \"Yes,\" Her eyes fix him, again, right through the chest. \"Except for when you can't.\" He drops her hand, as if burned. She shrugs. \"C'mon Ubermensch. Let's get it done.\" She is silent as he prepares the bandages, eyes blazing black, and he thinks he's lost her to the angry space she holds around her like a fortress, but when he reaches for the hem of her turtleneck, she grabs his wrist. \"Remember this is just business, Ilya.\" Her voice soft, shaking. \"Just part of the game.\" Ilya understands what this means - dont' disappear. Don't break anything . Solo would be btter at this- the man has surgeon's hands- but it can't wait. And he won't trust anyone else, even Solo, to touch her tonight. Ilya's hands are too big, too clumsy, but at least they know her. It's the first time he's seen her in full light, and it is worse than he thought, damn it, but he doesn't flinch, just maps it, every bruise and cigarette burn, every fingerprint and boot and belt cut. He wants to drop to his knees and cover every inch of her with his mouth, begging her forgiveness. He is dizzy with what he will do to the bastards who hurt her once this deal is done, once Waverly cuts Araldi loose. Dizzy with the hunger of it, with the blood of it. But he cannot think of what he will destroy, not yet. He touches the angry red swell on her left side, whisper-light, and she sucks her breath in. \"Keep breathing,\" he says. \"Deep. It will hurt. But you won't get pneumonia.\" She nods, teeth gritted. He begins to wrap her ribs, slowly. A small silence, until he is done. Until he eases the turtleneck back over her shoulders, pulls her damp hair out of the collar. \"They took the dress off,\" she says. Not a whisper. Not angry. Just flat. \"He said it would be a shame to ruin it. He gave it back to me before the potato field.\" She doesn't look at him. She stares out the window by the bed and he isn't sure she's talking to him, that she remembers he is still beside her. \"It was a nice dress. Chanel.\" He hears Chekov, again, in his head. A country house on a terrace. In front of it, a garden. In an avenue of trees, under an old poplar, stands a table for tea... His hands shaking. Arms too. Up to the elbow. \"Ilya-\" Like always, she calls him out of his head. Small hands on his balled fists. \"Ignore me. I am just rambling. It is nothing.\" Beyond their room, the click of the door opening and Solo calling a too loud, too cheery, too careless hello that is as much a warning as it is a greeting. Company has arrived. \"Stay in here,\" he says. \"You do not have to go out.\" \"I'm not hiding from a fat little tarakan.\" Now she uses his language. Now it is his turn to almost smile. She bares her teeth, a fierce grin. \"Besides, you might find a reason to hit him and I want to watch.\" The Italian is drunk. Solo deposits him on the couch as if flinging a chunk of rotten meat away from his hands and vanishes into his bedroom, no doubt to the flask of bourbon he thinks they don't know about. Ilya does not begrudge him this. Even the Cowboy has to catch his breath. Araldi sprawls on the couch, red-faced. (it is not Gabby's couch now, just the couch, just like no longer their room, just the room). He squints at Ilya. \"You, Russian. My hand hurts. Give me morphine.\" An exaggerated groan. \"We are not hospital\" Ilya sets his chess set out on the card table across the room. \"More wine, then.\" \"You're drunk enough.\" \"This from a Russian.\" Araldi spits. \"Do you even drink wine, comrade, or do you just suck vodka straight out of Kruschev's dick?\" Ilya ignores him. He sets out the queen, the king. The knight. The pawn. Gabby, quiet on the edges of the room. Walking toward the card table, her face always to the couch, always wary. Ilya can make out the hard edge of a gun tucked in her waistband under the turtleneck. She folds herself into the chair beside him. She is quiet, and Araldi is drunk, but he sees her and smiles, a wide, rat-tooth smile. \"Piccolina!\" He nods to her, lifts her good head in an imaginary salute. \"Little one! No hard feelings, eh? Tell your Russian bear ! He stares at me like he'll eat my liver.\" \"With onions.\" She says. Sweetness and cyanide. \"Or perhaps raw.\" He laughs, long and longer. \"Such sharp tongue you have, piccolina. But remember who it was that let you keep it-\" Ilya presses the pawn into his palm, the sharp edge a pin-point for his thoughts. The subtle shake of Gabby's head tells him what he already knows: Don't get up. It's what he wants. A scene. A sliver under the fingernail. Wanting to know what makes Ilya flinch. \"What do they call you, piccolina? I had to tell everyone my name. The American tells me he is Jones. I suppose you will say you are Schmidt? And the Russian beast...let me guess...Tolstoy!\" More laughter. \"Or does he make you call him Stalin when he wants to eat you raw? Puttana tedesca .\" This time it is the whole weight of Gabby's hand on his forearm that tethers him. She quietly pushes her chair back from the table and takes what's left of the bottle of vodka from the liquor cabinet. She crosses the room and without ceremony, without even a twitch of her jaw, pours the entire remaining contents onto Araldi's face. He coughs, sputters, curses, red-faced, but he's smart enough to stay on the couch. She regards him with dispassionate disgust, like something she's wiped off her shoe in the street. Ilya has never seen her this flat. Every mission, every fight has been a fireball, as if she takes it all personally, every punch an insult, but now she's blank and capable of anything. There's that gun in her waistband. But she walks back to the table, just as quietly, and moves her chess piece. Just in time for Solo to stroll out of the bedroom, the top two buttons on his collar undone, and wrinkle his nose. \"Why does everything smell like vodka ?\" \"He wanted a drink.\" Gabby says, her eyes on the chess board. Solo eyes the still-dripping Araldi. \"I see.\" His eyes travel to Gabby, then to Ilya, asking if she's in hand , and the American doesn't know, doesn't know how much she's contained herself tonight. Ilya knows. He has spent years of his life in small rooms with people he's not allowed to kill, no matter what they say, no matter what they do to him, he's taken the insults and worse, no flinching, even though it feels like someone's peeling back his skin like a peach. He's used to it. He does not want Gabby to be used to it. It occurs to him maybe she was already used to it, long before he got to her. Which is why she is so extravagantly angry, so impulsive. She refuses to behave any longer. \"She's ruined my clothes,\" Araldi says. \"I'll get something for you to dry off.\" Solo smiles, solicitous, though Ilya can see his partner is hiding his amusement at Araldi's indignance. \"And a bottle of wine. Good wine. Because we are friends now, Jones. You and me and Schmidt and Tolstoy. All good friends.\" \"Buoni amici\" Solo says, tossing him a towel. He sets a bottle of something expensive on the table in front of Araldi.\"Alla vostra salute.\" \"Pour it for me, friend. My hand is injured.\" A pointed stare at Ilya. \"You'll manage.\" Solo says. \"If you're motivated.\" Araldi pats his face dry and fumbles with the bottle to fill his glass. Red wine sloshes onto the table, onto the floor. No one moves to clean it up. He eases back onto the couch. \"You should reign in your woman,\" Araldi says to Ilya. \"She is her own woman. What she does with her vodka is none of my concern.\"\" Ilya remains focused on his half-hearted game of chess with Gabby. She moves her pieces mechanically, without thought. He could have ended the game three times already and both of them know it but they just keep moving pieces. Circling. Araldi snorts. Solo turns on the radio and they pretend to listen to mediocre jazz while the Italian drinks and complains about the volume. Every time he complains, Gabby turns the radio up louder until the air is one shriek of trombones and trumpets. Exhausted as she is, she can't help but sway just a little to the music; every bone of her is a dancer, tired or not, beaten or not. Araldi's eyes follow her hips. \"I am bored.\" He shouts, his voice so thick with wine he is barely coherent. \"I want to dance.\" \"By all means,\" says Solo. \"Tap or ballet? I'll bet you do a lovely pirouette.\" A bellow of laughter. \"I want to dance with her.\" He waves his wine glass at Gabby, sloshing more wine onto his sweater. \"Come, piccolina. Let's show them the steps we learned...\" She clicks the radio off. The silence rings in their ears. Araldi tries to stand up but his legs give out and he misses the couch on the way down. He knocks over the table. Ilya looks away in disgust. Cockroach. Solo rolls his eyes and hauls Araldi back onto the couch. \"It's not your night for dancing.\" \"Then you dance with her. You and the Russian. Both of you. So that I will not be bored.\" Solo ignores him, collects the ruined towel and the empty wine bottle. \"Or maybe I have better idea.\" Araldi's smile turns ugly. His burnt-black eyes gleam ugly and bright and fix squarely on Ilya. \"Let's turn the German whore over the couch and split her like a pig-\" Solo breaks the bottle over his head. Araldi crumples like a sack of wet garbage. Solo cuffs his wrist to the foot of the couch. He steps back, lights another cigarette. \"My apologies, Gabby.\" He says. \"I should have let you be the one to do that.\" She doesn't respond. She hasn't moved from beside the radio, her hands balled into fists, her jaw locked \"Go to bed.\" he says. Her fists ball tighter, smaller, whiter at the knuckles. \"Gabby.\" He touches her elbow. Ilya feels the touch as if on his own elbow. He flinches. He can't get up yet, can't trust himself to move without walking over to Araldi's body and snapping his neck. Chicken bones. Instead, he arranges the chess pieces, square by square. He arranges himself, square by square. He knows this work. Make the deal. Deliver the goods. Chess pieces and pawns. \"He could wake up.\" she says. \"You didn't hit him that hard.\" \"I hit him hard enough.\" Solo says. \"And I'll be out here. In that terribly uncomfortable armchair. If he wakes up, I'll know.\" \"I can handle it.\" she says. \"I can do the job.\" He tucks a stray strand of hair behind her ear, a gesture Ilya would begrudge anyone else. \"Not if you're too exhausted to stand.\" She takes the cigarette out of his mouth, puts it between her lips, and walks away from them all. Solo turns out the lights, one by one, until just the city bleeds through the window. He sits down in the armchair across from Araldi's couch and picks a piece of something small and glittering from his hand. \"I am sure I have met nastier men,\" he says. \"But it's been a while since I have wanted so badly to kill one of them.\" He flicks the speck of glass at the unconscious man. Ilya grunts. \"For once we agree.\" \"Did she really douse him in vodka?\" \"Yes.\" Solo sighs, wistfully. \"Wish I'd seen that.\" Ilya nods. \"Was glorious.\" \"How is she?\" \"I bandaged the ribs.\" \"I'm not talking about her ribs.\" \"I know that.\" Ilya says. He is quiet a moment, gathering his words. \"This will not be the last time she is hurt. It will not be the worst time.\" Even in the dark he can see Solo roll his eyes. \"Please tell me that was not what you told her.\" \"No.\" Ilya says. \"I did not tell her. I told her she was safe. I lied.\" \"It's not your fault.\" Solo's voice is uncharacteristically sincere. Ilya hates it when Cowboy is sincere. It means that nerves are exposed. Raw. \"We can't deflect everything that comes her way.\" \"Then what can we do?\" The question escapes him before he knows he's asked it. A weak question. An inescapable question. \"I don't think you're going to be able to answer that out here with me.\" In the bedroom there are no windows to the street, no bleed of light, just a darkness that seems to Ilya, when he walks in the door, to stretch out in all directions like a lake. Black and treacherous. He can do nothing but wade in, even though he's not sure of the depth. He's not sure at which point he'll be over his head. Even in the dark he makes out her shape on the edge of the bed, hunched, poised for some defense, hands coiled around the dull glint of her wrench. For the second time this night, Ilya finds himself on his knees without thinking. He unwraps her fingers from the cold metal. Kisses each one, with their taste of steel and blood and the faintest hint of engine grease. \"We sleep now.\" He lifts the wrench to slide it under the bed but she grabs it. Clings. \"Is okay.\" He says. \"I will keep one eye open for us.\" Her mouth keeps its hard line but her hands relax, let him take the wrench. She does not protest when he pulls the blankets down on the bed and eases her between the cool sheets. She watches him, through the dark, as he unties his boots. Pulls off his socks. He keeps the gun, which he will put beneath his pillow, not because he doesn't trust Cowboy, or the handcuffs, or his own hands, but because he wants her to feel it if she stretches out her hand in the night. Wants her to know that he will not be caught by surprise. That this room is safe. Or perhaps the gun is to convince himself of these things. This is not the first time they have shared a too-small bed in the dark after ugly mission, and their bodies remember how to fit together. Her back curled to him, spine pressing into him, head tucked against his heart, which she has told him (once, when she was drunk and overly honest) is like a lullaby. Something to help her sleep. Normally he would drape his arm over her but tonight he hesistates, unsure what will hurt her. She takes his wrist and pulls his arms over her beneath the blanket, which she pulls up almost over her head. \"You aren't hurting me,\" she says. He wonders if he has spoken, but no, she just knows him in this way. How long are they silent, unmoving, unsleeping? How long until he asks the question he has kept off his tongue all night? Only it is not a question. It is an entreaty. \"Tell me what happened.\" She tightens, spring-coiled against his chest. \"He was distracted.\" She mutters. \"Why?\" \"It does't matter.\" \"To me it matters.\" \"It shouldn't. All of this is part of our job. All the things.\" \"I am not in here for the job.\" When she speaks again, her words are small and clipped, like bullet casings. \"He let me out of the trunk in the middle of the field. Full dark. No moon. Nothing. He told me to kneel in the dirt and he put his gun in my mouth. He pulled up the dress to my waist and I thought about the stories my mother had told me about the soldiers and about the Stasi, the lessons she gave on how to leave your body when you have to, where you can go.\" He wants to clutch her to him and cling but he keeps his touch light. Delicate. He has to hear this out. He has to know. He has to keep still, keep breathing; why does it feel like his ribs are broken too, like each breath is tight and stretched and thin.  \"But I'm not good at that. My body never lets me leave. Ever. He put his hand around my throat and took the gun out of my mouth. He put it... somewhere else. He told me to be still or he'd shoot me in the gut instead of the head and I would bleed out in the dirt. I told him he should have already shot me. And he laughed, and said I was a brave girl and he was wasting me, out here, but it was business and when he pulled down my...when he decided to get on with the business he had to let go of my throat to fumble with his damn zipper...he thought the gun would keep me still but it didn't. We fought. He broke my ribs but I got the gun. I should have shot him. Instead I made him get in the trunk and I brought him to you. And now he is asleep in our hotel room. Just Business. Fucking business.\" She draws his hand up to cover her face. His thumb traces her the bone of her eye, down her jawbone, under her chin. He draws her as close to him as he can, his arms as firm as he can be without hurting her because she needs to know he means this. His mouth against her ear. \"When this is over,\" he says, \"I am going to kill him. You need to understand this.\" He kisses the small, soft spot behind her ear. The side of her neck. \" I am not going to use my gun. I am going to use my hands. It will be intimate. He's going to know it is for you.\" She rolls over, gasping from the movement, and covers his mouth with a kiss that will not relent. He cups her head in his palms, refusing to breathe, refusing to breathe until she does. \"You can't kill them all, Ilya.\" She whispers this, in between kisses, the words light against the corner of his mouth. She sleeps, then. He doesn't. He is in that potato field, a flickering gray ghost, watching the gun and what's done with it, an endless loop. She is always strong, and she always gets the gun in the end, but it's what happens first that he can't stop no matter how many times he puts himself between. He is only a ghost. His hands go right through. Her weight and warmth in his arms is all that keeps him from blood. Solo materializes out of the gray before dawn, when Ilya is half-awake, half in fugue, and the American is almost shot for it. \"We need to talk. Before she wakes up.\" Gabby sleeps, almost peaceful, and Ilya is careful not to wake her when he untangles himself from the bed, stretching to loosen the muscles that are complaining from a night in cramped quarters. He follows Solo out into the sitting room, where Araldi, still handcuffed to the leg of the couch, is waking in ill temper. \"You are a bad host, Jones.\" he says, picking glass out of his hair. \"And you do not keep our terms.\" \"What is he talking about?\" Ilya asks Solo. \"We can talk in my room-\" \"Where is she?\" Araldi shouts. \"Wake her up. Piccolina. Little bird whore.\" Ilya doesn't need a wine bottle to shut him up this time. He will wrap his hand around the bastard's throat and squeeze- But Solo's hand on his arm pulls him back. \"A word, Peril. Now.\" \"What did you promise him?\" He grinds the word out between his teeth. \"On the phone with Waverly. What did you do?\" \"You look surprised, comrade.\" Araldi chuckles. \"Your American friend didn't tell you? I help you out. I am big hero. I fuck your German. I wanted six hours but the Englishman only gave me three. Still...\" Ilya's hand closes around Solo's throat. He drags the American into the other bedroom and only lets him breathe because he needs to know what is happening, what he missed. \"I will kill both of you. I swear to God.\" \"You don't believe in God.\" \"This is not a fucking joke.\" \"I am not joking.\" Solo straightens his tie, which somehow even after a night in the chair is still smooth. \"I didn't tell you because you needed to not be murderous last night. For Gabby's sake. For all of us.\" \"You made this deal.\" Ilya doesn't know why it makes him so angry. Solo is a professional. So is he. But when it comes to her, there was supposed to be an understanding . They were supposed to deflect. \"I hate this deal.\" Solo snaps. \"So does Waverly.\" \"Then why-\" \"The chemist. The one Araldi gave up. We found schematics...it's bad. Bad enough that Araldi gets whatever he wants. The chemicals in that bomb are made for mass civilian targets. Hospitals. City streets. And it won't be quick. People will suffer.\" \"So she suffers instead. Without a choice.\" \"She will choose to finish the mission.\" From some drawer beside his bed, Solo produces a tiny silver flask and takes a very long drink. \"Damn the mission.\" \"And damn all the innocent people that will die?\" \"Yes. All of them.\" Solo's left eyebrow arches. \"If I thought you believed that, you'd be out. I'd call Waverly myself. We all knew what was in this line of work.\" \"I did. You did. She just wanted out of the Wall.\" \"This is her new life.\" Solo said. \"And ours. If we want to keep it- any of it- then we do the deals and agree to terms and when it's ugly we take it.\" The slightest crack in his voice. \"We can't always take it for her.\" \"That bastard will kill her.\" \"We'll be supervising.\"' \"He will kill her anyway. He is angry because she humiliated him. He doesn't want to fuck her. He wants to hurt her.\" \"We'll be supervising very closely. There'll be ground rules.\" \" Ground rules. You going to stand there and watch it, Cowboy? \" \"If I have to.\" Solo finishes off the flask and tosses it into the shadows. \"You certainly won't be able to do it.\" He eyes Ilya's shaking hands. \"Should I be worried for the furniture? You can break the end table if you like; it's hideous. I'm not overly attached to the chair either. Or you can go break another of his fingers. I'll pretend to stop you.\" Ilya considers the offer. He considers choking out the American, shooting the Italian, and carrying Gabby out to the car and running , somewhere, some edge of the earth, some place invisible... ….where he knows she would never forgive him. People will suffer. She would never accept that cost. \"How long until the exchange?\" he asks Solo. \"Thirty-six hours.\" \"Give me twenty-four\" \"Peril-\" \"I will find another way.\" \"You don't even know where to start-\" \"Gabby remembers a field. We will start there. Araldi didn't work alone. And he is not silent type. He talked to someone, and we will find that someone and we will make him talk to us.\" \" We-\" \"I am not leaving her here.\" \"She's not allowed to leave.\" Solo says. \"Agent Teller is a critical asset . She has to stay here until Araldi gives up the location of the bomb and the exchange site-\" \"You can pretend to stop me.\" Ilya almost smiles. \"I haven't gotten to hit you in a while.\" Solo rolls his eyes and yanks open the top drawer beside the bed. He tosses Ilya several bundles of money. \"Twenty four hours. Wear a tracker. Make her wear a tracker. Take the mission dossier. Something in it might be useful. Take the good guns and the card for my French contact.\" He flips a small business card in Ilya's direction. \"Waverly doesn't know about him yet. Tell him to get you whatever you want and I'll get him another Monet\" Ilya nods. \"If you come up empty-handed, you will bring her back and we will all do our job like the bastards we are. If you don't come back, I will send them to find you and bring her back. Partner or not.\" \"Understood.\" Ilya pockets the money and the card. He is already out the door when Solo's voice, unexpectedly taut, catches him in the back. \"Peril-\" He turns back around. \"Don't come back emptyhanded.\" He closes the door and it is like diving underwater. Araldi shouts at him, some profanity, some obscenity that he can't hear, that doesn't exist for him. He only hears the click of the doorknob to Gabby's room. Her breathing. Her body stirring under the blankets. He opens a black duffel and throws every single weapon he can find in the room into the bag. The medical kit. His own pile of money. His gadgets. Ammo clips. The passports. The trackers- which he does not know if he will activate- and the mission file. Gabby is still dressed from last night, good clothes, practical clothes. No beautiful dresses, no high heels. She is still asleep when he picks her up, still in her blankets, and carries her out of the hotel room. Down to the car. He sets her in the back seat, tucking the edges of the blanket around her, and when she starts to wake, he hushes her. Not yet, Gabby. Still sleep. She relaxes. He will wake her, but not here. He will tell her what they need to do, but he will not tell her why. He will lie. Invent some crisis. She'll believe him. He glances back up at the the window of the hotel room, Solo is a shadow watching them. Ilya closes his eyes. Draws a breath. A country house on a terrace. In front of it, a garden. In an avenue of trees, under an old poplar, stands a table for tea, with a samovar... The car's engine springs to life. Ten miles later, or twenty, long enough for the baguettes he bought fresh from a sleep bakery to have cooled, long enough for the stainless steel thermos of coffee to no longer scald their throats, he stops the car. Past dawn. Past sunrise, past the beauty of waking. It's just morning now. No visible sun, just gray light everywhere and nowhere. It's been thirty minutes since they left the hotel. He's already got the sense that they are too late, can feel seconds slipping past his skin like he's standing in a lake trying to catch minnows. His hands are bear hands. Clumsy and inefficient. He can't stop time. Gaby sits up in the backseat, wrapped in the blanket, eyes bleary and one hand un cradling her broken ribs. He hands her the bread without speaking. Unscrews the lid of the thermos and fills itfe with black coffee, which he tastes first, and when it doesn't burn his tongue, he passes it into her cold hands. She hunches over it as over a fire. Eats in silence. He drinks straight from the thermos, counting on the caffeine to counteract four nights of sleeping in snatches. After she was taken, he thought he could hold out until she was found, until he could sleep knowing she was in the next room again, safe. Then she came back and he realized he was wrong. No rooms were safe anymore. No spaces between bullets. No time between. Another five minutes. \"Where are we?\" She says. Hoarse. \"Why aren't we in the hotel?\" \"There is a new development.\" He says. \"We can't rely on Araldi anymore.\" \"Did you kill him?\" Her eyes, in the rearview, meet his. \"No.\" She looks back into her coffee. \"Why isn't Solo here?\" \"He's working another lead.\" \"We have no leads.\" \"He didn't work alone. We'll find his colleagues. We'll have conversations.\" \"You and Solo have ruined that word for me.\" A half-grin. Something in her is warming and it wakens him more than the coffee. \"Where are we going to find them?\" \"The last place he went.\" Her fingers whiten around the cap of the thermos. \"I don't think you were the only one he took there. Maybe someone knows something. Maybe someone saw something. Do you remember a house? A village?\" \"I was in the trunk.\" \"But later he was in the trunk. And you had the gun.\" He says this to remind her, that no matter what else happened in the field, she had the gun at the end. \"I drove too fast to see much.\" She said. \"But there was a town, not far from the field. A small place, a forgettable place. I scattered the chickens in the street. I passed an old factory outside town. Boarded up. But I thought I saw one of Araldi's men by the side door, smoking. I knew his face. I knew his cigarettes too.\" She touches a burn on the side of her neck. \"I thought I was imagining things. I kept driving. But maybe I was not imagining.\" \"Was that where they kept you?\" He is professional about this. \"I never saw the outside. But it could have been. The room was all concrete and steel. It smelled of old cat food. And other things, later.\" She says this with that same flatness as in the hotel room. Clinical. Calm. \"Move over.\" She tosses the crumbs from her baguette out the window and drains the last of the coffee. \"I'll drive.\" Gaby drives like she hates the car, like she wants to punish it, gears strained, engine hot, brakes grinding. White-knuckles on the wheel. Ilya checks and re-checks the guns and the ammo clips. Tucks the knives into their secret places. He reviews what he knows about the Vinciguerra operations. Local cells are small, discreet, easily movable. Victoria discouraged communication between cells; each head operative checked in with her directly, which meant her death left the operation disoriented. He has a theory growing in the back of his head that men like Araldi see this as an opportunity to reconsolidate. Maybe this arms deal was a way to assert his importance. He's not just local muscle, at least not anymore. But still authortarian. Enjoyed his power. His men wouldn't know what to do without him, not right away. They'd be waiting at the warehouse for him to come back. Maybe half a dozen. No more than ten. Ilya doesn't expect them to know anything, but he'll have conversations with them anyway. He'll let Gaby watch. Or maybe he'll watch. She's got an instinct for pain. She's better at this job than he wants to admit. The Vinceguerra protocol was to keep on-site information to a minimum, but if Araldi had ambitions, maybe he kept his own files. Maybe they'll be that lucky. If they aren't lucky, they'll have lost three hours, maybe four. He expects Solo will stick to his word- twenty hours until, as the American likes to say, the cavalry will come. Only it won't be a rescue. It'll be enforcement . He checks the gun again. Traces its sharp edges, its reassuring chill. They have time. He has time. Damn it. Gaby stops the car dead center in an empty dirt road thirty miles into nowhere. She leans her forehead against the steering wheel and rolls down the window. Outside, birdsong against silence. Smell of dirt and sun. The engine idling. \"Here.\" She says. \"It was here. I remember the broken stone wall.\" Ilya follows her gaze out the window, to the field. In the sunlight it is unremarkable. Almost tranquil. Add a few peasant women in scarves and it could be a scene from one the paintings Napoleon can't keep from stealing. Something Old World and expensive. Gaby's hands are shaking at her sides. He covers the back of her neck with his hand, rubs the taut muscles. Reminds her that she is here and he is here. \"Keep driving.\" He says. \"Keep driving and it will be just a field.\" He says this to comfort her but he knows he's wrong. He knows she's drawing out the same kind of map in her head that he has in his own mind, the same kind that Solo has, the map all of them carry. Places of harm. Places of smallness. Places not to remember and not to forget. \"We should talk about how we're going to handle the factory.\" \"No talk.\" Ilya says. \"You stay in car. Watch exits. Shoot anyone who tries to run. I will clear the building and then radio you.\" \"No.\" She bites her lip, her jaw set into the familiar hard line that he knows means an argument. \"I'm not staying.\" \"You do not need to go back into that place.\" He says. \"Is not useful. You have injury.\" \"I can handle it.\" She glares at him. \"We should be strategic.\" He keeps his face impassive. They've had this argument dozens of times. He rarely wins. \"Someone has to do surveillance. Solo isn't here.\" \"I am clearing that building with you.\" She shifts the car into gear. \"With my own gun.\" Stay behind me, he says, but she doesn't. She's small and fast, sometimes he forgets how fast, and she runs ahead and takes the guard by the door without even stopping. One shot kill. \"Keep them alive,\" He holds her back. \"We have to ask questions.\" She nods but he isn't sure she's heard him. He isn't sure she can hear anything, she's already on fire, already white hot. She's already pulled away from him and kicked in the door, because she doesn't care what is waiting on the other side, because she wouldn't even feel the bullet that killed her. At this point he realizes this is not a tactical strike. Not information retrieval. This is a siege. He has to get in front of her. She's not a good shot yet, but she keeps firing until two more fall and return fire drives her behind a desk, splintering wood in her face. Three men fire down at them from the second floor but he takes them quickly. A tug at his left sleeve; a familiar burn of a bullet just close enough to graze. Her eyes black and wide. \"Schite.\" She rolls out from behind the desk, barrels down the hall, blind, screaming at the poor bastard who's ducking around the doorway for a second shoot. She is faster. She was probably aiming for his face but she got his gut instead, a messy shot, blood-blooms and viscera. Ilya pulls her down just before the wall beside her splinters after another barrage from further down the hall. He covers her (indignant, screaming) while he returns fire until the shooting stops. Until more blood blooms. \"Watch hallway.\" He pants. \"I empty rooms.\" Back to back, they work the rest of the hall. No more shooting. Each room opens to silence. \"There should be more of them.\" He says. \"There was an office,\" she says. \"Left at the end of the hall. When they left my door open, I could see in the window. Papers. Maps. Filing cabinets. Some squirrely fuck with a camera.\" The office is empty by the time they get there. Papers scattered. A mug of coffee still steaming beside a half-burnt cigarette. An open back door, and a scrawny man in shirt-sleeves clutching a briefcase and running for his car. Gaby launches herself after him while Ilya (pragmatic because one of them has to be) shoots the tires out from the car. When Gaby catches up to the man he shoves the briefcase into her ribs and she screams, but holds onto him, so he hits her again, then again, and that third hit finall drops her. Her fingers wrap around his ankle, tug him down with her. He fumbles, clumsy, for his gun but Ilya catches his hand. Breaks the wrist. Also the elbow. The man curls into himself, whimpering as Ilya holds him by the neck. Gaby yanks the camera from the man's neck and shoves it in his face. Flash. He looks away. \"Not so much fun now, is it kakerlake ?\" \"Is he useful to us?\" Ilya holds his gun whisper-soft against the back of the man's ear. \"He and Araldi talked a lot. He was always in the office. Or in the room. With his camera.\" \"Then we will have conversation.\" It is a good thing, to drag the man sniveling and sobbing into the building. To feel his pulse jump and shimmy. This is what he promised her. Intimate retribution. He dumps the man on the office floor as Gaby sets the briefcase on the desk. Her hand moves to her ribs. \"Are you alright?\" Ilya asks her. She nods. \"Just breathing.\" \"I need to clear the rest of the building. Stay with him. If he causes trouble, shoot his knees out.\" The man yelps. \"Your arm-\" She says. \"Will wait. Just a scratch.\" He doesn't want to leave her alone, here, and she reads his hesitation. Straightens her shoulders, drops her hand from her ribs. \"Go. I am fine.\" Her whole body is shaking but the hand holding the gun- that hand is firm. Now it is good that they are apart because he can focus only on the things he knows by heart. Muscle memory. Sweep the room. Check the bodies. Repeat. He could do it blind. He finds one last hostile- some thug with a knife- and the kill is impersonal. It is clean, sharp-edged. She clouds things. She makes him hate the men who shoot at her, who come at her with knives or pipes or fists, she makes him want to- need to- dissemble them. She makes it matter too much, like someone has taken out some essential organ he even realized he had inside him and now parades it, raw and quivering, in front of everyone. She is an exposed nerve. When he holds her in bed after the missions, it is as much for this reason as any other: to tuck this part of him back inside himself. He reaches the last room satisfied, like he's stretched cramped muscles. It's a dark room. Clotheslines of photos. He collects them into a cardboard box so they can examine them later, and the first row is useful- bits and pieces of promisingly sinister machinery outside other promisingly non-descript warehouses- but farther back into the room the pictures change. All of them are of the same tiny room, but the women in the pictures are different. An old woman. A whore. A pudgy middle-aged brunette. A young waitress still in her uniform. A small girl, whose face he cannot look at because it will gut him. He cannot let himself acknowledge what is happening to them in the pictures; he must remind himself that they are already gone, disembodied, ghosts. He cannot enter the photo and stop their suffering. This works until the last group of pictures. This works until it's Gaby. Ilya has the same feeling he did in his dream about the potato field, that he is standing witness to something that he simultaneously cannot endure and cannot stop. She is frozen in those moments, unreachable to him in her pain, in her nakedness, in her fear. He can't enter that space. The red mist descends. After it clears, he stands in the wreckage of the room, staring at the pictures for too long. Studying them. He will want to remember exactly what Araldi is doing, in these pictures. Exactly what he owes. The gunshot interrupts him. And the scream. It is not her scream- he knows her scream- but still he runs. She sits in the office chair, swiveling back and forth, bleeding from her temple. Her gun trained on the squirming man clutching what is left of his right knee. \"The damn filing cabinet was locked.\" She said. \"He said he had a key in his pocket. He headbutted me. Knocked me into the desk and tried to run. He didn't get far.\" She glares at him like she's considering shooting him again. \"I found the key myself.\" She gestures to the stack of files on the desk. \"What took so long?\" \"Loose ends.\" Ilya says. \"But the building is safe. We can talk to him now.\" Gaby hops up from the chair and walks across the hall. Ilya follows her to a rusty metal door, which she pushes open. She stands in the doorway and considers the room: cement floor, one lightbulb, a chair bolted to the center of the floor. Shackles in the corner, by a filthy mat. \"I bled more than I thought,\" she says, kicking at the edge of the mat. \"I thought I was going to die in that corner,\" she says. Then corrects herself. \"Wait, that's wrong.\" She points to a large ceramic bathtub also bolted to the floor. Rust and blood and a small fingernail that matches what's missing from her left hand. \"There. I thought I would die there.\" She folds her arms over her ribs, an unconscious protective gesture. \"It was supposed to be an ice bath, you know, like for crazy people, but they kept fucking running out of ice. I kept laughing at them. Araldi got impatient and just held me down.\" She isn't talking to him anymore. She's talking to the fucking tub, like it can hear her, like it remembers her. \"Gaby.\" he turns her face back toward him. Holds it between his hands so that she can't see the room, so that she just sees him. Steady. \"Go outside. It's warm out there.\" She nods and walks straight across the hall, over the blood and the broken man, right out into the sunlight. Sits down, halfway across the parking lot. Her crying rises like bird-wing, like a sudden, startled flight. Ilya doesn't go to her. If he steps out the door after her, she'll shut it down and she needs to let it all leave her. She needs to cry alone, for now. And he has work to do. Ilya rolls up his sleeves. Grabs the camera man by the ankles, drags him across the hall like pulling a trout out of the river. Throws him, screaming, into the tub and there are fucking straps at the bottom. That's what happened to her. Over and over and over. Ilya looses it a little, the red mist rushing up. By the time it clears he's choked the bastard unconscious. Damn. He pulls the swivel chair across the floor, blood streaking behind. He turns on the water and waits. The water climbs up to the little trout's chest when he wakes and opens his mouth to scream again but Ilya pushes him under just enough, just enough to fill his mouth and nose. Stands back. Lets him sputter. \"You are going to die in here.\" He says. \"You will bleed out or drown. It will take a while. Or you will get lucky.\" He pushes the man under water again. Waits. This time, there's no screaming, just gasping. Oxygen is becoming more important than pain. \"Araldi is ours now. You can't help him, but you can help yourself.\" Ilya submerges him again, longer. He remembers the negatives in the dark room and it is harder than it should be to let him up. He almost wait too long. \"Where is the exchange?\" The trout sputters something, shakes his head. Ilya reaches into the bloody bathwater and cups the man's shattered kneecap. Not ungently. \"Did you take the pictures for yourself?\" He tightens his fingers. The man begins to squeal. High-pitched. He shakes his head again. \"For Araldi?\" Ilya asks him. The man nods. Ilya squeezes tighter. \"And you just took the pictures, right?\" The man nods his head. Vigorously. Ilya holds up the picture of Gaby that had been in his hand when he'd heard the gunshot, the one he couldn't leave behind. Holds it right in the man's face. \"How about her?\" \"Didn't...hurt …. her...\" The man gasps. \"You just took pictures.\" Ilya nods. He leans close. \"Ask yourself if that matters to me.\" The man begins to weep. Snot and tears and sobbing. \"I will sit in that chair for three minutes. Then either you decide how you die or I do.\" Four minutes later, the gunshot echoes. Five minutes later, Ilya rinses his hands. He goes in search of gasoline, which is always somewhere in these places. There are always matches. Always things to burn. He locates both, and empties the entirety into the darkroom. Flicks the match. He adds the relevant maps and files to the cardboard box of photos and leaves the warehouse. Outside, she's still cross-legged on the pavement, ragged-edged and red-eyed and she's turned her face up to the sun and he just watches her, at first. Watches her soak it in. She doesn't ask about the smoke billowing from the building. Doesn't ask about the conversation. Doesn't know to ask about the picture folded in his pocket. \"Where are we going?\" She says. \"Belgrade.\" \"Should we radio Solo-\" \"No time.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Get the car.\" \"We're driving to Belgrade?\" \"To Paris. Flying to Belgrade. You drive. I will look through the files.\" \"Or we just go back to the hotel. Or to the CIA safehouse. Where there are resources-\" \"I said no time.\" His hands tighten on the suitcase. He digs the keys out of his pocket and hold them out to her. \"Look on the bright side. You get to drive.\" Her eyes narrow when she looks at him, like there's a question the edge of her silence, but she shakes it away and grabs the keys from him instead. They leave the warehouse and all of its rooms behind them. No time to watch it burn. He looks up from the files and photographs with a dull headache and the sign flashes He hates Paris. He is unimpressed with the city of fucking light, with its open air cafes and wistful artists scrambling everywhere like paint-covered vermin. The Eiffel Tower is medicore to him. The shopping is good, yes, but he's rarely shopping for himself and while he's found a certain amount of pleasure in putting Gabby in the most lavish things Waverly can afford, it's always for The Mission. The old bookstores are the only redemption, filled with titles he can't get back home, and he has to force himself not to horde, not to swallow the books whole because he doesn't know how long this will last. The books. The dresses. Gabby. Any of it. Maybe that's why he hates the city. Because the only way he can experience it with her is in-between everyone else's plans. Agendas. Time tables. He wants to take her to Leningrad, to the Church of the Resurrection, to lay in the summer by the Neva, to buy her flowers and soda from the street vendors, to read Chekov to her naked in a half-dark room. He wants long, still afternoon hours. He needs to stop thinking this way. It is counter-productive. He hands Gabby the card Napoleon gave him. \"This address.\" \"This is not the contact we used last time.\" \"It's not UNCLE.\" She brakes. Ungently. The stack of his pictures in his lap fall to the floor. \"This is wrong.\" \"You are correct. You brake too fast.\" \"Not what I meant, Ilya.\" She glares at him in the rearview mirror. \"We leave Solo with an informant to go information gathering but we don't take any of the information back to Solo. We get a lead but we don't call it in. We're flying across Europe but it's not for UNCLE. What are you not telling me?\" He bends and picks up the pictures. Arranges them. Corner to corner. \"Is this a KGB thing?\" she asks him. \"Do they want something from this mission? Are they leaning on you?\" She says this with an endearing indignance, as if she would march up to the Kremlin and punch someone in the nose. \"Ilya, answer me. Or I'm driving us back to Rouen.\" He tucks the pictures back into the briefcase. \"We don't trust Araldi.\" He said. \"Waverly thinks he's our best option at stopping this arms deal. Solo and I have doubts. So we're working both ends. He's there with Araldi. We are here. In Paris. Flying to Belgrade. When we have something solid, we'll bring UNCLE back in.\" This is a good lie. It surprises him how good it is, and pains him, that it's easier than he thought to use her trust in him against her better judgment. Her fingers curl, uncurl, curl around the white leather steering wheel. \"Maybe I will say I believe you,\" she said. \"But this is not Ilya. You're the one who always fills out his paperwork and who has memorized the contents of every protocol file we've ever been handed. You don't race around Europe burning down warehouses because you don't like the mission parameters.\" This time she turns around, leans over the back seat. Touches his forehead, right where it aches, smoothes out the wrinkles. \"If it was something else, you could tell me. I know what it's like to be entangled. You can trust me.\" \"I know.\" he pulls her hand to his mouth, kisses her palm. \"Now can you drive without more of the whiplash? It is bad for my back.\" She rolls her eyes and they are on the road again. She wants to stop at her favorite cafe for baguettes and brie and wine, some hole-in-the-wall by the river, and he leaves her at a sidewalk table to find a quiet phone booth. He isn't sure how Solo is going to like this. The phone rings, rings, rings. \"Hello?\" Solo sounds tired or pissed or both. \"The Matisse is obviously a fake.\" (It was Solo's turn to choose the call signs. Obviously.) \"But the buyer will pay full price anyway.\" A sigh. \"Tell me some good news. I'm on the verge of locking our guest in the closet for the rest of his visit.\" \"She took us back to the warehouse.\" \"Was it occupied?\" \"We cleared it. We had conversations.\" \"We?\" \"I had conversations. She waited outside.\" The art of these conversations was another thing neither of them wanted Gabby to know how to do, even though eventually she would need to know. Another thing they were delaying. \"They must not have realized Araldi was taken. All their information was on-site. An office, a dark room. We took what was important.\" \"What did you find out?\" \"The meeting is in Belgrade.\" Solo grunts. \"Yugoslavia. Think Tito is involved?\" \"Maybe. Maybe not.\" \"Be careful. He's not going to fond of a very obviously Russian agent and a very obviously German agent poking around his backyard.\" \"We will be careful.\" \"You'll be out of range of the trackers.\" \"Yes.\" \"I look to your ridiculously impeccable sense of duty to keep our terms in mind.\" \"I am hanging up now.\" \"Peril-\" \"What?\" \"The conversations...was it someone involved with her?\" \"A photographer.\" Solo's silences are always unexpected and this one stretches whole seconds. Ilya feels obligated to do something, to say something useful. \"I shot him in a bathtub.\" \"Is that all?\" \"There was more. Before I shot him.\" An exhalation. \"Carry on then.\" Ilya rolls his eyes; Solo picks up Waverly's annoying English chirpiness when he's trying to be light and deft about something horrible. \"Goodbye Cowboy.\" He hangs up and considers Solo's estimation of his impeccable sense of duty . Delivering Gaby to Araldi would not be the worst thing he has done. Not by half. Especially since she would agree, would go herself if she knew the stakes. Would shout at him for not telling her, would throw some useless object in the hotel room at his head in a small and righteous indignation. Giving her up will not be the bloodiest thing, or the most painful thing, or the most costly thing, but it's the first thing he might be incapable of doing. When it comes down to it, he isn't certain his body would obey, even if his brain somehow consented. He doesn't know if he'll be able to to make his muscles hold still, how to lock his bones in place. He doesn't have to know. He won't have to know. Damn it. He calls Solo's Frenchman and offers him a Monet in exchange airplane tickets and passports: the usual favors. He returns to Gaby, who is sitting at her table surrounded by sunlight, and takes her to the small, dark room where they'll wait for their contact. All this will take time. Hours lost. She asks him why he's pacing and he lies about a weather headache even though outside it is a beautiful day. She tells him to step away from the suitcase of photos and maps and lie down on the old blue sofa beside her, even though it won't fit them both, and she pulls him against her, like a child, and covers his face with her hands and tells him he can stop for a minute, he can stop. She is wrong. He can't. But he can't do anything else until the papers arrive, so he does let her push his eyes close, and he does let her wrap her arms around him like some kind of advance consolation. \"Something is wrong about this mission. You are wrong.\" \"I am fine.\" He realizes she won't be satisfied with this and hastily amends it. \"Tired.\" \"You can sleep.\" \"Not here.\" \"If it is the KGB-\" \"Not the KGB. The weather makes my head hurt and I am tired and you are making me better. We can stop talking now. \"I don't believe you.\" She sighs and lowers her head to lean it against his shoulder. \"Just...tell me before it becomes a problem, right? I can't be your partner if I don't know what we're up against.\" He could say: We're up against weights and measures, against things meted out and balanced and your pain versus someone elses and the ruthless equilibrium that all of us are fighting to maintain and we're up against the fact that you weigh more to me than any of it and that is terrifying He could ask her to read Chekov: It's in the mission bag, although he doesn't remember packing it. When one has no real life, one lives by mirages. It's still better than nothing. Or he could sit and close his eyes and he'll keep count of the minutes, he will. He'll know how much time this has cost. Down to the second. He'll know... She prods him in the ribs- not sharply but not gently. Briskly. She waves their airline tickets in front of his face. \"You get to be Aleksandr. You are a buyer for some machinist corportation. It's an excuse to poke around factories. I get to be the secretary. My name is Dragna. I sound like a scary grandmother\" She rolls her eyes. \"Someday I can be the buyer and you can be my secretary.\" \"I wouldn't look good in heels.\" \"You don't know that.\" She smiles. Not sharply but not gently. \"But we can discuss it on the plane. You've had your nap.\" \"You let me sleep?\" He stands, awake. \"We are on mission.\" \"You're no good to us dead tired, Aleksandr.\" \" I could sleep on plane.\" \"Or you could sleep here while I took my turn with the files.\" He waits for her next words, waits to find out if she found her picture and if she's going to throw the phone at his head for taking it but that picture is still in his pocket. Out of harm's way. He doesn't know what he's going to say when he shows it to her. He blinks the thought away and focuses on what she's saying. \"Every two weeks for the past six weeks, there's been serious money going into Yugoslavia. Some of it looks like the normal bribery of local officials and other pocket-padding but some of it goes to this guy Emil Borislav. His family owns a chain of pickle warehouses. I think we should visit him first.\" She taps the paper. \"It has his address.\" \"When does our flight leave?\" \"One hour.\" She tosses him half a wrapped sandwich. \"Eat. I've already packed what matters. We'll call Waverly about the rest.\" \"No need.\" Ilya says, \"One hour. Let's go.\" He's trying to remember the last time he flew to Yugoslavia, how much time it will cost them. Four hours? Six hours? Eight? \"You never leave evidence unaccounted for.\" \"One hour. Grab the bag.\" \"Ilya.\" She grabs his wrist. Her eyes the same dark as when the bullet grazed him earlier. She is worried. She bites her lower lip. He almost tells her everything, then, but instead he steers them both out the door, into the night. She says nothing but she moves her arm away from him, folds it into herself. She follows him with curt, efficient steps. While they drive to the airport, she drills him on the details of their cover story. Her eyes never leave the road. She makes him eat the sandwich before they get out of the car, makes him promise at least to call Solo to tell him they're leaving a car full of possibly-probably-likely important information parked in some back lot of the airport. She hunches over the paper cup of airport coffee, and the flourescent lights bring out all the bruises and the cuts and the shadows. She's got a story for that. Reckless boyfriend. Motorbike accident. He can't even brush her hair out of her face because she's a proper secretary; she won't even take a cup of coffee from his hand, insists she gets it herself and she's still limping and the old woman with the small dog two seats from them glares at him like she knows it's his fault. It's going to be a long plane ride. Ilya sits on the couch, his hands in fists, his fists in front of him, and blood everywhere. On his knuckles, on the couch, on his shirt and the cuff of his pants and on the floor spreading over an olive green rug. Gaby screaming at him from across the room what did you do what did you do he was just an old man damn it you Russian bastard what did you do to him what the fuck were you thinking Ilya tries to remember. The plane landed, but was delayed on the tarmac. For two hours they sat and sweated in seats that were too small for him and the whole while he could feel the time sliding out. Like blood out of a cut. He had to wait, pinned in place, while arrogant men in crumpled uniforms asked questions for the pure pettiness of it. He couldn't tell Gaby why he kept fidgeting. Why he let an insult slip at just the wrong moment and cost them another hour in some cigarette-foul back room until Gaby could charm the fat little customs official into letting them go. He remembers all this clearly. They found the address of the man who owned the pickle warehouses. He told Gaby to wait in the car. She objected, annoyed at his slip at the airport. But he had thought she listened to him. An old man, in shirt-sleeves, met him at the door with a cigarette and Ilya thought he asked the question but maybe he just broke his nose. The conversation was a blur. He kept demanding information and the old man kept breaking and bleeding and knew nothing and Ilya knew this but he couldn't stop because if there wasn't a different answer he was going to have to call Solo and tell him nothing . And they'd take Gaby back. So he kept hitting and waiting for the man to say something. He remembers this less clearly. Only she hadn't waited in the car. Not long enough at any rate. She'd launched herself at him like a small hurricane and beaten him back from the old man's unconscious body. Bent over the broken body and breathed into it like it was someone who mattered to her, pounded the crushed chest like she could make the heart beat, and then when she could not, rocked back onto her heels and now she is cursing him with everything in her. And he sits on the couch, staring at the blood on his hands Which is very clear. \"We don't have time,\" he says. \"To what, Ilya? To not kill our only lead in the first five minutes?\" She has blood on her knees. She doesn't wipe it off. It looks like she's a girl who's skinned her legs on a bike. He should take her home, to her family, should make sure she gets there safe and he almost remembers why this is impossible. \"You have got to talk to me.\" Her voice thin, shaking, controlled. \"You have got to tell me what is going on.\" \"We had twenty-four hours.\" He said. \"We have four left. It's not enough.\" \"No,\" she says, \"We hav time before the exchange.\" \"Something else is going to happen first.\" She shakes her head and it is not pity, it is disgust, and she's right to be that way. \"You make no sense. I'm going to call Solo.\" \"No!\" It bursts out of his chest, a growl, and he grabs her wrist, harder than he means too, in a panic. She slaps him and she means it, no warning blows, she draws blood from his upper lip, but he doesn't let go and it could have gone somewhere even worse between them when a set of big black boots kick through the door. Light fills the room and sparkles in all the blood. A man curses in Croatian, and- when his eyes land on Ilya- in Russian, for good measure. Ilya knows the uniform- secret police. Chert. Damn it. Other sets of boots swarm in this man, like he's a rock in a river, something impassable, something Ilya knows they are not going to be able to paddle around. He lets go of Gabby's wrist and spits his blood onto the floor and gets ready to systematically disassemble men and cause at least one international incident. But she wraps her arms around him, and it's not violent, it's not even insistent. It's featherlight , and she's getting blood all over her turtleneck but she doesn't complain. Es lohnt sich nicht , she whispers, in her own language. It's not worth it . And then, because the men with boots are pulling them apart and his muscles tense, spring-coiled, she appeals to him in his own tongue: Ostavaysya so mnoy. Stay with me. She lifts her hands above her heads and kneels. A ring of men with guns are shouting at him. Klekni. Klekni. On your knees. He doesn't remember obeying. He blanks before he hits the floor. He doesn't touch a one of them, not even when they slam their boots into his ribs and into the of his back and into his groin and into his face, until Gabby wriggles her tiny and defiant body between them and hollers, in a mix of German and Russian, that if they fucking kick him one more time, the KGB is personally going to use their balls to sharpen their knives after she tears them off with her fucking teeth. The Immovable Man in the center of the room grunts at this and all the pain disappears, not that he felt it. He isn't there. He's not even with Gabby. He's with Chekov. A country house on a terrace. In front of it, a garden. Ostavaysya so mnoy. Stay with me. \"You are KGB,\" the Immovable Man says, in Russian. \"Nyet.\" She says. \"But he is. You can run it. Call Moscow. Ask about Ilya Fucking Kuryakin then go get a fresh change of underwear. Or we can help each other. If you got here this fast, you were listening in. Probably from a van that smells of cabbage.\" Immovable Man stares at her, rock-blank. \"We'll come with you,\" Gaby says, \"because we have questions for you. We'll answer whatever questions we can. Stick us in whatever room you want while you figure it out but don't you fucking touch us. I'm not KGB but my friends have knives to sharpen too.\" Ilya is a bit dazed, by now, at how much she reminds him of a pit bull. He half excepts her to lunge at Immovable Man's throat but she stays beside him, no, in front of him, and she will. Not. Budge. \"Help them up,\" the man says. \"We'll walk.\" She gets up. Smoothes her hair. Glares at Ilya to get his ass off the ground. He will follow her, because right now he'll follow her anywhere, follow that incandescent glow that's rising up from her skin and fucking hell he has to get control of his head. Es lohnt sich nicht A country house on a terrace. Ostavaysya so mnoy. In front of it, a garden. Stay with me. Until the end, he will tell her. He can only leave her by cataclysm: fire, wind, water, moving earth. He can only leave when the entire world wrenches out from under his feet, which by his watch is four hours from now. She's right- the van smells like cabbage. The tiny cinderblock cell they walk into- walk, because that was the deal, but it's still unfriendly- somehow also smells like cabbage, and also bleach. It's the bleach the worries him. That means things were done here that had to be erased after. And they were sloppy; there are brown flecks of old blood in the crease between the cement floor and the wall. She doesn't see this, and he won't tell her. She paces. He crouches on the balls of his feet, in the center of the room, back to the wall, and he balances his fits carefully one on each knee. She stops pacing, takes one look from his head to his toes, and bangs on the door. A smoking man in uniform eventually answers. \"Get me a towel,\" she says. \"There's blood everywhere.\" He shrugs. \"Whose fault is that?\" \"Do you want to clean it up later?\" He grunts. She gets her towel. She squats before him and leans on her toes, like a ballerina, both of them holding all their weight on the tiniest points. Both of them balancing. She wipes the blood from his face, the splatter that isn't his, the split lip that is her handiwork, the speckles on his neck, on his clothes, on his arms and hands. She is thorough, and silent. When she is done, she folds the towel in a square. \"Why is there only four hours?\" She says. \"What else is happening first?\" \"The bomb we are looking for is not ordinary bomb.\" he said. \"I know.\" \"We have no time and no good options. Araldi has the good cards.\" \"I know.\" \"He has conditions.\" The muscles in her jaw tighten \"Go on.\" \"You are the condition.\" She leans back, onto her heels, away from him. A half-smile. \"I pissed him off, didn't I?\" \"Yes. And that's why we both know this isn't going to be about sex. It will be about something else. You know what else.\" She wraps her arms around her broken ribs. \"I know what else.\" \"Solo gave me twenty-four hours to find something. I think we have found something. You were right. That old man was good lead. I think the factory is not making pickles. But we don't have time to find out. And it's my fault.\" \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"I thought we could fix it first.\" He clenches and unclenches his fist. \"It's not your decision,\" she says. \"It's my decision. It has always been my decision. You should have let me make it.\" \"You would do your job.\" \"Yes. I would do my job. I know Waverly. He's told me what to do in these...situations. Play along. Make nice. Call for backup if you need to.\" \"It won't be like that. This isn't some fat accountant who likes a bit of fucking along with his red wine and rare steak. Araldi is different. He devours things.\" \"I will do my job.\" A fainter whisper, this time. \"I'm going to call Solo.\" \"Wait.\" He kneels, toward her, not touching her, but close enough. He pulls at the waistband of his pants, tugs it down past his hip to show her the brand that after these years is white but still angry, still visible. P.K. \"Look at it.\" he says. \"Touch it if you want. Understand it.\" She does touch it, featherlight , fingers a whisper, and he has to control his flinch even though the skin does not feel it. \"Did the KGB give you that?\" \"A commander. But before I was in KGB. When I was still a boy. Thirteen. He visited my mother. After a while, he decided he wanted to visit me too. This let the other KGB officers know that I was preferred. He liked my mother to watch when he preferred me. Liked her to know there was nothing she could do. He took special interest in my military training. He taught me to do anything and kill anything...except him. He was untouchable. \" \"Ilya-\" She leans forward, so her forehead is against his. Gently tugs up the waistband of his pants and covers the spot on his hip with her cupped palm. \" \"Some men are not men. Some men just are teeth.\" She closes her eyes, shakes her head. \"There were not-men in my family, remember? They killed people too. Devoured them, like you say. My uncle-\" \"You don't owe the world for what he did. Or your father. Or any of them.\" \"Maybe I do.\" She says. \"Maybe if I suffer enough, it will be over-\" \"You can never suffer enough for it to be over.\" He says. \"I have tried.\" \"People are going to die.\" \"People are always going to die.\" \"Damn it, Ilya. Stop.\" \"I told myself, when I was being preferred , that I would not be my mother. I would not watch someone I love-\" \"Love?\" She is bewildered. He can't unthread the word; it's spinning out between them now. But maybe he can wind it back, just a bit. \"Among other words.\" He says, pulling back from her to the wall. This time it is her hand that catches him around the wrist. A strong circle of her fingers. The door opens. Immovable Man appears. \"M16 girl,\" he says. \"We talk now. The Red Peril stays there. And behaves. Maybe we talk to him too. Or maybe we hang him from the ceiling until KGB comes to collect him. Understand?\" \"Understood.\" She turns back to Ilya. \"Love is a good word.\" She says, And don't worry,\" she leans even closer, kisses him on the lip she herself split, three quick, fast kisses, benedictory kisses. \"You won't have to watch.\" She walks away from him, towards the the Immovable Man, towards the wedge of brighter light coming through the half-open door. He filters two dozen logistics through his head. Nothing works. They are out of time. People they don't know are waiting for them to save their lives. The men with teeth are hungry. The entire bent corkscrew of the world spirals to her walking out of the door, and it always has, ever since Araldi walked into their hotel room. The past twenty four hours wasn't going to work. It was always an exercise in consolation, and Solo knew it, and Ilya himself knew it. Now she knows this, knows all of it, as clearly as Ilya does himself. She doesn't look back. When she is gone, it is somehow easier. Not gone from the room- that part is unbearable, when she is just on the other side of the door but receding, like tide, like foam on the sea- but later, when the nice men in suits collect her for the flight back to France. When there is truly nothing he can do. Then it gets easier. Helplessness is its own mercy, and its own clarity. For the first time since they got off the plane in Yugoslavia, he is no longer running out of time. Time has run out. He is suspended in only the now . He can think, instead of twitch and shudder and flail and grasp. He can draw a breath. The old man. The seller of pickles. The warehouses. He calls for Immovable Man and slides into the Red Peril persona, cold and arrogant and not afraid to remind them who the bigger dog between their two countries. He lays it out plainly: they can give him the men he needs to investigate the warehouses, and when they turn up the bioweapons they'll all get medals- probably from two countries. He is exaggerating, at this point, but he wants them wet and feverish with pride and with glory. There might be substantial displays of gratitude. At this point he sounds like Solo, shamelessly selling an idea to people just unhappy enough with their current life to buy it. Immovable Man is capable. His boots are glossy mirror-finished, his uniform crisp enough to cut your finger if you run it down a crease. He aspires to more than cabbage-stinking surveillance vans and local squabbles. This mission is important. The M16 girl had to be gotten out of the way. The British were always too curious for their own good. But this was Mother Russia's business. Mother took good care of her friends. If they declined, he'd go alone. If they tried to stop him, he'd kill a regrettable number of them and go alone anyway. Mother Russia would be angry. She had a long memory, and it could be a gift or a curse. Up to them. The Immovable Man drums his fingers on the desk. Then he smiles. Comrade. Ilya gets an entire patrol, and the return of his gun. It will take them time to fly her to Paris. More time more to drive her to the hotel. He can fight a small war by that time, and he will. What happens next happens in flashes, between bullets, between explosions, between discoveries. The room beneath the warehouse, with the laboratory and the rows and rows of hospital gurneys with straps. The smell of fresh bleach from a hasty cleanup. The incinerator left running. Burnt bone and singed hair and the after-stench of flesh. The reel of video footage, and the picture. Testing, testing. Vomit on the floor, after three of the local boys can't take it anymore. But Ilya watches. Takes notes. The virus is liquid borne. Not aerosol. It will have to be deposited into a water source. It will spread quickly and kill lavishly. But it requires generous dosing. They'll have to transport it in something large and inconspicuous A train track snakes out from the warehouse into the night. There are always trains, the local boys say, they move the brine for the pickles in great vats. Ilya can only just keep himself from running down the track on foot. He is so close. He tells them to close every meter of track. Every centimeter of road, every fucking goat path and cow trail. Nothing on wheels moves until they say. If he could just reach his hand out far enough down the rail line, if he could just close it on the burning metal of the engine, he could wrestle it down himself. If he could just reach. Four hours, thirty four minutes, fifty- nine seconds later, Ilya sits in what he thinks is a grocer's shop and clutches a heavy black phone. He grocer woman looks at him in sheer terror, as if he is something come to hunt them. Something from folk lore. And maybe he is: he staggered out of the woods into her shop and promised her all the money she could imagine for the use of her phone. Which he now struggles to hold it; three of his fingers are broken. His other hand burned, missing fingernails. Blood soaking his shirt, most of it not his but enough of it his that standing up is a struggle. He thinks the engineer with the knife got his ribs. Sometime before the train derailment. Or during the fire that followed. All of that is blurry. The world blinks black and white around him; his brain fires and fires and he clutches the phone. Tries to remember the number for their hotel. Sways. His legs buckle and he falls to his knees, still clutching the phone. The room swims. The number in his head swims. A hotel room. Something is ringing, a bell, like on a bike, ringing, ringing, it won't let him think, but then Solo's voice- \"Illya? Illya?\" \"I have it\" he says, not really into the phone. \"Illya? What?\" He holds it to his mouth. \"I have bomb. I have it. Go get her.\" \"Waverly will want proof-\" \"I will bring the proof. Go.\" The phone clicks dead and he lets the receiver dangle, staring into the silent mouthpiece and wondering if he pushes it to his lips could she feel it? It's his last thought when his brain blinks black. The grocer woman is kind through her fear: she wakes him. Pushes a paper cup of black coffee into his hand. Says that his friends have come for him. Immovable Man's shiny shoes wait for him in the doorway. A car that smells of cabbage can take him to a hospital, which he will not stay at He collects the necessary files from the Immovable Man's office and boards a plane before the hasty bandages are even done seeping blood. He doesn't wash the smoke from his skin. The hotel room is naked and empty- the cleaner team has removed all the furniture for processing on the usual pretense of bedbugs. Every fiber and fleck of their presence, every blood stain and hair, every wire and shell casing, every residue gone. Right down to the mattresses. It is unusual for Ilya to be in one of their hotel rooms after cleaning. Normally the team is already elsewhere by this time, but here he is, and here Solo is, standing a rectangle of light on the bare floor. Ilya insisted on coming back here for the debrief. It has to be here. \"I heard you derailed a train.\" Solo says. \"A small train.\" Ilya shrugs. \"I had some local help. For part of it.\" Solo smirks \"Keep that efficiency up; I could use a vacation.\" \"Where is she?\" \"Paris, I think. Waverly thought she should have some down time.\" \"Araldi?\" \"Set to be transferred from to sunny Miami later this afternoon.\" \"Svin'ya.\" \"I agree.\" \"Are you going to tell me what happened? After she got back?\" \"No.\" Solo says. \"Cowboy-\" \"She wasn't in there long. You interrupted.\" \"And you wouldn't have.\" \"Not if she was still doing her job.\" Ilya's fist clenches, which of course Solo notices. \"You don't want to hit me,\" he says. \"Where is he? The safehouse?\" \"Waverly made a deal. You know how the English are about those sorts of things.\" \"I made a promise. You stay here and smoke.\" \"Not a damn chance.\" Solo flicks the cigarette butt into the corner, like a dead cockroach. I owe him something too.\" It's not him that I owe , Ilya thinks. He held her in the dark. He'd made promises. Solo understands this, and in the end, after the violent and righteous work they do together in the conversation room of the safehouse, it's Ilya alone with these promises and Araldi. Promises he keeps. (after) When he finds her in the little room in Paris, after it's done, there are things neither of them can say. He doesn't ask her what happened after she left him in Belgrade. She doesn't ask him how Araldi died. He brings baguettes, champagne, and a stack of his Chekov favorites. He shuts the door and locks it behind them, and he throws the phone out the window. They lie on the unmade bed, her head resting in the crook of his arm, her eyes closed, and he reads to her. For days. They go through all the baguettes, and the champagne, and they venture out at night for more wine, for cheese, for blackberry jam. He reads her Uncle Vanya and The Cherry Orchard and Ward No. 6 . Unflinching, uncomforting things. Words that offer a kind of grief, a lament neither of them are allowed to voice. And finally, after days, after the last black and bitter word of it, he closes the books. And the room is silent. She stretches, like a cat. The mid-morning sun through the lace curtains dapples the bed, like fish-scales under a current, tiny flecks of warm gold on her mouth, on her face and the side of her neck. When she kisses him, he imagines she leaves tiny smears of light on his mouth, on his jaw. When she kisses him, the weights and measures of the world bend before them. When she kisses him, they have all the time. ","Summary":" Weights and Measures by Darkstar1013 Ilya, Gaby, and Solo know their job is to maintain balance.

There are two men standing at the window despite the sign saying closed , and even from a distance Napoleon can tell they're armed. Illya pauses and looks up from cleaning his gun, one brow raised. \"What is it?\" Napoleon heaves a sigh as he turns into an alley a little ways down the street. \"I think someone may have beat us to the book.\" Illya's raised brow lowers into a frown and he looks back at his sidearm. \"Are you sure?\" \"There are two armed men watching the front.\" \"Shit.\" \"The good news is...\" Napoleon says, pausing to turn the car off. He doesn't continue until Illya is looking at him again. \"We got here before they left.\" \"So we can take the book from them.\" \"If we move quickly, yes. Of course, it'll be slightly more complicated now that there's some competition.\" Illya shrugs. \"I'm sure we've had worse.\" Napoleon nods. \"Agreed.\" He leans across Illya and tugs the door handle before looking up at him with a grin. \"Shall we?\" Illya rolls his eyes and gives Napoleon a good-natured shove. \"Get off me.\" Napoleon takes his time sitting up, stretching his back and getting in a few satisfying pops as he does so, then draws his weapon to make certain it's loaded. \"Besides the two watching the front, there are probably a few more keeping an eye on whatever civilians were unfortunate enough to be in the building.\" \"So...once we're in I'll check up on the hostages and you'll go down to the vault for the book?\" \"Are you sure you don't want to go after the book?\" Napoleon says slowly, looking over at Illya. The Russian raises an eyebrow at him. \"You get the damned book.\" Napoleon bites back a smile as he holster his gun. He'd already known the answer, of course. His affinity for all things old and rare isn't exactly a secret, and Illya and Gaby are in his apartment frequently enough to be familiar with his book collection, including his greatest pride-half a shelf of first editions. \"Well, I had to ask.\" \"Mmhm,\" Illya says, pushing his door the rest of the way open. \"Let's get going. You wouldn't want someone else getting away with your Walden .\" \"Or the nuclear secrets,\" Napoleon adds as he opens his door climbs out of the driver's seat. \" Alleged nuclear secrets.\" \"You don't trust Professor Behr?\" Napoleon asks. They walk at an easy stroll, their long strides enough to get them there quickly without them looking like they're in a hurry. Illya snorts. \"I think if Walter Ludlow of Ludlow's Books and Oddities were a Soviet spy, we would know.\" \"I don't know about that,\" Napoleon says as they cross to the side of the street the bookstore is on. \"They can be quite sneaky, you know.\" They're almost to their destination when he draws his gun. He glances over his shoulder toward his partner. \"You ready?\" \" Da .\" The two men at the front turn out to by quite easy to dispatch. It takes only a few short moments to find where the hostages are-a few scared civilians crammed into a small office with a single guard on the door. Illya is handling him when Napoleon heads to the basement. He closes the door behind him and is startled at how quiet the room is he hurries quietly down the wooden staircase. The vault is already open when Napoleon gets to the bottom of the steps, and there's a person unconscious just inside. Napoleon kneels down and checks his pulse. It's there, and strong. Most likely he was forced to open the safe and then got a blow to the back of the head for his trouble. There's no sign of anyone else in the basement, just an open window leading to a window well large enough for a man to escape through. Napoleon briefly considers going after the thief, but the man probably has a good lead and Napoleon has no idea what he looks like. He decides to go into the vault instead, on the off-chance that perhaps the thief were after something other than a book full of nuclear secrets. A quick scan of the vault reveals shelves full of old volumes, from Homer to Dickens to Bronte. His attention is drawn to a wide gap, too large to have been the book he's after. Whatever it was would have to be worth a hell of a lot to warrant so many men coming to retrieve it. Further exploration brings a smile to Napoleon's lips, and he pulls a first edition Walden from the shelf. He returns his gun to his shoulder holster, not bothering to buckle it as he shifts his attention to the book. He leafs through the pages with a sinking feeling, his preliminary search revealing no notes in the margins, no loose papers, no sign of anything out of the ordinary. It appears Walter Ludlow of Ludlow's Books and Oddities is merely a collector after all. \"Hands up, if you please,\" someone says, and his words are followed by the click of a gun being cocked. \"Then turn around, slowly.\" Napoleon closes his eyes in frustration, then lifts his arms above his head and turns in a slow half-circle, the first-edition Walden still clutched in his left hand. He silently curses himself for walking right into a fucking trap. \"That was a good trick,\" he says to the man who had been lying on the floor moments before. \"You'd be surprised how many have fallen for it. Now kindly keep your hands where they are. If I see you reach for your piece and it'll be the last mistake you ever make.\" Napoleon obeys, wishing that this basement weren't soundproof and that his damned partner would hurry the hell up. \"You shouldn't have come alone,\" the man says. Napoleon furrows his brow. \"Yes, that was foolish of me, wasn't it?\" His gaze shifts to the large book tucked under the man's left arm. \"Gutenberg Bible. It's said to be worth millions,\" the man says, then stares at him for a long moment before a look of recognition crosses his features. \"I know you. I remember face, and your many...achievements.\" There's something akin to admiration in his voice. \"The Rembrandt in Manchester, '46. The German pearls in '48, the Spanish gold in '49…\" A corner of the man's mouth lifts up. \"To think, I came face-to-face, nay, head-to-head, with the Brooklyn Dodger.\" Napoleon can't help but smile at that, despite the perilousness of his situation. \"I always liked that nickname, although I'm not from Brooklyn, and I've never been a fan of baseball...Or Dickens for that matter.\" The man laughs, and it turns into a sigh. \"You're a proper legend. It would be a shame for you to die here,\" he says. \"I can't say I disagree,\" Napoleon responds. Any minute now, Kuryakin. \"But I can't risk you coming after me.\" \"Probably wise.\" His right hand is itching to draw his gun, and he's pretty sure the man knows it. They stare at each other for a long moment before Napoleon makes his move. He's barely drawn his weapon when the man's hand suddenly twitches and a shot rings out. Napoleon cries out as his leg collapses beneath him and he hits the floor, the gun escaping his fingers and clattering to the floor, out of reach. He can do nothing but watch as the man slips out and shuts the vault door, plunging Napoleon into darkness. \"Fuck!\" he mutters as he hears the deep, heavy sound of the locks falling into place. Hardly a second passes before there's a pop that Napoleon immediately recognizes as gunfire and his breath catches, fear lacing through him. The silence seems to stretch on for eternity, and Napoleon has almost given up hope when there's a sudden banging on the door. \" Cowboy?\" comes a muffled voice. Fear gives way to relief and Napoleon lets out the breath he was holding. \"Yeah, Peril,\" he calls. \" I heard a shot. Are you okay?\" Napoleon almost laughs because not really . His ego has taken a blow from which it might never recover, his leg hurts like a bitch and is bleeding enough that he's going to have to use his new Hugo Boss necktie as a tourniquet, and the intel they'd gotten from the nutty professor is probably shit, which means (damn it) that Illya was right. And that isn't even the worst of it. Oxygen started running out the minute the door closed. Napoleon figures he's probably got an hour, maybe two left before he loses consciousness, and from there it's only a matter of minutes. He can't tell Illya that, though, because it'll just make him panic and panic is the opposite of progress. So, he raises his voice and says, \"I'm fine! Bastard got me in the leg but I'll be okay. He missed the artery and I think he missed the bone.\" \" He shot you in the leg? Why not the chest, or the head?\" Napoleon does laugh this time as he loosens his tie. \"He was a fan.\" \" A fan? A fan of what?\" There's a pause and Napoleon thinks he hears him snort before he says, \" What's the combination? I'll get you out of there.\" Napoleon is considering the best way to answer that question when Illya says, \" Solo?\" \"Yes, I'm here. I don't know the combination.\" \" What do you mean you don't know it? How did you get in there?\" \"It...it was open when I got here.\" Illya swears in Russian, rather colorfully, mirroring how Napoleon is feeling. Napoleon tries not to let it show in his voice. \"It's okay, Kuryakin. It's okay. I'll just…I'll talk you through it.\" He's really just saying it to try and calm the Russian down. The unfortunate truth is that opening combination locks by touch is a complicated and delicate work that takes years to even grasp. Hell, Napoleon's been at it nearly twenty years and it still takes time. \" Alright. Tell me what to do,\" Illya says. \"I will. Just give me a few minutes. I'm gonna move closer to you so we can talk easier.\" He stays put for a second, trying to remember if he'd seen something rigid he can use to tighten the tourniquet. His thoughts quickly turn to his gun that's sitting somewhere between himself and the door. The clip should work well enough. Of course, he has to get to it first. He bends his good leg and holds his breath to steel himself before straightening it, pushing himself backwards. It hurts like a sonuvabitch, but he doesn't lose consciousness and he's somehow not crying, so it could be worse. It takes him another few scootches and blind feeling around to get to the gun and its clip, and he's tempted to just stop there. \" You still awake in there?\" Illya is trying not to sound worried. \"Yes, Illya!\" Napoleon manages between gasps. He catches his breath for a moment before going the rest of the way to the door. He leans against it, grateful for its support and for the fact that he doesn't have to move his leg again. He does, however, have to stop the bleeding and that will be wildly unpleasant. \"I'm going to put a tourniquet on my leg,\" he says as he takes the tie from around his neck and loops it around his leg, a few inches above the wound and ties a half-knot. \"And it's going to be rather painful. So if you hear me...shouting in agony followed by a somewhat lengthy silence, I've probably passed out. But there's no need to worry as I will be back around shortly.\" He doesn't hear Illya's response as he ejects the clip from his gun. He puts it on top of the half-knot and ties it into place, his hands trembling and his heart hammering as he mentally prepares himself for what's to come. He takes a deep breath and holds it, then twists the clip, tightening the tourniquet. The breath rushes from his lungs and he the world seems to tilt wildly for a second. The pain is agonizing and a cry escapes from him. He's not sure he's going to be able to tighten it as much as he needs to, but he forces himself to keep going, tightening it until he can't and then tightening it a little more. By the time he's done, his breath is coming in harsh, ragged pants, his ears are ringing, and his whole body is shaking and sweaty. He closes his eyes just for a moment before tying off the tourniquet. \" -boy. Solo! Are you okay?\" \"Uh...yeah,\" Napoleon manages, his voice gruff. \" Tell me what to do.\" Napoleon takes a few deep breaths, pulling his focus from the pain in his leg and directing it to the task at hand. \"You need to turn the dial left, about four times.\" \" About four times, or four times?\" Napoleon lets out a small is going to be harder than he thought. Cracking a vault isn't like changing a tire or baking a cake, where there are exact steps and measurements. It's about the feel of it, really, and it's damn near impossible to explain. It's not long before Illya starts to get frustrated, and it takes everything in Napoleon's power not to follow suit. \" This isn't working!\" \"It just takes a little time, that's all,\" Napoleon says, careful not to let his emotions make their way into his words. \" You've always been better at this part. Ya beznadezan !\" Napoleon closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before opening them again. \"You're not hopeless. You just need to focus.\" \" I can't focus when you're in there with a bullet in your leg!\" Illya is shutting down, and Napoleon can't afford for him to. He's got to calm his partner down, get his mind onto something that will recenter his focus before making him go at the vault again. The idea comes to him and almost brings a smile with it. \"B1 to c3,\" he says. He knows the Russian well. \" What?\" \"B1 to c3,\" Napoleon repeats, picking up the chess game they'd started the previous night. \"Your move.\" There's a short pause before Illya says, \" E7 to e5.\" \"Let's see...E2 to e6.\" They play like this for ten minutes or so, and Napoleon finds that it's calming him down too. Part of him wants to finish the game, but now's really not the time so he says, somewhat reluctantly, \"Are you ready to try again?\" \" Yes, I think so.\" \"Good. Now, you need to turn the dial to the left and listen for the level to drop into the drive cam.\" \" ...The what?\" Napoleon isn't sure what he expected. They've both calmed down, yes, but besides that they're still at square one. He's probably used up about half his air and they're no closer to getting the damned thing open. He's fairly certain now that he's going to die in this horrible metal box, holding an ordinary book that doesn't hold any more secrets than any other copy of Walden . But he can't give up. For Illya's sake, he can't. \"For the-Um. Hm. Just feel for the-\" \" Fuck this,\" Illya interrupts, catching Napoleon completely off guard, and before he can respond Illya continues. \" You have been in there for close to an hour. You're running out of oxygen and you know and I know that I will not get this in time.\" \"You don't know that,\" Napoleon says, fully aware that he doesn't sound even remotely convincing. \" I'm going to find another way, Solo. I'm sorry I couldn't-\" \"Stop!\" Napoleon can't stand to hear him apologize. Not for something that's as a result of Napoleon's own stupidity. \"You know this isn't your fault right? If this-if you can't...It's not your fault.\" \" I will be back, Cowboy. I'm going to get you out.\" \"Illya, wait!\" Napoleon says, but there's no answer, and he knows Illya is gone. He closes his eyes, heart sinking, and finishes his thought anyway. \"I don't want to die alone.\" xxx Illya looks at the blood in the window well from where he'd hit the bastard that locked Solo in the safe, and briefly considers whether he could follow the trail through the streets of London. It only takes a moment to determine that the better option is upstairs handcuffed to a radiator. He wastes no time getting there, taking the steps two at a time. He bursts out onto the upper floor and a pit forms in his stomach when he sees that the office door, which he's certain he left closed, is now wide open. \"Shitshitshitshit shit ,\" he mutters. If that bastard managed to escape then Napoleon- He doesn't finish the thought, because when he gets around the door and into the room the man is still there, looking very angry and very stuck. \"The men you asked to guard me were cowards,\" he says when he sees Illya. \"They ran as soon as you were out of sight.\" He tugs at his cuffed wrist with a sour expression. \"Fat lot of good it did me.\" \"Where is he?\" Illya says. \"Do you mean Graves? Got away then, did he? That's just bloody typical.\" \"Where is he?\" Illya says again, crossing the small room in a single stride and grabbing a fistful of the man's shirt. The man responds with an amused smile, but Illya can see the fear in his eyes. He lowers his voice and leans in so his nose is practically touching the man's. \"I have already broken your nose.\" The man's eyes widen and the corners of his mouth twitch as he tried to keep up the facade. \"I don't know where he is,\" he says. \"I think maybe you are afraid of him.\" Illya's voice is lowered, almost to a whisper. \"But you should be more afraid of me. I am ex-KGB. I know many creative ways how to make people talk, hm? You want me to show you? Or you want to tell me the truth?\" The man's brow furrows, the smile gone. \"I am telling you the truth. I don't know where he is.\" \"Not good enough,\" Illya says, tightening his grip. \"Wait!\" the man cries, eyes wide and face pale. \"Just wait, alright? I don't know where he is. But I know how to find him. Eliza Andrews. He won't leave without her. She's tall for a woman, with long dark hair, birthmark on her right jaw, fond of trousers. American. She's sort of hard to miss, really.\" \"And where is she?\" \"She's staying at the Savoy. That's all I know, I swear.\" Illya studies the man's face for a second before letting go of his shirt. \"You pray to whatever god you believe in that I find him, or I will come back here and take you apart.\" The man holds his eye contact for a moment before looking away with a sharp humorless laugh. \"Blimey. I do believe you will. Graves is a slippery bastard, Mr. KGB. You had better hurry.\" Illya does. xxx Eliza Andrews is hard to miss. Illya spots her leaving the Savoy mere seconds after he gets there, wearing white flared trousers and an olive button-down, her white jacket flung over her shoulder with one hand and Louis Vuitton luggage in the other. She's doing a good job of hiding it, but Illya can tell that she's looking for tails. She probably knows how to shake them, then. Unfortunately for Graves, Illya has plenty of experience tailing people who know how to shake tails. Between his years at the KGB and his time working with Gaby and Solo, he's damn near perfected the art of blending in despite his stature and the fact that he rarely blinks and his tendency to glower. He makes sure to keep plenty of people between himself and Eliza, keeping his head down and his shoulders slightly hunched to make himself smaller, and then it's just a matter of following. He knows London like the back of his hand, its nooks and crannies, its dark corners and passageways. It doesn't take long before Eliza does a quick look around and ducks into an alley, the right wall of which belongs to an abandoned garage. It's an old and empty building, perfect for shady dealings. He watches her slip through the door, then waits until he hears a man's voice- Graves's voice -before entering the building himself. The girl is holding the Bible. The man is holding his bleeding shoulder. Illya is holding a gun. They both look up at once. \"Oh, dear,\" Eliza says, clutching the Bible a little tighter. \"You were followed?\" Graves snaps, taking a few threatening steps toward Eliza. Illya fires a warning shot at his feet, stopping the bastard dead in his tracks. \"In her defense, I am very good follower,\" Illya says, then turns to Eliza. \"Get out of here.\" \"She won't leave me,\" Graves says. \"Will you, darling?\" Eliza looks at Graves, then back at Illya. \"Can I keep the book?\" \"Go,\" Illya says, and she scurries away, a satisfied grin on her face. \"You spoiled Yankee bitch!\" Graves shouts, and moves to follow her. Illya steps in front of him and grabs his bad shoulder, pressing his thumb into the bullet hole he'd put there. Graves cries out in pain, falling to his knees. Illya doesn't let go. \"You're coming with me,\" he says. Graves makes a desperate grab for his gun, but Illya easily disarms him, throwing the weapon out of reach. \"I said you're coming with me . If you try anything else, I will put a bullet in your knee.\" Graves glowers at him as he staggers to his feet. \"I don't know who you think you're dealing with, but-\" \"Shut up,\" Illya interrupts, moving behind Graves and giving him a shove toward the door. \"Move quick and quiet.\" He doesn't bother making any more threats. If Graves doesn't believe him by now then he's either too stupid to recognize the precariousness of his situation, or too prideful to acknowledge it. They take a complex, weaving route back to the bookstore that keeps them mostly out of view of the general public. It takes a little longer, but it's worth it to avoid the risk of being stopped by someone. Illya shudders to think what would befall Solo if that were to happen. It makes him step a little faster. Ludlow's Books and Oddities comes into sight just a few minutes later and Illya prays it's soon enough as he leads Graves across the street and into the little store. A tiny bell tinkles when he opens the door and a call comes from the office. \"Did you get him?\" \"Kidd, you bastard!\" Graves shouts. \"You gave me up! I'll kill you!\" \"Keep moving,\" Illya says, pushing him toward the basement door as Kidd laughs. \"Oh, I see. You couldn't get into the vault,\" Graves says as they start down the stairs. \"You want to stop talking,\" Illya says. \"And you let Lizzie get away with the Bible, so unless you don't know its worth, it's not money you wa-\" Illya grabs Graves's good arm and twists it up behind his back, forcing him down the rest of the steps before slamming him face first into the vault door. \" Ow ! Damn you!\" Illya's breaths are coming hard and heavy, and he clenches his fists to stop his hands shaking as he puts his mouth next to Graves's ear. \"You do not seem to understand how serious I am. So let me make myself very clear. If you do not close your mouth and do as I tell you, I will break every last bone in your body, starting with your light fingers. Now you're going to open this vault now .\" He lets go of Graves and takes a step back, keeping his gun trained on the man's head. \"Aah,\" Graves says, straightening his bloodied tie. \"So it's the Dodger you're after.\" \"Open it!\" Illya barks. \"I think I'd like to negotiate. His life is in my hands.\" Illya fires two shots, one to each side of Graves's head. \"And I hold yours in mine. Open the safe.\" For once, Graves doesn't have a comeback as he turns to the safe. His quiet doesn't last long, though, and he half-shouts, \"You're lucky I remember the combination, because with the ringing in my ears there's no way in hell I'd be able to do this by touch.\" He turns the hand wheel and Illya's knees nearly go weak at the deep sound of the vault being unlocked. \"Move,\" he says, pushing Graves out of the way and pulling open the heavy door. He doesn't care that he hears the son of a bitch making a break for it up the stairs. He's more concerned about the sight of his partner, slumping out of the vault like a ragdoll. \"Cowboy!\" Illya rushes forward, pulling the American out onto the basement floor so he's lying flat. He gives Napoleon's shoulder a shake, and his stomach knots at the man's limpness. \"Come on!\" He holds a hand over Solo's mouth, feeling for a breath, but there isn't one. \"No no no. \" He's too late . He takes a deep breath, trying to remember the steps to the new procedure they'd been taught in the fancy first-aid class Waverly had made them take-CP...CP something . It doesn't matter. He thinks the breaths come second. He laces his fingers together and places the heels of his palms in the middle of Napoleon's chest. He's about to start compression when the American suddenly takes a deep, shuddering breath, his eyes snapping open as he gulps down air. Illya sags with relief, the tension he'd been carrying for the last few hours melting away as he grasps Napoleon's hand in his own. \"That's it, Cowboy. Just breathe. Just breathe.\" \"You…\" Napoleon pauses to catch his breath. \"You opened the vault. How-how did-\" \"Hush,\" Illya says, pressing a finger to Napoleon's lips and ignoring the look of surprise this garners. \"That is a story for another day. For now, I think we had better get you to hospital.\" Napoleon closes his eyes and gives a short nod. \"Yes, I think we had. Just let me...Let me lie here a moment.\" He opens one eye and looks up at Illya. \"Thank you, Peril.\" His voice, though tired, is steady. But there's something in his expression that speaks to the fear he must have felt, the aloneness. Illya doesn't press the matter, knowing that his partner will talk about it when he's ready, or he won't. \"Hey, Cowboy?\" \"Yeah?\" \"B4 to C6,\" Illya says, and he smiles. \"Checkmate.\" ","Summary":" Napoleon looks into the window of the little shop as they pass, driving slowly enough that he can g"},{"Movie":"Man From U.N.C.L.E.","Title":"Traditions Are The Root Of Love","Author":"WordsAblaze","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13171090","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Everyone's been revealed so it's safe to cross-post now! Check out the ao3 collection for more fabulous fics! :) Traditions Are The Root Of Love Napoleon had never really given Christmas a second thought but the fact that Illya hadn't even given it a complete first thought made him stop and give it an entire contemplation. The three of them had been finishing off the boring parts of their mission, the written report and the evaluation of sorts, when Gaby had suddenly stood up from the sofa and stretched, clicking a good few bones in the process. \"This silence is overbearing, anyone know which station plays Christmas songs?\" she asks, already walking over to their little - definitely not stolen - radio. Before Napoleon can reply, Illya scoffs. \"Is not Christmas yet, why would we need Christmas music?\" Gaby and Napoleon both turn to him, shocked and mildly concerned, but it's Gaby who narrows her eyes and says, \"Illya, Christmas starts as soon as November does.\" \"It is pointless scam to make money.\" Illya waves a hand dismissively, attaching one of their better recon photos to the report. \"You've got to be kidding me,\" Napoleon mutters, taking the glue from Illya before he can ignore them any further. \"Are you telling me you ignore the whole thing until it's about to be over?\" Illya looks up at that, albeit mostly just to take the glue back, which he does rather forcefully. \"You said you had never properly celebrated either so why are you surprised?\" A soft, exasperated sigh escapes Gaby as she switches the radio on without bothering to try and find a station, hoping for the best, then flops back down between the two of them, glancing between them seriously. \"Why am I stuck with the only two men in the world who don't indulge in festivities?\" \"Are we meant to answer that?\" Napoleon asks, leaning back and raising an eyebrow. \"Can we just finish mission and move on?\" Illya asks, already filling in another one of the endless pages. Napoleon gives him a pointed look and where Illya's display of determination would usually cause pride and respect, it now leaves remorse and an idea that Gaby seems to catch on to surprisingly quickly, within half a sideways glance. They go back to it, of course, it is a team effort after all, but as soon as they've reached a respectable place to stop - almost the end, to be fair - Napoleon takes the pen from Illya and Gaby scoops up the papers as smoothly as a heron. \"And that's the end of that for now!\" Napoleon grins. Illya glares. Menacingly. \"Oh, don't look at me like that, Peril, I've hardly stolen your left lung,\" Napoleon says both defensively and just because he can, which are really two of the main reasons he does anything, ever. \"First up, Christmas shopping!\" Gaby announces, making her way across the room and chucking their coats at them before slipping her own on, a determined look on her face and a thoughtful glint in her eye that neither of them wants to argue with. Begrudgingly, Illya pulls himself up and takes one last glance at the unfinished report before letting Gaby loop her arm in his, her other arm looped through Napoleon's, of course, as the three of them start moving. \"Must we do this right now?\" Illya asks sourly, even though the cold outside clearly affects him the least. Napoleon sighs. \"When have we ever successfully changed Gaby's plans? And no, don't bring up chess games because they don't count.\" Since there are no examples outside of their numerous chess games, the three of them end up at the most lowkey supermarket around, immediately heading to the bakery section. \"Fruit and sugar, no big deal,\" Illya complains. \"It is a mince pie and you will give it the respect it deserves!\" Gaby frowns, grabbing a couple of packets and slipping them into the basket she'd surreptitiously picked up. Napoleon's turn leads to him picking up some DIY gingerbread men next, grinning childishly. \"You have not lived if you haven't terribly decorated a gingerbread man and I'd rather not leave my life in the hands of a dead man so you absolutely cannot refuse to take part.\" Surprisingly, all Illya picks up from that is: \"You would leave your life in my hands?\" Feeling the blood rush to his face, Napoleon clears his throat roughly. \"All part of the job, right?\" \"Right,\" Illya echoes blankly. Gaby clicks her tongue at them in disapproval but moves on, grabbing overly iced cupcakes and sparkling water instead of alcohol because she claims she'd rather they be sober so they can remember their first Christmas together. Illya, to his credit, only complains minimally, until they get to the clothing section. \"No,\" he says bluntly, as soon as Gaby picks up a green hat with a tinsel bobble on the top. \"You're right,\" Napoleon replies smoothly before smirking at Gaby, \"I think red suits him better, don't you?\" She snorts. \"Suit yourself,\" she mutters, picking up two red hats and a green one before moving on, leaving the two men to stare after her in confusion. \"Why did you not celebrate?\" Illya inquires suddenly, turning to Napoleon with a rare, curious look. Napoleon just shrugs at first but he knows that stubborn look in Illya's eyes so he adds: \"There was never really much point, too many things to worry about and too many people chasing me to allow a night of carelessness. I would rather not do something than do it pitifully.\" Illya's expression softens considerably. \"But now it is worth it?\" Slowly, Napoleon nods. \"Yeah, it seems to be, don't you think? Waverly will definitely give us bonus points for enjoying the festive traditions together.\" Despite the serious element to their conversation, Illya laughs. \"That I can agree with.\" \"Alright, Peril, let's go find Gaby,\" Napoleon says, sending one last scowl to the hideous outfits behind them as they head towards the exit, figuring that she's already paid. Which she has. \"Took you long enough!\" she grumbles lightly when they arrive, refusing to hand over the bags and marching ahead. Napoleon and Illya share a sideways glance but follow her anyway, engaging in only the mildest of chatter until they get back to their rented apartment. They must have spent longer than they'd thought shopping because it's almost pitch black when they get back, meaning that it takes them an unnecessarily long time to find the right corridor and unlock the door. \"So now we finish our report, yes?\" Illya asks, not really waiting for an answer. Gaby gives him one by throwing a red hat at him. \"Get back here and help me unpack or so help me I will confiscate your glue stick!\" \"Really, Gaby, you should have gone with his chess set,\" Napoleon comments as he places the green one on her head before putting the other red one on for himself, raising an eyebrow at Illya, who sighs defeatedly and slides his own hat on too. Gaby looks shocked for a second before dumping the bags on the counter and starting to pull things out. \"Gingerbread men first, right?\" \"Sounds perfect!\" Napoleon agrees, taking the packets from her and setting them out on the table, opening the little icing tubes and tiny containers of sweets and what looks like glitter. Illya simply watches, occasionally moving forward to help before thinking better of it and staying in one spot, his arms folded and a faint smile appearing on his face as he watches his team set up festivities for him. Sparkling water is poured out into sparkling glasses, a log cake is unwrapped and placed on a somewhat garish doily, and Napoleon even dares to wrap tinsel around Illya's neck. The tinsel is promptly removed and used by Gaby as a scarf but Napoleon escapes the situation with no injuries so it's a win from his perspective. \"So, what do I do to this biscuit?\" Illya asks once they're all seated. Gaby raises the most sceptical eyebrow she's ever raised at him. \"Are you serious, Illya? You simply use the decorations to create something that resembles a person.\" Her tone is exactly why none of them says a word until they're done, at which point Illya has broken two gingerbread men and Napoleon has accidentally squeezed green icing over Gaby's face, earning himself a dousing in the contents of her glass. \"I think mine is best,\" Illya says, glancing between theirs. Napoleon takes one look at his and bursts out laughing, finding it hard to comprehend that Illya had taken it so seriously and genuinely made his look like an exact replica of himself. Even Gaby is speechless, blinking at him in shock before giggling. \"You Russians never do anything halfway, do you?\" \"Why would we?\" Illya shrugs, then bites the head of his gingerbread man with a smile. \"That was quite fun, thank you.\" Matching soft smiles settle on his teammates' faces before they share a relieved look and eat their creations too, after which Gaby leaves to 'freshen up' and the other two put any rubbish in the bin before waiting for her to get back so they can cut the cake together. \"Did you do this?\" Illya asks suddenly. \"Peril, you're going to have to be a bit more specific than that.\" Napoleon folds his arms, twisting in his seat a little to look at Illya better. Illya rolls his eyes. \"Decorating. Did you do it when you were young?\" After a moment's hesitation, Napoleon shrugs. \"Yes. And no. I will admit I've stolen from bakeries in the past; you can draw your own conclusions, I presume.\" Something like sympathy flashes in Illya's eyes but he quickly buries it, not allowing his mind to venture into why he wishes better for a thief. Instead, he focuses on changing the topic, asking: \"Gaby has been gone long, don't you think?\" Napoleon sighs in what might be disappointment or agreement. \"Probably getting that icing off her face.\" \"Was not that much icing, cowboy,\" Illya argues. \"Alright, then maybe she's throwing holly leaves all over your bed so that you finally learn to take a joke?\" Napoleon smirks. Either way, when she does get back, she makes a big fuss about cutting the cake herself, muttering something about the two of them acting too much like children to be in charge of a knife. Of course, they don't argue against her and she dishes out a piece to each of them, smiling proudly. \"What is it, what have you done?\" Napoleon asks suspiciously. \"Just enjoy your log and, Illya: there is liquid chocolate in the middle so be careful because you seem to be wearing white for some reason.\" Illya hums, already having eaten a spoonful, his eyes going wide as he glances to Napoleon. \"You did not warn me it was so soft.\" Napoleon chuckles. \"The mighty Kuryakin, taken down by soft cake.\" \"Is this what Christmas feels like?\" he asks them, genuinely. Gaby answers before Napoleon can: \"We're meant to have a tree and badly wrapped presents but we've got received a new mission that starts tomorrow so there isn't enough time.\" It takes Napoleon half a second to splutter. \"Tomorrow?\" Nodding, Gaby swallows she piece of cake she'd eaten and glances between them. \"It's an emergency so Waverly couldn't find a way to give us a break for Christmas.\" Napoleon groans. \"I had plans!\" \"What plans?\" Illya asks, having finished his piece of cake by this point. His face flushing slightly in embarrassment, Napoleon's gaze shifts to the floor as he lets out a small mumble: \"Badly wrapped presents.\" Now it's Illya and Gaby's turn to share a look, both of them knowing they hadn't planned to get each other gifts and feeling slightly bad. Napoleon is not widely known for his sentiments so his plan to get them gifts truly means more than they can articulate. \"It's alright, Napoleon, we can do that on New Year's, right?\" Gaby asks brightly and more or less rhetorically. He nods but Illya is not convinced his spirits have been lifted so he nudges Napoleon gently. \"Can I ask favour? Will you bake your, uh, cookies again? They are much better than this cake.\" \"What?\" Napoleon asks, his annoyance melting to pleasant confusion. \"But you adore this cake, you just proved that.\" Illya's smile doesn't have to be faked when he replies: \"But I love your baking more.\" \"Really?\" Napoleon's voice is quiet, stripped of its usual confidence, and Illya has never been so taken aback by someone's voice in his life. Sensing that neither of them will notice, Gaby quickly rises so she can set up her plan to give them some kind of gift. Sure enough, they're still staring at each other when she gets back, meaning that she can pointedly clear her throat and watch as they scramble to appear poised, turning to her with questions in their eyes. \"We don't have forever, you know. If you want to get those cookies baked, you might want to start now,\" she says casually, raising her eyebrows at them, almost from muscle memory at this point because of how many times she's done it before. Illya recovers first, nodding briskly. \"Ready, Cowboy?\" Napoleon beams at him, whether or not he knows it. He probably doesn't, it's not an action he would accept as part of his usual behaviour. So the two of them get up and, with a little persuasion from Gaby, leave their plates, heading to the kitchen empty-handed. They've only just stepped into the kitchen when Illya pauses. \"What is that?\" \"Hmm?\" Napoleon turns, having been thinking about whether or not to add chocolate chips to his cookies or not. As he turns back around, the first thing he does is internally curse Gaby. Mistletoe. Of course she'd do something like that, he should have seen it coming. He could easily just lie to Illya, he knows he could, but dishonestly towards his team isn't something he wants to indulge in, ever. He sighs, glancing at the small, oblivious white berries. \"It's called mistletoe,\" he says eventually. Illya frowns. \"It has purpose involving feet?\" Napoleon chuckles before shaking his head. \"Not quite, Peril. It's, uh- well, if two people stand under it together, they're meant to- they're meant to kiss before they continue walking.\" \"Oh,\" Illya says blankly, staring at the little plant with curiosity. He glances at Napoleon and his eyes are filled with both hope and fear, which Napoleon hadn't even thought physically possible for him. Taking the emotions in Illya's eyes to mean he's uncomfortable, Napoleon laughs lightly, shaking his head. \"It's just Gaby having some fun, I'm sure, we don't have to humour her.\" \"Oh,\" Illya repeats, as if the entire English language has failed to satisfy him. Napoleon bites his lip, then reaches up to grab the mistletoe, wondering how on earth Gaby had placed it there. \"I can just relocate this then…\" Just as his fingers are brushing the berries, Illya's hand envelops his wrist, causing him to freeze, a shiver running along his arm despite the warmth in their apartment. He looks up to see Illya frowning and clearly thinking something over. \"I thought traditions were meant to be kept?\" Illya's voice is smooth, calm. Napoleon's jaw drops ever so slightly. \"And... you'd be okay with that?\" Illya lifts his other hand to cup Napoleon's cheek, his skin cool and soft and possibly full of adrenaline if the sparks on Napoleon's face are anything to go by. \"I would be more than okay with that,\" Illya confirms, letting go of Napoleon's wrist, \"if that is something you want.\" Finally remembering that dignity is something he's meant to have, Napoleon lowers his arm back down and takes a deep breath. \"I don't think I've ever wanted anything more, Peril.\" \"Then take deep breath, Cowboy,\" Illya instructs, a slightly serious expression on his face. \"What? Wh-\" Illya fulfils the tradition of mistletoe. By kissing Napoleon. And Napoleon forgets what oxygen is, never mind how to breathe it in. Then oxygen and everything else is irrelevant because as soon as their lips meet, they are the only thing that matters and they might as well be in deep space because neither of them can breathe properly but that's okay because they're practically inhaling each other's happiness and that's enough to keep them going until they're slightly dizzy, both donning impossibly bright smiles and dazzling glints in their eyes. Napoleon pulls back first, not because he wants to but because he knows he might otherwise fall and that's not something he wants to happen just after he's discovered his appreciation for mistletoe and his love for Illya's oxygen. \"Is not bad tradition,\" Illya murmurs ever so gently. A small, breathless chuckle escapes Napoleon as he nods. \"It's probably the best one.\" They stay there until they can breathe again, simply enjoying the feeling of reciprocity and laughing when Gaby smugly yells 'Merry Christmas!' at them before her bedroom door slams, signalling that they've been left alone for the night. \"Still want to bake those cookies, Peril?\" Napoleon asks, not even trying to hide the euphoria in his voice. A fond look in his eyes, Illya nods slowly. \"Would not be early Christmas without them.\" Still, neither of them move, not wanting to disenchant the moment and disturb the magic of it. It's almost a staring contest, except that they're gazing and competition may just be the last thing on their minds. Only when their eyes water and their lungs throw a tantrum do they move, making more of a mess than actual cookies, trading soft kisses rather than questions and answers about the recipe, knowing they have to be up early the next day but electing to forget about that in favour of spending as many seconds with each other as possible. Once the dubious cookies to be are in the oven, Napoleon wraps his arms around Illya and smiles up at him for the millionth time that evening. \"Do you like Christmas yet?\" Illya plants a small kiss on Napoleon's forehead and brushes a chocolate chip off his curls, his eyes positively twinkling. \"I like you.\" Napoleon's blush is redder than the Christmas hats they'd discarded without noticing but he doesn't mind because it gives him an excuse to hide his face under Illya's chin and breathe in the scent of sugar and wine and something sharp that he can't quite place. Illya pulls him closer and nobody is around to blame him if he chooses to soothe the burn on Napoleon's tongue - from choosing to check whether the mixture was turning out alright before thinking about it - with his own, or if he gets distracted from keeping an eye on the clock and instead chooses to steal Napoleon's breath just because he now has the right to. The cookies almost burn. Thanks for reading! Leave a review with your thoughts? :) ","Summary":" Everyone's been revealed so it's safe to cross-post now!

You can find my other MA/E rated entry on AO3. They're safe now, or as safe as they can be until the extraction team can make it to this location. Their rendezvous point had been compromised and they wear the wounds of the betrayal. The room is tiny, with only enough space for the bed and a foot or two for the door to swing open. There's a darkened window a little above waist high. It leads to the canal, in the event that things get desperate enough for the thirty foot drop. Solo sits at the edge of the bed with his gun resting on his lap. He remains perfectly still as Illya shifts against him. They all took some pretty good hits and overall, everything hurts. He glances over his shoulder, and subsequently Illya's too. Solo can't see Gaby over the Russian's hulking frame. \"How is she?\" \"Bruised. Here.\" Illya leans to the left so that Solo can see the purple mark spreading across her lower jaw. \"A punch.\" Illya nods in agreement. They come to the same conclusion and feel the same sense of relief; a small thing in comparison to the myriad ways in which they are all expecting to die. And, it's not like they left anyone standing, but it would be a shame to have to hunt down any survivors should anything more serious have happened to their little mechanic. \"She should come around soon. I'll take first watch. Get some rest.\" Illya bristles at the comment. He does not need watching over and says almost as much. \"I am not tired.\" It's not exactly a lie but he can feel the American's disagreement through the places where their bodies touch. \"I need you rested in case you need to carry her out of here. Plus, I thought your ribs could use a break. All in one piece?\" \"I have had worse.\" Which is universal code for no, but that's ok. As far as Solo can tell, there aren't any open wounds. That's good enough for now. \"Sleep, Peril.\" Illya huffs, pulls Gaby closer and tucks her small frame against him. He tugs his jacket around both of them and wraps his arm around her waist. From this angle, no one would know she's here, and Illya likes the thought of that. He is committed, beyond anything, to seeing her safe. To seeing her whole. He traces small patterns, old letters, across the back of her hand. It's meant to bring good fortune and they could use some of that tonight. Gaby wakes in a confused haze of warmth and pain. Had a horse kicked her? There could be no other explanation for the searing in her jaw or the ringing in her ears. She tries to shake her head but ends up burrowing deeper into some...one? She blushes all the way down to her toes. It doesn't take more than a second to put all of her thoughts together, to recognize the thick wool jumper or the sonorous breathing she'll always associate with Illya. Gaby takes another minute to appreciate this comfort and safety. Their lives are complicated and growing more so every day. If it isn't tomorrow, it will be some day soon after that one of them won't be so lucky. There's no happy ending for them, not this far in. But she can be thankful for moments like this one, where her life is her own and her men are safe and they make sure she is too. She takes these last minutes before poking her head out from the confines of Illya's coat. His arm around her waist tightens for a few brief seconds before he seems to catch himself and rolls away to let her out of the makeshift cocoon. \"Nice nap?\" Solo peeks over his shoulder, a sparkle of laughter in his eyes. Gaby rolls her eyes but the blush doesn't subside. \"Are you jealous? Perhaps Illya will make space for you.\" Their partner grumbles, likely something vulgar in his mother tongue. \"No, no. I'm sure we aren't playing favorites. Right, comrade?\" Illya doesn't bother answering. He pushes up into a sitting position and winces at all of his newly discovered injuries. Something in his side throbs. He shoves the feeling down, locks it away in the place where all his pain goes. \"How long until extraction?\" \"One hour. Plenty of time to get into trouble.\" While they chat, Gaby frowns at the gash on Solo's forehead. \"Hmm, is it that bad?\" She props herself up on her knees, wedged against Napoleon's back and Illya's thighs. Leaning forward, she touches around it gently to check for debris or evidence of deeper damage. Besides the blood crusted around it, it will likely heal with minimal fuss. Gravely, she makes eye contact and shakes her head. His forehead creases in worry, though he would never admit it. \"It will heal. Your good looks are safe.\" Illya coughs suspiciously, as if it isn't a cough at all. Solo glares. Gaby's sense of humor was generally much funnier when directed at someone else. \"Thanks, doc. Now let our brooding friend here make sure they haven't rattled your brain too much.\" It's her turn to glare. She doesn't like being ordered around or babied and depending on the mission, that's all her partners do. \"I'm fine.\" He looks over her head. \"This sounds familiar.\" Before Gaby can continue to protest, there is a strong, very cold, very gentle hand on her chin and a painfully bright light in her eyes. She jerks her head back, ready to scold him. \"Concussion.\" He subconsciously rubs his hand on his pants leg. \"Sorry.\" He is always worried about that, what his hands must feel like against her skin. Illya tucks the flashlight inside his coat and readjusts to sit next to her so that Gaby is sitting with her back against the wall, Solo is sitting at the edge of the bed to watch the door and Illya is next to her, watching the window. The room is dark except for what makes it through from the moon and the floodlights below. Given where they ended up this evening, this may be their only opportunity to rest and recover before the next leg of their journey. It's rare that they have downtime, and this is as close as they're going to get. While her soldiers work to keep them secure and alive, Gaby decides to keep them all sane. With great flourish, she begins to weave her tale. \"Have I told you both the story of how I ended up running from the KGB in nothing but my undergarments?\" She knows, when she sees the tips of Illya's ears go red, that this will absolutely be worth it. Solo checks his watch. Midnight. He wedges the receiver into his ear. It sputters to life. He hears the staticky voice dictate their instructions. With his back to them, he relays the message. \"Good news, Peril. Out the window after all. I'll go first. Agent Teller, you're in the middle.\" Illya is already at the window and sending the responding light flashes. When he gets the signal, he opens it all of the way and steps back. They hear the thunk of the grappling hook as it catches the windowsill. Solo checks the rope, gives it a tug to be sure that it will hold. Illya is facing away from them, gun trained on the door in the event that this isn't one of the easy times. Solo keeps his voice low. \"Give me ten seconds and then follow me down.\" Gaby nods and crouches below the window, listening to her partner rappel down the side of the building. She counts to herself as she tucks her hair into the collar of her top. \"Ten seconds, Illya.\" He nods slightly and begins backing up towards the window. Gaby grabs the rope and hops over the ledge and then she's free falling and weightless. Her feet hit the side of the building silently. She glances down, sees Solo melting into the shadows at the bottom. Down, down, down she goes until her feet meet the ground. When she glances back up, Illya is already halfway to the bottom. When he dismounts, they run with nervous, excited energy crackling between them. They are relieved and grateful because they've made it, all in one piece, again and that's happening less and less frequently. They're on the boat now, and she's smiling like a lunatic. Solo is pretending not to be winded because Illya isn't and they're both watching their backs as the small craft pulls out of the docks. They're clear, heading to the safe house and a debriefing and this is perfect, the best outcome possible. Her and her handsome, dangerous men are safe and that's all she'll ever ask.

Napoleon is almost impressed. Still, when he finally locates him, it's easy to see how the agent has been so effectively overlooked. He's towards the stern of the boat, camouflaged against a dun pile of coiled rope, arms round his legs, face pressed tightly against his knees. Napoleon hadn't thought that someone built like Kuryakin could possibly take up so little space. \"Peril?' No response. He gives the man's shin a careful prod with the toe of his wingtip. When Kuryakin finally looks up though, his gaze is clear enough, if a little glassy and faintly irritated. There's no indication that he's experiencing any sort of episode. \"You okay there?\" \"Fine.\" Peril grunts, restores his head to his knees. \"Are you sure?\" Napoleon looks him over, thinks through the day they've had, \"No symptoms of concussion? Any dizziness? Nausea?\" Peril's response is somewhat muffled, \"How would I tell?\" Napoleon looks down at the super-spy huddled at his feet, looks out at the shimmering blue waves. Oh. \"No,\" he says, \"you can't be serious.\" There's a motion that might be a nod. \"But… I've read your dossier; you were some kind of boating champion.\" A sigh emanates from somewhere within the pathetic knot of arms and legs. \"Was on lake. None of this…,\" the figure uncurls slightly, holds out a hand, palm down, rocks it back and forth with a grimace. \"Well, Waverly's looking for us, and you know what they say, time and,\" he smirks, \"tide don't wait.\" He grabs Illya's hand, hauls him to his feet. \"Buck up, you can always be seasick once we've finished saving the world.\" \"I hate the sea.

A magpie would be too obvious, too cliché, but there's something about the sleek grey and black feathers that sets off his dark hair and marble skin to dangerous effect. Rakish, devilish, and devastatingly charming. More than one shiny object has been snatched under the shadow of those wings, the light of that smile. A hooded crow, perhaps; steely blue and midnight black, less notorious but a thief nonetheless. If his wings have a flaw, it's that they betray his restless spirit, shuffling and flaring and stretching more often than most people's. They're only completely still when he's perfectly at ease or seconds away from snapping. It's like nothing so much as watching a bird with clipped feathers, longing for freedom but unable to chase it. It's only in his head that his wings have been clipped, though; the long black flight feathers are pristinely intact. Illya's are strigiform, wide and soft-edged for silent movement. The pale undersides made him particularly adept at airstrikes in Russia, where the white winter skies provided the perfect backdrop, but now he is no longer so reliant on those skills. With U.N.C.L.E., he keeps his wings folded tight against his brown and caramel jackets, and the mottled russets and golds don't stand out in a crowd, not like Solo's do. Almost drab, really – just the way he prefers it. And they move without a whisper, just like the rest of him. Even at their most silent, Solo's and Gaby's wings rustle against their clothing, the stiff feathers scraping with the faintest of rasps against cotton or silk or leather. Only Illya's make no noise; together with his superb night visions, this makes him the obvious look-out and point-man on many of their night missions. Gaby's wings are falconid, just as sharp and fierce as she herself. Her flight is swift and precise, maneuverability nearly unbeatable. Even Illya can't keep up with her at her fastest, and Solo's sleeker wings are equally unmatched to her dives and turns. Gaby's flight is fun until it becomes furious, and then she's just a streak of motion. Many underestimate her because of her size, but oh, that is a deadly mistake indeed. Her words and wit are sharp as any beak, her hands as strong and sure as any talons. Gaby is a hunter disguised as a songbird, and never hesitates to use that to her advantage. They have a masterful set of skills among them even without the wings; with them, they are more than a match for any opponent. They have tells, all three of them, but they are not a liability because only those familiar with them understand what they mean. Solo's wings go dull and lustreless when he's not feeling well, Illya's get restless and ruffled when he's upset, Gaby cleans hers aggressively when she's stressed. They never mention these tells, but they know. They're stuck in an unheated cabin one night, and Illya pulls the other two close to him, one on either side, and stretches his wings out over them. He was made for the cold, and the downy feathers trap the heat of three bodies and warm them all. They're caught somewhere they shouldn't be in a dark warehouse, and there's no cover. Without a word, Solo yanks his partners into a corner and splays his dark flight feathers in front of them. They blend perfectly into the bizarre shadows of the interior, and the guards pass without incident. They're hot on the heels of their targets when one of their tires is shot out. \"Take the wheel!\" Gaby shouts to Illya, and jumps , launching herself out of the careening vehicle and taking to the skies. Their adversaries don't think to look above them when they see the pursuit falling away in their rearview mirror, and Gaby takes out the driver with a magnificent dive and holds the passenger at gunpoint, wings outstretched dramatically behind her and hands completely still, until the backup arrives. Illya has to fight the urge to applaud. Solo wears his wings like a fashion accessory, easily displayed until they're almost forgettable despite their near-constant motion. He plays it off as vanity, preening, a continuous dissatisfaction with his appearance, and onlookers eat it up. They never think to link the vain young man with ravenesque wings to the thief who leapt from their balcony and disappeared into the night. Illya wears his wings like a secret, slow to show them but careful not to look too conspicuous about it. He doesn't like to spread them in public, even to stretch, and keeps them close to his body instead, an additional guard against his many secrets. Gaby wears her wings like a challenge, faux-naïveté worn like a mask that drops away at the time of the strike, stunning her prey as surely as any blow. She likes to match them to her outfits and wear jewelry that brings out the gold and the copper in them, and she lets people think of her as a silly young thing with dainty wings. No one looks too closely at how strongly they come to a point, how sleek they lie against her shoulders. They are spies, after all. Distraction and misdirection are what they do . I wrote this back in December as part of a \"short story celebration\" that marked the third birthday of takingoffmyshoes fanfic. As a thank-you to everyone who'd supported me and encouraged me, I spent two weeks taking writing requests on tumblr, and then posted the finished stories first to tumblr, and then to my AO3 account in February. I initially wasn't going to post them here, but then I thought why not? You guys have been just as kind and encouraging here, and I'll make sure to open up requests on this site as well when December rolls around again. This was my first time with wing-fic, but it was tons of fun to write. In case anyone is interested, Solo's wings are based on a combination of Magpies and Hooded Crows (more the Central European variety, rather than the Irish/British variety); Illya's are based off of Barn Owls, and Gaby's are based off of the European Kestrel (also called the Common Kestrel). As always, thank you for reading! Any feedback you'd like to leave is welcomed and appreciated. ","Summary":" Solo's wings are distinctly corvid.

I'm in love with tmfu! I had this idea for a while but had no excuse to write it so thanks and a happy [very very very] (belated) birthday to el3anorrigbyworld on tumblr! 3 Kiss Confusion Goodbye Evening falls as the three U.N.C.L.E agents rendezvous at a small, lesser-known bar after having split to shake off anybody who'd decided to try and follow them from their primary recon location. \"Boys.\" Gaby nods as she slides into the seat opposite where the two of them are sat, rather close together if she does say so herself, and smiles when they look up, Napoleon seemingly amused and Illya already on edge. \"What can you possibly have done already?\" Napoleon nods his head to their left, feigning a cough. \"The group over there seem to recognise us from somewhere. I did warn you wearing the same outfits as yesterday would be a bad idea.\" \"We need to leave, soon as possible,\" Illya mutters bluntly, quickly looking Gaby up and down. \"You are unhurt, yes?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine. I'll go get our car working and, in the meantime, why don't you boys give our stalkers a little show to satisfy them, hmm?\" She smirks, standing up before they can answer. Gaby's only gone for a few seconds before Napoleon and Illya exchange a weary look and nod to one another, pushing their chairs back and cracking their knuckles, mutually agreeing to start this personal brawl for the sake of their team's reputation. Both of them whirl around each other when the other gang surrounds them and initiates the fight, leaning on one another when they need and using each other as support. They even manage to trade a small smile at one point, then replacing the expression with ire once more, their fists flying. They dive into the fight and stop focusing on each other so much until one of the other men somehow gets the upper hand on Napoleon and he crashes down onto a table, breaking the wood and groaning as he does. Of course, he rolls over and jumps up immediately, but even Illya, who's juggling half a dozen angry men, can tell that Napoleon has slowed down considerably, his blows weaker than before. When he goes down again, this time staying down, Illya's eyes roar as he sees red and he all but growls at the remaining men before lashing out ferociously, the previously overconfident gang either falling to the floor or fleeing to the exits. \"Back off!\" Illya snaps at the bartender, putting himself in between the curious man and Napoleon, then kneels down. \"Napoleon?\" Napoleon peers up at Illya, blinking awkwardly as blood runs into one eye. \"Are you hurt?\" Illya methodically runs his fingers along Napoleon's jaw when he receives no answer, checking for breaks. \"Where is your irritating voice, Cowboy?\" Napoleon bats Illy's hands away, shifting his weight so he can sit up properly, wincing minimally. \"Hands to yourself, Peril, I won't be brought down by some amateur boxers and a table.\" \"That is not what blood on your shirt says,\" Illya mutters pointedly, pressing his hand to Napoleon's side and frowning when he receives a soft hiss of pain. Still, Napoleon shakes his head, clearing his throat. \"Okay so I might have gotten some sort of splinter?\" he admits, grinning sheepishly, moving to try and stand up. The fact that he doesn't resist when Illya puts an arm around him or when he helps steady him says a lot, but Illya doesn't make a comment, knowing that Napoleon would not appreciate it right now. The two of them make their way to the car that had been left outside the bar for their getaway, where Gaby rolls her eyes at them but sighs when she sees the red seeping into Napoleon's shirt. \"Get him to the hotel, I'll sort this out.\" \"Really, I'm-\" Napoleon starts. \"Nobody was talking to you,\" Gaby interrupts, glaring at him, \"Illya, don't leave him unsupervised, I'm now almost sure the guys you just fought with have men stationed at the hotel.\" \"Understood,\" Illya replies, pulling Napoleon to the other side of the car and gently placing him on the seat, waiting until he settles before quietly closing the door, a contrast to the way he usually slams car doors shut as if they'd all personally assassinated his loved ones. Gaby, of course, notices this change and raises a knowing eyebrow at him but doesn't give him time to process it, waving a hand before marching into the bar, rolling up her gloves and painting a confident smirk on her face. \"Eyes open, Cowboy!\" Illya barks as he starts driving, noticing how Napoleon seems to have drifted into sleep. He frowns at himself; he hadn't noticed the injury being that bad. \"Stop fretting, I'm fine, see?\" Napoleon smirks, nudging Illya's arm. He is fine, sure, but he won't be for much longer unless they find a way to stop the bleeding with a more reliable method than his own shaky, bruised hands. Gritting his teeth, Illya presses his foot down and speeds up, not caring about the lecture he's sure to receive from Waverly about standing out later, twisting and turning around other cars, occasionally driving on the wrong side of the road, until they reach the hotel, where he parks - or rather, stops the car at a random empty spot - and glances at Napoleon. \"Nice driving,\" said spy mutters, looking a little pale under the light of the obnoxious hotel sign. Illya says nothing, getting the two of them out of the car and leading Napoleon into the lobby, nodding at the incompetent receptionist before navigating his way to their room, his grip on Napoleon's waist basically the only thing keeping him upright. \"Would be nicer if you had been better fighter,\" Illya comments absently, focusing on unlocking the door with one hand and getting it to shut behind them without leaving suspicious bloodstains anywhere. Napoleon gasps as they stumble into the centre of the room but still manages to shake his head and argues: \"Gaby's the one who told us to fight them!\" Then his knees are buckling underneath him and strong, steady hands are around his arms, holding him up, keeping him stable. It takes him a minute to realise that his head is spinning, not the room, and he practically sags into Illya's comforting, cool touch before shaking his head, trying to shake himself out of his thoughts. They're moving and one of the hands is gone before something is pressed against Napoleon's lips and he opens his mouth without thinking, trusting the gentle voice telling him to swallow and promising freedom from the pain shooting out of his side. Napoleon only finds the strength to stand on his own when Illya replaces the glass of water on the table, but his head feels a little fuzzy and he has to blink to clear his vision again, keeping a hand on Illya's arm just in case. Neither of them moves when Napoleon stares up at Illya, when he looks into Illya's concerned eyes with a childlike wonder, or when Illya finds him staring back, admiring the way his partner's eyes look so much softer, so much more dazzling than usual for one reason or the other. Silence hangs above them like a stormcloud for much longer than it ever has before Illya clears his throat. \"Can you walk?\" \"Maybe,\" Napoleon answers honestly, his voice hoarse, his eyes unblinking as he watches the way Illya's forehead crinkles. \"What is it, Cowboy? I have something on my face?\" Illya asks, trying to figure out why he is suddenly so afraid of Napoleon's potential scrutiny. Dimly aware that he'd been given painkillers that are obviously taking an effect, but ignoring the fact, Napoleon shrugs. \"I wish it was my face…\" Illya blinks, startled. \"What?\" Confidence surges through Napoleon and he wobbles closer to Illya, inhaling the scent of copper and lavender and warmth. \"Peril, will you do something for me?\" He might usually have rolled his eyes but there's something both attractive and amusing about Napoleon right now - or maybe it's always there and he's never given himself an excuse to look - so he just nods, raising an eyebrow. \"Kiss me?\" Napoleon's voice is quiet but smooth, free of his usual arrogance and full of hope, sincerity, and something deeper, something Illya cannot yet name. Illya frowns, cocking his head at Napoleon, wondering why he'd ask something like that when they were clearly sharing what Gaby would definitely call 'a moment' but chalking it up to the drugs currently running through his veins. Despite what might be heavy disappointment settling in his gut, he steps back, surprised when Napoleon stumbles as he hadn't realised how close they'd been, and widens his stance, taking in his partner's position and how much force it would take, figuring that the pain must have suddenly gotten much worse for him. Too late, Napoleon notices that Illya has moved away and is doing the opposite of what he'd wanted. He has to push past the painful rejection thrown at him to realise that he should probably say something more, act upon his request to help it be fulfilled, but, as soon as he opens his mouth, there's a sharp but muted pain in his head and the world's going black. He doesn't feel Illya catch him before he hits the floor and then gently carry him to the bed, tucking him in as if he were a child to be protected; he doesn't hear how Illya mutters to himself about stupid tables and drugs making everything more confusing; and he doesn't see how maddeningly fast Illya paces along the room, occasionally glancing to Napoleon to see if he's comfortable, wringing his hands as he does. He does, however, wake up with a soft hiss of both pain and confusion. Within seconds, Illya is there, sitting beside him, placing a hand on his forehead, checking for a temperature as if he hadn't done that before, as soon as Napoleon had slightly stirred. Napoleon sucks in a breath, only mildly shocked when he feels the familiar pull of a bandage around his middle; it's not like they haven't fixed each other up before. Still, it somehow feels different this time, slightly more personal. \"Illya? What- Wait, did you seriously knock me out?\" Napoleon asks incredulously. Frowning yet again, Illya nods briskly. \"That is what you asked of me.\" Groaning, Napoleon pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs. \"Why on earth would I have asked you to do that?\" Illya shrugs, having asked himself the same thing at least a dozen times, simply waiting for Napoleon to crack a grin and explain himself. When he doesn't, Illya squints at him, noticing the look of hurt in his eyes. \"Are you still in pain?\" Napoleon lets out a bitter laugh and hesitantly takes Illya's hand, stroking the rough skin with his thumb. He lifts his gaze to Illya's eyes, sitting up a little better. \"I really don't think you understood what I meant.\" Illya shakes his head. \"You were in pain and asked me for the kiss. That is what I gave.\" Shifting so he's facing Illya, Napoleon swallows. \"No, no, I didn't ask you for the kiss. Peril, I- I asked you to kiss me,\" he says gently. \"What is difference?\" Illya asks, shrugging slightly, still not getting it. Instead of saying anything, Napoleon uses his grip on Illya's hand to pull them closer together, and, using that momentum, presses their lips together, softly but firmly, stealing Illya's breath away. The contact between them, as small as it is, sends ripples of electricity - the good kind, not the torture kind - along his skin and he shivers, his eyes sliding shut despite having wanted to see Illya's reaction. He doesn't feel Illya reciprocate so he pulls back, guilty, averting his eyes as he bites his lip, pushing down the hint of euphoria that he'd felt. \"I'm sorry, I thought-\" he mumbles, shuffling back, hoping this won't affect their missions, even if their friendship is ruined. \"That was not kiss,\" Illya remarks eventually, his voice hard and oddly hollow, as if he's not truly paying attention to what's happening. He pauses and Napoleon feels downright shameful - hating the idea of exploiting Illya, wishing he'd never done anything - but then a small smirk plays on his lips and he moves further onto the bed, killing the space between them, adding a hushed: \"This is kiss.\" And, before Napoleon can ready himself to be knocked out again, or worse, there's a hand cupping the side of his face, another wrapped around his waist to keep him steady, and a kind pair of lips connected to his, pushing harder than he had previously, as if fighting to prove something. He gasps, leaning into it without thinking, one of his hands reaching around Illya's neck as his eyes close again, a small yelp escaping him as Illya carefully bites down on his bottom lip, the taste of mint and surprise and smug love overwhelming his other senses. Breathing is a task and a half when they break apart, both equally as flushed, letting their foreheads touch as they smile, free of confusion and full of relief, panting, relishing in the feeling of being so close, so intimately close, to one another. \"You're right,\" Napoleon admits, his voice still shaky, \"that was definitely a better kiss.\" They leave the pending conversation about the next level of their relationship to later, choosing instead to just lean against the headboard with their arms around each other, Napoleon practically curled into Illya's side because Illya refuses to let him pull his stitches for the sake of cuddling. And, when Illya plants a soft kiss on his forehead, forget his skin, Napoleon's entire soul feels kissed. my friend is in a really really really bad place, if you can donate to help via kofi or , pls let me know!

The gray clouds guard the skies not allowing any sunlight to penetrate down to the grounds. The people gather in their black clothes to pay their respects to a woman only a few really knew. Most people knew her as an auto mechanic. Others as a spy. But there were a select few who truly knew her. Alexander Waverly stands by the tombstone telling a well-prepared tale of his time with Gaby that neither portrays her as a spy nor disclaims any details about her yet it seems to catch the hearts of many who attend the funeral. Two men, neither aware of each other, or possibly ignoring each other, wait behind different trees for the people to leave. Gaby lived a good life, a longer one that many others in her profession. She got to see the difference she made in the world and even become a grandmother. \"You can stop hiding now. At least for her.\" Waverley speaks into the empty space and lets the wind carry those words to whoever may want to hear them. He picks up his umbrella, thankful for the lack of rain, and with a sullen face leaves the grounds to mourn in private. Two men walk out of the shadows they are so used to hiding in, neither fully aware of the other as they are too swallowed up with their own grief for their mutual friend. It is only as they stand side-by-side at the tombstone that they finally acknowledge each other. \"It has been too long my friend.\" Napoleon Solo says. \"Or maybe not long enough.\" Illya Kuryakin answers and Solo looks at him in surprise. \"I only meant that I was sure the next time I saw you would be…\" Illya points to Gaby's tombstone. \"With my name on a tombstone.\" Solo nods in understanding. They stand in comfortable silence. \"Have you seen her recently?\" Solo asks but Illya shakes his head. \"I haven't seen her since U.N.C.L.E. got disbanned.\" Solo says. \"Me too.\" Illya says. \"I didn't expect her to be the first one to go.\" The Russian says. \"I thought I'd be the first one to go.\" The American laughs. \"Me too.\" Illya laughs too. \"She was a good agent. Better than the two of us combined, and don't you dare deny it.\" Solo says. \"I would not deny such a thing.\" Illya says as if here were personally attacked. \"You know there was a time when you would go against everything I said.\" Solo smiles. \"Yes, there was. Probably because everything you said was wrong.\" He responds and the two of them laugh. Anyone looking at the two men standing in front of the tombstone of someone they cared about deeply would think they had gone mad. \"I think Gaby would be shushing is right now.\" Illya says looking around to make sure no one was around. \"We were here boys after all.\" Solo adds. \"Yes, we were.\" The two men, after exchanging some stories from missions the three of them went on, stand in front of each other and after a minute of silent glances hug. \"Until next time Cowboy.\" \"Until next time Peril.\" \"Oh, should we make a bet on whose funeral is next?\" \"I do not make bets Napoleon.\" Anyone who knew them understood that they did not plan on seeing each other, not until their funerals. The rain starts to fall as they part ways not daring to look back, not daring to break their resolve, not daring to shed a tear in front of the other. One tear for Gaby and one tear for the other.

I participated in a summer gift exchange on AO3, and one of the prompts assigned to me requested Illya trolling Solo about how many cats he had. At the time I received the prompt, I had recently been watching a lot of hilarious Slavic YouTube videos, and decided that I absolutely had to incorporate my newfound knowledge of Russian swearing and Slavic culture into what is essentially a crack fic. So that's what happened. I hope you enjoy it nonetheless. ... It is, like many of life's great accomplishments, completely accidental and utterly inspired. They've just arrived in Serbia, and a search through the cupboards of their purportedly \"stocked\" apartment turns up nothing but a loaf of black bread that probably witnessed the start of the first world war. It's not moldy, though, so Illya braves a bite – mostly as a challenge to Solo, if he's being honest with himself – and then promptly chokes on the horrid staleness of it. \"That would not even be suitable for квас,\" he manages, after spitting it out and drinking a large glass of water (all under Solo's highly amused scrutiny, of course). \"You mean the drink?\" Solo asks, glee somewhat dimmed by confusion. \"No,\" Illya says, completely straight-faced, \"my cat.\" And oh, блин, that is just the beginning. A couple of years into their partnership, it's safe to say that they've more or less got the important aspects of one another figured out. Of course they still have secrets, parts of themselves that they're not ready or willing to share, and those will almost certainly become known with time, but the foundations are there, uncovered, ready to be built on. Solo is an incorrigible thief, light fingers ready to dip into any pocket and lift any jewelry, all too likely to duck off the path of a sanctioned break-in for ten minutes and come back with a folder tucked under his arm or a small painting distorting the lines of his jacket. (He doesn't go after larger art on missions, but that doesn't stop the occasional appearance of a canvas-wrapped frame in their lodging du jour.) Gaby is grimly determined to prove herself, perhaps a bit more so than is necessarily healthy (not that he of all people can criticise her for that), but it makes her a good partner: willing to learn, but also willing to take risks and brave the unknown. Illya is not unfamiliar with the challenges of overcoming a…distasteful family history, and perhaps he has no useful advice to offer, and perhaps they never discuss it, but it creates something of a bond between them. Faint, weak, maybe, but there. Gaby also has a wicked sense of humour, which isn't really a surprise, but it's a joy to witness nonetheless, even if Illya finds himself on the wrong end of her jokes as often as Solo does. Life is about taking what you can get and not looking too closely at what you end up with. So when Solo swallows the line about a cat named Квас hook, line, and sinker, well. Illya would be fool to pass up an opportunity like that. \"Ah,\" says Illya, adding a thick dollop of cream to his coffee. He doesn't usually, but it's been the sort of week that demands unorthodoxy. \"Reminds me of кефир.\" \"Кефир,\" Gaby repeats, tasting the word. \"It sounds familiar – have you mentioned it before?\" \"It's fermented milk, more or less,\" Solo supplies without looking up from his newspaper. \"Considered something of a delicacy.\" There's a neat sticking plaster on his forehead, covering the three small stitches needed to close a gash at his hairline. Gaby's left wrist is in a thick brace, and Illya's side is still twinging three days after taking a spray of birdshot from their target. A stressful week, but not the worst they've had. \"It has a very rich taste,\" Illya agrees, \"though it sounds odd to foreigners. It is also,\" he adds casually, \"a common name for house cats.\" Solo goes completely still. He might not even be breathing. \"Oh, do you have a cat?\" Gaby asks, delighted, jumping in without hesitation. \"One or two,\" Illya answers. Solo clears his throat. Illya smiles into his coffee. Five alleged cats later – Урод, Ушанка, Сука, Братан, and Дебил – he's fairly certain Solo suspects something. He doesn't know what he suspects, but that doesn't matter: suspicion is a perfectly acceptable outcome, and Solo does a very amusing suspicious. It's almost cute. Could be better, though, so he enlists Gaby. She's entirely too thrilled to be in on the game, and for a single moment, looking at the unnatural gleam in Gaby's eyes at the promise of organized chaos, Illya feels what may be an inkling of sympathy for Solo. It doesn't last long. \"Just little bits,\" he tells Gaby. \"Enough to keep him guessing, but not enough to make him think he has an answer.\" \"Any particular reason for this?\" Gaby asks, but not like she really cares. Just digging at him a little bit, seeing what motivations or backstory or insights she can glean. He shrugs. \"Why not?\" Gaby beams. Between the two of them, they needle Solo into an artful state of bristling paranoia, batting him back and forth between them like a pair of masterful tennis players. They don't let it interfere with work, of course, because current pass-time aside they actually are professionals, but any time not spent actively working missions (recon, surveillance, research, any of it) is fair game. \"Oh, Ушанка,\" Gaby sighs as they pass a fluffy black mop of a dog on the sidewalk. \"He was that color, wasn't he?\" \"Yes,\" Illya agrees blandly. \"I assume he still is – he didn't die, he just ran away.\" \"Oh really?\" Solo asks, feigning a level of disinterest that he has to know is fooling no one. \"And why would he do that?\" \"Сука is bully,\" Illya says, and leaves it there. They're walking in a cluster, with Gaby and Illya in front and Solo in the rear. It's mostly because the sidewalk is crowded, but it's also probably partly due to the fact that somehow, Solo has gotten it in his head that he and Gaby are a burgeoning couple. To be fair, they have been engaged in some rather furtive meetings recently, and have broken off many a soft conversation at his entrance, but that's not because they're a couple. They're discussing strategy . Honestly, they're not even that subtle about it. If Solo doesn't know by now that he's being played by both of them, there may not be hope for him. Whatever the reasons, Solo is walking a step behind them, and they pretend not to hear the soft scratching of his pen as he takes notes in their periphery. \"Is it Урод or Братан who hates milk?\" Gaby asks when they have a quiet moment in the elevator. \"Is Кефир, actually,\" Illya answers. \"How ironic,\" Solo mutters darkly. They ignore him, and the doors ding open, and their work takes precedence once more. The game has been going on for months , and at this point half the joy is watching Solo try to talk himself out of playing. He has to have realized that Illya will never tell him the truth, regardless of how much or little this particular truth matters, but the temptation of knowledge – more specifically, knowledge that will give him an advantage – is one he's never been able to resist. He's had his teeth in Illya since their first meeting, trying to shake out his secrets and pry open his locked doors, but Illya never expected him to latch onto such a small question with such tenacity. It's like he's convinced himself that all the mysteries of Illya's past, present, and future are tied up in the number of cats in his possession. That is not true, of course – he cannot begin to imagine what Solo expects to learn from the answer – but even so, it's far too late to give in. Solo will never learn the answer, if only so that Illya doesn't have to find himself a new game. Also, the cowboy should learn some boundaries. And maybe some humility, but one step at a time. It was probably inevitable that Solo would turn to bugs once more. Illya finds all of them with relative ease and dumps them in Solo's coffee the next morning. Solo just shrugs, conceding the loss. \"Ruins the taste, you know,\" is all he says, but Gaby frowns. \"Isn't that toxic?\" \"I doubt it's hot enough to seriously melt anything,\" Solo says, then takes a swig and grimaces. \"Just gives it a little extra flavor.\" Gaby rolls her eyes and goes back to her own coffee. \"Well, if you die today, I guess we'll know why.\" \"Murdered by my own partner,\" Solo sighs. \"Tragic.\" Illya rolls his eyes. \"Always so dramatic. No need to be Вадим.\" Solo's eyes narrow. \"Is that...?\" \"Maybe.\" Illya smiles. \"Maybe not.\" Gaby slips him a folded scrap of paper as they pass each other outside a department store; he unfolds it once he's inside, reads he's started a chart , and tries to suppress a vicious smile. Based on the reaction of the sales associate, he is less than successful. He manages to salvage the situation, though, and buys Gaby a hat on his way out. She's earned it. That evening, he casually walks behind Solo's chair in the common room of their current apartment, casually glances at the newspaper he's been glaring at for over an hour now, and finds (with very little surprise) that the newspaper is merely a cover; pinned against it is a sheet of notebook paper with what looks like a crudely drawn elimination puzzle and a profusion of scribbles around it, too small and distant to make out without peering too obviously. So it's going well. For him, that is. Then Solo gets stabbed, and they take a break for a bit. All told, it could have been much worse, but between the stress of the situation leading up to it and the considerable increase in stress following it, no one really has the spirit for jokes. \"Hey, Peril,\" Solo croaks a few days in, when he's starting to get tired of being in the hospital but not quite ready to leave yet. Gaby and Illya have both been spending most of their time trying to clean up the absolute пиздец that the mission had turned into, but they take turns dropping in on Solo and making sure he hasn't attempted to escape, attempted to seduce any of the medical staff, or otherwise given them anything else to worry about. And, well, to make sure that he's doing all right. \"What,\" Illya asks blunty, and it's not that he's angry, or even irritated, he just hasn't slept more than two hours a night since Solo was hurt and he's tired . \"Pass me that folder?\" There's a thin file folder on the small table on Solo's right side, and it would be well within his reach if his right arm weren't currently out of commission, but it is, so Illya picks up the folder and puts it into Solo's waiting left hand. Solo brings up his knees to rest the folder against them, then flips it open and sorts through it one-handed. \"I just have one question,\" he says, \"and then you should probably go lie down before you fall down.\" \"What,\" Illya says again, but this time it's more of a sigh. He's so, so tired. \"Блядь, yes or no?\" Solo whips out a piece of paper, which turns out to be what looks like a torn-out page from a magazine. On it is a picture of a grey and white cat. It's a good thing Illya's learned to keep so much of himself inside, or his relief would be embarrassingly obvious. \"No,\" he answers, and lets a small smile escape. \" Сука блядь.\" \"God damn it,\" Solo sighs. \"I was so sure this time.\" \"Try again tomorrow,\" Illya suggests, and tucks the picture back into the folder. \"Check your chart. Who knows – I may even give you clue.\" \"You would never.\" Illya smiles. ... квас (kvass): a fermented drink made with black bread блин (blin): literally means pancake, but is also used as an all-purpose interjection кефир (kefir): a Russian/Eastern European drink made of fermented milk Урод (urod): idiot, fool Ушанка (ushanka): the fluffy russian hat with ear flaps Сука (suka): literally \"bitch\" but also used as a strong general insult Братан (bratan): somewhat milder general insult Дебил (debil): annoying idiot Вадим (Vadim): male name, also sworn enemy of The Boris пиздец (pizdets): big mess, fuck-up Блядь (blyat): fuck Сука блядь (suka blyat): an interjection that's basically 'fuck' squared Thank you for reading! As the summary mentions, this was written for a prompt that requested ridiculousness, hence the ridiculousness. My knowledge of Russian comes pretty much exclusively from the YouTube channel \"Life Of Boris,\" so take my usage and translations with a heaping handful of salt. I feel bad for using Сука, because I didn't initially know it meant \"bitch\"; nowadays it seems to be used in a completely gender-neutral way, but still. I decided to leave it as a cautionary tale about using languages you don't speak, and also for video-quoting purposes that are amusing to no one but me.

He's not even sure how it happens, just that he freezes when he should be reacting, mind caught in a thick sludge of apathy and indecision and detachment, so that when he should be moving, he simply stands, unable to find the will to act. It's Illya that tackles him to the ground, pushing him from the path of a burst of automatic fire, but even that seems slow and distant. Illya's shouts fall on ears gone deaf, the words not strong or important enough to break through the fog that's been thickening for days. In the end, Illya leaves him there, presses an extra magazine into his hand and disappears into the fray. He comes back once the warehouse has gone silent, not that Napoleon notices. He's tight-lipped, obviously angry, but he doesn't say anything, and Napoleon doesn't care. He doesn't care about anything at all. Gaby calls it in once they're back at the safehouse. Napoleon's on the couch, trying to feel. All he has is exhaustion, and that same feeling of persistent unreality. Gaby doesn't lie in her report to Waverly, just speaks dispassionately of their failure to apprehend their target. She doesn't look at Napoleon. To be fair, he's not looking at her either. \"There was a complication,\" Gaby says calmly. \"Solo's unwell.\" There's a pause, and he stirs himself to look up at her. He's unprepared for her gaze, the pity and apology in her eyes, but he can't even be bothered to care that he's about to lose his job. It's a minor concern, far less a problem than the back-bowing weight of everything holding him down. It may even be a relief – no work, no responsibilities, nothing to stop him from simply giving in. \"He has a high fever,\" she says. \"It made it hard for him to act.\" He closes his eyes, and the weight of the world redoubles on his shoulders. He was so close. And Gaby did lie. \"I'm sorry,\" he says once he can think again. It's the next day, and it still hasn't really gotten through to him. He's hoping it never does, because as much as he hates the fog, he hates even more when it lifts, leaving him with a guilt and shame and apologies and reparations and work , so much work , to try to get his life back in order. He hates feeling this way, but it's not really hatred, and it's not really even feeling. It just is, and sometimes (often), he thinks he'd rather live this way forever than fight his way out of it one more time. \"I know,\" Gaby says, \"but it's not your fault.\" He laughs tonelessly at that. \"Who else's fault could it be?\" \"Nobody's,\" she says, like it makes perfect sense. \"Nothing is nobody's fault,\" he tells her, and rolls over to put his back to her. He's still on the couch, but now he has a pillow. He tries not to feel ashamed, which is easier now than it will be later because he's still so fucking tired. Later is a specter lingering ever present at the edges of his vision, and it tracks him down with unerring precision. The first day is exhaustion, which he never notices because he's almost always tired. It makes sense, though: his job is dangerous and demanding and he never sleeps quite as much as he'd like to. The second day he's irritable, on-edge, and every little thing pushes him closer to snapping. But that too is natural, since he's tired, and doesn't everyone get irritable when they're tired? The third day, he loses all his appetites. He doesn't eat, finding the process of preparing food too tiring to be worth it and the product wholly unsatisfactory. He stops noticing the beautiful things around him, the temptation to take buried by the knowledge that it wouldn't change a thing. He stops wanting to talk, to flirt, to argue; he simply doesn't have the energy. By the fourth day, there is no color, no meaning, no joy. Simply to exist is an unbearable burden, and remaining awake is an unconscionable waste of his efforts because nothing has ever mattered and nothing ever will. This vast expanse of emptiness and hopelessness is his life forever, and he rather wants to die. The fourth day is always the day that he realizes what's happening, and it's always too late to stop it. He should be better at recognizing the episodes by now, but. Well. He should be better at a lot of things, shouldn't he. No matter how much he wants to not , however, he always does his job. He gets up, he gets dressed, he holsters his gun, he smooths his hair, and he gets to work. No matter how much he wants to starve himself until the world dissolves around him, no matter how much he wants to sleep so long he never wakes up, no matter how much he wants to be deaf and mute and so give up his role in the world, no matter no matter no matter, he always does his job. He cooks, he talks, he chases, he drives, he shoots. And maybe it's duller than usual, maybe it lacks his signature flair, maybe it comes across as tired and pale, maybe maybe maybe, but he simply cannot care. No matters and maybes aside, he does his job, and he does it well. It might be a blessing, but it feels like a curse. This is the worst fall he can remember, not that it particularly matters. He's starting to get tired of this – the exhaustion, the apathy, the inability to do anything even should he want to (the inability to want in the first place) – which means that he's wading through it one laborious step at a time, coming incrementally closer to the end, but that doesn't make it stop. \"I would like to be done with this,\" he says to the ceiling, just to taste the words. It feels like a rebellion, somehow, to not simply take what he is given and stew in it. Resentment isn't a right he's earned: he's not too good for this, not somehow above this punishing grey, and if he were any sort of reasonable person, he'd simply fight against it and break free of its hold on him. But he's not reasonable, obviously, because he still gives in the moment he feels it creeping up behind him. He lets this happen; he has no business being unhappy about it. \"I'm sure you would,\" Gaby says quietly, and he startles. He'd forgotten he wasn't alone. He looks over, and sure enough, there she is – curled up in a chair, wearing one of his sweaters and doodling in her schematics notebook. \"You don't have to stay, you know.\" Why she would want to is beyond him; even i he's/i growing tired of his company, his mind being what it is. \"Don't be stupid,\" she says calmly. \"I'm not leaving you alone like this.\" \"Illya did,\" he says without thinking, and immediately regrets it. Illya doesn't deserve to be maligned like that, let alone by a pathetic bastard like him . But even as he says it, he feels the truth of it, feels the sting of the words. Illya did leave him, did drop him in disgust at the first opportunity, did realize what he was and distance himself as much as he could. It shouldn't hurt, but it does. It isn't unfair, isn't even unexpected, yet it still wraps his heart in stone and drags it down. This is who he is, after all. This is what he is. He has no doubt that he'll find himself alone at the end of it, cut off from everyone he once held close, because that's what you do to anchors – you cut them away to keep yourself free. And he's resigned himself to it, but that doesn't mean he's embraced it. There's quite a bit of distance between acceptance and peace. \"Illya didn't leave,\" Gaby tells him. She should probably be angry, or at least frustrated, but she doesn't sound like she is. \"He's following up a lead. And besides,\" she adds, voice growing ever so slightly steelier, \"he didn't leave you alone , did he?\" No. That's something, perhaps. When he goes to bed, Gaby doesn't try to stop him. When he sleeps through the night and much of the next day, she doesn't try to wake him up. She just keeps him company, makes food for him to pick at and brings him tea and water, gives him her flannel so he can wash his face without having to stand at the sink. Illya comes back two days later, and Napoleon resolutely doesn't look at him. He keeps his eyes closed and his face to the back of the couch, and pretends to sleep so successfully that he actually does. \"Do you want to go to bed?\" Illya asks him once, when he caught him unawares with his eyes open, staring blankly at the upholstery. \"No,\" Napoleon says. He doesn't think he could actually stand right now, and even if he wanted to try he wouldn't want Illya to see. No one mentions the mission. Only once he's slept enough for a month does the fog start tentatively creeping away. His mind is clearer, but his body is still weak and unsure of itself, and he'll need a few days' more rest if he doesn't care to have an immediate relapse. He's far enough through it now to be annoyed, infuriated by his failings and sullenly seething that of all people, this had to fall on him, and of all the illness he could contract, he had to get the one that no one would believe. Insolent, they called him, for not responding to orders and barbs with sufficient alacrity. A womanizer, they sneered, but how often had he let them see seduction when all he'd really had was sleep? His life is far too worthless to be so much work, yet here he is, getting ready to go back to it and pretend that nothing happened. In the end, all he can do is keep moving forward, over and over, again and again. It's torturous and brutal, but maybe one day it will be better. thank you for reading this week's installment of writing angst to attempt to cope with my problems !

Nothing of particular note has happened recently – just the normal running of the bakery, weekend socializing, and the occasional Event – and nothing of particular note is happening now . There's absolutely no reason to feel so content, but he does. He's in Gaby's kitchen making omelettes when the thought occurs, and he nearly flips the eggs right out of the pan. He catches them just in time and tries to contain his grimace, but something must show. \"Close one,\" Illya comments drily, and Napoleon scowls at him. \"If you'd like to take over, you only have to say so.\" Illya scowls back, but there's no steel behind it. Illya's real scowls can practically cut through rock. Without the sheer laser-like hatred, the expression looks more like fond exasperation, and Napoleon's whole chest gets warm. He grins, and Illya smiles back – it's a small smile, not much more than a slight twist at the corner of his lips, but it's unexpected and lovely enough to send his heart skittering. Gaby's sitting on the counter beside them, shamelessly eating the leftover toppings with her hands. Diced bell pepper, shredded cheese, sautéed mushrooms – nothing is safe from her, no matter how shortly they'll be eating. \"Who decided we should have omelettes for dinner, anyway?\" she asks out of nowhere. \"They're a breakfast food.\" \"That doesn't mean they can only be eaten for breakfast,\" Napoleon argues, swirling the pan before flipping again. \"Besides, breakfast for dinner is a wonderful American tradition. Peril, what kind of cheese for you?\" \"Cheddar, but not like you put on Gaby's. That is far too much cheese for one person.\" Gaby sticks her tongue out at him, but Napoleon snatches the bowl of cheddar before she can steal another handful. \"I would have made pancakes, you know,\" he goes on, sprinkling the cheese over Illya's omelette, \"if someone hadn't thrown a fit.\" \"Pancakes aren't real food,\" Illya insists, exasperated. \"They are dessert, not dinner.\" \"Peril, I'm surprised at you. Perfectly shocked, really. That you would so insult pancakes when they're not even here to defend themselves…\" He tuts disapprovingly. Illya rolls his eyes and turns away to finish setting the table, but not before Napoleon sees another smile trying to get out. \"It's just too easy,\" he stage-whispers at Gaby. \"It's a miracle he hasn't locked you in a freezer yet,\" Gaby mutters back. \"That you know of,\" Illya says blandly, setting down silverware. Napoleon winks at Gaby, then folds the omelette and slides it onto its waiting plate. He's not particularly good at being happy, but with these two around, he'll have plenty of time to practice.

It had been a hell of a mission, beginning with their contact getting poisoned and ending with an armed chase through a Methodist chapel. Two civilians are in the hospital, Gaby will be on crutches for a month, but all the men across the table can talk about is their lack of subterfuge. The other agents, Denforth and Hastings, are obviously new and British to the core; they're not pleased with an arrogant American and a monosyllabic Russian 'mucking things up.' It doesn't seem to matter to them that they'd gotten the files they needed or that no one had died. Napoleon is sneaking glances at his partner, in between placating the pair of them with tight nods and disarming smiles. While Illya's obviously not happy, he's not shaking with rage either. Napoleon entertains the thought that they might get out of here before dawn after all. \"And another thing! That Teller woman ought to be reminded where her priorities lie, or she could find herself reassigned.\" He spoke too soon. Illya goes very, very still next to him. \"Her name,\" he says carefully, \"is Agent Teller.\" He gives Agent Hastings a glare that normally has people reaching for the nearest weapon. Napoleon would know, he's been on the receiving end of it many times. Hastings must be blind, because he continues. \"Then she'd better act like an agent; civilian involvement is unfortunate but her mission was to retrieve the files. Not play the hero. I'd say she got off lucky with a wound like that.\" Denforth nods smugly with his partner, and Napoleon can see Illya's fists start to tremble underneath the table. All he wants is to get cleaned up and go to bed. Perhaps check on Gaby. Have a drink. But if Illya gets in another fight with a fellow agent, he really will be reassigned. He closes his eyes for a moment and utters a quick prayer, then he carefully reaches out and rests his hand on top of Illya's. The other man tenses even further. Denforth begins to flick through paperwork, oblivious to Illya's glare. Napoleon gently strokes the side of his hand with his thumb. \"Deep breaths,\" he mutters. Illya shoots him an annoyed look, but slowly, ever so slowly, his fist unclenches, until it's lying flat against his leg, shaking. Napoleon keeps stroking as he reaches for the stack of papers with his other hand. \"Well, we'll be sure to pass that along. We'll just sign these and be out of your hair.\" He gives them a strained smile and scribbles his signature down. He slides the paper over to Illya, who signs it so rigidly it's like he's carving his name into solid oak instead of signing a mission report. Napoleon stands and allows his hand to slide up to the other man's shoulder. Illya stands as well, brow furrowed but hands stable. \"We'll be going then. Gentlemen.\" He leaves before they can answer, pulling his partner along. Illya is uncharacteristically compliant, and Napoleon slows when they reach their rooms, turning and letting his hand finally drop. \"Are you alright? You're quiet.\" Illya nods curtly, not meeting his eyes. \"I am fine. I do not like that man.\" Napoleon smiles and claps him on the shoulder. \"Couldn't agree with you more, I felt like punching him myself. Now get some rest. Gaby will be fine.\" The corner of Illya's mouth twitches. \"I do not take orders from you, Cowboy.\" Napoleon laughs and turns away, opening his door. He steps in, then turns to shut it. \"We'll see about that. Goodnight, Peril.\" He closes the door. He sincerely doubts the other man will sleep much tonight, and definitely not without checking on Gaby first. It's the only reason why he doesn't do so himself. He stretches, cracking his back, then grabs his robe and heads for the bathroom. He deserves a bath. A nice long one. And maybe a drink. Definitely a drink. - • • • - \"We'll see about that,\" Napoleon says, laughing. \"Goodnight, Peril.\" He closes the door. Illya stands there for a moment, then heads for the elevator. He knows he won't be able to sleep tonight until he sees Gaby with his own eyes, and he knows that the only reason Napoleon hasn't checked on her himself is because he knows his partner will. He presses the button for the elevator, and stands back to allow a handful of agents to get off when it arrives. They nod to him as he sidles past them, and he tips his head in reply. He recognizes one or two of them from past missions. They'd all been tolerable, why had Waverly assigned Denforth and Hastings to this one? He gets on, presses the button for the infirmary, and folds his arms as the doors close, eyeing the corners distrustfully. There are cameras everywhere here. Not as good as his own agency's, but better than the Americans'. Speaking of Americans . . . Illya's brow furrows. No one had ever been able to do that. Granted, not many had tried. The closest he'd ever come to not giving in to the shaking anger he often felt was when Gaby grabbed his arm in Rome, her voice tight as she told him to hand over the watch. Even then he'd barely kept it together, and he'd still injured one of the muggers. There had been people in the past who'd tried to restrain him during such episodes, to hold him down or try to talk him out of it. But Napoleon had done no such thing. All he'd done was cover Illya's hand with own, warm and still. He'd told him to breathe, whispered it out of the corner of his mouth so Hastings and Denforth couldn't hear. Rubbed his thumb gently back and forth. If anyone else had done that, he would've thrown off their hand and bared his teeth at them. It would've felt like mockery. Why is it different with this man, this infuriating, unorthodox, and reluctant American agent? He doesn't know. But he intends to figure it out, to know why this man can stop his rage with just a touch. The elevator dings, and he looks up with a start. With a shake of his head, he strides out of the elevator and looms over the nurse at the front desk. \"Teller,\" he grunts. \"Gaby. British, brown hair, gunshot to right calf. What room?\" The nurse looks at him over the top of her glasses, unimpressed, then turns to her computer. She hits a few keys and nods. \"Hmm, Teller, she came out of surgery about half an hour ago. You're Agent Kuryakin, yes? I'll give you her room, but you're only allowed fifteen minutes. Patients need their rest and doctors need their space. Am I clear?\" She turns back to him and raises an eyebrow. Illya glares, then nods. The nurse rolls her eyes. \"Room 112. Fifteen minutes.\" He turns and heads for the the recovery wing, the nurse muttering behind him. \" Field agents! \" Illya strides past the row of endless, identical rooms. 108, 110, 112. He knocks quietly on the door, then eases it open. Gaby is slumped in a mound of pillows, snoring lightly. He allows himself a small smile. She's alright. Her hair is a mess, and she has a bruise on her chin, but she's alright. Her injured leg is under the covers. He knows that touching her would wake her, bullet wound and anesthesia be damned, so he edges around to the end of the bed, squinting to read her chart in the light from the hallway. It's a through and through, no shrapnel, and the bullet had missed the bone with millimeters to spare. She'll need crutches for several weeks, but no permanent damage. She's alright. Satisfied, he stands, and after one last look, he leaves, closing the door softly behind him. He still doesn't think he'll sleep tonight.[Chapter 2] The next time it happens, they're on a stakeout. The life of an agent isn't all shooting and running and car chases, a lot of it is hurry-up-and-wait. Napoleon is used to it and Illya is focused on the feed from the room next door, but Gaby lost interest a while ago. Forbidden from pacing because of the thin hotel walls, the young agent has commandeered the only pair of headphones and is glaring at the small television screen, chin in hand. They've managed to acquire a room directly next to the American mob boss, but after that their luck had stalled. Vainer hasn't so much as gotten out of his chair in over two hours. Gaby begins to tap her foot impatiently, and Illya slowly turns his head towards her. She rolls her eyes at him, but stills. He turns back to the screen, just as there's a knock next door. Napoleon gets up from his seat by the window and comes to stand behind them, hand on the back of the Russian's chair. Vainer's men stand as well, and one of them checks the peephole, a hand on his holster. After a moment he laughs and swings it open, ushering in three more of Vainer's men and a thin young woman in a miniskirt and a halter top. As Vainer looks up, Gaby puts the headset down on the table and turns the volume up enough so they can all hear. \"Well, well, well. Whadda ya' got there, boys?\" The mob boss stands and moves to sit on the edge of his desk. His smile is cruel and the woman–girl, really–wraps her arms around herself nervously. \"I-I'm Lulu-\" The three agents jerk as Vainer slaps her, hard enough to snap her head around. She brings a hand to her face in shock as the men laugh. \"Listen, doll,\" Vainer says. \"You only speak when spoken to, got it?\" Lulu nods hurriedly and glances towards the door, but the men behind her shift to block it. Next door, Gaby's jaw is clenched, and Napoleon and Illya's faces are rigidly blank. One of the men who brought the girl in shoves her foreword, and the goons form a circle around her as their boss slides off his desk and saunters closer, hands in his pockets. \"I think we're gonna have some fun with you. Might even pay ya, if you're . . . friendly enough.\" Lulu's eyes are wide, her cheek reddening. She can't be more than sixteen. There's an awful silence in the other room. \"We have to do something . . .\" Gaby's voice trails off. They can't compromise this stakeout. They can't. And they all know it. Illya tries to concentrate on his breathing, in through the nose, out through the mouth, but his vision blurs and all he can hear is his mother's voice, brittle and far too high, telling him that it's alright, this is just one of his father's friends, everything will be fine. Her voice mixes with countless others: his superiors, the officers who told him about his father, a handful of classmates, and, achingly, his partner's, scorn in their tones as they remark on how 'friendly' his mother was. He can't go next door, can't stop them, he can't. But he can't not, he can't just sit there and watch, and if he so much as knocks his chair over, they'll be noticed. He starts when Napoleon speaks up. \"Gaby, call the front desk and tell them we have a noise complaint.\" He wrenches his gaze from the screen and reaches for Illya, carefully telegraphing his movements. \"Peril. We won't let them hurt her. I promise.\" He cups the back of Illya's neck with one hand and reaches for his clenched fists with the other. Illya closes his eyes and grabs for it with both hands, shaking. \"C'mon, partner, breathe with me.\" Illya sucks in a lungful of air and opens an eye. He's face to face with the other man, noses almost touching. \"Really, Cowboy,\" he croaks, \"'partner?'\" In the background, he can hear Gaby on the phone. He glances up at the screen. The men are ignoring the girl for now, laughing at something Vainer is saying. He curls his lip and Napoleon knocks their foreheads softly together, making him look back. \"Hey, pot, kettle, Red Peril.\" His eyes are so blue, bluer than anything Illya's ever seen, and his hand is warm in his and on the nape of his neck. He's still upset, but he's more in control now. He doesn't understand how this man's touch can calm him like this, doesn't understand why he allows it. He doesn't understand it at all. He looks down at Napoleon's hand in his. It's smaller, but no less calloused, with faint scarring on the knuckles and nimble fingers that can lift the hat right off your head. He knows that from experience; the first time he'd caught Napoleon at it, he'd snatched his cap back and shoved it inside his jacket, grumbling at the American to keep his thieving hands to himself. They're nice hands, he supposes, but ordinary, really. So why does his heart calm and his shaking still when they touch him? He frowns, then sits up as the front desk manager knocks on Vainer's door. Napoleon's hands slide to his lap. \"Alright, now?\" Illya gives him a sharp nod, then relents. \"Yes. Thank you.\" His vision is clear and his hands are steady again. He turns back to the TV, pulling his hands free, and he can feel his teammate's eyes on him. Thankfully, Vainer answers the door just then, and Lulu ducks out of the circle and darts out the door, heels clacking. Then men let her, laughing and jeering. She's safe. He'll figure out the mystery of Napoleon's touch later, right now he has a job to do. ","Summary":" They're debriefing with two of Waverly's subordinates, and Napoleon can feel Illya getting angrier "},{"Movie":"Man From U.N.C.L.E.","Title":"Trajectory","Author":"rose griffes","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13091509","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Groton, Connecticut, USA July 1963 Back in the good ol' U.S. of A., thinks Solo, and wonders when exactly Sanders' voice became so ingrained in his subconscious that he can hear it even when the short man with the long leash was nowhere in sight. It's not usually part of the C.I.A.'s purview, posting an agent on U.S. soil, but this assignment is unusual in plenty of other ways. Sanders hadn't contacted him; instead Director McCone himself made the phone call. Frankly Solo would rather deal with the short devil that he already knew. But here he is, walking along Esker Point Beach with the ex-wife of the submarine captain who has gone missing. Along with all his crew and the submarine itself. Gaby and the Red Peril are a few miles away, in close proximity to the Naval base and their colleagues inside. The U.S. Navy has gone to extraordinary lengths to be as transparent as possible-in private dealings with both allies and enemies, if not in public-which has led to this: under the auspices of U.N.C.L.E., Gaby coordinates intel-sharing with SIS and the KGB, Kuryakin shadows the KGB agent that the organization chose for its semi-public face, and Solo... well, he's the honeypot. Again. He doesn't think Marlene knows anything about her ex-husband's doings, but he's here to make sure. To play the beach bum that Marlene can confide in after downing generous portions of Blue Hawaiians and Vodka Gimlets. \"Robert, look over there!\" Marlene grabs his arm and points it in toward the water. \"They're playing with a Frisbee!\" He looks closer at the group of young people throwing a lightweight disk-made of plastic, he thinks, rather than metal. \"That's a Pluto Platter,\" he tells Marlene. Or a Flynn Saucer; another name that bobs to the surface of his memories. She shrugs, uninterested in what he called the thing, and tugs him toward the group. Solo spends the afternoon getting a sore wrist and a sunburn, and learning exactly zero secrets from Marlene, who is more interested in watching shirtless men throw around a plastic saucer than in sharing confidences. At least he wins whatever unofficial contest they're engaged in. Grand prize: the Frisbee disk itself. (Marlene was right; that name is printed across the top of it.) Twenty-four hours later he meets up with Gaby and Illya in the ballroom of a hotel-not the hotel where Gaby stays in her official role, or where Illya doesn't sleep in his publicly undisclosed role. It's a boring meeting, but he's pathetically happy to see them and talk about something, anything, other than what passed as small talk in Marlene's circle of friends. Okay, and maybe he's slightly pleased to see his U.N.C.L.E. colleagues, even if they're not all officially working for U.N.C.L.E. this time. (The Istanbul mission ended two weeks ago; they arrived separately in Connecticut, flying in from different countries, and while Solo definitely works better alone, it's not always bad to have someone else around. Neither the Red Peril nor Gaby are hard on the eyes, and they're surprisingly effective given the one's temper and the other's newness to the job.) Gaby finishes her U.N.C.L.E.-sanctioned news report, Illya stays close-mouthed, and Solo gets his turn. He pulls the Frisbee disk out of his briefcase with a flourish, stating, \"This is what I have to report.\" \"Was ist das?\" Gaby blurts out. It's a satisfying enough result to his deliberate dramatics. \"It's a Frisbee disk. And this is about as exciting as things got during the beach date with Marlene yesterday.\" He tosses it lightly and it sails across the length of the ballroom, bouncing off the wall and falling to the floor. \"This is for what purpose?\" asks Illya. \"It's a game, Peril. You toss the Frisbee to your friends, they chase it around, you all get sunburned and drink a lot, and you don't share any secret plots your ex-husband had to steal a submarine and its crew.\" Gaby raises her eyebrows. \"At least you got to drink.\" Fair point, he thinks. Per her report, she's been on the phone with London or talking to a KGB agent with a thicker accent than Illya's for the last three days. Illya walks across the ballroom and then returns, Frisbee disk in hand. He examines it, turning it over. \"Why the name Frisbee?\" \"Does there have to be a reason?\" He doesn't actually know the answer to Illya's question. Marketing, copyright law, a whim... Illya bends his knees, flexes his wrist and throws it. It flops over, traveling maybe a third of the length of the ballroom. Gaby giggles, and it's the first time Solo has heard a sound like that come out of her mouth since-well, ever. Illya's eyes narrow in a glare at Solo as he stalks back with the disk in hand again. \"Teach me this,\" he says. Napoleon hasn't actually thought through how he learned to throw the Pluto Platter; it takes him a few dry runs, feeling how his muscles work, to describe what to do. On his next throw, Illya manages to get the Frisbee to hit almost the exact same spot on the far wall as Solo had earlier. \"Hmph,\" says Gaby, and takes the disk from Illya when he comes loping back again. Her toss isn't elegant, but it's serviceable enough to move the Frisbee almost the length of the ballroom. She smiles, pleased that her first throw didn't flop as badly as Illya's did. Illya returns from yet another retrieval jog across the room. \"This could be useful for delivery of information,\" he says. \"In certain situation.\" Gaby scoffs. \"That doesn't sound very fun.\" She gestures imperiously, and Illya hands her the Frisbee. She takes careful aim, more graceful this time, and tosses the disk. It sails over to the far wall in an arc almost identical to Illya's second throw. After five more minutes of Gaby and Illya taking turns throwing the Frisbee (with Illya on permanent retrieval duty), the two of them have created a complicated point system that involves the Frisbee touching a dent on the wall, or below the second wall sconce, or striking the chair rail between the third and fourth wall panels. Napoleon loses to both of them. He's vigorously consoling himself over his loss in the arms of a wiry waitress from the hotel restaurant when the idea blooms into existence. Gaby and Illya have worked together on two missions. They're either both oblivious to how much the other is attracted, or they're deliberately not acting on it. Either way, given the stifling tension that builds up between them when they're near each other, Napoleon knows it's only a matter of time. In the meantime, though, he has a window of opportunity. A chance to win at Frisbee and enjoy watching the two of them suffer. He'll be in close proximity to the secretive glances, blushing cheeks, and lingering touches, but this time he'll be orchestrating that tension instead of just putting up with it and wishing they would get on with it with already. Implementing the plan the next morning requires a visit to the hardware store, a hunt for appropriate attire, and finally a trip to the beach to scope out the site of their upcoming defeat. Then he practices whenever possible, and waits for the right moment.[Chapter 2] p style=\"border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-Napoleon isn't sure if the relatively generous thirty-six hours of freedom before reporting for duty again is thanks to Director McCone, or if Sanders was simply left out of the loop during this stateside mission. It's an unimportant detail, though. He gets a message to both Gaby and Illya, saying that they need to have a priority meeting, and sets the time and place. \"What's so urgent?\" Gaby asks. Her wide sunglasses hide her eyes, and her careful movements broadcast hangover recovery: something else to factor into his strategy. \"Let's wait until-ah, here he is.\" Solo watches Peril finish walking to where they're standing: on a street corner next to a cafe that caters to the beach-going crowd. The man is still wearing his work clothes from this trip-quite literally all buttoned up in an American business suit. He looks stiflingly overdressed in the warm weather. Perfect for his plans, thinks Solo. \"I'm assuming you both have a day or two before you have to leave,\" Napoleon says. Gaby and Illya look at each other-a communication with meaning that Solo isn't privy to-and then back at him. \"Yes,\" answers Illya, his tone shading from neutral to suspicious in one short syllable. \"I thought we could all unwind and have a saucer rematch on the beach. It would be a fun way to celebrate another successful mission.\" Gaby lets out a tiny snort. \"I don't know why you call it successful.\" \"Well, we're all still alive, and the hotel rooms are intact, too.\" He grins toothily at Peril, pushing the smugness of it way past subtle into obnoxious. Illya bristles, just as Solo anticipated. \"Besides, I took your Frisbee disk point system and made a beach version of it, which is exactly what we need.\" Illya and Gaby exchange another look. Apparently Gaby gets tagged as designated refuser-of-fun, which works out as Solo hoped. \"I don't feel like playing in the sand just now,\" she says, adjusting the sunglasses to a higher angle. He waits until he feels certain she must be looking at him, and raises his eyebrows. \"Scared to lose this time?\" Gaby scoffs but doesn't relent yet, so he pulls out the next weapon in his arsenal. \"The winner gets a bottle of the finest rum made in the region.\" \"I don't like rum,\" says Gaby. \"Rum is too sweet,\" Illya concurs. \"Well then, why don't you choose the prize.\" He aims for chivalrous in his tone instead of petty annoyance, with mixed results. Gaby stands still, handbag draped over her shoulder: a chic woman with a hidden hangover, out on the town. \"Fine,\" she finally says. \"You owe me good whiskey when you lose again. Something expensive.\" Before he can accept, she adds, \"Something you buy instead of steal.\" \"I'll consider my honor duly maligned,\" he tells her. He considers adding a caveat that she isn't allowed to drink it in one sitting, but then remembers his ingracious plan for an immodest win. No need to worry about how she'll drink his expensive alcohol without properly appreciating it this time. He turns to Illya. \"What do you say, Peril. Are you in?\" The question is meaningless. Once Gaby accepted, there was no doubt that Illya would stay too. The man nods once, looking alarmingly determined. \"I have everything you two need right here,\" he tells them, handing each of them a small paper bag. \"Now go change in the cabins and I'll meet you at the beach-\" he gestures, \"Over there.\" His own swim trunks double as shorts for the moment, along with a lightweight linen button-front shirt that he'll continue to wear until they step onto the beach. Now he just has to wait for Gaby and Illya to deploy the main weapons in his arsenal. Nothing too obvious, of course: the swim trunks he found for Illya would be a decent length on his own frame, but he has the excuse of trying to fit a six foot five inch giant. The bikini is almost identical to what Ursula Andress wore in last year's Bond movie. Teller is built along more slender lines than the Swedish actress, but he has no doubt that Peril will find her beguiling anyway. Gaby has a cover-up in her bag, but putting a top in Illya's bag would have been counter-productive. He doesn't want to risk Peril keeping a shirt on for the entire game. Too bad he couldn't have arranged for this to happen earlier in the day; applying sunscreen would have been a nice starter. He'll just have to count on the rest to keep the two of them distracted. Gaby emerges first, still wearing the dark glasses. Her ponytail drapes down her left shoulder, across the knot of the aubergine-colored sarong that grazes the tops of her thighs. She walks across the street to stand next him as he waits, her dancer's legs adding grace in spite of the hangover, and doesn't say a word. The sunglasses make it impossible to tell what she's looking at or thinking, and it sets him just a bit on edge. In their acquaintance she's never been a chatterbox, but unlike Illya, she's usually decent with the expected social niceties, the occasional moment of small talk. Tamping down the moment of nerves, he smiles brightly at her. The silence lingers while Illya finishes changing. That's when the doubt starts to set in. Napoleon spent so much time preparing the Frisbee course, practicing throws, getting the clothes, but executing the plan-this is where the human factor comes in. Maybe he didn't think all of this through well enough, Solo decides. Peril is easy, at least when it comes to Gaby. His feelings for her run too close to the surface. Gaby, though-what she feels is a mystery. Attraction to the giant didn't sway her from throwing Illya to the dogs in Rome when her mission demanded it. Too much is riding on the allure of Soviet beefcake, thinks Solo. Staring at the changing room cabins, a feeling of dread slices through the earlier giddy effervescence of plotting. How could he have thought that he could beat a machine like Illya anyway, even if he did succeed at distracting him? The man trains in two different kinds of martial arts, and he actually likes to jog. Maybe Solo shouldn't be doing this anyway. They can just throw around a plastic saucer and he can let his partners' infatuation, or whatever it is, run its course without interference. Gaby startles him from his crisis of confidence with a quick intake of breath. He refocuses and spots Illya striding toward them. The man is either angry or-well, odds are that he's angry. He found a white tee-shirt somewhere-did he steal it? wonders Solo-and it's beautifully snug, outlining a broad expanse of chest and strong arms. Below the burgundy swim trunks Peril's long, long legs are nicely muscled, especially those thighs. He's a Michelangelo sculpture in cool marble to contrast with Gaby's warm gold. It takes Solo a moment to remember to check on Gaby; she still hasn't spoken. From the angle of her sunglasses it looks like she's staring at those legs. Good choice. Solo's fizz of excitement returns. Game on. He deliberately turns his back on his male competition and offers an arm to Gaby. \"Shall we?\" After a dazed moment she turns around and puts her right hand in the crook of his elbow. Peril catches up to them in quick strides. Napoleon long ago lost susceptibility to hostilities from other men in contests over women; good thing, too, otherwise he would be melting under the angry glare that beams at him over Gaby's head. They walk on the sand to the course he set up earlier: a series of poles made from tubing he bought at the hardware store. And then it's game on, or rather, game explained. \"The concept is simple,\" he tells them. \"Hit the poles with the Frisbee disk. Shorter poles are worth more points; taller poles are worth fewer points.\" They're both staring at him as he narrates the rules: the uncooperative competition that he desperately wants to beat, just because. \"This may prove advantageous to Miss Teller, but we'll allow the lady to keep that privilege,\" Solo concludes, all magnanimous generosity. Her expression tightens at his words. \"You know I'm not actually short.\" Illya makes the kind of comment Solo was hoping for. \"Not short, no. But not tall either.\" He radiates a subtle smugness, and Gaby takes umbrage to it. \"I'm above average height for women in most European countries,\" she announces, \"Including Germany.\" \"You're the perfect height for a lovely woman,\" Napoleon says, all bland gallantry to annoy Illya. He doesn't know how it went wrong. The strategy is working brilliantly on Illya; the third round was when Gaby shed her sarong, and Illya hasn't been the same since. It's not just superspy James Bond who's charmed by a woman in a white bikini. The crowd gathering to watch the spectacle helps in that regard; quite a few in the audience audibly or visibly appreciate the body Gaby honed by years of dance lessons, which has led to Illya carrying her sarong from one launch point to the next, just in case she gets a chill during their sunlit match. Unfortunately Gaby seems capable of both appreciating the Russian beefcake on display and launching the Frisbee disk with perfect accuracy. Napoleon slings the Frisbee and hits the mid-length pole. It grazes the pole; not as direct a hit as Gaby's earlier shot, but that doesn't matter for the point system, so he's satisfied. He waits for Illya to retrieve the disk, but Gaby is in some kind of whispered conversation with the man at the moment. Someone from the crowd sends the Frisbee spinning back to Napoleon. He catches it and hollers over the noise of the wind and waves, \"It's every man and woman for themselves! No plotting!\" Gaby looks mildly offended, while Illya just looks grim. He stalks over to the launch point for this round, grabs the Frisbee from Solo, and misses his shot. Again. Satisfying, but it's not enough for Solo to have a chance at winning rather than just not losing. They move to the next designated launch point, where Gaby has yet another perfect throw, this time against the wind. Illya finally takes off his tee-shirt. The man has fewer scars than Napoleon might have guessed. His broad chest doesn't have the ultra-defined bulging muscles of some of the weightlifter types hanging out at the beach, but Napoleon appreciates the lean sculpted functionality of muscles honed by years of martial arts, watching as Illya retrieves the Frisbee again. \"Your shot,\" says Gaby, as Illya hands him the Frisbee. He misses this time. Damn that wind coming off the water. Gaby makes a perfect shot yet again and then does a few quick stretches, her toned legs on gorgeous display, and that's when Solo realizes that he's been had. And it's his own fault. He may have decided not to screw his partners-or at least be a graceful loser as they chose not to screw him-but that didn't mean his subconscious mind was ready to ignore the plenteous pulchritude on display in front of him. Gaby's point lead is almost unbeatable by now. At least he can console himself with winning against the Red Peril, who looks surprisingly cheerful now for a man who's losing at a competitive sport. Cheerful for Illya reveals itself as not breaking things and an almost smile, which is a good look on that usually dour handsome face. Gaby isn't a gracious winner, but she is very funny, even if it's mostly at his expense. Both literally and figuratively. Illya stays for the festivities as well, a looming figure hovering nearby as Gaby and Solo have drinks at the beachside bar, and then as they walk to the nearest liquor store. Gaby has insisted on witnessing the purchase of the prize-winning bottle, to keep him honest. She's probably right to do so, but he doesn't really mind. Bottle triumphantly in hand, Gaby excuses herself to go back to her hotel to sleep. Napoleon assumes it's code for consume a good portion of the bottle. Illya says he'll share a taxi with her, because his hotel is only a mile farther, and something about the look on Illya's face reveals a bit too much. The penny drops. At some point Gaby figured out Solo's scheme. She took his own strategy and beat him with it. Her stretches right before his throw, the tee-shirt Kuryakin took off right before another throw-she plotted it all on that beach. He hopes they enjoy their victory drinks together. Dammit.

She looked at Illya but, judging by the smile playing on his lips, she was not going to find any support there. She had to admit that it was slightly funny, and now that she had seen her partners laugh and was picturing the scene in her mind again, she was finding it hard to keep a straight face. Poor Asher had even missed his plane. \"Maybe someone was playing a joke on you.\", she said, to divert attention from the smile that was creeping upon her lips. \"One of your colleagues, maybe? The shooter had to know where you usually park your car and when you would get off work.\" Gaby knew that some of Asher's colleagues liked to tease him about the fact that he had been targeted by a contract killer. \"Or maybe Sanders.\", Napoleon suggested with a cheeky smile. \"I wouldn't put it past him.\" \"That's seriously messed up for a joke...\" Asher paused for a second. \"Then again...I know a few sharpshooters who have a rather...peculiar sense of humor. But that guy...he was impossibly fast, and he had insane accuracy skills...\" Gaby noticed that Asher was holding one hand over his heart as he spoke, as if he was reliving the unpleasant episode in his mind. Poor Asher... She felt even guiltier for finding the situation funny, but she also knew that part of the reason they were all smiling and teasing him was that they were relieved Asher was alive. She glanced at Illya again. He was no longer smiling and was staring intently at the CIA agent. She knew exactly what was on his mind, and on Asher's mind. Of course she had thought about it too, they all had. Blake. But Blake certainly wouldn't have let Asher live... \"Anyway\", Asher said, apparently eager to change the subject. \"Sanders filled me in on what the code-breaking team discovered. It looks like this is going to be an interesting mission...\" \"Indeed. Good thing someone had the presence of mind to steal this notebook...\" Gaby blew out a small sigh and smiled. Here we go again... \"Solo, did you seriously expect Sanders to give you a medal?\" \"A \"thank you\" would have been enough...\", Napoleon grumbled with feigned indignation. Asher chuckled. \"Yeah...even that was highly unlikely. So...when are we leaving?\" \"Tomorrow morning.\", Napoleon answered. \"Destination: southwest France. At this time of year there might still be some snow in the mountains...our Russian Bigfoot will feel at home.\" Illya muttered something in Russian under his breath. Probably not a compliment, if Napoleon's reaction was any indication. Gaby watched her bickering partners. She could tell that Illya was still troubled. At least, with the important mission ahead of them, he would not have much time to worry about Blake. A few minutes later, Waverly joined them to go over the details of the mission one last time. After the hour-long meeting, as they were all standing up to leave, Waverly put his hand on Asher's shoulder. \"Perhaps it would be wise to have Kuryakin walk you back to your hotel...you know, in case someone tries to kill you again. Adrian will never forgive me if something happens to you before you complete your mission...\" A small, mischievous smile formed on Waverly's lips and, this time, Gaby couldn't suppress a chuckle at the sight of the CIA agent's mortified expression. Welcome to the team, Asher!.. End of chapter 1. :)[Chapter 2] Chapter 2! Let's make this a nice, calm chapt...uh-oh... :P Unknown location, Solo's p.o.v. \"So which one of you is it going to be?\" Pick Asher, please just pick Asher... Napoleon cast a furtive glance at the younger agent. Just look at those beautiful, terror-filled, hazel eyes. He's the perfect victim... The look of raw fear in his partner's eyes was pretty convincing and he hoped it would be enough to make their captor choose Asher. The five other men in the room, French and American, were looking expectantly at their leader - what was his name again? Dasque? - waiting for him to designate a victim. Napoleon tightened his grip on the bobby pin. The last thing they needed was for him to drop it. He knew that he needed to hurry but, with the man's attention focused on them, he didn't dare make his move yet. \"It's almost ready.\" One of the men had taken the branding iron out of the fire and was holding it up in front of them. He saw Asher flinch in his peripheral vision. Nice acting.. . Napoleon had noticed on several occasions that Asher Marshall was quite a good actor when the situation demanded it, although this time he suspected that his colleague was barely pretending. Dasque's eyes darted from one agent to the other. Several times. Then a vicious smile formed on his lips. \"Bring me Marshall.\" Yes! I knew he wouldn't be able to resist... Napoleon wasn't sure exactly what it was, but there was just something about Marshall...the man was a damn magnet for sadists. Of course the poor agent looked slightly less thrilled than Napoleon felt as Dasque's two American henchmen walked up to the chair he was cuffed to. They removed the handcuffs to allow him to stand up. Then they roughly pushed him toward the center of the room. \"Put him on the table.\" Alright, Mr Marshall...your time to shine, give them hell!... As the two men dragged Asher toward the beautifully carved wooden table, the agent, who up until that moment had looked convincingly paralyzed by fear, suddenly seemed to snap out of his trance. He managed to wrench his left arm free from his surprised captor's grip and used it to shatter the man's nose with a violent elbow strike. The man staggered away, swearing and holding a protective hand over his nose. The other American was a big man, he was still holding Asher's right arm and was trying to apply an arm lock. The agent was more skilled in hand-to-hand combat, though, and it wouldn't be long before he managed to escape his grip. But of course, Dasque was not going to let that happen. \"I said put him on the table. Don't you people understand your own language? Ibrac, Daroit...give them a hand.\" Two of the three men who had been standing close to Napoleon went to help their American colleague. Good...That's two less pairs of eyes I have to worry about. Just keep them busy a little longer... Napoleon was working as fast as he could but the stubborn pin stubbornly refused to open the stubborn handcuffs. The fact that there was still a guard posted next to him wasn't helping either. Not only did he have to concentrate on opening the damn cuffs, he also had to make it look like he was horrified by what they were about to do to Asher. Not that he wasn't. To tell the truth, he was awfully glad that he wasn't in Marshall's shoes. But he had more pressing things to focus on at the moment. It was a good thing that they had not bothered to cuff Asher's hands behind his back again. Once Napoleon managed to get rid of his own handcuffs, the two of them would have a chance to fight their way out of this mess. Napoleon hadn't seen any guns in the room. Their captors didn't seem to be carrying theirs but he couldn't be sure they didn't have holsters concealed under their clothes. If they were armed, he would just have to make sure they didn't get a chance to draw. He had spotted a wooden club behind the door, not far from his chair. At least he would have some kind of weapon. He also had a small throwing knife, hidden in an ankle sheath, that would probably come in handy. For the rest...He would have to improvise. Asher was still struggling as hard as he could but with three - three and a half if you counted Broken-nose - men against one, the odds were not in his favor. Dasque was obviously amused by the agent's efforts. His men, on the other hand, were not. Asher was a good fighter, he was fast and he hit hard. After a few more minutes they finally managed to lift the wriggling agent up and lay him down on the table. \"Good. Hold him still.\", Dasque instructed. But Asher wasn't giving up yet, he suddenly turned his head and sank his teeth into the big American's hand, which had been pressing down on his shoulder. \"Ow! What the hell! The bastard bit me!\" He let go of Asher who immediately sat up. At that moment the last man who had been keeping an eye on Napoleon rushed to his struggling colleague's aid. Together, they grabbed Asher's arms and they slammed him back down on the table hard enough to knock the wind out of him. \"Finally.\" Napoleon glanced at Dasque as he stepped around the table to get a closer look at his victim. The Frenchman was smiling in anticipation. Things were not looking good. I just need a little more time...why won't those damn things open?! Houdini must be rolling over in his grave...okay, just focus, you can panic when you start smelling burning flesh... Hopefully it wouldn't come to that. \"What a nice little calf. What part of your body are we going to brand?\" The men laughed cruelly. \"Son visage!*\", Daroit exclaimed. (*His face) \"Non. I want him to be able to see it...\" Well...at least that rules out his backside... \"Oh I think I know.\", Dasque went on as he suddenly grabbed each side of Asher's collar and ripped his shirt open. He let his finger hover over the agent's bare skin for a few seconds, then brought it down and traced an imaginary circle over the left side of his chest. \"Juste ici*, it will look perfect.\" (*Right here) Napoleon almost blew out a loud sigh of relief as he felt the handcuffs finally click open. As silently as possible, he slipped them off his wrists and glanced at the scene in front of him. The men were all eagerly waiting for their leader to start torturing Marshall. Most of them were facing away from him. No one was paying attention to him. He retrieved the throwing knife from his ankle sheath and slowly extended his arm to reach for the club. As Dasque turned around to fetch the branding iron, Napoleon seized the opportunity to get out of the chair and started sneaking up on the group. He froze as Dasque turned around again, returning with the red-hot branding iron. Luckily, the room was dimly lit, Napoleon was concealed in the shadows and the man was too focused on what he was doing to spot him. Dasque brandished the branding iron in front of Asher's face. Napoleon silently stepped closer. He saw Dasque place a firm hand on the right side of the poor agent's chest and bring the iron down with the other. Slowly. A small sound of distress escaped Asher's lips. He wasn't acting this time. Just a few more seconds, buddy... The younger agent's self-control was impressive. Not once had he glanced in Napoleon's direction. Broken-nose suddenly seemed to sense that something was going on behind him and he briskly turned around. He stared into Napoleon's eyes for a couple of seconds, his mouth agape. Whoosh! went the throwing knife. Straight into the man's throat. Not bad. Illya would have been proud. As the man gasped and raised his hands to his throat, Napoleon gripped the club with both hands and swung. Hard. The wooden club produced a satisfying \"crack\" as it connected with Daroit's head, then with the big American's shoulder on the way back. Another swing and the third, unnamed Frenchman staggered backwards. Dasque was looking at Napoleon with wide eyes, he was still holding the branding iron above Asher's chest. Except that there was no one left to hold Asher down... The agent grabbed Dasque's arm and brought the red-hot piece of metal down on the man's own hand, which had been resting on his chest. Napoleon heard a hair-raising shriek and he felt a grin tug at the corners of his mouth. Then he felt something else. And his grin instantly disappeared. Someone was holding what felt suspiciously like the barrel of a gun against his back. \"Turn around. Slowly.\" French accent. \"Nice try but I'm not falling for that old trick. I know it's just a finger gun.\" \"I can maybe shoot in the head of your friend to prove you that I'm serious.\" Napoleon turned around. Slowly. In addition to his poor English grammar, Ibrac was pointing a MAC-50 pistol at him. Well...this is slightly disappointing... He heard movement behind him and instinctively flinched just as something hit him hard on the back of the head. \"Hé, mollo*, Daroit.\", Ibrac warned. (*Hey, easy) Napoleon carefully prodded the back of his head. No blood. Good. Then he turned around to face his attacker. He was fairly confident that Ibrac wasn't going to shoot him. Daroit, who was sporting an award-winning bump on the side of his head, was also holding a gun - which he had just used to hit him and was now pointing at \"the head of Asher\". The big American was crouching next to Broken-nose's still body. \"That asshole killed Edwards.\" \"La ferme*!\", (*Shut up!) Dasque suddenly yelled, making everyone - except Edwards, of course - jump. \"Qu'est-ce qu'on en a à foutre d'Edwards!* (*Who gives a damn about Edwards!) He was a useless piece of shit! Aaaah merde*...\" (*Aaaah crap) I take it that's painful... Napoleon looked down at the ugly burn on the man's hand, then up at Asher. The other agent flashed his boyish smile and gave him an almost imperceptible wink before the big American and Unnamed-Frenchman brutally pulled his arms behind his back and cuffed him again. Dasque was still cursing in French, cradling his hand. \"Ah le p'tit salaud*...\" (*little bastard) He turned toward Daroit. \"Foutez-le dans la putain de cage!\" What?... Put him in the cage? What cage? \"But they said we had to wait for them.\", the big American intervened. \"They clearly stated that they wanted them alive. You don't want to mess with those people... you know what they're like...\" \"Qu'ils aillent se faire foutre ces tarés* (*Screw those twisted bastards) , they don't know what I'm like! I said put him in the cage and that's exactly what you're going to do... Et fais-le saigner d'abord!\" Fais-le saigner?... Make him bleed? Napoleon frowned and exchanged a glance with Asher. He saw his own confusion mirrored in the other agent's expression. Were they going to slit his wrists or stab him and just let him bleed out? But why bother to put him in a cage? Was it some sort of traditional French execution method? \"What are you waiting for. Do it, now!\" For the second time, the big American knelt down beside his unfortunate colleague's corpse and pulled the knife out of his throat. He wiped it clean on the dead man's shirt and walked up to Asher. Daroit and Unnamed-Frenchman each grabbed one of the agent's arms. That's not good... The American used the knife to slice off the few remaining buttons on Asher's shirt and spread it open. He started raising the knife, then paused. Napoleon saw an amused smile form on the man's lips as he used his finger to trace the x-shaped scar on Asher's torso. The worried expression on the agent's face seemed to intensify. He probably expected the man to carve another stupid shape into his skin. Fortunately, the big man lacked inspiration and he simply slashed Asher across the chest. Twice. Asher grunted in pain, Napoleon winced in sympathy, and everyone watched in silence as blood started dripping from the long incisions. The man stepped back, apparently satisfied. What, that's all?... \"Perfect. Take him to the cage now. Adieu, Agent Marshall.\" Napoleon noticed that Dasque was smiling despite the pain. The two agents exchanged one last confused glance before Asher was dragged out of the room by Daroit and his colleague. \"May I ask where they are taking him? See, I'm supposed to bring him home before curfew and...\" \"Let me make things clear for you, Agent Solo\", Dasque spat out, his upper lip twitching with anger. \"the wisest course of action for you now is to shut up, sit down on that chair and wait for death in silence. Unless you want to join your colleague...\" Napoleon had at least a dozen witty comebacks in mind and was ready to fire but the barrel of Ibrac's gun, jammed into his face, dissuaded him. They tied him to the chair, with a length of rope this time, and Dasque left the room, leaving only the big American and Ibrac to keep an eye on him. He tried to ask about Marshall but both men completely ignored him. After about fifteen minutes, Daroit was back. Napoleon heard him talk with Ibrac in hushed tones. He concentrated as hard as he could but was only able to catch fragments of the conversation. One sentence caught his attention, though. \"On va avoir des ennuis, on aurait pas du le mettre avélélou...\" We're gonna be in trouble, we shouldn't have put him ...avélélou?... damn this guy's southern accent...what does it mean?... To tell the truth, Napoleon was finding it hard to keep track of what was going on. The whole mission had exploded into a giant mess. He knew that Dasque and his clique had to be connected to the main organization but who were those people they kept talking about. The ones who \"wanted them alive\"? And where the hell were Illya and Gaby? They had been at the inn too, when they had all been attacked by Dasque and his men, so what had happened to them? He was almost certain that they weren't dead. Dasque would have been too happy to deliver the news to Marshall and him if that had been the case. Napoleon decided that it was probably a good sign that his two partners were missing. They had probably escaped and would barge in to rescue them soon. What? A little optimism doesn't hurt... A few minutes earlier, Asher's p.o.v. \"You're uncuffing me?\" \"It will last a bit longer, that way.\", Daroit answered with a shrug as he stuffed the cuffs into his jacket pocket. That's reassuring... He glanced at the other Frenchman who had the gun trained on him, but the man's expression was unreadable. Daroit unlocked the huge metal gate in front of them and it creaked open. \"Get in.\" He felt the gun being pressed against his back. He stepped into the \"cage\" which was actually some kind of subterranean cavern fitted with a metal gate. He registered the sound of the gate being pushed shut and locked behind him. The \"floor\" of the cage was pale-gray stone, with a few pieces of what looked like dry wood scattered here and there. Weird. He suddenly became aware of the eerie silence. He turned around, expecting his captors to be gone. But both men were still there, and their eyes were fixed on the ground near his feet. Asher looked down. The cuts on his chest were still bleeding and a few drops of blood had stained the stony ground. This was what the two men were staring at, as if transfixed by the small crimson stains. What's wrong with those guys... \"Good luck, Agent Marshall. If it's any consolation, your partner's fate will probably be much worse.\", Daroit said. Then, without another word, both men turned around and left. Asher watched them through the bars of the gate until they disappeared. Well, I suppose it's time to explore our new habitat... The far end of the cavern was not lighted and Asher couldn't tell how big it actually was. He took a few steps forward and peered into the darkness. He was about to venture into the shadowed area when a sound suddenly made him freeze. A low growl. Just as he started retreating toward the gate, a shape emerged from the darkness. \" Oh...what a cute little pup...\" Quit fooling yourself, Asher, that's a wolf... Another silent shape appeared behind the first one. Then another. \"Looks like it's a whole family of pups...\" No, Asher, it's a damn pack of wolves... He took another step back. Slowly. The first \"pup\" sniffed the ground, all the while keeping its eyes fixed on Asher. Then it started licking the pale stone. Greedily. \"Oh...so, you like my blood...wonderful...Sanders is never going to believe that this is how I died...\" End of chapter 2.

Disclaimer: I don't own the "},{"Movie":"Man From U.N.C.L.E.","Title":"One Town Is Very Like Another","Author":"rose griffes","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13091512","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This story sprang out of writing Trajectory, but you don't have to read it for this to make sense. July 1963 Groton, Connecticut A month ago she went flying over the wall dividing her city, holding onto an American man while a Russian giant was in close pursuit. Three weeks ago Waverly sent her directly from that first mission into her second, the three of them a newly-minted team. London next, while her two teammates went to different destinations for their original agencies. Gaby worked nonstop with Waverly's eccentric circle of friends to cram years of training into two weeks-training that wasn't available during those years of waiting behind the wall. And now this mission in the USA; it's a failure, from Gaby's perspective. No verifiable answers about the Americans' missing submarine, although the two superpowers haven't blown each other up over it. It's not a blemish on U.N.C.L.E.'s record, given their unofficial role here. Nor on her own short record, for that matter; Gaby 'coordinated the mutual sharing of information' while still 'maintaining discretionary control over top-secret information' to the best of her abilities. Better than her own best, in fact; she modeled her diplomatic tones on Waverly's good moments and Solo's blunt moments, as needed. The KGB's official representative is a boor, but she soldiers through it with a fake smile, teeth deliberately bared in full display. She hates his accent, all heavy Rs and twisted vowels. Four days of nightmare fodder; the sound dredges up her worst childhood memories. At least Solo has beach visits in his role. Gaby is touring stuffy submarines, walking through endless badly-lit hallways in the American Naval base, or lying awake in a too-big, too-soft hotel bed. She can't even talk to Illya in those brief moments when she catches a glimpse of him. They have one short break together, all three of them. Officially it's to share intel, but Solo brings a plastic toy disk that he calls a Frisbee. They take turns throwing it across the hotel ballroom, which is fun; even more fun when Solo loses to both of them after they make up a point system and start keeping score. The next day they're playing their roles again. Gaby's knee-length skirt and matching jacket feel like a prison uniform by then. It's a relief when the call comes through that they're done for now. Waverly's second-in-command Rushi offers her the news; Gaby is impressed at the woman's chipper tones over the phone line, considering that it must be three a.m. in London. Gaby shimmies around the room as she puts on pedal pushers and a sleeveless shirt. Then she heads down to the hotel bar. Not her hotel's bar; Illya's paranoia has rubbed off on her in the short time they've known each other. Instead she wanders down the long blocks parallel to the beach, to a brightly-lit hotel catering to the swimwear crowd. Maybe she'll dance, she thinks, and decides to try a new drink while she's here. The bartender winks at her as he slides a rum and coke her way. She takes one gulp and grimaces, almost coughing with the shock. This is what the bartender thinks of as good liquor? It tastes like medicine. She can't tell which part is the alcohol and which part the syrupy American drink. Gaby quickly swallows the rest of it, determined not to allow her money to go to waste. Then another identical glass slides down the bar towards her. \"Courtesy of the man in the yellow swim trunks!\" the bartender yells over the noise of the band and crowd. She swivels on the bar stool; yellow swim trunks waves at her with his own rum and coke in hand; he then takes a sip, attempting to look suave. There's no trusting a man who likes this drink, Gaby decides. She drains the glass anyway, counts out the American money to pay for her first drink and leaves it on the bar. Yellow swim trunks will have to drink alone. She's suddenly not in the mood for this crowd either, so she bypasses the dance floor. Walking back to her hotel, the ocean breeze tugs at her hair. She spins a few times, and it feels like her stomach is spinning even faster; it twirls on even when she stops. Stupid rum and coke. Her hotel bed is still too soft. Gaby sits in the middle of it, letting the sand from inside her shoes trickle onto the bedspread. She takes a quick mouthful of vodka from her flask and swishes it around to get rid of the medicinal taste, and then another mouthful just because. Because of lost submarines and leering sailors. Because of American drinks and Russian accents. The wrong Russian accent. The wrong man speaking with a Russian accent. This bed is too big for one average-sized woman. Gaby leans down from the edge of the bed, determined to grab the folder on the floor without standing up. Instead she tumbles to the floor, landing on hands and knees. No scrapes and probably no bruises thanks to the fuzzy carpet that covers the entire room. Not that she likes that either; it feels wrong against her skin, like an enormous cluster of caterpillars crawling across the floor. She grabs the file and climbs back on the bed: precious folder with a map of Groton inside, and Illya's hotel name and room number written in pencil across the back. He has to know by now that the mission has been called off. And it's only-she squints at the alarm clock on the bedside table-it's only just before midnight. That's not late at all. Not really late. She picks up the heavy phone and dials the numbers. It takes her three tries; the holes of the rotary dial slip out from her fingertips and she curses at the phone in German. The hotel clerk connects her to Illya's room; after five rings he answers with an American-sounding \"Hello?\" If she didn't know him well, she might think he was sitting next to the phone, tidy and buttoned-up in that American business suit and wide awake while waiting on the telphone to ring. But she can tell: he was asleep. It makes her want to giggle, so her voice has a breathy catch. \"Illya,\" she says, and then realizes she doesn't know why she called. What was she going to ask? \"Gaby? Are you ok?\" She doesn't like his assumption at all. \"Why wouldn't I be ok?\" she demands. \"You sounded-strange.\" \"Hah!\" Gaby says. \"You only say that because you were asleep. Don't deny it.\" \"Yes, I was asleep.\" His voice blurs a bit and she thinks maybe he's trying not to yawn. \"Why would I deny this?\" \"Because you like to make us think you're a machine and better than the rest of us humans. But even tall people need sleep. Maybe you need moresleep, even.\" He doesn't say anything for a moment. Finally, accusingly, he asks, \"Are you drunk?\" \"No,\" she says, sticking her chin out. \"Only two rum and cokes.\" Or is it rums and coke, she wonders. \"And they tasted terrible, and I didn't even want the second one, and so they don't count.\" And then two mouthfuls of vodka and maybe there was another sip or two after that, but that's too much to add to the other sentences, so she doesn't. \"Why did you order second one if you didn't want it?\" \"I didn't. This man in the yellow swim trunks bought it for me.\" She yawns; the stretch in her jaw pleases her, so she does it again. \"Is man in the yellow swim trunks there now?\" Illya's accent gets thicker, and this time it's the right Russian with the accent. Even if it's still not her favorite accent. She doesn't like it, but she likes him, and it's how he's supposed to sound. Not all fake American, like when he answered the phone. \"Gaby?\" \"What?\" \"Is man in yellow swim trunk there now?\" \"No, why would he be?\" What a silly question. \"Oh,\" says Illya. \"окэй. Why are you calling?\" She hums. \"Why not call? The mission is kaputt. We have time to talk. Unless you are leaving right away?\" She doesn't want him to go. Someday he'll go and never come back, and she won't even know when it's that day. He'll choose Russia over U.N.C.L.E., over her. Or Russia will choose him, and he won't fight it, because that's all that he thinks he has. All that he allows in. \"No. No, I'm not leaving right away. Are you leaving soon?\" \"In three days. I get to enjoy the beach.\" Rushi told her that's what Waverly said: for her to enjoy the beach. Maybe she should go to the beach now? No, not now. The sand is cold. \"You cannot go to the beach now,\" Illya tells her. Did he know what she was thinking? Or did she say that idea out loud? Maybe he just guessed. \"You should come to my room,\" she tells him. \"I have an idea.\" She remembers her excuse for calling now. She bought it her first day in Groton, when she found out that Illya would be here too. \"What is your idea, Gaby?\" He sounds indulgent, but also impatient. Gaby frowns. The idea, yes. He asked her about the idea. \"Chess,\" she announces. \"I want you to teach me how to play chess.\" Her foster brother played chess. She wanted to learn, but he went West when she was thirteen. Gaby had been an angry bundle of a girl, too impatient to learn. And then her brother was gone. Chess is safe, she thinks. Chess is a way to ration out the moments that Illya is near and not get too attached. Gaby knows all about rationing. She doesn't know if he'll accept. If he'll be a good teacher or restless. But she wants to tease him, to see him flustered, to watch him as he plays and try to guess what he's thinking. \"I could teach you this, yes.\" His voice rumbles in her ear, and it's-pleasant. Pleasing. Gaby stretches out on the bed, pointing her toes and sighing. \"But I don't want to teach drunk Gaby.\" Not so pleasing now, that voice. \"Why not?\" \"Because drunk Gaby won't remember the rules.\" \"I will too,\" she argues. \"Also, drunk Gaby will want to dance.\" That is probably true. \"But there's no radio in here. Or record player,\" she tells him. \"I do not think you would let this stop you.\" She pouts. \"But I want to see you now.\" \"I will teach you chess,\" he finally says, \"When you are not drunk. If you invite me again.\" His voice curls upwards, a hint of uncertainty mixed in with the practical answer. She huffs out a breath. \"Maybe tomorrow?\" \"Yes,\" he says, and his voice is soft. \"Maybe. You ask me tomorrow.\" \"Ok.\" The phone is warm against her ear, sticky against her skin. She holds it there anyway. He's still on the line, his breathing an unsyncopated rhythm. \"May you have good dreams,\" he tells her. It is ridiculously formal and sweet, she thinks. \"Schlaf gut, Illya.\" The words tumble out in German, and she feels oddly vulnerable. He's heard her speaking German before, of course, but not soft like that. Not to him. She waits a minute, until the hotel operator comes on the line asks if she would like to place a call. Gaby hangs up and curls on her side. The sand itches, but she doesn't get up to shake it off the bedspread. Tomorrow. She will ask him again tomorrow to teach her chess, and then she'll have that memory stored away, just in case.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two of Trajectory (mostly) happens right before this chapter. Short summary: Solo sets up a game of beach frisbee; both he and Illya lose to Gaby. Her prize is a bottle of whiskey, paid for (rather than stolen) by Solo). The Polish name Jan is pronounced like the word yawn. \"An American, a Russian, and a German walk into a bar.\" Solo's expression radiates loose amusement at his own words, although Gaby doesn't know why that's so funny. \"This is a liquor store, not a bar,\" says Illya. They've already been to a bar. \"That's not how the joke goes, though.\" Solo opens the door to the liquor store and gestures for them to go through. After they're inside Gaby says, \"An American, a Russian, and a German. You put me last on the list, but I won your Frisbee game. I should be first. I even went through the door here first.\" Napoleon sighs, the way he does when he thinks they're supposed to know how his American mind works. Illya nods at her in support of her claim, but Solo has moved on, walking around the store and explaining various types of alcohol. \"What you're calling whiskey is probably what we Americans call Scotch,\" he says, and then rambles on about filters, ageing, and different grains. Gaby tunes him out; she trails behind, fingers tracing the different shapes of the bottles, examining the colors of the liquids within. Illya walks with her, studying her hands as she moves. Gaby winds up close to the clerk and ignores the remainder of Solo's lecture. \"Which whiskey-or Scotch-\" she adds pointedly, \"Is the most expensive?\" They must seem a funny trio, she thinks. Solo, handsome and self-assured in his linen shirt and swim trunks that actually do pass for shorts. She, in a purple beach wrap as a would-be dress, demanding the most expensive alcohol instead of looking for her usual bargain. And the Red Peril, of course: a visual pun in the wine-red swim trunks Napoleon provided for him. On Illya's feet are those strange thin-strapped sandals that Solo calls some funny name she can't remember. (Illya complained about them earlier, but as they can't go into bars or liquor stores barefoot, he wears them anyway.) Gaby doesn't let Illya carry the bottle after Solo pays for it. It's her prize, after all. She does let him carry her day clothes, though, after they retrieve them from the beachside lockers. They make their way to the taxi stand-enterprising Taxifahrer waiting to drive the tired, drunk, or sunburned back to more distant hotels. She gives Illya a look, and he follows her cue by telling Napoleon that he'll share a taxi with her. His hotel is only a mile farther than hers anyway; that's the excuse they give. Solo squints for a moment, and she wants to laugh at the outrage that crosses his face next, because he's figured it out. She used his strategy against him during his silly Frisbee game, and she got Illya to help her; now Napoleon knows. Gaby clambers into the taxi first, carefully holding the bottle. Illya slides next to her, knees bumping into the empty chair in front of him. She gives an address to the the Taxifahrer: halfway between their two hotels. Turning her head, she can see Napoleon through the back window. When he notices that he has her attention, he makes a series of hand gestures in combination with raised eyebrows that she translates to drink and sex. She assumes it's his advice on what to do with the man in the seat next to her, based on the lewd expression on his face. Gaby snorts. \"What?\" \"Nothing. Just Solo.\" She doesn't say anything about the gestures; instead she tells Illya, \"He's figured out that we plotted against him.\" \"You have good mind for strategy.\" \"Thank you for helping,\" she tells him. She chooses not to tease him for now about how many bad throws he made without any excuse of strategy. Solo's plan wasn't a complete failure; Gaby feels girlishly silly for it, but there's a warm glow inside her, knowing that she can distract Illya. Even if the stakes weren't very high. Illya leans his head back against the seat, looking at her. His hair is an unruly blaze in the evening light; hours of ocean wind have destroyed the straight lines he prefers. She likes it, seeing his edges softened like this. He will probably comb it the moment he notices just how messy it is: smooth it with pomade and water, make it properly regimented again. But she gets to enjoy it for now. He's still watching her, and she thinks about what he said last night on the phone. After sleeping through most of the morning, and then carefully maneuvering around the beach with a hangover this afternoon, she's tired. But she has an invitation to renew for this evening's entertainment. Sober Gaby, ready to be taught. Only one drink at the bar (to Solo's two-he was trying to impress the barmaid), and an unopened bottle of whiskey or Scotch, whichever this is. Illya didn't have any alcohol; too careful to drink in public when he doesn't have to. Her hands clutch that bottle while she thinks. Solo's mind had gone straight to sex-of course it did-but this feels like a very juvenile thing to ask, now that Illya sits next to her. They're both adults. Teach her to play chess, when she could probably persuade him to bang her senseless? Last night she had the lubrication of rum and vodka to ease her past the anxiety of asking him. She sighs and starts talking in spite of her doubts. \"I have only had one drink, in celebration,\" Gaby tells him. His lips curl upward just at the corners. \"Yes, this is true.\" \"And I have a brand-new chess set in my hotel room.\" Illya's eyebrows raise slightly at her revelation. She pushes ahead in spite of the nervous feeling in her stomach. \"So I think we should go to my hotel and you can teach me to play chess.\" Gaby looks at him, wanting to see his reaction. His smile softens the stern lines of his face. \"окэй.\" \"Ok,\" she echoes, her lips curving upward as well. The taxi pulls over at the intersection and Illya pays. He doesn't look flustered by the American money, which still confuses her. They step out of the taxi onto the warm sidewalk. Even though Groton isn't a big town, it has the Naval base and enough beach shore to draw in visitors. Gaby didn't know until two days ago just how close her hotel was to Illya's. That makes it easy to pick a spot between the buildings and walk, letting them check for any unusual activity around them before going inside. Not that she's really worried about it, but it's good spycraft, and it prevents Illya from grumbling at her. Besides, she's feeling generous with her time now. She still has two more days to enjoy after this one. Gaby had planned to invite Illya to play chess early this afternoon, but then Solo pulled his little Frisbee rematch stunt instead. It all works out, she thinks, as they walk slowly in the glow of sunset. Too slowly. Why is Illya walking this slow, she wonders after a few steps. She stops and stares down. \"Your feet!\" she exclaims. His feet are bare on the sidewalk. \"What happened to the flop sandals?\" \"I left them in taxi,\" he confesses, shoulders hunched a bit. \"They hurt.\" She looks more closely at his feet. The skin between his big toe and second toe glows an angry red. Gaby clicks her tongue at him. \"You need to put your dress shoes on now. You might get cut by some glass, walking on the sidewalk.\" He starts to say something, but Gaby cuts off his protests. \"Your feet are more important than fashion.\" Illya takes his black leather shoes out of the bag. He sits on the sidewalk to put them on, retying the laces as she watches. She feels a wave of affection for him then: his loose curls, his knobby knees close to his ears, his blond lashes shading his eyes as he looks at his shoes, the expression of concentration on his face. Gaby is dizzy with it, and then she realizes: she's really dizzy. When was the last time she had any food? She quickly sits down, ungraceful with herself but careful to keep the whiskey bottle from breaking. Leaning against Illya's shoulder, she takes slow breaths, willing herself not to faint. \"Gaby?\" She hums in recognition. \"What is wrong?\" \"Just a bit dizzy,\" she says, attempting to sound airy and unconcerned. \"Do you need water?\" She probably does, but that's not the main problem; Gaby shakes her head, her hair sliding across his shoulder. \"When was last time you ate?\" \"Yesterday morning,\" she admits, embarrassed to have done this again. For years of her childhood there was never enough to eat; she used to imagine herself past that hunger. Then then she spent more years training to dance through all kinds of pain. The result is that she doesn't always notice what her body is telling her. She forgets about food sometimes, especially when she's under stress. A whole new country and a frustrating mission make for a lot of stress. The food on the Naval base tasted wrong, so she didn't eat much during the meals served there, either. She sinks lower against him, and Illya sighs. He mumbles something in Russian; it's too quick for her to understand. The air and the warm sidewalk make her feel uncomfortably drowsy, like hospital sedatives. Illya stands up, pulling her with him. \"Come,\" he says. \"You will feel better if we get food now.\" She doesn't argue; instead she uses one hand to hold onto her bottle and the other to hold onto him. \"Can you walk?\" \"Ja.\" She doesn't let go of his arm, and they amble slowly down the sidewalk. Illya has his arm around her back, making sure she won't fall if she gets dizzy again. \"I don't want to put that skirt on again,\" Gaby tells him. Her day clothes are in the bag he's carrying now. \"But I will if I have to, for food.\" Her beach wrap looks exactly like what it is, not like a dress. Not standard dress code for a restaurant this far from the beach. \"I think I know a place we can go,\" he says. \"Close, food is not bad. Not fancy, though.\" Gaby huffs out a laugh. \"Solo is the one who cares about fancy.\" She could kill a cow and eat it right now. Fancy doesn't matter. Illya's not-fancy food place is only three blocks away, but it takes them nearly fifteen minutes to walk the distance. Gaby has time to inspect the building as they approach: a wide front, but not deep. Silver metal panels gleam under the street light; its shallow roof is curved rather than pointed. \"This is a diner,\" Illya tells her. \"It is an American tradition.\" His pronunciation of the word American doesn't include ire or disdain for once, and he chose this place; Gaby decides that a diner must be a good thing to Illya. She half-expects he'll claim it's actually a Russian tradition, but he doesn't. He also doesn't open the door for her like usual; instead he pokes his head inside to look first. What he sees must reassure him, because after that he takes her hand and pulls her in, letting her trail behind him with the whiskey bottle in her other hand. \"Elsbeth?\" Gaby looks past Illya to see a tall woman smiling at him. \"Can we come in dressed like this?\" The woman Illya called Elsbeth looks them up and down, eyes narrowed: a thorough inspection. \"Works for me,\" she then says with a cheery shrug. \"Listen, if I put you in a booth, no one's going to know any better anyway.\" \"Thank you,\" says Illya, and that's when Gaby realizes that something is different about his accent. It's subtle; she can't pin down how he's changing it, just that he is. Interesting. Elsbeth walks them over to a corner. Gaby slides into the round booth first, followed by Illya. Her legs stick to the vinyl seat, but she's not going to complain. Better than putting on that itchy skirt again. Elsbeth brings them both a one-page menu with handwritten changes and additions. A quarter of the items don't even look like they're in English. She thinks she recognizes a Greek dish or two. In spite of the single page, the number of choices starts to make Gaby's head swim. Illya shifts and pulls her in to lean her head against his shoulder. She takes deep breaths while Illya asks Elsbeth if she can bring them something to eat right now, because \"Anna was in the sun too long today.\" Illya's hand is still behind her back, his long fingers curved around to her waist. Cool fingertips press against her bare skin there, under the beach wrap. It doesn't really help with the dizziness but she doesn't tell him to move his hand. A flimsy-looking paper bowl filled with pretzels plops in front of them, and Gaby eats at least half of them in under a minute. By the time Elsbeth comes back, the bowl is empty. \"You sure weren't kidding around.\" She puts down two glasses of icy water and picks up the bowl. Already Gaby is feeling much better. \"Thank you,\" she tells the waitress. Then she takes a big drink of water and grimaces at how cold it is. Americans put ice in all their drinks, which Gaby finds ridiculous. It makes her teeth ache. \"You guys ready to order?\" Illya orders some kind of sandwich called a sub, and a bowl of stew; he suggests the stew for Gaby as well. She looks at the menu with new determination. No stew. Something different. \"I want a hamburger,\" she says. The name makes her smile, even though she knows that it's not the same thing anymore as the ground steak from Hamburg. It's a completely American food, which is what Gaby is ready to try. Something about Gaby's short request sends Elsbeth's eyebrows upward. \"Is she a Pole too?\" the woman asks Illya. A pole? What does that mean, she wonders. \"Yes, Anna is also Polish,\" Illya says. Gaby gets the full force of Elsbeth's brown eyes checking over her. \"Well, aren't you the prettiest little thing!\" she declares. \"My father came here from Poland in nineteen hundred, though I don't speak a lick of the language. I told Jan the other day how glad I am to see Poles coming here again, and getting good jobs too.\" 'Anna' nods in agreement, while 'Jan' watches her. Does Illya speak Polish? Gaby thinks he must know some, or he wouldn't have used this cover story. Elsbeth finishes writing their order and heads over to one of the customers at the long counter. Gaby studies the woman as she bustles around the small diner. She's very tall. Her dyed blond hair is pulled up in a series of elegant knots, which add to her height. Deep lines bracket her mouth and eyes, like she laughs a lot. Gaby never got to see either of her mothers like this, with age so clearly marking them. Illya watches the waitress too, until he notices her looking at him. \"So why Poland?\" she asks. \"It is easy to make Polish accent in English,\" he says. \"Polish are better received than Russian.\" He looks around the room again; casing the joint, Napoleon might say if he were here. \"Not that Polish immigrants have good acceptance in U.S., but still better than Russians have.\" \"Hmph.\" It doesn't really answer the question about needing a cover just for food. It's not like Elsbeth was likely to refuse to serve him, Gaby thinks. The woman does her work with an easy professionalism: quick to serve the food, not lingering for unnecessary conversation most of the time. Illya has gotten the most attention of any of the customers here this evening. He could have sat at the counter and kept his answers to short syllables, avoiding problems even if Elsbeth hated Russians. Gaby watches a man at the counter eat his hamburger; he's not using any utensils, just his hands, so she looks around and spots another couple in a booth doing the same. No fork and knife here-just hands around the hamburger. Same with the so-called French fries. Well, she's never been the dainty sort, so why not do as the Americans while eating their food? Elsbeth brings a tray over and puts their large meals on the table. Gaby dives in without waiting for Elsbeth to finish putting Illya's food in front of him. It's messier than she thought-or maybe that's just her inexperience at this-but tasty and fun. The fries taste comfortingly familiar. The hamburger is lower-quality beef on a roll, but she likes it anyway. The food is gone before her hunger is sated, so she steals two bites of Illya's sub sandwich when he's taking a spoonful of soup. He looks outraged but he can't say anything while his mouth is full of food. She sticks out her tongue at him. Elsbeth wanders back to their table to check on them. She looks impressed at Gaby's appetite. She turns to Illya and says, \"So how did the giant Polish boy find a good little Polish girl?\" This is the second time she's referred to Gaby as little; it's beginning to annoy her. The waitress doesn't wait for an answer from Illya, just smiles and admires the blush that her question was meant to elicit. \"How long have you known each other?\" \"Just a few weeks,\" Illya answers. Gaby doesn't know what kind of story he has in mind for 'Anna' and 'Jan'; she watches him and doesn't try very hard to hide her amusement. \"How long have you been in the U.S.?\" That question is for Gaby; she has to decide what 'Anna' has done, so she goes with something resembling her own experience. \"Not very long. I'm still adjusting.\" Then she decides to take charge of her cover instead of letting Illya run the show. \"Now that I'm here, I may go back to school.\" Illya's eyebrows raise but then his eyes crinkle and his lips twitch upward a bit. Prosperous immigrant 'Jan', so proud of 'Anna' and her plans. Showing off his would-be girlfriend to Mutter. Oh Gott, Illya. Gaby doesn't even know if Illya's mother is alive, much less what she looks like, but Elsbeth, with her tall blond figure, might well resemble her. She certainly has a maternal air as she teases 'Jan'. The first two days Gaby and Illya spent together, from West Berlin to Rome, he made little effort to please her until after she tackled him to the floor. Yet Illya has charm to spare for this waitress who may or may not resemble his mother. Illya still has soup left in his bowl and a few bites of sandwich that she hasn't stolen. Elsbeth says, \"I'll come back later to see if you guys have room for dessert.\" \"Actually, I would like a milkshake now,\" Gaby tells her. \"What kind?\" \"Vanilla.\" Elsbeth goes back behind the counter to make the milkshake, and Illya says, \"It will be too sweet.\" He's right. But Gaby takes at least four more spoonfuls than she would have if he'd said nothing. He eats the last of his sandwich and then his stew. Gaby gives in to an impulse-a hunch-and comments on it. \"You finished your stew. Otlichno srabotano.\" Very good is a phrase burned into her memory from the one time her Russian ballet teacher said it about Gaby's dancing. Illya's ears turn pink; Gaby has to look down-at first because she wants to laugh, and then because of a flash of something needy in his eyes. She's going to file that reaction away for later. Illya request dessert, to Gaby's surprise: something with a name that's neither German nor English. Elsbeth nods her approval as she confirms they have what he wants, and nods again when he says to make it two. Gaby gives him a look at his presumptuousness. \"Maybe I don't want dessert,\" she tells him. The milkshake really was too sweet. \"You will like this one,\" he promises. \"And if you do not, I will eat both.\" Gaby wants to ask him what the dessert is, but she's feeling pleasantly full and a bit sleepy. It's just cool enough with the diner's air conditioning that she can lean against Illya again with the excuse of using him to keep warm. He doesn't object; instead he slides his fingers through the strands of her ponytail and she doesn't want to say anything because he might stop. She might be jealous of 'Anna', thinks Gaby. Anna who can come to this dinner with her maybe-boyfriend after a day at the beach. Elsbeth returns to their table with two plates of the dessert: a Greek baked apple dish. And yes, it is good. \"So I'm having a Greek dessert in an American dinner with my new Polish-born friend.\" Gaby points her fork at him for emphasis on his borrowed identity. Illya doesn't answer; he just takes a bite of his dessert and raises one eyebrow. Copying Solo? It suits him well enough; she knows Illya has more of a sense of humor than what he lets on. As they finish dessert, they argue over which hotel to go to for the chess lesson. Gaby is in favor of Illya's hotel, because it's closer and his feet are already sore. Illya finally acquiesces and she picks up her bottle of whiskey again in triumph as he pays for the dinner. Even though the sun has set, there's just light enough outside that they can enjoy the brief walk to Illya's hotel. She would like it more if they were closer to the beach now, with the breeze, but it's still a beautiful evening. Gaby has this time with Illya now, and then another two days without work before heading back to London. And a bottle of whiskey that Solo had to buy for her instead of steal. They don't get moments like this very often, where they can walk around and not have to pretend to be something that they're not. Gaby would twirl around, but she decides against it; they're almost to Illya's staid business-class hotel, and she doesn't want to draw attention. They stick out enough already, wearing their beach clothes this far inland. She follows Illya's gesture to stay silent when they get to his room. He checks for bugs, working quietly and with meticulous attention. Gaby would help, but he has so much more experience doing this that it would probably take more time if she interfered. Maybe she'll ask him to help her learn this skill better if they work together again. Just-not now. Not while she's taking a holiday of sorts. What else does she need to learn? What else will she have to do if she continues in this life? Her first mission in Rome led to the death of her biological father, and of her mother's brother. Also Victoria Vinciguerra, and her husband Alexander-the only death she actually saw. A death at Illya's hand. Not that Gaby regrets it; better him than Solo, Illya, or her. Vinciguerra's ending was easier it might have been, she thinks. Istanbul was simple, at least in that way. Their mission here in America too, for all its futility, brought no troubled conscience; no nightmares other than those she already carried with her. So the worst is still ahead of her. Someday, waiting for her: her moment to be the nightmare in someone else's life. Unless she turns from the path she's on now. Gaby isn't drawn to spending a life in America, but she's intrigued (and occasionally amused) by American flexibility, the way they constantly try reinventing themselves. She could go to school: a comment she made half in jest at the diner, but it appeals to her. Or even a mechanic's job again-but maybe working with race cars this time, learning more about design... Illya finishes his rounds and gives her a slight nod: her signal to stop thinking and move on to teasing him. He pulls a second chair close to the small table with the chess board, and starts resetting the pieces. Gaby takes the two upside-down cups from the desk corner; she sits down and deliberately puts her bottle of whiskey on the table, then twists open the cap. Illya looks at her with a hint of curious concern. \"You can have a drink of this, but you're not allowed to enjoy it.\" His eyebrows go up ever so slightly. \"It's too decadent,\" Gaby tells him, trying not to smile. He takes the bottle, pours a drink and them slowly sips, eyes boring into hers. And then it happens: he smiles just big enough that a dimple pops into view on his left cheek, and she feels ruined. Cheated that she has never seen this before. She sighs and tips out a much smaller amount of alcohol into her glass than she normally would. The rich, smoky flavor surprises her; it's worlds away from the cheap whiskeys Gaby has tasted so far. Belatedly she thinks about clinking their cups together, but decides it's too much trouble. She's never been one to stand on ceremony, and certainly not with alcohol. Besides, they're drinking from mugs; it's already an informal affair. \"So tell me the rules,\" she says after he finishes putting the chess pieces into starting position. He picks up one tall, delicate piece in black, and the same shape in white. \"This is queen. She is most powerful.\" That has her attention. Gaby stops trying to think of ways to tease him now and focuses on what he's saying. \"She has most options in moves: vertical, horizontal, diagonal.\" He struggles for a moment with the vocabulary; difficult, Gaby thinks, taking something deeply ingrained in one language and teaching it in another. \"Other pieces have limits. Rules.\" Illya looks across the table at her, all blue-eyed sincerity. \"You are like this,\" he tells her, and she feels the warmth as it rises through her, a tide that flushes her neck and cheekbones. The phone jangles an untimely interruption, sending sparks through her and shocking her enough to almost drop her drink. Illya picks himself up stiffly to answer it: recalibrating from chess teacher to agent. She hates it. Hates knowing that it's almost certainly someone else with the KGB on the other end of the line. \"Hello?\" He's doing the fake-American voice again, the one she heard last night during her drunken call. His voice continues with the charade, long pauses and quick yeses until his final good-bye. Gaby slumps deeper into the chair, because she knows what is coming next. Not the details, but the general idea. \"I leave early tomorrow morning,\" he says, his expression stuck somewhere between soft sorrow and stern lines. Gaby never forgets that he's a KGB agent, but she let it be more distant today: between the warm sun at the beach and the generous servings of food at the American diner, it fell away from the top level of her awareness. \"Where are you going?\" The question slips out before she can stop herself. To her surprise, he answers her. \"New York.\" \"Oh.\" He looks at her and pauses, like he's waiting for her next comment: a condemnation or an invitation? She breathes out, then in. \"I'll let you pack, then.\" He takes this as condemnation, from the mostly-guarded expression that crosses his face. Maybe it is. \"I'm going to walk back to my hotel,\" she says. \"I'll go with you.\" She bats that idea away. \"Your feet are already sore.\" \"It is fine.\" He uses his I'll accept no arguments voice. Maybe that would have scared her a month ago, but not now. \"It's over a mile, and then you would have to walk back. And you still need to pack and get some sleep.\" He shifts tactics. \"Maybe you take taxi.\" Gaby scoffs at that. \"It's not that far.\" He looks at her, analyzing, and then says, \"A good chess teacher will ensure the best performance of his students.\" That's hard to refute because it's so silly. He knows it, too; his lips twitch. If he's willing to be this ridiculous over how she goes back to her hotel, she'll give in. \"Fine,\" she huffs out, and tries not to laugh at them both. Honestly, she's tired anyway; she can admit that to herself now. A bit footsore herself even without having worn cheaply-made sandals. Also, it's dark and she doesn't know this town. He's smart enough to turn away rather than let her see his victorious expression. \"I will call front desk for a taxi.\" \"I'm going to change out of these beach clothes,\" she informs him, and picks up the bag holding the outfits they'd worn to meet Solo earlier. Illya is dialing the phone already, and nods as she turns to go into his hotel bathroom. It smells of bleach; only one small kit and a couple of items mark this bathroom as occupied, rather than waiting for the next guest. She sets her clothes on the counter. Gaby doesn't want to put on the itchy skirt again, but she also doesn't want to ride a taxi in a strange town in a bikini and wrap. She'll blend in better wearing regular clothes, especially after dark. Dropping the purple wrap onto the floor for the moment, Gaby glances in the mirror. Her ponytail is a loose mess, and the white bikini resembles lingerie. She looks soft, vulnerable. Gaby pulls off the swimwear, her skin tingling where Illya's fingers brushed against her side earlier. She smoothes her hand across the gentle swell of her stomach and then upward, taking a stuttering breath. As a child she spent days-she doesn't know how many-living on the streets of Berlin. It was after her father left them, after her mother died. She remembers the hard-earned lesson of snatching whatever crumbs came her way, from hand to mouth before anyone else could take them. She wants to grab at Illya, gobble him up before he's gone again. Seducing Illya Kuryakin: she could use one of Solo's come-on lines. Her nose wrinkles at that thought. A better idea: she could tackle him to the bed and call him-what are the words? Khoroshiy mal'chik. Good boy. Gaby could spend a sleepless night in his hotel bed instead of hers. Instead of making up her mind one way or the other, she looks around this hotel bathroom. His shaving kit is zipped closed; toothbrush placed on the countertop, parallel to the edge, and a bar of soap that clearly doesn't come from the hotel sits next to the sink. She tries to push a few strands of hair into place and then washes her hands with the soap. It smells harsh, but also like him. It probably comes from Russia. Like him. Just over a month ago she was still keeping her childhood vow never to let a Russian man touch her. The two of them have only worked together for two weeks during that month. Tackle him to his bed or not, he will still leave in the morning. Her other childhood lesson about food: when you have a safe place to store something, you ration it. That's why she bought the chess set that's stored in her luggage back in her hotel room. Gaby puts on the itchy skirt-Solo needs to think about what the clothes feel like when he gets them for her, not just how they look-and her blouse. Stepping out of the bathroom, she spots Illya smoothing his hair down with his fingers in the mirror by the closet. \"You still owe me a chess lesson,\" she tells him. \"Of course.\" He takes it as the careful offering she means it to be, his smile reminding her of that moment in Italy when he gave her back the ring. She glances again at his hair, back in mostly-straight lines. He couldn't redo it completely without water or pomade, so it still curls just a bit. Like it would have when he was little, maybe: tow-headed Illya with a halo of blond fluff. \"Be careful.\" Instead of scoffing, he nods. \"You as well,\" he says, and the moment fills all of her senses in a synchronized wave: Illya's blue eyes meeting hers, his body warm and close, his hair waiting to be touched, his low voice a charged rumble in her ears... his lips hers to taste. His hand touches hers and he pulls her that last step toward him, so that she's almost between his long legs; Illya's head inclines toward hers, his eyes look down at her mouth, his chest expands as he breathes in and Gaby does as well and they almost collide just breathing in, and- The phone rings. \"Verdammt,\" she exclaims, and Illya rubs his eyes in frustration before he steps away to answer the phone. A clipped yes this time instead of a fake accent, followed by, \"Thank you.\" She breathes in deeply and picks up her whiskey bottle from the table. \"Taxi is here,\" he grumbles. His finger twitches once. Gaby sets the bottle down again, goes over to him and tugs him down while standing on tiptoe herself, planting her lips solidly against his for an all too brief moment. It's not the thorough farewell kiss they was hoping for, but it will have to do. She tastes the hint of whiskey on his lips as she pulls away. \"Goodnight,\" she whispers, and picks up her bottle again. Back in her own hotel she takes one more drink, slow and careful, of the expensive whiskey. Plenty of time to sip this; she can always get a refill of something less precious elsewhere. She will leave the itchy skirt here when it's time to leave Connecticut. Solo will grouse about the price, and she'll remind him that he didn't pay for it. The chess set will stay in the corner of her suitcase, carefully wrapped, waiting for the right moment to try it. ","Summary":" This story sprang out of writing Trajectory, but you don't have to read it for this to make sense. "},{"Movie":"Man From U.N.C.L.E.","Title":"Three Secrets","Author":"takingoffmyshoes","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12741990","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Let the record reflect from the outset that Illya was not worried . He was not worried about Solo, he just wanted to check on him. Because of reasons . Reasons like the ice storm that had knocked out power across half the city and burst pipes in the other half. Reasons like the wind and sleet that made the roads unsafe and the alleys between buildings impassable. Reasons like the fact that he wasn't answering his telephone. Reasons like the fact that La Mie was still closed at nine in the morning on a Wednesday . Reasons . So really, Illya was perfectly justified in going and breaking into Solo's flat. He was not, however, prepared for what awaited him there. He lets out a startled hiss before he gets control of himself, because it is freezing . The hall outside had been chilly, but the rooms within are nearly arctic (and Illya would know). He can't see his breath, but it's probably just a matter of time; it's well below freezing outside, and only getting colder. He closes the door behind him, glad for the thick gloves he wore on the way over. The flat is silent, absent even the sounds of air or water moving through vents and pipes. That would explain why his telephone call had gone unanswered, then, if the power were out, and perhaps a pipe had frozen or burst elsewhere in the building. Solo's flat is not what Illya would have expected. For starters, it's not above the bakery where any sensible person would choose to live. Illya's next guess would have placed him in a house in a different, nicer part of the city altogether, but that's not it either. Rather, Solo lives a few blocks away from the bakery in the wrong direction, in an old and frankly unattractive apartment building. Solo had given him the address at some point, more of an off-hand remark than a meaningful exchange of information, and Illya's knowledge of the city hadn't been complete enough to place it. He'd taken a cab over from the bakery, though, and been thoroughly surprised by the stop. The flat itself is nice enough, he supposes — or it would be it the heat were working — and he indulges in a bit of harmless snooping on his search for Solo. The space turns out to be surprisingly impersonal. For someone as loud and colorful as Solo, it's quite colorless, and the decorations are tasteful but rather bland. The mystery of the missing color is solved when he nudges open a door that turns out to be a bedroom. It's dark inside, but once his eyes adjust he sees that rugs of every color and pattern known to man are layered over one another on the floor, and the bed is almost totally obscured by blankets, throws, and what may even be a couple of towels, all of different hues and designs. Apparently Solo had responded to the growing cold by bringing every scrap of moveable fabric into the bedroom and adding it to his magpie's nest. Not entirely unreasonable, but a fully sane person would have just left . And let it never be said that Napoleon Solo is sane . \"Cowboy?\" Illya calls softly, and is rewarded with a slow roll of movement from under the mountain of blankets on the bed. \"I hope that's not you, Illya,\" comes the muffled response, \"because I'd hate to have to kill you for breaking into my apartment and waking me up.\" And that, that does it, because Solo doesn't use his given name, and more importantly, Solo doesn't sleep . He's up before five most mornings, ready to open the bakery at seven on weekdays and eight on weekends, and he stays well past closing to clean and prepare for the next day. Illya had once recommended that he hire some help, and Solo had been so scandalized that Illya might as well have offered to stab him. If the bakery were closed because the storm had rendered it unusable in some way, that would be one thing, but for it to be closed because Solo was still asleep at nine o'clock? Unheard of. \"What's wrong?\" he sighs, resigning himself to the worst possible drama as he picks his way across the haphazard floor. \"Are you sick?\" Solo's head appears from under a thick ochre blanket in some vaguely geometric print. \"Why would I be sick ?\" he demands, gathering righteous indignation about himself like a cloak. It does little to counteract his incredible bedhead or the fact that he still has blankets pulled up to his chin. \"You take day off,\" Illya says. \"You never take day off.\" \"I'm not allowed to take a vacation?\" \"Да, you're allowed to, but you don't .\" \"Well, I am today. Goodbye.\" He retreats back under the blankets, and it's not like Illya can blame him — it's cold , after all — but he can pursue further information. He does this by taking a handful of blankets and yanking them down around Solo's waist, revealing his curly mess of hair and a forest green sweater. Solo lets out an ungodly yelp at the sudden intrusion of cold air and scrambles to burrow back down under the warmth. Illya is extremely unnerved at the sound, and wonders for a frantic moment if Solo actually is sick, until he realizes that it hadn't come from Solo at all, but rather from a cat who had been curled up in the curve of his body. The cat, a long-haired tabby with white markings, wriggles out from the top of the blankets and immediately puffs up to twice what Illya assumes is its normal size. It stalks across the bed towards him, somewhat hampered by the uneven surface, and Illya finds himself unnerved once again. No, not unnerved again; unnerved still , because everything about Napoleon Solo is apparently designed to be unnerving. \"Solo,\" he says carefully, as the cat sniffs the air around him, \"why do you have a cat in your bed?\" \"Who, Lady Margaret?\" is the muffled response, and Illya has to consciously unclench his fists. \"Unless there are more,\" he says through gritted teeth. \"No, just the one.\" \"Then by process of elimination, it would have to be Lady whatever, wouldn't it?\" \"No need to be rude,\" Solo huffs, snippy even through his many layers of blankets. \"And in case you haven't noticed, it's very cold. We have a mutually beneficial arrangement.\" \"About that,\" Illya starts, and then stops. \"Come on, Cowboy, I'm not going to talk to blankets all morning.\" There's some shifting and some shimmying, which sends the cat jumping down off the bed, and then Solo's head re-emerges, hair in even greater disarray than before. \"Carry on,\" he says easily, and Illya rolls his eyes. \"How long has heat been out?\" he asks. \"Some time yesterday, I'd imagine. Stone cold when I got back.\" \"And were you planning on doing anything about it, or…?\" Solo pins him with a flat look. \"Peril, I've just gotten warm for the first time in nearly twelve hours, so if you'll excuse me, I don't plan on moving again until it's absolutely necessary. Now be a good man and put my cat back in, would you?\" He rolls over, putting his back to Illya and making to pull the blankets back over his head again, and Illya leans over and grabs his arm to stop him. He's expecting Solo to be annoyed, but he's not prepared for him to jerk, to flinch with his entire body and land on his back once more, face ashen and drawn. Illya lets go as though burned, shocked into stillness and silence. \"Don't,\" Solo grits out, eyes shut tight and sweat starting to bead along his hairline. It looks like he's about to pass out; if he weren't lying down, he already might have. \"Don't do that.\" Meanwhile, Illya's mind is racing with thoughts of what-ifs and maybes, running through lists of everything that can go wrong in a kitchen with large knives and heavy objects and hot surfaces. \"What is it?\" he asks fervently, sitting down on the edge of the bed and pressing a hand to Solo's forehead. He's not feverish, so that's good, but his skin is clammy, which is not. \"Solo, what's wrong?\" Solo doesn't answer, focused as he is on breathing deeply through his nose, so Illya folds the blankets carefully back from his left arm, the one he'd touched, but whatever's wrong with it is concealed by the thick cable knit of his sweater. There is, however, the edge of a bandage peeking out from the cuff of the sleeve. A sleeve that will certainly not come off without a great deal of grief. \"I need scissors,\" he says, and pushes himself up, but Solo shakes his head vigorously. \"No,\" he says tightly, \"I'm fine. It's fine. Just...just give me a minute.\" \"That is not fine ,\" Illya snaps. \"I need to get sleeve off to look, and I need scissors to—\" \"Peril, stop. It's okay, just don't grab it like that again, that's all.\" His voice is steadier now, and so what Illya really hears is \"please don't cut my sweater,\" rather than \"please just leave me here to die.\" Normally he wouldn't give a damn about the man's wardrobe, but it really is cruelly cold in here. \"What happened? Illya asks. \"Burned myself,\" Solo admits. \"Scalded, really. It's not too bad, just hurts like the devil to touch it.\" \"When?\" \"Yesterday afternoon.\" So he'd burned himself badly enough that it was still excruciating the next day and then come home to find that the heating had failed. And the thing of it is that Illya's actually angry with him. He knows that it's nonsensical, that Solo hadn't done any of this on purpose and there's really nothing he could have done to prevent it, but that doesn't stop him from wanting to wanting to take Solo by the shoulders and shake him for spending the night injured and freezing and alone, when Illya— 'Illya what ,' he doesn't know – would have come and helped him? Would have come and gotten him? Would have taken him back to his apartment and let Mrs. Vanlian fuss over him all evening? Cares about him? – so he sets that line of thought aside. Illya weighs his options, and arrives at the inevitable. \"You're coming home with me,\" he decides aloud. \"I'll pack you a bag.\" Solo puts up some token protests, but once Illya reluctantly agrees to bring his cat, as well, he subsides, and directs the packing process from his bed, sitting up and heavily wrapped against the chill. Illya's breath starts to fog the air as he moves about. Once the bag is packed and the cat is ensconced in a box padded with towels, Illya helps Solo ease into his coat and wrap his scarf. If he notices an apparent stiffness in Solo's left arm, or a clumsiness in his fingers, he keeps it to himself. He'll leave that for Mrs. Vanlian. He gets Solo and his things (and his cat , which is still just a bit too much to swallow) up to his apartment without incident, and settles Solo in the kitchen with a cup of hot, strong coffee in his hands – or, hand – and an afghan over his shoulders before crossing the hall to knock on the Vanlians' door. \"I'm sorry to bother you,\" he says when Mrs. Vanlian opens it, \"but I need your help with something.\" Illya has more than his fair share of experience with first aid, but Mrs. Vanlian sees Solo as yet another wayward son, Illya's still trying to tamp down that strange, seething anger, and hell hath no fury like a mother whose child has been injured doing something stupid. He explains the situation to her, and sees the cold, hard light of an imminent scolding gathering in her eyes. It vanishes as soon as she sees Solo, of course, and she greets him with all her customary warmth. He returns her affections with a rather awkward one-armed hug, but his expression over her shoulder is perplexed. Illya smirks, and Solo's eyes widen as he realizes what's about to happen. Sure enough, Mrs. Vanlian pulls away and presses him back into his seat. \"Illya tells me you've hurt yourself rather badly,\" she says in Russian. Solo tries to dismiss her concerns, but she continues. \"He also says that you spent the night in an old, unheated building instead of asking your friends for help.\" Illya hadn't said that last bit in quite so many words, but the image her statement evokes – of Solo huddled in the corner of some decrepit warehouse, stubbornly ignoring the voice of reason literally knocking at the doors – is not actually all that inaccurate. \"The phone line was dead,\" Solo says, and yes, Illya had tried to call him to no avail. The anger wavers, then steps back into irritation, since the bakery has a phone, as well, which may well have been fully functional. Mrs. Vanlian concedes the point with a touch of wariness, like she's not quite sure she believes him, but poses no further accusation. \"Come on then,\" she says, \"let's take a look.\" Getting Solo out of the sweater is rather a lot of work, since he flinches and pales anytime someone touches his left arm, but between the three of them they manage to get it off without too much incident. Solo's left shivering in a white t-shirt, and Mrs. Vanlian has Illya get him another blanket before she turns to the bandage wrapped from his wrist almost to his shoulder. She carefully unwinds the cloth to reveal the telltale blisters and angry red splotches of a scald wound — a bad one, at that. \"Oh, Napoleon,\" she breathes, \"what happened?\" Solo gives a vague account of a new recipe and a foolish mistake and a vat of something boiling spilling all down his arm, but he doesn't give specific details and his Russian is clumsier than usual. Mrs. Vanlian doesn't press him, though, just squeezes his good arm and kisses him on the top of the head, promising to get him all fixed up. She returns from a raid on Illya's bathroom with a roll of gauze, a bottle of iodine, and a tub of Vaseline. Solo bears it impassively until the iodine hits a spot where a blister had torn away, revealing raw, spongy flesh, and Illya has to push his head down between his knees and remind him to breathe while Mrs. Vanlian crouches in front of him, wiping his face and neck with a cold towel and murmuring soothing Russian nonsense. The iodine likely burns worse than whatever had scalded him in the first place, but infection would be far worse than either, so they take a short break and then continue. There's one more raw spot, larger than the first, and waters down the iodine before applying it but Solo still goes rigid and pale and needs Illya to hold him still so that Mrs. Vanlian can finish. She does, then daubs the whole thing liberally with Vaseline and wraps it all carefully in two layers of gauze. Together, she and Illya get him to the couch — a two person job, because Solo's more than a little unsteady on his feet after everything, and Illya's afraid of jostling his arm. \"Would you like to stay here, or come back with me?\" she asks once he's settled, stroking damp hair back from his forehead. \"The children are all at school, so I can promise a few hours of quiet.\" \"Oh, no, I'd much rather bother Peril,\" Solo murmurs, eyes closed, and that's how Illya knows he's all right. \"That's fine,\" Mrs. Vanlian smiles, \"but you'll let me know if you need anything.\" It's not a question. Solo hums his assent, then Mrs. Vanlian's taking Illya's arm and leading him out of the main room and into the bathroom. \"He should be fine,\" she says quietly, explaining the reason for their odd sequestration, \"but I don't think he cleaned it yesterday so you'll have to watch for infection. You know what to look for?\" Illya nods. \"And you'll come and get me if you need help?\" \"այո,\" Illya agrees. \"Good boy,\" she smiles, and gestures for him to head back out into the hall. \"I'll come check on you this afternoon,\" she promises in Russian, and if Solo were a normal person, he'd simply accept it. As it is, he raises an eyebrow and starts to protest as politely and eloquently as possible. \"D'ap,\" she interrupts, pointing at him in manner that has subdued many an ebullient child. \"Just you try to stop me, Napoleon Solo. Try, and see what happens.\" Napoleon deflates; Mrs. Vanlian softens. \"Get some rest,\" she says gently. \"Healing takes time.\" \"Yes, Mrs. Vanlian,\" Napoleon mutters, wisely giving in. \"Be good,\" she tells them both, and slips out. There's a soft snick as the door closes behind her. \"Nice place,\" Solo says eventually, breaking the newfound silence. \"Heating and everything.\" \"Running water, too,\" Illya agrees blandly. \"And three working hands between us.\" Solo snorts. \"Yes, all right, I should have asked for help. Happy?\" \"Not particularly.\" \"Well, there's not much I can do for that, I'm afraid.\" Solo rearranges the blankets around himself and slides a little further down the arm of the sofa. \"Would you mind letting Lady Margaret out? She's probably asleep, but no living thing should be trapped.\" Illya goes over to the bed, where Solo's bag is sitting next to a suspiciously quiet box, and carefully lifts the lid. The cat is indeed sleeping within, curled into a circle with its feather-duster tail tucked over its nose and front paws. Its fur is long and soft-looking – on impulse, he runs a hand down its flank, and should have expected the way it startles, lifting its head to reveal a silky white throat and chest. A small chirrupy trill has the distinct cadence of a question, so Illya holds his hand out for a sniff. He's never been one for cats, but he's never precisely disliked them, either. He just never spent much time around them, and doesn't know how to act. The fact that Solo, of all people, should have one…. It's not that odd, but still. It's just one more surprise, just one more facet he hadn't been anticipating. Every time he thinks he's starting to understand the man, something catches him off guard. It's like he's doing it on purpose. Infuriating American. Apparently satisfied with his scent, the cat butts its head up under his hand, and Illya obediently scritches between its ears. \"Why Peril, are you bonding with my cat?\" There's a smile clear in Solo's voice, and Illya almost startles. He's so rarely quiet, after all. \"Not on purpose,\" Illya says, still not looking away from the small animal so happily receiving his attentions, and Solo chuckles. \"She's a sweetheart, isn't she?\" He pats his lap and clicks his tongue, and the cat gives Illya's hand one last nudge before jumping down off the bed and trotting across the room to hop up onto Solo's lap. \"I found her not long after I'd moved to the city. She was doing all right on her own, but I think most of us do better with a home. She certainly seems to agree.\" Illya can hear the purring from across the room as the cat stands on Solo's chest, tail waving lazily in the air, accepting its due affection. \"You do not seem the type to take in strays,\" Illya says, and then immediately realizes how untrue that is. Solo had taken him in just as surely as the Vanlians had; the fact that he (and the Vanlians) have now taken Solo in doesn't do anything to change that. But the words are already out, and Solo doesn't appear to take any offense. \"No,\" he says, \"I suppose not. But some are just too hard to resist, don't you think?\" \"Perhaps,\" Illya allows, but all he can think is I know . Thanks for reading! This story will have three chapters, and although I'm aiming to have it finished before the holidays I'm not sure what my posting schedule will look like. As always, please feel free to leave any feedback you'd like to, and hopefully I won't keep you waiting too long before the next bit![Chapter 2] Solo falls asleep almost immediately, as Illya suspected he would, between one thing and another, so he goes into his room to stretch out on his bed with a book. He manages this quite peacefully for about an hour, until he hears the soft thump of the cat jumping down off the sofa and realizes abruptly that he'd more or less broken into Solo's apartment and kidnapped him out of little more than sheer annoyance. He feels bad for a few seconds, then he remembers the freezing rooms, the festering scald wound, and the fact that Solo would probably happily have died of hypothermia or some kitchen-related infection before thinking to ask for help, so really, he's an idiot and all Illya did was save him from himself. That settled, he is still faced with the question of what to do now. If you kidnap someone for their own good, you can't just ignore them afterwards; honor demands that you follow through. With the two most pressing concerns taken care of, what is there left to do? Solo will want to rest, and complain, and be annoying, and all Illya has to do is sit there and let him, and maybe make some tea and some food when he wakes up, but that's hardly going to take up the whole day. Illya checks his watch: not quite 11:30, and how long is this supposed to go on, anyway? A day? A week? They're friends, yes, but the \"I break into your kitchen and help you work and you thank me by getting me involved in things I never asked to be involved in\" kind of friends, not the kind that sits around in silence for days on end kind of silence. He doesn't even have work to escape to, since the ice storm that precipitated (hah) the situation has put a solid hold on the new sewer lines being laid. And the more he thinks about that, the more unfortunate it seems, since he doesn't exactly have savings and if he's going to need to feed two people instead of one, he'd rather have a paycheck while he does, unless Solo wants to pay his way, which he probably will but with what money? They didn't take any with them, so they could drive back across town to Solo's apartment to get it, but what if Solo's arm gets infected and he's too sick to go so Illya has to go by himself and dig around his things looking for his money, and is found and arrested because who in their right mind would believe that really, he just needs his friend's money to pay for his groceries, his friend said he could, and— Why didn't he just think of this before they left, is the real question. What's wrong with him? Did the sight of Solo looking so pathetic really throw him so badly that he couldn't string two sensical thoughts together? He should be immune to Solo by now, damn it, but apparently he's not. He probably would have just kept asking himself useless questions and spiraling further into complete inanity had the cat not padded into his room just then, head down and prowling like a tiger, and provided a new and welcome avenue of questioning. Illya knows more or less how to deal with Solo by now - is personality, at least, if not this exact situation - but the cat is a complete unknown. Illya's never had a cat, and his neighbors two doors down growing up had a stray that lived on their property, but he only ever saw it from a distance. He knows the basics, obviously - it will need food and water and a place to do its business, and what else? Do cats need to be exercised like dogs do? He thinks not, but if anyone were to have a contrary cat, it would absolutely be Solo. He can't imagine the idea of walking a cat, though – he'd seen nothing to suggest such an activity in Solo's flat – so if it needs exercise, it will have to be through play. Hunting! Yes, that's it: cats play by simulating hunting, so it needs something to chase, something to bat around… He wants to slap himself when he realizes the answer, if only because it took so long. He has just the thing. Tucked into one corner of his tiny bedroom is a dresser that skirts the edge of comically large, especially in such a small space. Only two of the four drawers contain his clothing, so it's not as though he's already fallen into capitalist hedonism (he snorts to himself: not that he could , even if he wanted to). One sparsely populated drawer holds some of the more painful personal belongings he'd brought from Russia – a few pictures of his family from his early childhood, the Orthodox bible he'd taken at his mother's insistence, his sambo medals, his judo dan certificates, and a handful of buttons from the shirt his father had been wearing the day the KGB came for him, all that Illya's young hands and childish protests could keep – but the one below it is stuffed to bursting. It would make more sense to equalize the two a little more, but some things don't belong together. It's this last drawer that he opens now, pausing to listen and make sure that Solo's still asleep. If he asks, Illya will say that he got it from Mrs. Vanlian; Illya likes Solo, but he's not quite prepared to deal with his reaction right now. The apartment is quiet but for the cat's quiet purring, so Illya reaches in and pulls out a ball of yarn, then carefully closes the drawer again, making sure no stray loops or ends peek out. The yarn is grey wool, tightly spun, and (hopefully) unlikely to explode into millions of pieces of wool fluff that he'll have to pick up later. He carries it out to the main room, cat following quite literally on his heels, and bends down to drop it lightly onto the floor. She may not want it now, but he'd rather she get any surprising energy out during the day instead of at night, so he might as well give it to her now. He steps aside to let her get at it, and watches as she reaches forward to sniff delicately at the surface. Apparently approving of what she finds, she ducks her head to rub it against the wool, only to send it rolling away from her, leaving a small length of yarn in its trail as the end falls loose. Suddenly, her entire body seems concentrated on it. Her ears swivel forward, her eyes go round, the fur along the ridge of her spine stands up, and she slowly eases to her feet, chest pressed low to the ground even as her tail lifts, waving jerkily, and her hind end moves in tiny incremental adjustments. The she pounces, and Illya's plan unravels along with the yarn. Her jump is silent, but the landing is loud, and she and the yarn both skid on the bare wood floor until coming up against the side of the couch with a resounding thud, and then she's scrambling up again and galloping after the ball, which had either bounced off the couch with impressive force and shot across the room or else been struck by a flailing paw. Either way, for a small animal she makes an incredible amount of noise, and Solo wakes up just in time to see his majestic pet trip on the ball of yarn she's chasing across the room, somersault around it, and end up on her back with all four paws sunk into it. For a second, everyone is silent. Illya looks from the cat, who's staring at them upside-down and somehow managing to convey both confusion and derision with an incredibly bland expression, to Solo, who's staring back with the exact same expression. \"Well?\" Solo asks eventually, clearly talking to the cat. \"What did you think was going to happen?\" Illya doesn't think cats are biologically capable of rolling their eyes, but this one does an excellent impression of it and sets about industriously licking the yarn. Solo sighs. \"Big heart, small brain,\" he mutters, then looks over at Illya. \"Speaking of which, it's quite bold of you to give that cat a ball of yarn.\" \"That's what you do with cats,\" Illya says, trying to sound sure of himself. \"Only if you don't mind rolling it all up again eight times a day,\" Solo huffs, and pushes himself upright with a wince, \"after untangling it from every piece of furniture you own.\" Illya shrugs. \"I don't have that much furniture.\" \"And dealing with the fact that it's pretty much useless for anything else once it's covered in cat spit.\" They both look over at the cat, who's given up licking the yarn and settled for trying to fit the ball, which is twice as big as her head, into her mouth. \"I have more,\" Illya says without thinking, then freezes, and curses himself vehemently. \"Oh?\" There's such innocent delight in the word, of course there is, that's why Illya was going to lie , because lying is always the best option with Solo, and it's a damn good thing he didn't join the KGB if it's this easy to get under his skin— \"Why do you have yarn, Peril?\" To strangle himself with, of course. \"For—yarn...things,\" Illya answers with as much asperity as possible, which isn't much at all, because berating himself in Russian and speaking in English is quite a lot of work to do at once, before noon, on a cold Wednesday that has already involved breaking and entering and kidnapping but which quite amateurishly did not include robbery. Ну блядь. \"Peril.\" Maybe if he ignores him, Solo will let it drop. \"Peril.\" Well that was clearly the stupidest thought he's ever had. \" Peril. \" \"Fine,\" he snaps. \"I am making presents for the Vanlians.\" \"It's January. It's mid January.\" Somehow, that's what gets him. What does it matter what time of year it is? Are Americans really so stringent that they only give gifts on dedicated occasions, with no room for generosity at any other time? \"And? It's cold, and they have four children to feed and keep warm, and I have nothing better to do since I cannot work when the weather is like this—\" he gestures angrily at the window, rimed in ice \"—and so if I do not wish to lose my mind from uselessness , I must do something, and so yes, I am making them presents, even in ' mid J anuary.'\" \"Easy, Peril,\" Solo says soothingly, \"I wasn't criticizing. Just didn't know if you - or they - had a different holiday season I should be aware of.\" \"Oh. No. How is you arm?\" he asks, belatedly remembering the wince. \"Still hurts,\" Solo says absently, pulling it out from under the blanket and moving it around gingerly, \"but not worse than before. So I'll probably live. What are you making?\" He's clearly not about to let this go, even if his intentions aren't to malign Illya's pass-times, so Illya goes to his room and pulls the bundle out of the drawer. It falls apart when he drops it on Solo's lap, revealing several layers of scarves wrapped around hats and mittens. They're not colorful – he can't afford the sort of dye that won't run – but they're wool, and they're thick, and they're warm. He just needs to finish two more hats and another pair of mittens, and then he can take them across the hall and hope that they're worth something. Solo blinks a few times, then runs his hands over them, feeling the texture. \"Is this knit or crochet?\" he asks. \"I never could tell the difference.\" \"Crochet,\" Illya says. \"Makes thicker fabric. Doesn't stretch as much, but fewer holes, so better for winter.\" \"Looks like it.\" He picks a hat at random and holds it to the light. \"It's well made, that's for sure. Where did you learn?\" \"My father.\" \"Your father? \" Solo puts the hat down, and while he doesn't quite gape, it's a close thing. Illya almost smiles. \"Yes. He was the youngest of three sons, and his mother did not want the skill to disappear from her family, so she taught him. Embroidery, too, but he did not have time to teach it to me. I remember, when I was young, that he would come home from work and embroider handkerchiefs. Traditional Russian patterns, mostly, but sometimes other things.\" \"When did you lose him?\" Solo asks quietly. \"I was fourteen, but he didn't die. The KGB took him away. We never knew why.\" \"Illya, I'm—\" \"Don't apologize,\" Illya cuts in. \"I don't need it. Not from you.\" 'Not from you, because you had nothing to do with it,' he means, but Solo seems to understand. \"D'you want to sit down?\" is all he says. \"It's your home, after all. You don't have to loom.\" \"I'm not looming,\" Illya protests, though he might not be entirely sure what that word means. \"You're looming like a henge. Sit down, if only to spare my neck the strain of looking up at you. Here, I'll make room.\" He swings his legs over the edge of the sofa and drags the blanket with him, gathering all the garments into a pile next to him. \"Look – plenty of space, even for you.\" Illya thinks about it, considers refusing, and decides it's not worth the effort. He drops down next to Solo with a bit of a sigh. \"I'm sorry I asked such a personal question,\" Solo says after a little bit. \"It's not my business. But for what it's worth, I think he'd be proud of you. These are incredible, and I'm sure the Vanlians will love them. Which ones are for who?\" Illya reaches over and starts sorting them out. The creamy white is for Mariam, the larger tweed for Mr. Vanlian, the light grey for Davit, the smaller tweed for Siran, the slightly darker grey for Yeva, and the black for Mrs. Vanlian. Black wool is more expensive than dyed white wool, but it's worth the extra cost for something that won't bleed onto other fabrics, and he thinks the black looks elegant, almost. He'd used his smallest needle, and the yarn itself is fine; the resulting material is light and pliable, less bulky than the others, but it will still be warm even in the coldest winds. \"Incredible,\" Solo says again. \"I can't even imagine how long these took. They're all perfect.\" Illya shrugs. \"Nothing is perfect, but nothing has to be.\" \"I suppose,\" Solo agrees, but he sounds dubious. \"What's a henge?\" Illya asks. \"A what?\" \"A henge. You said I was looming like a henge. Is it different than a hedge?\" For some reason, Solo finds that hilarious. Hey so I know it's been a Long Damn Time but in my defense, depression tried super hard to murder me this entire spring semester and then when I finally succeeded in beating that back with a stick it was time for hip surgery and that went really well but then the executive dysfunction came for me and nailed me to the asphalt for a solid month, so there's that. I'm bit of a dumpster fire sometimes, but I'm still alive, and I'm still writing. I would love to promise that it'll never happen again, but I can't, so I won't. I'll just say that I'm grateful beyond words for all of you: you've stuck with me, you've supported me, you've encouraged me, and you've been patient with me. You're awesome, and I appreciate you so much. Thanks for reading, and as always I welcome your feedback! ","Summary":" Let the record reflect from the outset that Illya was not worried .

Too close. Making his way up the stairs, he slammed the door shut behind him and noisily knocked over some filing cabinets in front of it. That'll buy some time. Rushing through the building, he pushed the blaring sound of the alarm out of his head as he tried to remember the layout of the third floor; there'd been a balcony overlooking a cluster of trees and bushes, perfect if he could find it. Tucking the precious files away in his jacket, he turned to his left and resumed his search. Where's Peril when you need him, he thought as he rounded the corner ahead, looking for an exit, instead finding the business end of a gun. \"Hands up, no sudden moves!\" 'Whoa, take it easy.\" Solo held up his hands in a placating manner. \"Hey, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for party room number 12, I got lost on my way back from the restrooms, absolutely great party too though. I can even introduce you to the guest of honor, I know she'd-\" \"Shut your mouth and move\", the guard gestured the direction with his weapon. \"And watch it, I believe my boss wants you alive, but whether you stay that way is entirely up to you.\" \"You're no fun, you know that. And your uniform has a despicable amount of wrinkles in it.\" \"Move!\" Napoleon almost tripped as he was roughly shoved forward. His mind raced with ideas as they walked down the dimly lit hallway. This fellow was definitely bigger than him, and therefore it was safe to assume he was stronger as well. Very bad odds. Neither Solo nor his suit would last long in a one-on-one fight. And not really eager to see Mr. Rieck again so soon, he tried the first thing he thought of. \"Look at that!\", he yelled, pointing in one direction as he shielded himself with his other hand. Unperturbed, the guard simply walked on, pointing his gun dangerously close to Solo's head. \"Nice try\" \"Well, if at first you don't succeed-\" \"Keep going!\" \"You sorry stick in the mud\", Solo murmured. \" What?\" \"I said I borrowed six from my bud\", he rephrased, not pushing his luck. Halfway down the hall now, what else?, Napoleon thought. His stomach growled loudly. He hadn't eaten since his lunch yesterday. Hmmmm... Napoleon groaned, clutching at his stomach and unexpectedly dropped to his knees. This may have worked too, if the guard hadn't barreled into him, causing Napoleon to fall the rest of the way, headfirst into the concrete floor... And then have the heavy guard fall on top of him. \"Dumb American.\" He barely registered the guard's comment as he felt himself get pulled up to his feet by his collar and pushed forward again. Remind myself to never try that again on an empty stomach, Solo thought. Got it. If he was feeling a little weak before, no food and all, he definitely felt worse now, with a pounding headache and most likely a couple of bruised ribs to boot. At this point, they passed by some empty offices. Looking out of the corner of his eye at the reflection in the glass, he saw a figure moving silently behind them. It wasn't another guard. That could only be... Peril. Finally. Still, how to deal with Mr. Heavy Mud Stick here before he saw Illya too. Maybe if I can distract him... \"Aha! I've got it\", Napoleon declared, brimming with confidence and swaying like a drunk as he spun around pointing to nowhere in particular. The guard blinked. Undeterred, he went on. \"What you need is a kiss.\" The guard blinked again before shaking his head. What was this American's problem? Maybe he really was cookoo. \"Enough with your nonsense already! Move!\" \"Aww, come here you big lug\", Napoleon stumbled towards him with his arms outstretched. Despite the situation, it was still a comical sight. The guy unconsciously took a step back and then- SMACK! He never knew what hit him. \"Yup, a nice big kiss for you buddy\", Napoleon smirked as he turned to his friend, his smile turning into a confused frown. \"How long had you been following us anyway?\" \"All time you walk down hall until I get closer. Wait for good opportunity.\" \"There was a perfectly good chance back when, oh I don't know, the guy fell on me!\" The last three words were clearly emphasized. \"Not good opportunity, too far away\" Of course, a reason for everything, Solo thought before speaking. \"You are a terrible spy.\"[Chapter 2] No sooner did the alarms go off than Illya emerged from his hiding spot. Napoleon had told him to check the window at the far end of the hallway, and he did. But knowing the kind of trouble his partner attracted, he'd decided to return and keep watch. And a good thing he did too... CRASH! Napoleon exited the room with far less grace than usual and went headfirst into a stack of boxes. Slightly shaken, he attempted to get up and glance around a moment to regain his bearings. Reaching over, Illya grabbed his arm and had started to speak: \"OK, Cow- OOF!\" Just like that, Solo jerked his elbow back and landed a punch square in Illya's jaw, ending with a kick that sent Illya stumbling backwards into a wall. Not surprise Cowboy next time, he thought as he got back up and chased after Solo's rapidly vanishing figure. And none too soon, because right then, a group of guards swarmed out from a nearby staircase with guns raised. \"Halt! Halt or I shoot!\", shouted the apparent leader. Without thinking twice, Illya dashed off in the direction Solo had gone. A bullet whizzed by not two inches from his ear. So far he had put a little distance between himself and his pursuers. Turning another corner, he noticed the only door left in this hallway was at the very end, along with a small window. No problem, he thought as he rapidly approached the door. Suddenly, he heard a tumultuous crash on the other side of the door, followed by a \"Ha!\" and quickly fading footsteps. Napoleon! Looking around, he saw the window and groaned before forcing it open. Sticking his head out, he saw the ground three floors down; no trees, just small rose bushes. With that in mind, he clambered out the window, and hanging on to a gutter pipe, shimmied over to the next window. Unlocked. Good. Climbing inside, he saw the cause of the crash he heard earlier. Solo had toppled over the filing cabinets, effectively blocking the door. Aha. \"Move!\" Illya snapped back to attention and crept towards the corner, listening carefully. As he poked his head around the corner, he quickly sized up the situation. Only one guard, a pretty good size though, and lightly armed. Ahead of him, Napoleon stumbled a bit before walking on. Best follow and take chance. As Illya slowly caught up to Napoleon and his captor, he heard Napoleon abruptly yell, \"Look at that!\" Oldest trick in book, Illya thought. No wonder the guard ignored that. He had to smile at Napoleon's next comment. Illya mentally reminded himself to ask Solo what exactly a 'stick in the mud' is. There still was a considerable distance between Illya and the two, who were already halfway down the hall. Napoleons next actions were surprising. He had fallen to his knees, feigning illness, only to have the guard knock him down (presumably by accident) and land on top of him. Illya quickly flattened himself up against the wall, no sense in getting caught this far. The two got back to their feet, Napoleon doing so a little slower than usual. They were close to the end already. Now or never. Illya quickened his pace, noticing Solo had stalled yet again, something about 'Aha', but was caught off guard by his next words. \"What you need is a kiss.\" Everyone but Solo froze. He must have taken one too many hits to head, Illya thought, yet... Maybe Solo had seen him. Illya got up behind the guard, readied himself and SLAP! Napoleon smiled contentedly as he dropped his arms to his sides and turned to his friend. \"How long had you been following us anyway?\" \"All time you walk down hall until I get closer. Wait for good opportunity.\" \"There was a perfectly good chance back when, oh I don't know, the guy fell on me!\" Illya rolled his eyes to keep from laughing; that had been funny, big guy squished him like a pancake. \"Not good opportunity, too far away\" Solo opened his mouth and shut it promptly before opening it again. Satisfied, Illya walked past Napoleon, intent on leading the way out himself until something stopped him short. \"You are a terrible spy.\" ","Summary":" He muttered under his breath as he dodged another bullet.

Sean having been bitten seemed to start to take it's toll on his mobility as he broke his ankle falling to the ground atop of the stairs leading to the porch of the country home. Waking up to the sweet smell of... of... blood sean sat up slowly, his body feeling like anvils resting atop every limb. Suddenly a man slowly stepped behind him, scuffing his boots off a body nearby. The man then looked to the driveway to see a car which seemed to be in fair condition was a treasure, but this zombie at his feet was going to need to go. Pulling a revolver out of the back pocket of his pants the man spun the chamber and lowered it to sean's head. Sean looked up with curious eyes to what this man was doing until he saw the gun. Before sean could react the man's index finger pulled back on the trigger blasting sean's head into fragments of flesh and bone all over the stairs. Satisfied the man stepped over sean's corpse, and walked over to the car. Delighted that the driver's side door was unlocked he pulled it open. In the center console he spotted a pair of keys the man grabbed them, and before he inserted them into the ignition he looked at the key chain. What the man saw was sean and his wife who was pregnant standing next to sean's daughter. Not understanding that the \"zombie\" he killed was in the picture he shurgged, and slid the key into the ignition. Turning the key the car sputtered to life, the man reversed out of the dirt driveway. Taking one last look at his old sanctuary, the man opened the glovebox, and found a map which he greedily snatched up. Plotting his course the man then drove away hoping to find a future in the new wasteland that is now earth. What the man didn't know was that sean had only been bitten by a dog on his ankle, and had tripped on the stairs earning himself a concussion and a cut on his forehead.

I think it's a fantastic movie, and I bet the TV show was really cool! But yeah, I don't own either. ^_~ A/N: So I'm a sucker for the Gaby x Illya ship, and so I gave them a kid, a daughter named Katerina, which has about a thousand nicknames. Most of the time she's called Katie, since everyone can agree on that (though Gaby and Illya sometimes call her Katya or Katyusha). She's about five years old in this ficlet. This'll be a three-shot! Heroes Need Monsters Gaby was awake the moment the bedroom door opened a hair, letting in the soft glow of the hallway nightlight. She opened one eye to see Illya looking back at her, alert even though his eyes were barely open. Neither of them moved, however, as little bare feet padded over the carpet, hardly making a sound. A slight dip in the mattress and the blanket shifting downward was the only indication that their daughter had climbed onto the bed and made herself comfortable. If they had left her like that, Katie would have slept the entire night curled up at the foot of the bed like a cat, possibly using Illya's ankles as a pillow. Cute, yes, but a little worrying. Up until a couple weeks ago, she hadn't had any problems sleeping through the night in her own bed, and only rushed to their room after a nightmare or during a bad thunderstorm. But after Illya had left for this last mission, their curly-headed moppet had started crawling into bed with Gaby every night without fail. Apparently there were monsters with fangs and claws and lots of fur in her closet and under her bed, and a thorough inspection of all those places with a flashlight and even all the lights in the house on couldn't convince her otherwise. Gaby had hoped that when Illya got back, the whole monster situation would go away, but no such luck. She hadn't even gotten a chance to tell him about it yet. He had just gotten back that afternoon, and they hadn't really had a moment to talk without Katie around. Or, well, they had , but they hadn't used that time to talk . A big, callused hand brushed across Gaby's skin as Illya sat up and then reached for their daughter. Gently, he slid her across the covers until she was close enough to gather into his arms. \"I think this is not your bed, Katyusha.\" Her little face with its pert nose and big green eyes looked so solemn it was almost funny. \"There's a monster under my bed, Papa.\" Immediately, Illya's eyebrows came together in that concerned frowny expression that Gaby loved, and he glanced over at her, silently asking what was going on. \"We've been dealing with a minor monster infestation since you've been gone, love,\" she said, \"Can't seem to get rid of them.\" \"Mommy made them go away, but they won't stay gone.\" Katie's lower lip poked out for a split second before she determinedly hid her pout against Illya's neck, her dark blond curls spilling over his shoulder. Her next words were muffled. \"They're scary.\" Gaby could see Illya's arms tighten around Katie, and she reached out to squeeze his thigh, letting him know that she understood how he felt. Monsters weren't real, so there wasn't an easy way to take care of the problem. They couldn't chase it away or fix it quickly. Illya couldn't punch invisible monsters to death. No matter how much he wanted to. After a long moment, Illya loosened his hold and kissed Katie's forehead. \"We will have to see what we can do about the monsters in the morning. It is not a good time for hunting. Little girls should be asleep.\" He set her down on the bed, and Gaby automatically gathered Katie to her, squishing her with a hug and covering her with kisses until she gave a sleepy giggle. A shadow crossed over them and Illya caught Gaby's lips in a quick, crushing kiss, one of his arms planted in the mattress on her other side so he could prop himself up and not squash them. \"That, by the way, includes chop shop girls.\" His voice was stern, and that sent a shiver down her back. \"Russian giants, too, then,\" she said, shoving his chest. He growled before pulling the covers up around them, tucking his girls in. Most of the time, Gaby preferred being called a woman rather than a girl, but with Illya, it was different. Endearing instead of aggravating, most of the time. Between them, Katie curled up against Gaby, but one of her tiny hands reached out toward Illya, fingers resting splayed on his arm as if to reassure herself he was really there. It must've been too much for him because a few seconds later, he picked her up and set her on his other side and then pulled Gaby closer. It was as if he just wanted both of them as close to him as he could maneuver them. Gaby knew there was no need to say that they had missed each other. It was etched in every movement, in every time they reached for each other. Before the last sliver of night faded, she felt Illya give her a feather-light kiss. \"Goodnight, Радость моя.\" Радость моя = My Joy (I'm sorry if I totally screw up Russian words. I'm trying, but Russian is not my strong point! Let me know if you catch my Russian mistakes so I can fix them! 3)[Chapter 2] `Disclaimer: I don't own The Man from U.N.C.L.E. I think it's a fantastic movie, and I bet the TV show was really cool! But yeah, I don't own either. ^_~ Part Two Illya and Gaby had spent the afternoon setting up a few simple monster traps in Katie's room. There was now a pair of nails driven into the doorframe of her closet and a string with bells tied was hung between the nails. Around Katie's bed, Illya had sprinkled salt and flour, which he promised monsters hated so much. It was going to be a pain to clean up, but Gaby was willing to put up with it if it helped her daughter. And, to top it all off, they had bought three new flashlights just for Katie, and Illya had created a special makeshift flashlight holder that sat on her nightstand. Someone was especially determined to get rid of the monsters. It was getting late, close to Katie's bedtime. Gaby was busy chasing her down as she did a few giggling laps around the furniture in the living room while Illya finished drying the dishes. \"Come here!\" Gaby said, reaching for her and intentionally missing, letting Katie dart under her arms. She got a huge grin in return as Katie darted back behind the couch and ducked between the window and the back of the couch. \"Can't catch meee,\" she said in a sing-song tone. \"Wanna bet?\" Gaby asked, walking that way, her feet sinking into the plush shag carpet. This place needed a makeover, but they weren't staying here much longer since Illya's mission was over. It was time to move, but that was something they could think about tomorrow. Tonight they had some downtime. Just as Katie was creeping out from behind the couch, Gaby raced forward, reaching for her. The little girl squealed and backpedaled, heading toward the other end of the couch. She might have made it, too, if Illya hadn't finished the dishes a few moments earlier and headed into the living room to find out what they were doing. \"Papa, no, no fair,\" Katie cried, but she was laughing as he caught and lifted her, tossing her into the air. Thank goodness for high ceilings. They were a necessity when living with Illya. \"More than fair.\" He tickled her until she dissolved into breathless laughter and then settled her across his shoulder like a sack of potatoes. Turning to Gaby, he held out a hand. \"Coming?\" \"Wouldn't miss it,\" she said, tucking her hand into his. Honestly, she was a little curious about how this whole monster talk was going to go down. Yes, they had discussed it today, but she wanted to see it in action. When they got to Katie's room, Illya set her down on the bed and then sat down as well, pulling Gaby with him. \"Can I have a story?\" Katie asked, flopping across Gaby's lap. \"Pleeeease?\" \"Just one,\" Illya said, closing his hand around hers then opening it again. He flicked his eyes at Gaby. \"You have more stories than I do.\" Gaby smirked a little and settled against Illya as she started her story, weaving a tale of magic and fairies and good things with the heroes coming out on top, hoping that would help Katie sleep better. Maybe it was those fairytales with witches and werewolves that were keeping Katie afraid of the dark, though the kid always liked those the best. She was rather fearless, or had been until recently. As the story came to a happily-ever-after, Katie yawned and glanced up at Gaby. \"Can I sleep with you now?\" \"You're going to sleep in your own bed tonight, remember?\" Gaby said, smoothing her daughter's golden curls. Katie sat up, her lower lip poking out into a pout. \"I don't want to anymore.\" Beside her, Illya rumbled. \"Mmm, that is too bad.\" He reached over and picked up one of the flashlights they had bought. \"Then you will not be able to try out this special banisher.\" Tossing it from one hand to the other, he glanced at her. \"This is a tool for a brave girl.\" Perking up a bit, Katie frowned. \"I'm brave. But that's just a flashlight.\" \"Is it?\" Illya turned the light on, and it shined bright blue light onto the ceiling with a yellow star in the middle. He had spent part of the day coloring the lens on the flashlights, and it had a nice effect. Turning it off, he looked at the lens and then at Katie again. \"It does not seem to be just a flashlight.\" \"Can I see it?\" Katie held out her hand, eyes on the flashlight. Illya dropped it into her hand. \"Try it.\" She flipped on the flashlight and waved it around, sending the yellow star bouncing around the room. Giggling, she waved her hand over the light, making it blink in and out. \"What's it do?\" \"You know that monsters are not real,\" Illya said, \"But if you are frightened and feel like they are real, shine this light at them. They will go away. It may take more than one night, but I think you will find it works.\" \"Monsters seem real,\" Katie said. She leaned against Gaby, who brushed her arm up and down. \"They do, sometimes,\" Gaby said. And there were monsters in the world, but Katie wouldn't yet understand that people could be monsters sometimes. She wished she could always keep that from her daughter. \"But they're just in your imagination.\" \"Uncle Solo says I've got a good imagination,\" Katie said. Illya nodded. \"Which is why it has made up monsters. But you come from a strong family, and you do not need to be afraid.\" \"I think I'll be better with this.\" Katie wrapped both hands around the modified flashlight. \"You will,\" Gaby said. She grabbed the blankets and tucked Katie in while Illya picked up an old stuffed bear from the foot of the bed. \"Sleep well, little one.\" \"Here is Grey,\" Illya said, handing his daughter the black bear that had been misnamed so long ago. \"Now you shall sleep and have good dreams.\" \"Apparently that's an order,\" Gaby teased. She gave Katie a kiss and stood up to move toward the door. \"It is a good order.\" Illya tapped the end of Katie's nose then kissed her on the cheek before following Gaby out of her bedroom. He left the door open a crack. Taking Gaby's hand, he pulled her down the hallway, back toward the living room. \"Do you think this is going to work?\" Gaby asked. She hoped that Katie could make it through the night in her own room. She didn't mind cuddling her baby girl, but she didn't want her to be so afraid of the dark. \"It will,\" Illya said and gave her a mock-serious look, \"It is a Russian tradition.\" \"It is not…\" \"Now it is.\"[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I don't own The Man from U.N.C.L.E. A/N: I missed this family! Chapter 3 Cowboy was in the kitchen. Illya stood in the doorway in his pajamas, watching the American neatly break eggs into a mixing bowl and toss the shells into a second bowl. It had been a long time since Illya had questioned Solo just showing up in whatever house his family was living in and making himself at home. Still, he did appreciate some warning. He cleared his throat. \"Pepper and salt are—\" \"In the cabinet, I know.\" Solo tossed a smirk over his shoulder. \"I thought I would make omelets. Katie still likes peppers in hers, correct?\" Illya grunted. As far as he knew, she did. Then again, sometimes her tastes changed when he was gone for a while…he tried to not let it bother him too much since he knew leaving for periods of time was part of his job, but he always felt like it was a small-scale version of abandoning his family. Granted, often Gaby and Katie went with him. \"I brought the paper.\" Solo pointed toward the kitchen table without turning away from the counter. \"Seems to be some trouble brewing over in France. How's your French?\" \"Nonexistent.\" Crossing over to the table, Illya picked up the paper and flipped it open, looking for the article that Cowboy was talking about. It wasn't on the front page, so he flicked his gaze toward the American again. \"Where am I supposed to be looking?\" \"I'm sure you'll recognize it when you come across the title.\" Illya pursed his lips. Leave it to Solo to turn this into some kind of challenge. Even after all these years, he was still testing Illya at every turn, though it wasn't as if Illya was any easier on Solo. However, nowadays it was more of a game than anything that would make one trust the other less. They had been through too much for something so simple to affect their friendship/rivalry like that. Illya was halfway through the paper and beginning to doubt that there was, in fact, a real article, when his bouncy brown-eyed little girl barreled into the room. She still had her teddy bear and her flashlight, but now she was wearing a victorious smile. \"I chased away the monsters, and I won, and I want pancakes!\" She turned toward Solo, and instead of being surprised by his presence, she simply beamed. \"Pancakes?\" \"For a monster-killer, I suppose anything is possible,\" Solo said, one eyebrow raising as he glanced over at Illya. \"Oh, so the flashlight worked, then?\" Illya said, ignoring Solo and instead focusing on his daughter. She nodded vigorously even as she went up on her tiptoes, trying to peek into the bowl of eggs Solo was stirring. \"It's special,\" she said, \"It worked, and I wasn't scared. Much.\" She poked Solo's elbow. \"Is that pancakes?\" \"Right now, it's just eggs,\" Solo said, \"I thought you loved omelets?\" \"I like pancakes, too, with chocolate sauce,\" she said with a grin. \"How about I finish mixing this first, then I will work on pancakes, assuming there are ingredients here.\" \"There's instant mix in the cabinet,\" Katie said. As if that would be good enough for Cowboy. He prided himself on his cooking skills, and using an instant mix was a complete insult to his abilities. But for Katie, he managed a weak smile instead of a pointed look of offense. \"Is there now…\" \"Come, Katya, and tell me of your great battle,\" Illya said, holding his arms open for the tiny girl. She raced over, leaving behind Solo so that she could leap at Illya, tossing herself at him like a human projectile. He caught her easily and pulled her up onto his lap, settling her on one leg. She placed her bear and flashlight on the table and then looked up at him with that heart-warming smile. Every time he saw it, he swore yet again that he would never let any harm come to her. It was a promise that Gaby said was silly, since she would doubtlessly be hurt at some point and then Illya would blame himself, but he still held himself to the swear. \"There was a monster, with big fangs, and he was nasty, Papa,\" she said, the word nasty coming out as 'nassy' instead. Sometimes she still mixed words up, and it was rather adorable. \"And what did you do to this vile and despicable creature?\" Solo piped in. \"He wasn't veal, he was a monster,\" she said matter-of-factly. Solo hid a smile. \"All right, then, what did you do this the monster?\" \"I took my light and shine it at him,\" Katie said. She picked up her flashlight and flicked it on. \"See? See, Uncle Cowboy?\" Solo glanced over his shoulder and got an eyeful of blue light for his effort. He blinked and turned back to the stove, nodding. \"Ah, yes, I certainly see. Or I did.\" Illya grinned and wrapped an arm around his daughter. \"And what did the monster do then?\" \"He disappeareded,\" Katie said, \"Like magic. He must've ran away.\" \"Astounding,\" Cowboy said. He looked over his shoulder again. \"Does someone want to tell me what's going on? I wasn't aware monsters existed.\" \"They do not,\" Illya said, hugging Katie and getting a laugh out of her. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Gaby step into doorway, her arms crossed over her chest. She didn't seem bothered by the fact that there was an annoying American cooking breakfast for them. It was rather normal, after all. \"Sometimes they do,\" Katie said, \"But now I got a flashlight and I can make them go away real fast.\" \"Ah,\" Solo said, not sounding entirely convinced. \"When I used to be afraid of monsters, my mother taught me a song to sing.\" \"She did?\" Katie asked. Illya felt his own curiosity rising. \"Are you going to sing for us, Solo?\" Gaby asked, stepping into the kitchen, her expectant gaze falling on Cowboy. \"I'm afraid I've forgotten the lyrics,\" Solo said quickly, \"I'm sure someone else can come up with a song, if they wish.\" \"I will,\" Katie said cheerfully, \"I'll do it today.\" \"That sounds like a good way to spend the day,\" Gaby said, walking over and resting her hand on Illya's shoulder. Bending over, she kissed Katie's cheek and then Illya's. \"What are you making, Solo?\" \"Pancakes,\" Katie said with a mischievous laugh while at the same time Solo said, \"Omelets.\" \"He is still deciding,\" Illya said, reaching over touch Gaby's waist. He wanted to hold both of his girls, but his wife stepped away with a smirk. \"I'll make the pancakes,\" Gaby said, \"So Solo doesn't have to suffer through the instant mix.\" \"Thank you,\" Solo said with relief on his face. Katie grinned and looked up at Illya. \"With chocolate sauce?\" He kissed the top of her curly-haired head. \"For my brave one? A little chocolate sauce will not hurt.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

None of my OCs are in this. I don't own Zombieland, only Sarge. Two months. About 61 days. That is how long before the entire United States was overrun by zombies. Yes you heard that correctly. Zombies, or zeds as I like to call them. What caused this? Well, a certain strain of mad cow disease mutated into the mad human disease which then mutated into the mad zombie disease. Wait, that sounded like a game for some reason. Never mind that, I'm getting off track, called me Sarge, just call me that. I'd rather not give out my real name. I worked at the Chicago police department, riot squad, before this entire thing blew over. Now, I thought this thing was just a minor type disease that would blow over like the common cold, but when I saw it affect people. Oh yeah, I was so wrong. When the virus hit Chicago, the city literally fell apart in seconds. People were turning and getting eaten by the mass, and the CPD were overwhelmed. We didn't have the manpower or the firepower to beat back the swarm of zeds. How I survived? I ran the fuck outta there. No really, I RAN. Forget about honor and protecting the populous, when hell broke loose that day, it's every man, woman, and child for himself or herself. No one really paid attention when I ran, they were too busy getting eaten alive. When I ran I didn't have much on me, only my standard issue riot gear, it had full-body protection, gas-mask helmet, metal baton, couple of flash bangs, my 9mm Glock, and a metal riot shield. I felt like I was going to die within a few days, but for some reason luck was on my side. I was able to find food and water from scavenging abandoned houses and buildings, as well as finding some backup weapons, but no guns sadly: a machete, and a baseball bat with nails hammered inside them. But my luck didn't end there, for some reason the zeds ignored me. That's right, IGNORED ME. I walked through a town full of them and none paid any attention to me. I wondered why they didn't attack me until I realized why, I was covered in blood and guts from zombies I killed earlier. I guess they thought I was just another zombie like them, cause from the amount of blood on me, I think I can pass for one, appearance wise that is. Now what most people are probably asking right now is where am I going. When I ran from Chicago, that was my first question. I decided to head south. Why? I don't know, but I think because it's warmer there, considering I grew up in a place warm, and not freezing cold like Chicago. As I traveled south, I hoped to see any other survivors, anyone else who is not currently a zed, but I didn't find anyone, well I did find some but they were either dead or a zombie. But enough about me lets head back to where I was right now. I walked down an abandoned main street of an unknown town, I was too lazy to read where I was, and it was dark and eerily spooky. My mask didn't help either, but I didn't want to take it off. I also didn't want to use my flashlight, didn't want to attract those zeds. I found a store that wasn't damaged as much from vandals and decided to hunker down for the night. I barricaded the door and checked for any zeds inside the general store, I found none. I put down my riot shield, and bat and sat on the ground, back against the wall. I sighed as I lifted my mask/helmet off my face, and wiped the sweat off with my hand. \"Day 85… ah fuck it,\" I said as I got out my water bottle and took a good chug from it. \"Still no signs of intelligent life, and still an unknown distance to southern U.S\" I took the time to fill up on any supplies that I found in the store and put it in my backpack, which I \"borrowed\" from a dead person. After doing so I checked outside to see if any zeds were outside, then I sat back down and drifted into an uneasy sleep. Time Skip I awoke to sound of glass breaking and someone yelling profanities. \"What the fuck,\" I thought as I got my mask on. I gathered my stuff and readied my Glock and shield. I cleared the door and went outside to check out the commotion. What I found slightly amused me. A man in a short- brimmed hat was currently going ham on a minivan with a crowbar. While a teen, I guess his partner, watched from the sides. I causally walked over to the teen and looked at him before looking back at the man. \"What is he doing?\" I asked the teen. \"Oh that just Tallahassee being Tallahassee,\" he replied. We stood in silence as we watched \"Tallahassee\" smash another window of the minivan. \"What is he ranting about?\" \"Oh just some girls just coned us out of our car and guns,\" \"And do you realize you're talking to a complete stranger, right?\" \"Yes, I- wait WHAT!\" He took one look at me before jumping and falling on the ground. \"Uh-uh-uh stay back,\" he said as he grabbed a piece of cardboard. 'I know how to use this,\" \"First off, you're holding a piece of cardboard, and second I'm not going to kill you,\" I said as I pulled the cardboard out of his hands. \"Besides, I'm a survivor just like you,\" \"R-r-really? But you look like a complete psychopath,\" \"Oh about that, you see the cleaners isn't open today so…\" \"Ug, never mind,\" he said as he got up. \"What your name son?\" I asked him. \"Columbus,\" he said. \"Sarge,\" I replied as I shook his hand.

I hope this story will make you very HAPPY! The farm in Zombieland Tallahassee knew that he was about to die. He had nothing left but his clothes he wore. His car and everything in there was stolen by a pair of girls while he was tumbling around the dusty fields with a bleeding chest. Never did he think that helping others would leave him betrayed. Ok, he always thought this but that's made it even less logical of why he helped them in the first place, maybe because one of the girls, Little Rock, was still a kid. And Tallahassee can't bear the thought of leaving a child behind who he could have helped. Buck would be happy for him. Because now the redneck was sure about meeting his little pup again very soon. He groaned when he walked into a grid fence and grabbed onto it. Could he climb over it? Those were the zombie proof fences. That made Tallahassee curse in desperation. \"Come on you shitty thing!\" He screamed, feeling his heart aching and his lungs flatter. His hands trembled as the shook the fence but it didn't budge. Tallahassee fell to his knees, panting heavily when his slumped to the ground and everything turned black. … It was night when he woke up. Tallahassee looked around and found himself in an attic which was illuminated by a desk lamp. Beside the bed he lay in, there was a bowl of vegetables and the man was about to reach for it when he stiffened and groaned in pain and fell back on the bed, pressing a hand on his chest. Only then did he notice that his shirt was missing. It was replaced by bandages around his chest. Slow and carefully Tallahassee sat up and reached for the veggies and ate till he got full. He yawned tiredly and went back to sleep. It was a very long day. … He blinked his eyes open when his hat was lifted. There was a shocked gasp and his hat fell back covering his eyes. \"What the-\", he spoke with a rough voice as he lifted his hat again to see a teen standing in the opposite corner of the room. She quickly tried to fix her short curly hair while picking on some spots of her dark blue sweater and her flowery dress. \"H-hello!\" she greeted loudly. \"Uh…\" the redneck mumbled. \"You…uh,\" she interrupted, blushing and curling a lock on her finger,\" I found you last evening by the fence. Uh, you were shot. I'm happy that I could help you.\" Tallahassee looked down at his chest. \"I got that bullet out of your chest!\" she suddenly spoke up, pulled said bullet out of her sweater and showed it to the man. \"I thought you would die but I read a book how to nurse someone or how to do improvised surgeries,\" she explained, slowly taking few steps towards him. \"And I'm happy that you survived…\" she said, her voice getting quiet as she looked at the bullet and quickly put it away again. It was quiet for a while and the girl spoke up again. \"Oh! You must be thirsty! Wait a sec, I'll get you some water!\" And with that she left the room quickly. After few minutes, she came back with a glass of water and gave it to him. Tallahassee saw that she combed her hair a bit and is that make up? Well, it looked cute on her. \"Thank you,\" he said and took the glass. \"Y-you're welcome,\" she replied, scratching her neck. \"My name is-\" \"No names. No names, no unnecessary attachments,\" Tallahassee interrupted, not seeing the hurt expression the girl made when he drank the water. \"My name is Tallahassee. From Tallahassee,\" the redneck smiled at her which was responded with a wide shy grin. \"I wanted to say my name is Columbus. My friends told me the same about the attachment thing.\" She chuckled awkwardly, walking to the window and watching out with the binoculars which stood by the windowsill. Tallahassee sat up and looked around again. \"Where am I?\" \"You're safe here. It's a little farm my friends and I found and we built it up to live here…well, I did.\" \"Where are your friends now?\" Tallahassee asked and cursed to himself. Who knew if her friends survived or died already? \"My friends are traveling around, fighting zombies and searching for more supplies. They come by few times a month,\" Columbus explained while she held her watch. \"And what about you?\" She looked over to him. \"What is about me?\" \"Why do they leave you behind?\" Columbus smiled at this. \"I can't fight as well as them but I can keep a lair quiet good and I like living here. They come back to bring some supplies for me while I tend their wounds, giving them a place to rest and prepare their stuff for their next adventure like food and clothes.\" She gasped, \"the clothes!\" Tallahassee watched Columbus running out of the room. The man slowly stood up and followed her. He walked down the stairs and watched her wringing out water of the washed clothes above a wooden tub and hanging them on a rope which was fastened by hooks on each corner of what seemed to be a living room. The room was very clean and domestic with a little radio standing on a little chair and a little TV on its wooden stand with a large couch standing opposite. Columbus wore gloves and a surgical mask all the while washing out the blood. \"That is your shirt here,\" she said, holding up his now half clean washed shirt and also hanged it up to dry. \"I can patch the hole up later on, if you are ok with it.\" He nodded and just watched her doing the laundry. After she finished the laundry, she pulled out a large old knitted sweater from a basket of ironed clothes, \"take this, no need to run around like this, r-right?\" She stuttered as she glanced at his chest. He smirked and took it, smiling as she gasped when their hands touched. \"Are you hungry?\" she asked, pulling off her gloves and surgical mask. Tallahassee nodded again and slowly followed her slowly to the kitchen. The room was just as bright and clean as the living room and most possibly the rest of the house. It was just like Columbus said, she was living here. He sat on one of three chairs as he watched the girl making dinner. \"I'm surprised how much this building is still functioning,\" he spoke up when Columbus pulled out some tomatoes from the fridge. She looked up surprised as well and blushed lightly as she explained,\" well, actually nothing but the water and the toilets here worked…I repaired it and some other stuff here…\" \"You did this?\" She nodded, a light nervously but still proudly smile on her lips. \"I read the instructions for installation and use and my friends brought me the supplies so I could repair it. It took months but it was worth it…\" \"That's amazing…\" Tallahassee said and Columbus blushed, turning around and chopping the tomatoes and putting them into the pan on the cooker. \"I also managed to repair the cooker but I'm still working on the oven…and the washing machine need some spare parts...\" Tallahassee whistled impressive. \"Still, good work you have done. I mean it.\" \"T-thank you…\" she said and opened the fridge again and pulled out a little plate with meat in it. \"Where the fuck did you get this? I thought everything animal-like it rotten already.\" \"Well, it is. But this farm here had a little chicken house when we found it and the chickens were all half-starved because they were locked up in there. I'm taking care of them now, just like I take care of the little garden in the back yard,\" she explained and watched Tallahassee staring at her. \"I…I can show you around if you like?\" … Two of the lucky ones - The droge & Summers Blend (Zombieland soundtrack) After the meal, Columbus showed her new guest around the house, telling him were which room was like the restrooms or bedrooms. She showed him her self-made little garden she managed to plant and harvest and also the chicken house with the little field, surrounded by a small fence, the birds were running around when outside. Tallahassee smiled excited as he watched Columbus feeding the chickens. She was dressed in dungarees, striped t-shirt, straw hat, gloves and boots, looking like the cliché farmer girl everyone knew of. He couldn't stop looking at her. Sometimes he chuckled as she always jumped frightened when one chicken started to flatter around or the rooster started to crow. \"I still feel very guilty when I have to…you know? When I have to cook meat…\" She whispered into his ears, not wanting the chickens to overhear her. \"Also, I was quite traumatized after my first time, couldn't look at them or sleep for weeks.\" Afterwards when she was watering the plants, she spoke up,\" I have to check on the fences later on. And you should rest for now. How about you go back inside and I'll check up on you later?\" Tallahassee normally would have protested. But instead he nodded, looked around, not seeing any fences but still slowly went back into the house, touching his chest carefully as he walked up the stairs. He watched her from the window when the girl climbed on her bike, he didn't know of, with a heavy bag on her back and drove away into the empty fields. The moon stood high when he heard the door close and soft steps climbing up the stairs. \"Tallahassee?\", Was whispered. \"I'm awake, don't worry, come in,\" he softly replied, lying in the bed, reading a book about how to correctly plant a veggie garden. He noticed that Columbus had many books of how to do things. The repairs of furniture in the house and fridges to wash machines to connecting the right wires to correctly treat animals to slaughtering chicken to managing improvised operations…that girl is quite prepared. Columbus quietly walked into the room, \"I wanted to ask if you need anything. Otherwise I would like to change your bandages.\" \"Of course,\" Tallahassee replied quickly, sitting up and hissing by his movements. Columbus was immediately by his side,\" Careful, no need to hurt yourself!\" \"Don't be stupid, it was nothing…\" he mumbled and took of the old sweater. Columbus walked away to get the first aid kit and came back. She blushed when she took of the bandages and cleaned his chest before bandaging him again with new ones. \"Why are you doing this for me?\" He asked suddenly and she looked at him surprised. \"You…you needed help?\" \"But I could have been a killer…or a psychopath who could take advantage of you right now.\" Columbus pulled her hands away,\" …are….are you?\" Tallahassee chuckled,\" No, at least not the psychopath thing. I'm quite good at zombie killing.\" The girl chuckled nervously and went back to bandaging him. \"It was like I said,\" she spoke up softly,\" I found you by the fences and you were bleeding badly. I…I couldn't let you die there…you weren't a zombie. I had to safe you…\" \"Thank you for that,\" he said and hugged her as she finished her work. She froze in shock and didn't move at all. Then she shoved him and squeaked an apology and quickly left the room. Tallahassee smirked knowingly and shook his head in amusement before he lay back down and went to sleep. … It was in the middle of the night when Columbus stormed into the room with a shotgun and slammed the window open. \"LET ME ALONE! GET LOST! PISS OFF!\" She screamed after every shot she made. Tallahassee could hear a car driving off. She cursed and stomped her foot. She cursed and slowly began to cry. \"Damn…\" \"What's wrong?!\" \"Burglars, don't worry.\" She hiccupped and walked out again,\" go back to sleep,\" she said. Tallahassee frowned and followed her out of the room. \"What are you doing?\" he asked confused as she put on her jackets and shoes. \"Those burglars were here. That means the fences are somewhere damaged. The house is damaged, I hope they had let the chickens alone…\" she explains as she went into the kitchen and pulled out the big bag. \"I have to…\"she wiped away her tears and yawned tiredly,\" …I have to repair the fences firstly. Zombies could be walking in here right now if I won't do it.\" \"I'll come with you,\" Tallahassee said firmly. \"Don't worry, I-\" \"That wasn't a question or did you hear me asking?\" He said seriously. \"It's dark out there and you won't see attackers soon enough to flee or fight in time. I'll come with you and watch your back.\" Columbus watched him carefully before she nodded. \"Ok, but this could take all night because I don't know where they came from. I can only guess.\" \"Ok, I'm in.\" It did take them all night. Tallahassee realized this night that Columbus built up a fence of 1 km radius around the farm with the help of her friends. Every morning and every evening, she took her bike and checked on the fences so to repair and close the holes if needed. Within the fences, the place was completely zombie free. \"Why taking so much space? Won't you have problems overlooking everything?\" Tallahassee asked yawning while holding the shotgun and watching out. Columbus was fixing the last reminders of the damaged fence when she replied,\" I know, but zombies come in large numbers and then with small space, the fences which meant to safe you could be your death. # 22 When in doubt, know your way out. With much space, you have a better way to escape and won't be trapped\" \"Well, normally I just kill them and then would be off.\" Columbus chuckled and stood up, clapping her dirty hands. \"I'm done, let's go home.\" She blushed and stared at him,\" I mean House! Let's get back to the house! It's not like you are about to live here with me- I mean live here at all! I just- I just thought-\" \"Don't piss your pants, I know what you mean,\" the man laughed and climbed on her bike, caring the bag on his back and with a furious blushing Columbus on his lap. He smiled at the thought. A home… … Tallahassee was living with Columbus for around two weeks. And around the two weeks, he helped her out in her chores. They both checked on the fences, while Tallahassee worked outside of the house, repairing the damages on the house, feeding the chickens and taking care of the plants, Columbus was cleaning the house and doing the laundry. They both were caught off guard when two cars were coming towards them and Tallahassee growled as he noticed one of them was his car. Columbus came running out, shouting in panic,\" quick! Hide in my room!\" \"What? Why!?\" \"My friends don't like it when strangers are here. They don't trust them! Now get into the house now!\" she explained and shoved him into the house. When Tallahassee hid in her room, the attic, where he could hear the girl talking to her friends. He growled angrily as he noticed the familiar voices of the two bitches who robbed him and almost killed him and stormed down. \"YOU!\" He screamed at them and was greeted with guns pointed at him by no other by the assholes of sisters with a horrified Columbus. \"Wichita! Little Rock! NO!\" Columbus shouted and stood between them and him. \"He's a friend!\" \"Columbus, how many times did we tell you to not just trust any tramp you find by the fences?\" Wichita sighed annoyed and Columbus blushed. \"I couldn't let him die! He is healthy!\" \"But he attacked us by our last travel!\" Little Rock snapped and Tallahassee glared at them furious. \"LIARS! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES TRICKED ME AND STOLE MY CAR!\" \" YOU ARE THE LIAR! \" Wichita screamed and was about to shoot when Columbus yelled angrily,\" STOP IT! EVERYONE TO THE KITCHEN! NOW! \" It was silence for a while and Columbus glared at them all, pointing to the room. Everyone huffed angrily and annoyed and followed her orders. The girls and the man sat on the chairs while Columbus silently cooked a little bag of rice and chopped her veggies, snapping at them to be quiet when someone opened their mouth. They looked at her carefully when she put them all a plate of a hot cooked meal with a glass of water for each one. \"I hope it tastes good. Now eat and be nice to each other. Then we talk what happened out there.\" Columbus said sternly and started to clean the pots and the knives she used for the cooking. There was a tense silence and the sisters and Tallahassee glared at each other while eating. \"Now, everyone full?\" Columbus asked as the plates were empty. \"Was it good?\" They all nodded quietly. Columbus nodded, took the plates, put them into the sink and then stood in front of the little group. \"Now, tell me what happened.\" The three quickly talked all at the same time and angrily pointed at each other while accusing and shouting at each other. \"So Wichita, you say that Tallahassee here attacked you while you both were searching for supplies and that you shot him to survive. Then you took his car.\" The girls nodded. \"And you Tallahassee, you say that the girls tricked you into a trap and then you were shot. Correct?\" \"Right,\" Tallahassee growled, glaring at the girls. Columbus was thinking, looking at each of them. \"I hope you accept my apology for their behavior, Tallahassee,\" Columbus spoke up and Tallahassee laughed at the frowning sisters in triumph. \"You believe him!?\" Wichita glared at Columbus. \"You think I'm stupid to not notice this, but I know you. You both have trust issues and there must be a reason. You betray others, that's how you yourself become more careful of others. I found Tallahassee shot by the fences. He was bleeding bad and almost died on me but I saved him. He told me earlier about girls who took his car and I'm sad. I'm really sad.\" With that, she left the room. The girls looked at Tallahassee. \"And? You fucked her?\" Wichita asked, narrowing her eyes at him. Tallahassee glared at her,\" no.\" Wichita smirked at him, \"well then, welcome to the team.\" He watched her confused and Little Rock spoke up, smiling,\" That means we are friends now. We could travel together and all that.\" The redneck nodded carefully. \"Ok?\" …. The girls rested for the rest of the three days, mostly spending time on the couch and watching movies while Columbus continued with her chores. Tallahassee frowned at them and continued helping the cute brunette in the household and all. He fixed his head and hid his eyes from Columbus who, this time in the nice weather, hang up the laundry on a rope between the house and the cars while he repaired the broken door by the chicken house. Why was he acting like that? He knew she had a cute face but never reacted like this before. He noticed her looking at him and both smiled at each other awkwardly before quickly going back to work. \"Don't they ever help you?\" Tallahassee asked while taking the small amount of mesh from Columbus and fixing a lightly ripped part of the fence with it. Columbus stood beside him with her shotgun and held watch. \"Well, sometimes they cook something or are ironing their clothes.\" Tallahassee sighed and shook his head. Poor girl. \"Well that sucks, but now, I'm part of your group and I will help you wherever I can.\" He said and smiled as she smiled brightly back at him. \"Thank you!\" … When the sisters made their car ready, Tallahassee made his last check up on his own car. To his relieve, they didn't took anything from it or changed it in any way. He watched Columbus coming out of the house and nervously walking up to him. \"H-hi…\" she said nervously. He noticed that she was wearing the flowery dress again, this time without the sweater. It looks very good on her. \"I…I would like you to give you this…\" she said giving him a little box. \"A lunch box?\" She blushed. \"Yeah, I made some for the girls too. Just that you have something while on your journey….\" \"Thank you, Columbus.\" She looked at her feet shyly,\" ah, no problem.\" She picked on her dress and looked up at him,\" I have made a list of supplies I still need. I know that the girls lose it most of the time and bring me the stuff they remember. I can trust you not to lose it?\" Tallahassee didn't notice himself taking of his hat and politely nodding. \"Of course, I try to get everything when we get back home.\" She smiled and gave him the list. He smiled back and put the list into his wallet his son and he made. \"Columbus? Can you come over here for a sec?\" Wichita called her and Tallahassee hated her for the interruption. While they talked quietly with each other, he annoyedly put his hat back on his head and closed the trunk. He walked over to Little Rock who was cleaning her guns. \"Want some help?\" He gave her some tips how to clean the weapons with less complication and less dirt on the hands when he saw Wichita hugging happily the brunette. She had a strange look on her face but hugged back nonetheless. \"Take care and have fun!\" She said with a shaking voice and quickly made her way into her house. \"What's wrong with her?\" Tallahassee asked worried, glancing at the older sister. She just sighed and explained with a sad expression,\" She came from Columbus from Ohio. I told her about the city. Looks like she didn't take it well.\" \"We should-\" he was interrupted by Wichita. \"No no. Let her. She needs some time alone.\" And with that said, they climbed into their cars, leaving the little farm. … Tallahassee found himself not enjoying the zombie killing like he used to. He only could worry about the distressed girl waiting for them to return. The sad girl, mourning for her lost home in Ohio. The redneck's only motivation to not go back now was the list she gave him. \"Hmm…garden tools, mushrooms (if possible), screws, bicycle tires, Operating instructions…\" he mumbled, walking through the bike shop, his blood smeared shovel on his shoulder. He stuffed it back in his pocket and grabbed four bicycle tires and left the shop. He watched the girls killing few zombies and walking back into the shop they came from. He put the tires into the back of his car and walked after them. \"And? Found anything?\" He asked them. The girls huffed annoyed by him and giving them orders. \"Come on, have a bit of fun, you sound like Columbus,\" Little Rock said and then spoke in a high pitched tone,\" iron the laundry, little Rock. Wipe the floor, Little Rock, you know I'm shitty afraid of dust.\" Wichita laughed and also imitated the brunette,\" don't bring clown masks home, clowns are creepy. Don't touch the food, we need it for future crisis,\" the girls laughed. \"Do you have found anything?\" Tallahassee growled angrily, glaring at them furious. They stopped laughing and sighed annoyed,\" No we didn't found anything on that stupid list.\" Tallahassee walked past them and searched for the mushrooms. The mushrooms he found where all smashed or ugly rotten and he sighed. He raised an eyebrow when he noticed something down the shop. He whistled and smirked when another zombie ran towards him. He held his shovel like a bat and smashed the dead's head into a bloody puddle. He panted lightly and walked down the shop to get to the thing he noticed before. Potatoes He found fucking potatoes. Columbus will kiss him when he comes back with them. He ignored his smile and heated cheeks and took all the bags (which were five in the end) and carried them back to his car. When nothing more was in the little town, he called the girls and told them they have to move on. The girls followed his order with some snappish remarks. And this went on for the next month. They sat by the fire in the evening and talking about anything which came to their mind. The list was completed and Tallahassee felt his heart flutter by the thought of returning. \"Well, I head to bed, I'm tired,\" Little Rock yawned and went to their car. \"I think I go for it too, or should I take first watch?\" The redneck asked and Wichita smiled at him,\" could you stay for a while?\" He looked at her confused but nodded. They sat there in silence and stared into the fire. \"I miss Columbus' lunch box. They are so delicious,\" Wichita sighed and leaned her head on her hand. Tallahassee chuckled. \"Yup, they are very good.\" \"But not as good as my cooking, if you ask me.\" He looked at her. \"I didn't see you cook back there at the farm.\" \"Yeah, but I do. I can make awesome pancakes…\" he noticed her moving closer to him. \"Do you know when my pancakes taste the best?\" He turned to her and their faces were just inches apart. A hand landed on his thigh and slowly moved up and down. It felt good and Tallahassee didn't stop her when she leaned in. She closed her eyes as she pressed her lips closer to his. Tallahassee closed his eyes and kissed back. Then he thought about Columbus. Columbus in that cute dress of hers. Columbus checking with him the fences. Columbus cooking the meal with that small smile of hers while humming the ghost busters. Columbus telling him she never went to her school dance because every boy she asked turned her down. Tallahassee remembered promising her the dance when he comes back from their journey. Columbus looking like about to cry after talking with Wichita and still forced a smile while saying them goodbye. He pulled away and held Wichita at arm's length. \"You told her that you want me.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Tallahassee stood up and took few steps away from her. \"Columbus. You told her that you were interested in me. You knew she wouldn't say anything against you.\" Wichita stood up and walked over to him, leaning in. \"Is that so wrong?\" Tallahassee growled and walked to his car. \"Come on, Tallahassee, don't tell me you have feelings for her?\" He turned around and gave her his crazy glare. \"What if I am?\" \"What does she do? She is sitting at home in safety while we are here in never ending danger.\" \"Just sit-you just didn't say that, I dearly hope for you that you just didn't say that.\" Wichita just shrugged. Tallahassee huffed aghast. He walked back to his car and started the machine. I was very happy that everything Columbus asked for was in his car and not in the girls' car. Wichita shouted angrily after him. She quickly packed the stuff around the fire and also started the car. Little Rock grumbled irritated but continued with her sleep. It took them two days to return. All the way back, Tallahassee ignored Wichita's approaching and only talked to her if needed. When they reached the fences, Tallahassee ordered them to drive to the farm while he checked on the fences. It was evening and maybe he could find Columbus then. No such luck it appears. At least the fences were all ok and he drove back. … \"Boyfriend-stealer?! You call ME a boyfriend-stealer?!\" Tallahassee heard from the house as he got out of the car. \"You KNEW I have a crush for him and told me that he has a thing for you! Of course I would believe it! You know about my insecurity! And still you wanted to take him away from me!\" It was Columbus. She was yelling with a croaking voice. Coughs were heard before she continued. \"Logically he should be MY boyfriend!\" \"Oh! You want to talk about logic!?\" Wichita yelled back but Columbus just continued. \"You tricked him, shot him and left him to die to steal his things! I found him, took him in, treated his wound YOU were the cause of it and saved his life!\" \"Ok, now listen to my logic you bitch!\" Wichita snapped angrily. Tallahassee actually felt his feet frozen to the ground while he simply stared at the front door. \"While you are living your cute live in your cute farm, WE are fighting out there! Against ZOMBIES! Every day could mean our death!\" \"And you think my life is safer than yours?!\" Columbus snapped. \"Well, WE don't have fences to protect us-\" \"-which happened to be checked twice a day by me and on every occasion when I'm on the roof top!\" \"Don't act like it's hard work-\" \"IT IS HARD WORK WHAT I'M DOING!\" It was silent for a while. \"Look at me Wichita! Look at me when I'm talking with you!\" The front door opened and Wichita stomped out, an angry Columbus covered in thick closes and covers on her heels. Little Rock was standing by the door, a very worried expression on her face. \"Every damn day, I am out and checking on the fences at six! This takes two hours! TWO HOURS! Afterwards I make me a quick breakfast and start to feed the chickens and water the plants! It's damn hard to keep them growing! I clean the house, do the laundry, I check on the machines as well as the power lines and water pipes! I repaired the fridge, I repaired the cooker! I repaired the shower I destroyed after you and Little Rock scared me with those shitty clown masks while I showered!\" Tallahassee slowly walked over to the younger sister and laid his hand on her shoulder as she sniffed lightly in guilt. \"LOOK AT ME WICHITA!\" \"OK! I LOOK AT YOU!\" She snapped back. \"But still you don't see it! I am sick with a heavy cold! When you and Little Rock came back having a cold, I treated you and cared for you! Now here I stand! Having a cold and still stand up at half six in the morning to make myself ready to spend two hours checking on the fences! Do you know how tired I am!? HOW DAMN TIRED I AM?!\" Wichita stared at her with wide eyes. Columbus panted, shivered from the cold and wrapped the covers tighter around herself. \"I'm…\" she started to wobble,\" …I'm tired…\" \"COLUMBUS!\" Wichita shouted frightened when the sick girl fell. ... \"She will get better. She was overworked and the stress was too much in the end,\" Tallahassee spoke carefully as he entered the living room. The girls sat silently on the couch. Little Rock was hiccupping, trying not to cry. \"Go to sleep. Tomorrow will be a long day.\" He said and the girls just went to bed. Tallahassee sighed and made his way out to get the stuff they brought into the house. Afterwards he made himself comfortable on the couch and went to sleep. … It was half six in the morning when Tallahassee came to the girls room. \"WAKEY WAKEY!\" He shouted cheerily loud as he pulled the covers away from them. Both groaned tiredly and glared at the intruder. \"It's not even eight, why are you here?\" Wichita mumbled, hiding her head beneath the pillow. \"Columbus needs to rest. That means that we take over her chores.\" The girls went silent and then stood up without protests. \"Can we at least have some breakfast?\" \"Firstly, we check on the fences, now get dressed, I'm waiting down stairs.\" … The girls were about to get into the car when Tallahassee took away the keys. \"Hey!\" \"Columbus doesn't have the car. She uses this while carrying this.\" With that, he pointed at the bike and held up the heavy bag of mesh and tools. … \"Aren't we finished now? We checked most of this. Columbus never checked everything out…\" Wichita whined half hearty, dragging the bag on the floor and whining when Tallahassee took it from her and lifted it on his own bag. Little Rock yawned tiredly while sitting on the bike and following the other two. \"Nope. We're gonna check everything.\" They met a Zombie somewhere by the gates trying to push itself at the fence; one arm came through a little hole. Tallahassee shot the zombie down twice like Columbus told him to and gave the girls the bag while opening the gate. \"I come back shortly,\" he said and pulled the corpse away from the fence to the next tree and burned it into ashes with the lighter he had with him. \"Now repair the damage,\" he told them and pointed at the little hole the zombie managed. The girls opened the back and started discussing how to do it right. After five minutes of failed trying, Tallahassee took their tools away and nudged them away and repaired it. The girls watched him guiltily. \"It would take all day if we do it in your pace. Now move on, we're almost finished.\" After almost three hours, they were back at home and the girls fell back on the couch. \"I'm exhausted…\" Little Rock whined. \"Good morning….\" They heard from the stairs and Tallahassee quickly stopped Columbus from going further. \"Go back to bed,\" he said sternly. \"But…how about I make breakfast and-\" \"Wichita and Little Rock were about to do it, now go to your room and take your rest.\" Tallahassee said calmly. Columbus watched him worriedly. \"Maybe I could-\", she started but by then, the redneck lifted her up bridal stile and brought her to her room. \"Today is your day off. I deal with everything today. Don't you worry, if you can't sleep, hear some music from the radio, watch a movie or read a book about a knight fighting a dragon. Today you won't do anything related to your chores. Understood?\" Columbus blushed but nodded with an shy smile before she coughed heavily. \"Good. The girls will make some breakfast and I bring you some tea, how's that?\" \"Tha-\" *COUGH!* \"Thank you…\" Tallahassee nodded and left the room after she was safely placed in her bed and under many covers. … \"Shitshitshit!\" Little Rock cursed as she burned down the eggs. Wichita also cursed her bad luck as she noticed that the fridge is having a break down. \"Shit!\" Tallahassee came downstairs and prepared the tea. \"Tallahassee! Help us!\" Little Rock pleaded as the almost black eggs hissed in the pan. The man just looked at them and turned back to the water pot. \"No can do. Columbus is too sick to do anything right now.\" The girls looked guiltily at him again and Little Rock finished her burned breakfast while Wichita tried to fix the fridge. In the end, Tallahassee fixed the fridge with few tricks which Columbus showed him and Wichita and Little Rock gulped down their ruined food while the redneck went upstairs again to bring Columbus his self-made breakfast with tea. … \"Don't be too harsh to them Tallahassee…\" Columbus sniffed as she sneezed into her tissue before she nibbled at the cucumber. The man watched her fondly while she sipped her tea and slowly ate the eggs he made for her with chopped veggies. \"They have to learn their lesson. This is not over yet. We have yet to feed the chickens, take care of the plants and clean the house. You will see, by the end of the day, you will get the respect you deserved from the beginning. Columbus coughed again and sniffed again before smiling at him weakly. \"Thank you,\" she croaked out. Tallahassee smiled back, lifting his hat and putting it on her head. \"Take care of it, by the end of the day I want it back,\" he winked and left the room, leaving a blushing and giggling Columbus behind. \"Wait!\" she called and coughed. Tallahassee turned back. \"I…could you take care of the plants?...\" He nodded and left. … Wichita was scrubbing the floor in the house while Little Rock fed the chickens. Tallahassee worked on loosening the soil and watering the plants and then checked on the girls. He helped here and there and by the evening, he dragged them along to the fences again. It was past midnight when they returned. \"Ok, today is done. Go to sleep now, I'll wake you up in the morning.\" \"Where are you going now?\" Wichita asked as she headed to her room. Little Rock was already in her own room, changing for bed. \"I want to see how Columbus is doing,\" Tallahassee answered, stopping by the stairs. Wichita nodded and glanced at her feet. \"Can I see her?\" Tallahassee didn't answer and went up the stairs, smiling to himself. … He quietly opened the door and sighed as he saw Columbus sleeping with the Night lamp on and a Book *How to treat ill animals* in her arms. The redneck silently walked over and put the book away, fixed her covers and was about to turn down the lamp when Wichita stood by the door. \"Can I be with her for a while?\" She whispered. He looked at the sleeping girl and nodded once before leaving the room. Of course he didn't leave completely but stood behind the closed door. \"Columbus? Columbus, are you awake?\" Wichita whispered and Tallahassee could hear the sleeping girl groaning as she woke up. \"Wichita?\" \"Hi…\" \"…hi…do you…do you need something? Should I-\" \"No, don't worry, lay down….how are you?\" Columbus chuckled and coughed before she answered weakly,\" I'm fine, I think…tired…\" Wichita chuckled softly. It was quiet for a while. \"I'm sorry Columbus…for everything I said to you…\" \"It's ok, Wichita-\" \"No it's not!\" She spoke a bit too loudly. She sighed,\" We did today's chores and Little Rock and I are totally knackered. And thinking about you doing this every fucking day without protesting or whining and even taking care of us while we are here…Thank you for all this, Columbus. I'm sorry that we took it as granted what you do. Little Rock is sorry too, but she's asleep right now I think.\" After a pause, she continued,\" and I'm really sorry that I told you that Tallahassee had a thing for me. That was a lie. And I'm sorry for calling you boyfriend steal-\" \"Shshsh…Wichita, shsh…it's ok. Everything is ok…I forgive you…\" Columbus said softly when Wichita's voice began shaking. Tallahassee guessed they were hugging right now. It was silent once more when out of nowhere, Wichita said, \"Can I kiss you?\" \"What?\" Came the surprised voice from Columbus. Tallahassee's eyes widen and he leaned to the door to hear correctly. \"I want to kiss you,\" Wichita definitely said. \"But…my sickne-\" Tallahassee could imagine Wichita laying a finger on Columbus' soft lips. \"Let it happen…\" \"Wichita! Where are you touching me!\" \" What is going on here?!\", Tallahassee snapped and stormed into the room, only to see Wichita smirking at him, standing beside the bed. Columbus was blushing and giggling. That's when Tallahassee realized that he was tricked and blushed furiously, quickly leaving the room. He blushed even more when he heard Wichita laughing,\" See that? That's the proof that he is totally into you…\" … A week passed before Columbus was healthy enough to do some work. Still, she was very happy that the girls helped her where they could and even showed them like she showed Tallahassee few tricks of how to solve some problems. Tallahassee smiled as he watched Columbus explaining Little Rock on how to treat the plants when she noticed the strange flowers. \"What is that?\" She asked. \"Oh, just some potatoes I buried here. I hope I did it right…\" Tallahassee spoke up as he walked over to them. Columbus smiled brightly and jumped at him, giving him a kiss on the cheek. He hugged her back and they enjoyed this moment. … Since that day, they were officially a couple. And Tallahassee tried to make it clear every time when other survivors traveled by….which recently happened to be more often than previously. At least they won't break through the fences anymore but with the help of the redneck, they managed to contact others with the help of the car's radio. In this one year, more and more people started to visit and few began to stay. A little family of parents and a little son even came with a cow in tow. The little farm Columbus managed to run on her own for so long, slowly turned into a small farmer village. People helped them with the growing fields, the animals, the fences. Columbus helped them with the build ups of new homes, of course with the help of her strong boyfriend (Tallahassee still heard her giggle when she called him that and can only grin in reply). And somehow, the redneck really didn't know how that happened, Tallahassee and Columbus became the leaders of the growing group of survivors. Less and less zombies where walking around and they found more survivors every day. The world seemed to heal again. … Tallahassee felt bad when he and the girls made themselves ready to travel on, but Columbus cheered him up with a kiss and reassured him that she wasn't alone anymore with the other people around. \"But! But!\" He protested and he was sure that she noticed him glaring at that young man, building up a little bakery shop with the help of his father. \"Don't worry, Tallahassee,\" she chuckled and put her arms around his neck to catch his attention. He put his arms around her body. \"I only have my eyes for you,\" she smiled and he smiled back, leaning in and kissing her softly lips. He really felt bad when traveling on to find more supplies or killing zombies. It meant that he is leaving home. But this journey will be his last anyway. . . . For his last mission is to find the perfect ring for a certain girl. ","Summary":" Happy Birthday PyqaFanGirl! I hope this story will make you very HAPPY!

The Hudson River is near Battery Park on the southern tip of Manhattan Island. I have a 12 year old boy with me named Ethan. Ethan and I feel lucky to be alive after what seemed like a nuclear bomb explosion. There is no sign of life as I peek out the crack of light coming through the boarded up window. The only sound you hear is maybe a \"church\" mouse. We gather our backpacks and escape from the warehouse. As it turns out, every human being has been killed by some type of biological warfare; bacteria, a germ, most likely a virus. Are we really the only two people alive? While in New York City, Ethan and I had stayed with Dr. Robert Neville. I never understood how Neville maintained his sanity. When the Vamps came out by night there was the constant threat of death. Finding a medical cure for the mutant disease that created the Vamps was his only focus. When he died, I felt that Ethan and I would die. We were under attack by Vamps in his basement laboratory. I remember a loud explosion. A New Ally Hours later, we left the walk-in safe by daylight. We headed west in search of a safe place to take a rest. We checked lots of doors. It's easy to tell which first floor stores have an unlocked door. Obvious signs of a disturbance are inside, yet there are no broken windows or beaten down doors. We found what once was a vape and hookah shop, and entered. Ethan wasn't saying anything. I felt he must be in shock. We entered the store and went behind the counter and told him to lie down on the couch. \"We are safe here. It's daytime and this is one of millions of places,\" I said. I went back to the front of the vape shop and opened the envelope from Dr. Neville. Inside was the vaccine test tube of blood, and a syringe. Also in the envelope was a small piece of paper. It said, Rocky 726 West 57th. This was more hopeful than the syringe and a tube of blood. This was meant to guide me to a friend. I stashed it in my coat pocket. I also happen to find a few beef jerky which I shoved in my mouth. I then went back to where Ethan was sound asleep. In no time, I passed out too. After dark I woke Ethan. \"I have a journey for us.\" Eventually he sat up. I fed him crackers and canned beans. I also grabbed a can of spam for the road. He looked at me clueless. I asked him to please say something. \"Anna,\" she said. Our journey was south by about 3 miles. It occurred to me that Rocky might no longer be there. Nothing was for certain. When we reached 57th Street we only had to go east a few blocks from the corner. At the address we found a three flat apartment building. We walked up to the entrance, but the big steel door was locked. Nothing I could see inside through the window of the building looked out of place. We found a tire iron on the street and used it to bang against the metal door, hoping to get Rocky to answer the door. A half hour of banging and waiting didn't get an answer. Surely Rocky was still there if the outer walls of the three flat were standing. There was a garage door behind the building, and we found a key pad with three buzzers. I pushed one that worked and rang a loud buzzer which I could hear inside of the door. I rang and rang. Nothing. Finally, I decided to throw a rock at a window. The rock bounced off the window! I threw a second rock and it went through the window leaving a golf ball size hole, but did not shatter the glass. We walked around the front of the apartment but daylight was running out, and an hour later we found ourselves back out on 57th Street. We stared at the big steel door. Now something moved on the inside front window. From behind the window we saw a man with long brown hair wearing overalls. As he came to the front door I pressed the paper with his name and address against the glass. He looked at it, then looked at me. After what seemed like forever, he pointed toward the door. \"This way,\" he said, as he walked quickly in the direction from which he had come, and in seconds the front of the apartment was as lifeless as it was when we arrived. Once in the dark interior of the apartment hallway, Rocky turned to us. \"Who told you to come here?\" \"Dr. Robert Neville,\" I said. \"How is Neville?\" I was silent. \"I see. Dead,\" said Rocky. \"Are there others with you?\" \"No,\" I replied. \"Come upstairs,\" he said, and pressed the button for the elevator, which shined light. Yea electricity! \"I'll explain,\" he said. We arrived at the 3rd floor. As we walked down the hall he took a key from his pocket, and he inserted it into the door marked 0307. \"I have to do something before it begins to get dark, but I will return in an hour. Use the bathrooms now. Eat something. Make yourselves at home. I would return sooner but when I turn the power off I have to walk all the way up from the sub-basement.\" He showed us the kitchen with a candle. \"Anything you want,\" he said. \"I have to go. The sun won't be up much longer.\" He turned to us as he was about to leave. \"I used to be the engineer of this building. I heard you ring the buzzer.\" Then the door shut and locked. We cleaned up and ate like there was no tomorrow. An hour later, Rocky came back. The building was dead silent now. We then took the time to introduce ourselves on how we had known Neville. Then Rocky spoke. \"I've been here a year. For another year I may be able to keep the electricity on. Then I run out of batter storage life. Everything runs on solar power, batteries only last so long. I live on canned foods and bottled water. At night everything has to be dark and quiet. The Vamps must never see light coming from here, or sense even the slightest sign of life when they go by. Tonight, you can both sleep in the extra bedroom on this floor and be in as safe a place as there is.\" That was the end of our day. In the morning Rocky was sitting on a window ledge. There were fires and smoke in the street. Rocky was about sixty something in age. He sported a scruffy beard and had bad knees. He had stopped caring about appearances. I have something to tell him. \"Dr. Neville gave me a package before he left us that contains a vaccine.\" \"Vaccine?\" \"For whatever created these vampires,\" I told him. \"He assured me that it turned Vamps back into humans.\" \"You carry it with you?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" \"Then there can't be much,\" he said. \"I have to figure out what to do.\" \"Can we make more?\" \"You and the kid stay put for a while. Rest up for awhile. I'll give you a room to hang out in across the hall.\" \"What is your plan?\" I asked. \"My plan is to be as careful as I can today, and to be in the same safe way at the end of the day tomorrow. Beyond that, I don't know. There is just today and tomorrow.\" The sun shone brightly when the three of us left the apartment later that morning. The hallway was dark. Holding a candle, he said, \"You would never believe how many candles some people have in their apartments.\" He took us down to the second floor, and showed us how he had gone through all three apartments and took anything worth saving. \"When I use things up or get them dirty, I put them out in the garage, which I use as a garbage dump. I don't want to leave garbage behind everywhere. I have to keep some kind of order here,\" he said. We went outside to see the garage used as a garbage dump. \"Nothing goes out the apartment windows,\" he said, \"even though that's tempting. No one can know we are here.\" Planning One night Rocky and I sat at the window facing the sunset side and the city was dark except for a few fires. The sky was haze filled. I told him, \"I need to do something with the vaccine. Neville sacrificed himself for it. I can't ignore that.\" \"Anna, is there anything you can do with it?\" asked Rocky. \"No, nothing. It makes no sense to consider it. There is one other option. We can try to leave the City.\" \"And go where?\" asked Rocky. \"Farmington, California. They say there is a colony of survivors like you, Ethan and me there. I'm told it's a self-sufficient organic ranch compound. The location is totally off the grid. Maybe they have some smart people who can do something with it.\" \"How will you get to California?\" he asked. \"Help me find a way. Come with us.\" Rocky was silent. The next day we sat at Rocky's window and watched as fires burned on the east side of the City. Rocky said that in the garage across the alley there are two solar powered cars. A Tesla Model S and a BMW X5 SUV, but he didn't know how he would find the fob keys and he didn't know if they would start since they had not been in the sun to collect energy to make them run. The solar panels on the car windows collect its energy from the sun. The solar windows on the car store energy in the batteries which are in the bottom half of the trunk. \"We will go out there tomorrow and see what we can find,\" he said. \"And you will come with us when we go?\" I asked. \"It never occurred to me to leave.\" The Garage Next morning Rocky walked to the sub-basement to turn the electric power on, and brought the elevator up to get us. Out in the garage Rocky went to look over the condition of the car and SUV that had been sitting for well over a year. We would try every door to see if any were unlocked, and if so, was there a key fob in the ignition? Over the visor? Under the mat? Or, tossed on the front seat? We finished checking the doors, both vehicles had key fobs, and only one car barely had enough power to start when we tried it. We started the car and moved it outside in the sun to store up energy. Minutes later, Ethan's scream brought Rocky and me running back into the garage. Ethan had found a dead body inside the other car. We quit after that. The next day we used a flashlight to check for more bodies. We found one more body under some blankets. It smelled so bad, all three of us almost puked! Rocky almost coughed up a lung! On the next day, Rocky told me that he would go to the garage alone to \"clean up.\" Ethan and I would stay upstairs with maps and telescopes, and look for the best routes out of the city. The next day we all took a break from doing work. Ethan was more talkative than normal. Rocky was quiet again. We looked at all the best routes out of the City once more. The best option seemed to be the Lincoln Tunnel which was only 10 blocks from where we were. The tunnel went under the Hudson River into New Jersey. The dark tunnel kept us from being able to see its condition clearly, but Rocky and I decided that we could go see the tunnel with our solar powered flashlights. Rocky wore a miner's hard hat that shined a light a long distance. The next evening Rocky said, \"I have an idea. I will spend tomorrow and maybe the next day getting both cars ready. When we are ready to go, we will pack up the car or SUV that gives us the best chance to hit the road.\" \"Have you decided to go with us?\" I asked. \"Let me tell you my plan. I'll take our first or second choice of car for a test run during the morning. If I can get through the tunnel to New Jersey and come back, I'll return immediately, and we'll change cars and we will go. If the tunnel isn't clear, we start over another day. But I think if the tunnel is open, or if it's not, I should be with you. All three of us escape as one unit.\" I spoke. \"Everything seems clear until we actually have to do it. I feel like I have asked so much of you already.\" \"Let me be the judge of that. I want to do this in the morning,\" he said as he left. Escape In the morning we got ready. He was going with, and there was no further discussion. Out to the garage he went. Ethan and I put together our game plan. We had packed water and crackers in our backpacks. Ethan fell asleep on the floor, and I was worried looking out at the tunnel entrance through the telescope. Rocky decided to take the BMW allowing him to do a test run. He had the Tesla ready if he returned with word that we needed to navigate through tight spots, and to move quickly. Next morning we put everything in the garage that we were taking with us. We waited. When Rocky returned we would then know which car we were to pack up. We had things timed so that we would be able to run upstairs and back down in time to open the garage door for him. On the 3rd floor we ran down the hall, and Ethan plastered himself against the window. My eye was glued to the sight on the telescope. In very little time the BMW was coming back. I jumped up and grabbed Ethan. We planned 2 minutes of get away time. The elevator was slow like a dormitory one. We should have taken the stairs, but we had too much shit to carry. Rocky was shaking big time. He jumped out of the car; put his hands to his face. He finally spoke. \"We are going for it! We need the fast and narrow car, the Tesla. There is a car in the tunnel stalled that is sort of blocking the exit into New Jersey. The BMW is too wide to make it through. Load up the Tesla.\" Ethan threw our things in the Tesla. I placed the vaccine inside the glove box. Rocky put an extra car battery on the floor behind the driver's side. Ethan wrapped himself up in a comforter in the back seat. Rocky started the car. He hit the garage door button to open the door. No power. Rocky got out of the car and opened the door by hand. We took off like a rocket! Even at midday my fear of Vamps was still on my mind. We sped the ten blocks to the tunnel, avoiding the wreckage that was in the streets. We hit the tunnel at full speed and only when we got halfway inside did Rocky slow down. Up ahead was a car stopped at an angle on the right side of the tunnel at the exit. We would have to move the car a bit. Rocky slowed his speed, and when he got close he bumped the red Mustang, and then he slowly tried to move it. The Mustang would not move. The car had been sitting a long time. The tires were flat. Rocky backed up, and put the Tesla in low gear. He pushed the car, and it moved, but then our wheels began to spin. Again we backed up. We again pushed the car forward. The next push moved the car just enough to get past it, and Rocky pushed the gas pedal to the metal as we barely fit past the Mustang. As we moved forward, one side of the Tesla scraped against the Mustang. Minutes later we turned on the New Jersey Turnpike, I-70 west, heading due west across 10 states, and over 45 hours of drive time. Since our car only runs on solar power energy, we can only travel in daylight. Five hours of daylight remain, and if our luck holds out, we will arrive in about six days to Farmington, California with the vaccine. Final destination is Range Hill Ranch. Will they or won't they welcome us as family to the Ranch? Is there the possibility of a cure?

Please leave any constructive criticism you have for me. So let us begin the story. I do not own Z-Land just my OC. My name is Rouge. Well, that's the name he gave me. And by \"he\" I mean my cousin. And…. You know what let me start over from the beginning. I was heading over to my cousin's dorm when I saw someone eating another person. Now I don't scare or get grossed out easily so I didn't have much of a problem looking at take out meal someone is eating. I didn't stay there for a while because then I would be suspicious, so I just kept walking to my cousin's dorm. Now I am 17 and it's just me going to visit him. That says a lot about our family. We were the ones that didn't \"come out right\". So we have a better relationship to each other than anyone else on our family. I finally made to my cousin's dorm and before I even knock the door swings open and he has a small, carry-on luggage bag with him. \"Going somewhere?\" I ask him. \"Uh yeah we are leaving. My neighbor ran in here last night and she was scared so I let her in and spend the night and when she woke up she tried to eat me.\" He explains in his really girly, high pitched worried voice. \"She tried to eat you? No way! I saw someone eating someone else on my way here. I didn't think much of it. I just thought it was normal I don't know how you guys roll here so, yeah.\" He had this look of worry, terror, confused and slightly amused. \"Ok well we need to get out of here!\" He says. \"Well why don't we stay here until things die down a bit and then haul ass back home?\" I suggest. \"No, we need to get out now before those things multiply and people go ape shit crazy.\" He explains quickly. \"Ok sounds good we need a car though.\" \"Where's your car?\" \"You mean the piece of shit car that I have been working on for about 2 years that mom and dad suggested would be good for me?\" He nods. \"It's out front a few blocks down.\" We got to the car and left. We were driving for a while when we came across an abandoned town. We decided to check what was in the town and found a gun shop. I took some hand guns and shot gun that we sawed off. We raided houses for food and other things we needed. This went on for a while when finally the car broke down and I had to say good bye to the worthless piece of shit I call my car. It took about a week to find a new one. So we were on our way to Columbus, Ohio to see if our rents were still alive. It has been 2 months and we are in Garland, Texas which looks like it was shitty before zombies destroyed it. My cousin is dropping the kids at the pool while I check the little gas station shop for food. I'm about to pick up some Code Red Mountain Dew when I hear a gunshot. I rush outside and I see my idiot cousin running with 2 zombies on his ass. I decide not to help him out and walk to the car and sit down. He runs by and drops the keys. The second time he comes by he noticed that it was unlocked and hops in. We lose the 2 that were after him but of fucking course there was one in the back. It grabs ahold of him and he slams hit foot on the gas, which causes us to crash into a flower shop. The force from the crash sends the zombie out the window and into the flower shop window. We then see the zombie climb out of the window. \"Mother fucker\" We say at the same time. \"How the fuck is it still alive?\" I ask. \"Just shoot it!\" He yells. \"No you got this one.\" I say with a big smirk on my face. He shoots it once in the shoulder which isn't enough, so he gets out and shoots it one more time. \"I'm driving.\" I say the second he gets back in the car. \"Well you won't be driving it for long because are almost out of gas and the window is brock.\" \"WHAT! The window is BROKEN! Oh My Gosh! Who would have fucking guessed that the window is broken!?\" I yell with sarcasm. \"Just get out of the car and into shotgun. I really don't give any fucks that the window is broken.\" I say as I am getting out. I walk past him and he smells like shit. \"Why the fuck do you smell like shit?\" I ask. \"Well I didn't get to go to the bathroom…so.\" He explains. \"Well, have fun sitting in it until the car is empty because I'm not stopping for you to change so rill down the windows.\" We get as far as the beginning of the freeway where I leave him to change out of his soiled pants which I happily burn. We are about 15 minutes into the walk when we here a car. We stop and look and we see a black Cadillac driving towards us. My cousin, being the idiot that he is decides to run away and hide. I just walk very calmly to where he has set up a motorcycle as a shield waiting for the driver to get out. The driver of the car gets out and is wearing a cowboy hat and boots, a dark purple V-neck, and a black leather jacket. My cousin is shaking so bad that it looks like he is going to piss himself. About 2 minutes in their little showdown my cousin raises the hitch hiker symbol. Which the guy nods his head to. \"You are so fucking stupid.\" I say as I get into the back seat of the car.

Even though we are four of the only people we know to exist on earth, Krista and I are not exactly in a hurry to repopulate. Don't get me wrong, she's amazing, and I fucking love her, but pregnancy- not to mention, babies- are messy, scary, and have a lot of needs. This doesn't exactly mesh with our current life style, which is mostly hit and run. That is, hit zombies with our car, and run. So, we were fine for the first few weeks, she had some condoms, and it wasn't like we had a lot of free time to do it with her twelve year-old sister around and Tallahassee just being himself. However, after a few covert hookups, we were running perilously low. Whenever we passed through towns, we always stocked up on ammo, but I hadn't anticipated having this much luck in my entire life. We were driving through Portland when Krista punched me in the arm and jerked her head at Tallahassee in the driver's seat. \"Hey, man.\" I cleared my throat awkwardly. \"Dude, we're totally out of Purell. Can you drop me and Wichita near a drug store?\" \"Sure, but what do we do while y'all are gettin' hand sanitizer?\" He raises his eyebrows at me and looked over at Little Rock, drowsing in the front passenger seat. \"We passed a gun range a few miles back, you can circle around and have a little fun.\" Wichita said calmly. She had gotten a lot better at negotiating with the others as we learned how to work together. Rule #2 of Having a Girlfriend in Zombieland: Let her do the talking. Krista woke Little Rock gently before we climbed out of the car. \"We're going shopping. You cool going shooting?\" \"Sure.\" She shrugged and yawned. \"Y'all have a good time 'shopping.'\" We watched them pull away and started walking down main street, on out guard for zombies. \"She really isn't just twelve, huh?\" \"You have to think of her as aging in zombie years.\" Krista said, laughing a little. \"For every month, two years.\" \"Well that makes her-\" I think for a second. \"Nearly eighteen.\" \"Baby sister's all grown up.\" She smiled at me, and my stomach flipped. I got that we were likely the last people on earth and all, but I never forgot how lucky I was. That was something you had to keep reminding yourself as the days passed: We were only alive because of moderate skill and pure dumb luck. We turned our attention back to our surroundings, looking at every object with unveiled suspicion. Another good thing about living in Zombieland: no need to act on social cues. If you thought there were zombies around a corner, you could give that corner your worst death stare. The street was deserted, so we let our guard down to amber alert, and looked around. A CVS was across the street from us, and we jogged over, still checking the area out suspiciously. The automatic doors swung open, surprising us momentarily. \"Back-up generators.\" We said simultaneously. We'd gotten used to occasionally running into working electronics. We entered the store, and she shot one of the cash registers, which made a loud noise, followed by a bell, and sprung open, showering us in money. When I was feeling contemplative, I meditated on the value we gave to pieces of paper, and how little that mattered in our new world, but at that moment in particular, I was annoyed by the lack of visibility. \"Shit.\" Krista said, summarizing my thoughts. But no one came. I saw a dead man behind the counter, holding a small hand-gun, half of his face intact and the rest of him completely torn up. Though I'd gotten used to carnage, seeing other people completely destroyed tended to ruin being alone with my girlfriend. \"Hey,\" She took my hand. I looked away from her. \"It's okay.\" \"No,\" I said, clearing my throat. \"It's not. I should be used to it. I've shot people in the face. I killed Bill Murray. I shouldn't-\" \"Yes, you should.\" She said fiercely. \"Because you're still human. I wish, sometimes that I was more like you. When I see him-\" She looked straight at the corpse. \"-all I see is a body.\" We stood there in silence for a moment before beginning to take stock of the store. She tackled the makeup aisle- her one indulgence was eyeliner. My priorities lay with the medical supplies. While none of us, again, by sheer luck, had been bitten by zombies, one of my main rules was to be prepared for contingencies, and scrapes, bruises and cuts all had the potential for infection. I kept a careful supply of antibacterial ointment, bandages, gauze, and painkillers. Since the sisters had joined our little crusade, I added tampons to my list. Little Rock was too young, but Wichita was incredibly grateful. Rule #3 of Having a Girlfriend in Zombieland: Keep track of her cycle. It's not creepy, it's practical. We covered most of the store in fifteen minutes, but the 'Family Planning' section had already been picked over. This was disappointing, but also weird. Why is the section with condoms called 'Family Planning?' Our plan was not having a family. Krista sighed. \"I guess we can walk down the street, see if there's anywhere else?\" I nodded and we left the drug store, still on the lookout for the undead. We wandered down the street for a half an hour, and the only zombies we saw were on the ground. We jumped over pools of blood like rain puddles, and looked around the streets of Portland. \"Wow,\" Krista summarized, nodding her head. \"They were right about this city. It's weird.\" She was not wrong. There was a yarn store right next to a trendy boutique selling sweaters, and a calligraphy store, and a store that seemed to only sell accessories for kittens. \"Yeah.\" I concurred. We walked for another ten minutes, passing weird, niche-market store after store, until we reached one that was exactly what we were looking for, between a store that would embroider your name on anything, and a seedy diner. It was called 'The Ball and Chain' and the window itself was a sight. The neon sign was dark, but a mannequin wearing a leather bra and panties and holding a riding crop was perfectly visible. Krista turned toward me, and smiled, and we opened the door, entering with a clang of the bell on the knob. The store was somewhere I wouldn't have entered if you had paid me before the civilized world had ended. It was a place I imagined to have been occupied by blue-haired, pierced and tattooed chicks, who I'd be simultaneously attracted to and afraid of. We looked at the store like an odd museum, full of artifacts of a more frivolous era. There was a fine layer of dust over everything, dildos the size of cucumbers with five different moving parts, lacy bondage gear, handcuffs in every possible pattern, and, at the back of the store, barriers. Literally everything I had ever seen in health class, and a few items I couldn't identify. Rule #4 of Having a Girlfriend in Zombieland: Let her take the lead. Krista leaned forward, and analyzed the wall of contraception. She carefully selected a few different packages, and slid them into her pockets, before reaching for the condoms. \"Don't put those in a pocket.\" I said rapidly, interrupting her. She turned towards me, as if concerned that I had recently contracted turrets suddenly. \"Why?\" She asked, patiently. \"Because temperature effects them, they won't work if they get warm.\" I said, quieter. She gave me a little smile. \"Smart.\" She grabbed a handful of condoms and gave them to me, letting me put them away in my carry-on. Then, she grabbed another from the wall and I pushed myself up onto the checkout counter and pulling down my pants. She ripped open the wrapper and plucked out the circle of latex. Rule #5 of Having a Girlfriend in Zombieland: When you have an opportunity, go for it. We all know you live and then you die, and you get eaten, so make the most of alone time in deserted sex shops.

There's barely a chance for a quick fuck or hand job here and there when they're safe enough, but there's not much time for any romance. Tallahassee doesn't exactly seem like the romantic type anyway, not that Columbus blames him. In the order of stab, run, kill, shoot, and repeat, there's not much room for flowers and chocolate, unless you're Tallahassee apparently. That's why Columbus is shocked when he comes out from the bathroom in the hotel they've crashed the night in to find flowers on the night stand and a box of mint chocolates next to them. He recognizes the flowers from the patch of overgrown flowers out front. Tallahassee is standing next to the stand, obviously had just set the flowers in the cup. He has a slightly sheepish look on his face at being caught in the act. \"Happy Valentine's Day, Jaymie.\" Tallahassee has guessed his real name a few days ago, it's a kind of long standing game they have going. \"Technically it was yesterday, but we weren't safe then.\" \"Robert.\" \"Nope.\" \"How do you even know what day it is? Carl.\" It's not like much need to keep track. \"You have your note book, I have mine. No.\" Jaymie walks over to him and loops his arms around Tallahassee's waist and leans against him. \"I didn't really take you for the Valentines type. Conner.\" \"I can be romantic when I want to be. No.\" Tallahassee settles his hands on Jaymie's hips to pull him flush. \"Is that so? Steven.\" He nips the taller mans jaw, who rumbles and tips his head to expose his neck. \"Mhmm. No.\" Jaymie bites and sucks at the newly exposed neck. \"Your not so slight oral fixation is showing.\" \"I've never heard you complain about it before.\" \"I'm not complaining at all, it's quite enjoyable.\" Tallahassee sprawls out on the bed on his back, quite invitingly so. Jaymie makes the most of the situation by quickly ridding him of the hindering jeans and gives him a quick, almost teasing, blow-job. That fact means that Tallahassee is able to turn the tables once Jaymie pulls away. He flips them to pin Jamie to the bed and nips at his exposed throat, drawing out a pleased little noise. Tallahassee rids them both of their remaining clothing items and shows him slowly what sex in safety is, not the quick and rough that they've had to live with for the past few weeks. Tallahassee, being the huge cuddleslut that he is, once they've both finished and he's cleaned them up enough for the moment, he stretches out beside Jaymie and pulls the smaller man to his chest. The latter tucks his head under Tallahassee's chin. \"Kevin.\" \"No.\" He chuckles slightly, Jaymie is horrible at guessing things. \"Tell me when you give up.\" \"I'm gonna get it eventually, no worries.\" Tallahassee kisses Jaymie's forehead, before saying, \"You should get some rest while you can, darlin'.\" \"Nuh uh, I'm gonna figure out what your name is first. Max.\" He says, stubborn streak showing. \"No.\"Jaymie continues guessing for about twenty minutes before he starts drifting off. The last name he says, just as he's fallen asleep, is correct. Benjamin. He smiles and kisses Jaymie's forehead one more time, and says quietly, \"Love you, spit-fuck.\" ","Summary":" During the zombie apocalypse, one wouldn't think holidays mean much.

Kissing included! Columbus/Tallahassee LOVE! *Peep…peep…peep…* „Do ya hear that?\" Tallahassee asked the group. The younger people looked at him, about to enter their car. \"What are you talking about?\" Wichita asked and also Little Rock and Columbus watched him irritated. *Peep…peep…peep…* \"There! There was it again!\" The man spoke up again, looking around. The girls giggled and Columbus just walked up to his partner (*cough* Lover *cough*) carefully taking the man's hand and guiding him to the car. \"…I would never doubt you,\" he whispered to him. \"Oh, shut it, kid…\" The older man growled annoyed, but couldn't hide his smirk for what the boy is trying. *Peep…peep…peep…* \"THERE! There again!\" He looked at the others, only to see nobody. \"What?\" The car was empty, the girls nowhere to see. \"Where are they…\" he looked over his partner who was still holding his hand. He just smiled at him. *Peep…peep…peep…* \"I think it's time.\" He said, letting go of the other's hand, walking away. Tallahassee was confused. \"Time for what?!\" He shouted after the boy. *Peep…peep…peep…* \"To wake up… someone's waiting for you…\" \"What-?\" Columbus was gone. The girls were gone. The car even was gone. No zombies, no road and everything turn dark. *Peep…peep…peep…* He opened his eyes carefully, trying to get used to the light. Everything was white. He felt himself wrapped in something comfy but also his head buzzing painfully. When he looked around, he found himself in a white clean hospital room. Flowers and bouquets were placed around. *Peep…peep…peep…* And then he saw him. Columbus, complete in white and washing the man's bare chest with a sponge like he does that every day. *Peep..peep..peep…* \"Columbus…?\" He croaked out. Why did he felt so weak? He was just walking around with the others and now… \"…Sir…?\" Columbus mumbled surprised, looking at him. *Peep. Peep. Peep.* \"Am I dead? Did they get me now?\" Tallahassee asked. His head hurt. And that peeping noise is getting really annoyed. Was he in a hospital? Is that some wet dream with his partner in a nurse outfit? Possibly not. Of course not. His head…damn fucking hurts! He tried to stand up. *Peepeepeepeepeep!* \"Wait! You shouldn't stand up right now!\" the boy said, trying to push the patient back into bed. Now that Tallahassee thought about it, Columbus just went away. He took the boy's wrist and pulled him into bed. He shifted so that he lied above his partner. \"Don't ya dare to scare me like that ever again. Understood?\" \"What-what are you talking about?\" \"I'm talking 'bout you jus' walking away, spitfuck. Ya know I can't handle more losses…\" he growled, pulling the boy into a kiss. Jayme couldn't understand for what he deserved it. Not only did he come too late for his job, no, he came late because of his discussion with his boyfriend who just happened to cheat on him…again! Also that he still is a virgin! If Donny would just accept that he just needs time…but no, he just looked up his fuck buddies till the college student is ready. Nice. Then he had to clean their well-known coma patient Jack Mullins. Just to tease him! He felt like the whole hospital knew that he found that man attractive which is even possible to believe, with Krista, his co-worker being all kiss-and-tell like. And now, he got officially harassed by said patient. Jayme tried hard to keep his eyes open, pushing the body away. 'Wow, still in form after two years of sleep' he thought, blushing when he realized it and trying even harder to reach the remote to call other nurses. \"Hey Jayme-honey, I brought a surprise-WHAT IS GOING ON!?\" \"100% not what it looks like!\" Jayme said quickly, breaking away from the kiss. Donny threw away his bouquet of roses, stalking over to them and harshly pulled his boyfriend away from the now annoyed and irritated patient. \"Ouch! Stop it, Donny, that hurts!\" the boy shouted, trying to calm him with gently touches on the shoulder but still trying to pull away. \"Oh! You want to make out a bit more?\" \"That's not what I-\" Tallahassee growled as he saw that asshole kissing his boy. His glare tightened as 'Donny' started to grab his boy's butt, making him squeak in surprise. \"Hey! How often do I have to tell you not to do it here!\" Columbus whispered angrily, pushing the other without success. \"Stop it Don!\" \"What, you seem to like being harassed-\" \"THAT'S IT! HANDS OFF HIM!\" Tallahassee screamed furious, jumping from his bed, running at that piece of shit, ignoring the gadgets he was attached to. One clean punch in the face and that guy flew to the ground. \"Don't! Sir, Mr. Mullins, calm down!\" Columbus shouted shocked, pulling at him to separate the both men. Tallahassee did at he was told, this name…why did he know his name? He couldn't think further when Donny threw his fist at him. Tallahassee dodged it easily, just as the next few punches. \"Donny! NO!\" He could hear Columbus yelling at the other. When Donny attacked the patient, he ran to the remote and pressed the button, afterwards he opened the door, calling for nurses in the area. Jayme then ran back to the fighting men. \"Donny! NO!\" He yelled at his boyfriend again, holding back an arm from him. Big mistake. Donny threw his elbow back to free himself, hitting Jayme right in the face. He stumbled and fell backwards, hitting his head on one of the hospital gadgets and lost consciousness. Yup, not his day. \"Columbus!\" \"Don't you dare looking at him like that!\" Donny snapped, trying to punch the man again. He just shoved him away harshly, slamming him against the wall and kneeled down to his partner. He checked the boy's head, gently stroking his curly hair. Then he was harshly grabbed and received the awaited punch from Donny when the other nurses entered the scene. Donny was thrown out and taken away by the police disturbing of the peace and because he attacked a patient, Tallahassee was put back into bed and taking care for everything a just awoken coma patient should get and Columbus was taken out the room, taking care of his injuries. Tallahassee felt strange. Hospital? How did he come into a hospital? A nurse came in. \"Everything ok?\" \"Wichita?\" The girl looked at him shocked. \"What did you say?\" She walked over to him. \"I called ya Wichita.\" \"I'm from Wichita…who did tell you…\" she then had a glare on her face, \"Damn it, Jayme…\" She sighed. \"Well, my actual name is Krista Rock. I'm here to check on you if you're able to meet your family.\" \"My family…?\" Wichita-or Krista now-glanced over the clipboard. \"Well, seems fine to me. I bring them in.\" \"What?\" Before he knew it, the door opened. \"DADDY!\" His son shouted, running towards him, throwing himself to the man's neck. \"Buck…Buck!\" Then it hit him. They moved away from Florida after the divorce. He wanted to visit a cousin in Ohio so they took a plain. It only took them a taxi drive to reach their destination. But really, do all taxi drivers in Ohio drive that crazy!? He only remembered that they crossed the road when the traffic light was red and holds his son tightly to take in the most damage. Looking down at his smiling child, he knew he did right. \"Hey Buck…Buck…\" He whispered over and over again, hugging his son tightly. \"You live…\" he chuckled, feeling few tears escaping his eyes. His son chuckled, \"You too, daddy!\" \"Hey, can you tell daddy how long he slept?\" Tallahassee asked. Buck looked over to Krista who held up to fingers. Two month? \"Two years! You slept two years daddy. But now you're awake and I can live with you again! We can play again!\" \"…Yeah of course you will, did Uncle Frank take good care of you?\" Buck nodded and hugged his father again. Then Frank entered the room. \"Good morning sunshine. Heard you beat somebody's ass when you woke up. Why doesn't it surprise me in the least?\" he smirked. \"He deserved it, by the way.\" Tallahassee replied with a smirk. \"Well, I let you talk in private, when something is needed, call.\" The young nurse spoke up, leaving the room. \"Thanks Wichita-arghh! Krista, sorry…just-\" \"Nono, it's fine…I like that nickname. I think I keep it,\" she said, winking him humorously and closed the door. The reunited family cuddled together before Tallahassee spoke up again. \"So, Buck, want to tell me about what I missed?\" ","Summary":" Warning! Slash! Kissing included!

Fox puts on his glasses \"Zombies\" \"What did you say?\" Mia asked. \"Zombies, dangerous creatures that looks like humans but aren't, they are real! I got a lot of guns at home, they only die if we shoot them in the head. And remember don't get bitten by them, then you will get a high fever and die, and then become a walker. And if you don't know what a walker is, that's a zombie,ok? We have to get over to my house, carefully follow me baby...I mean Mia\" Fox explained. \"Wait\" Mia said \"I'll explain over at my place, ok?\" Mia nod and they run down the streets. Fox looks outside the window, he saw zombie that was trying open a door to another house. \"We have to run so fast that we can, ok?\" Fox says. Fox and Mia runs to the door. Fox opened it slowly. \"At 1...2...3\". Mia and Fox runs like hell over the street, Fox's house was 100meter away. There it was, they ran and ran. Two zombies saw them, and they started to walk after them. \"Run faster!\" Fox shouts. They ran into the house and locked the door. Both of them were really tired and they breathed heavy. \"That was close, but maybe what if the walkers are inside the house? Maybe we should check all the rooms first.\" Mia says. \"Yeah, that's a good idea\" Fox answer. They walked together but not a body to see. A sound came from upstairs. \"What was that?\" Mia asked scared. \"I don't know, let's check it out, you go first.\" Fox said. \"Why me, oh whatever I can be the man.\" Mia said and walked up the stairs. Fox got a gun in his hands, so do Mia. When they came up they saw someone standing right in the door opening. \"Mom!\" Fox shouts Mia looks at Fox. \"We have to shoot her! Or else she will kill us.\" Fox cries and hold up his gun against his mother's head. Pow. Mia shot her down. And she felt at the ground. Fox sits down and cries (a lot). Mia walks to Fox. \"I'm sorry but I had to, I'm so sorry Fox.\" One hour later... \"Are you feeling okay?\" Mia asks Fox. \"I don't know, my mom just died. And the worst thing, she died like a walker\" Fox said. \"And I don't even know if she is alive or dead\" He added. \"Don't worry Fox, we will find her, I promise\" Mia smiles and looks at him. Fox looks at Mia. \"There is something I need to tell you... I love you Mia, I've loved you for a long time, I just needed to tell you it, because I don't know if we're going to die or...\" Mia says fast \"Oh just shut up and kiss me geek\" They started to kiss ant then they started to make out. Next day... \"Good morning\" Mia smiles. Fox opens his and kissed Mia on the cheek \"So what are we gonna do today?\" Mia asks. In that second someone knocks on the door. Mia runs to the door and looks out the window, it was two guys with orange/red hair. Mia opened the door and the two boys ran inside. \"Thank you, my name is Fred and this is Frank.

So please be patient, but I'll try to keep this regularly updating as much as possible. I'd give a little info on the story, but I feel like that would be spoiling the surprise, just please note that in this take illya/oc is the main drive here, and though he's kinda sorta with gaby at first, i've got other plans for her. So please, don't get upset with me regarding gaby/illya, I ship them incredibly so, but this is something very very different. Enjoy! :) Illyas head spun, his vision blurry as he tried to overcome the ringing in his ears enough to orient himself. He could hear his name screamed-or rather, the name he gave as a cover, as small grey eyes hovered over him. Pleading. Poor boy, he shouldn't have to see this. His hands lifted as much as possible, grabbing onto the childs arms as he tried to speak, tried to reassure him that he wouldn't let anything happen to him-but nothing came out, and the crying boy only cried harder. He could feel his small charge being ripped from his grasp, the tugging being enough to force his mind into overdrive, yanking him back into reality like a tug from a rope from water to safety. Too sharp, too jolting, his head spun again before it finally cleared and everything came into clear focus. The boy screamed to him for help, but he had to be careful with the gun being held in the captors other hand. There was only one thing in his mind he just needed to act on it- A sudden blur of a white dress and black hair flew out from the corner of his vision, the boy dropped as the woman he'd come to respect and admire became a hellion, the gun knocked across the room as she wielded raw fury against the man. She was beautiful, Illya thought, like an avenging goddess who'd finally had enough. There was no stopping her now as she screamed over the growing commotion in the room for him to take the boy to safety. He couldn't leave her, he wouldn't. She deserved to smile again, to enjoy the freedom that had been so cruelly stolen from her. He had made a promise and he would keep it. No order from her would stop him. Approaching footsteps came up behind him and he turned to face another opponent... and one became three... then five. But they were nothing more than pesky flies, brushed off easily due to how inadequate they were. A scream... Bang! A gunshot rang out, and he turned to face the man who held the weapon with deep seeded disgust before his eyes widened in shock. For between him and the weapon was the lady all in white. Familiarity set in, he'd been here before. A crimson patch building at her back. No. She couldn't die. Not like this. Another scream filled his ears, and he fell into darkness, the last he saw being her grey eyes looking back at him in apology. Illya woke from the dream with a start, breathing heavily as he placed a hand over his chest, his heart hammering away in his ribcage. He looked around the dark room, his mind coming back into focus as he remembered where he was. Gaby slept peacefully in the bed beside him, her chest rising and falling with every breath she took, and he focused on it to help bring him back. But in the back of his mind, there was a whisper, a gentle voice he had a hard time shaking. The memory played on as he stared into the darkness, eyes vaguely beginning to make out the shape of the armoire across the room. He remembered catching her as she collapsed, her blood staining his hands red as he'd ripped open the dress to look at how bad she'd been hit. It was bad, he knew enough to know that, the bullet had entered near her heart, and gone out the other side, meaning that she was bleeding profusely. But shock took her consciousness from her before he could do anything, and she'd laid limp in his arms with his name whispered one last time. Everything after was a blur of reaction, and he had some trouble recalling it fully- save for the pale form his eyes caught when he finally had time to process once more. Shaking his head, he tried to stop the memories, and getting up he trudged with sleepy limbs to the bathroom. He wouldn't be getting any more sleep now, he knew that well enough. \"You're up early, Peril.\" Napoleon commented upon seeing Illya flipping through some files . \"It's nine in the morning.\" Illya replied tersely, his eyes glued to the page. \"Not really what you call 'early'.\" Napoleon huffed softly. \"You're supposed to be on vacation. On vacation, 9 a.m. is early.\" He said before he sat down on the couch across from Illya with a coffee in hand. \"How long have you been up anyway?\" Illya paused. \"Three o'clock.\" Came his answer. \"Couldn't sleep?\" \"Something like this.\" Napoleon sighed, tilting his head as he tried to get a good look at the file. \"Is Gaby up yet?\" He inquired. \"No. She drank a little too much last night, I don't think we'll be seeing her for a little while yet.\" The file was closed just as Napoleon caught a name written in Russian. \"Blackwood?\" The name was familiar. The look he received from Illya would have made most men backtrack, but Napoleon merely met his grace with a curious insistence. \"It's not important.\" Illya said as he got up. \"It's an old mission from when I worked for KGB.\" \"And you're examining it why?\" There was no answer, just the quiet shuffling of papers as Illya put the file into his case and headed toward the kitchen to make some more coffee. \"Curious.\" Napoleon commented. But before he could continue poking at Illya, Gaby entered the room with a drawled out \"Good morning...\" which spoke oh so clearly of the hangover she was feeling. Illya watched with a small smile as she slowly padded over to the couch and laid down with her feet in Napoleons lap. \"Hmm... looks like someone got a little carried away last night.\" The American teased, earning a sleepy glare from the young woman. \"Is there coffee?\" Her voice was a pain to her own ears it seemed as she winced. \"There would have been if Cowboy hadn't drank the last cup.\" Illya replied, returning to the room with a glass of water and a tablet of Alka-seltzer, dropping it in and handing the drink to Gaby, who took it gratefully. \"But I'm making some more. Should be ready soon.\" The subtle flirtation that usually came with any interaction between Illya and Gaby soon occurred, but Napoleon tuned it out as his focus returned to the file Illya had been reading, the name finally clicking in his mind. Elliot Blackwood, arms dealer and weapon manufacturer. Napoleon vaguely remembered being offered the mission to bring him down before the man was dead and it was rumores he had been gotten to by the Russians first. He looked at Illya. What were the odds that the very Russian who stole the mission out from under him was Illya? But why did the he have the file still? It had to be five years before at least- \"Perhaps Napoleon can make breakfast instead? Prove he has something to add to this little vacation other than his charm.\" Gaby pointedly suggested, nudging him with her foot. \"And Since I'm incapable of keeping my balance right now...\" Napoleon chuckled, looking at Illya who shrugged. \"As the lady wishes.\" He said with an ounce more of charm than usual just because of her comment before he went into the kitchen. On the way, he noticed a small photograph, and he stooped to pick it up. Realizing it had probably fallen from the file, he pocketed it, waiting until he was in the seclusion of the kitchen before he took a look. It wasn't like reconnaissance photos, where the pictures were taken from far away without anyone knowing. It was a purposeful photo, a woman and three children playing near a fountain, the woman's face turned toward the taker with a smile of pure happiness. A little boy in the photo, who couldn't have been more than five, was waving with a large grin, his hand blurred with movement, and two little girls. Napoleon turned it over. 'Margaret, Miles, Rosie, Jenny. Vienna. 1958.' How Curious... It wasn't until later that Napoleon had the chance to try and find the file on his own, having sent out Illya and Gaby for a date which he'd taken the liberty to arrange. He adored both of them, but sometimes they needed a little push in the right direction-or else they'd drive him crazy with how slow they were taking it . At this rate, he'd be a grandfather by the time they finally got together, and he wasn't anywhere near married yet. With the rooms to himself, he sought out the case where he'd seen Illya put the file, and using his vast array of knowledge concerning locks and how to open them, he was in it within only about five minutes. He'd have to tell Illya how to make his cases more secure when he was done, they couldn't have anyone and their uncles raiding Illyas cases for vital information. Taking great care to have a catalog of how everything was when he found it, he searched the case for the file, finding it curious that Illya seemed to keep this file deep in the bag, underneath everything else. \"What exactly...\" Napoleon found himself muttering. \"is so special about this...?\" he withdrew the file from earlier, opening it as carefully as possible-again, so nothing would be askew next time Illya decided to do a little night reading. Settling in with a chardonnay and several hours of safety, Napoleon began reading. The official documents were dated September of 1957, the dossier of Elliot Blackwood making Napoleon grimace. \"Well don't you look like a ray of sunshine.\" he commented to the photograph attached, pulling out the picture he'd found on the floor earlier in the day and placing it back in the file before he forgot later. \"Alright, let's see what we have here...\" Let me know what you guys think, although this is more personal project that I just need to get out, i'm curious for what those who read it think. :)[Chapter 2] A/N: I don't own man from uncle in any way \"Your target is Elliot Blackwood, a businessman who was disowned by his family for his Nazi sympathies and moved to Germany...\" Illyas mind went over his debriefing again, the memory playing as he was all too aware of being watched very closely by two men across the bar. The first part of his mission was completed, he'd been noticed. \"...during the war, his family was killed, leaving him as the only heir with a very large fortune and a factory. Returning to England, he was rumored to be involved in espionage, proving a facade of making weapons for the allies...\" He'd avoided looking like he'd noticed them so far, but if he was going to get himself a job as a bodyguard he'd need to cause a scene. Intel pointed to the fact that Blackwood usually used a certain brawling type as guards, he'd need to fit that bill, and so he 'drunkenly' bumped into a large Turk and spilled his beer. \"...he escaped just ahead of being arrested as a spy and a traitor. He settled in Poland where he changed his trade to manufacturing fabrics, though intelligence says that he's still making weapons. But no one actually can prove it...\" The singular fight turned into an all out brawl, though it ended as Illya had expected- the Turk unconscious on the floor and him only having a few bruises. He stepped outside with a cool head, heading down the street aware he was being followed. \"...your mission is to become close to him by any means necessary. He has a wife...\" A tap was felt on his shoulder. \"... don't be afraid to use her for the purpose of information. She's the daughter of an Earl in England, she's sure to be of some use to us...\" He turned to see the men from the bar, one wearing a large grin. \"We saw that show back at the pub. What's your name, mate?\" \"...just remember your cover.\" \"Viktor Petrov.\" \"Petrov, eh?\" The man replied as he fished into his jacket and pulled out a photo, showing it to his partner. \"I guess we're in luck. We've been lookin for a bloke named Petrov, a... mutual acquaintance said you might be lookin for work.\" He looked between them, taking each detail in on default. The smaller men simply stood there, slightly unsettled by his silent gaze- good. \"How interesting. And what kind of 'work' would you be referring to?\" The men exchanged a glance with a smile. Perfect. Elliot Blackwood was exactly what Illya was expecting. For a man who there were few photographs of, to be so spot on with expectation was a surprise, even for Illya. He was a tall man in his forties, with jet black hair and skin which made him look more vampire than human. He had an air about him that commanded total obedience, for although he was a recluse, he was a man who knew very much the way of the world, and had full control of those who existed in his sphere. The first night he had invited Illya into his office for an interview, and with a friendliness that momentarily made Illya wonder whether the KGB had the right man, he asked Illya intimate questions about himself. \"I like to know those who work for me as much as possible. I think it makes people more comfortable in the long run...\" he'd said over his glass of brandy. \"Don't you?\" Illya couldn't have been more uncomfortable if he tried as he answered: \"Of course.\" In reply. He was a month in now, the schedule and routine beginning to feel normal to him. There was nothing yet to report, he'd not been allowed anywhere that Elliot was not. It was clever, in a way, for Elliot to have him so close, for in this manner Elliot could keep an eye on his newest recruit. In vain, of course. The change came abruptly, Elliot storming into the barracks that the bodyguards used with a gun in his hand, the poor soul that Illya knew was a relatively new recruit having his life ended with a cold look and a bullet to the head. The was a deadness in Elliots eyes as he turned to Illya, boring into him as if searching for a reaction, before he plaintively said: \"Come up to the house tomorrow for breakfast, Petrov. You've got a new assignment.\" The body was dragged away, and Illya turned to the two who had brought him there in the first place. Chip, one was called, the smiling one who had first spoken to him, while Karl was the name of the other- The Norwegian was probably the only one Illya actually took a liking to. \"Poor Eddy,\" Chip spoke. \"He couldn't keep his hands to himself could he?\" \"He got exactly what he deserved. Everyone knows she's off limits, why push your luck?\" Karl inquired in reply. \"It's not like he wasn't warned.\" \"Still, pretty girl like that.\" Chip replied. \"I'm shocked he didn't do it sooner.\" It didn't take a genius. \"What do you think new assignment will be?\" Illya asked instead, inwardly jumping for joy and hoping he would be right in his assessment. \"Wife duty, o'course.\" Chip answered with a laugh. \"You've never met her have you?\" Illya shook his head. \"No, but why me?\" \"Ooh, well you see taking duty with Mrs. Blackie is somewhat of a test. See, if you pass it without getting your head blown off for getting handsy, ol' Blackie boy sees this as some kind of loyalty and you get to stay on.\" \"The boss is very... \" Karl paused. \"Possessive.\" Chip smirked. \"Only Karl here has taken the duty and is completely unaffected. The rest of us simply try to look like it doesn't matter when she turns those doe eyes our way. You'd think she was an old hag by how little he talks about it.\" \"I've not got a death wish is all.\" Karl replied, prompting Chip to go after him, which Illya quickly tuned out in favor of cleaning his weapon. \"... don't be afraid to use her for the purpose of information... she's sure to be of some use to us...\" He looked forward to it. The next morning Illya arrived with a few minutes to spare, being led to a part of the house he'd not seen before. It was in great taste, antiques from all over the world collected along with famous artwork that Illya was fairly certain was stolen from somewhere. It felt like a museum, impersonal in such a respect that he found himself wondering why anyone bothered with this kind of thing. It wasn't sentimental, the former owners had died some hundred or two years ago. And so it gave the house a darkness, overcrowded by ancient history so much that there was nothing which Illya saw that was in any way restful. It was as if the house itself intruded on his thoughts, making itself an entity all its own. That was, until he reached his destination. In contrast to the rest of the house, it felt lighter. The autumn breeze gently blowing through the room, Illya took a deep breath to clear his mind of what he'd passed through. It was homey, pleasant, and the feel of the room was a relaxing place, with modest decorations which were more charming than intimidating. The sound of a cooing baby came from the floor, and Illya cautiously approached, quiet so as to first assess who he was dealing with. Tiny blue eyes peered up at him in curiosity from under black curls. A little girl less than a year old, he'd wager based on how she was mouthing a rattle. She smiled, a little squeaking sound coming out as she tapped her free hand on the face of the woman who dozed behind her. Mrs. Elliot Blackwood was far younger than he'd thought she'd be, her arms firmly holding another black-haired child who looked similar to the other, though perhaps a little older. The awake child tapped her rattle, another high-pitched shriek coming from her in glee as she giggled at him. \"Mmmm...\" Mrs. Blackwood stirred, her hand clumsily reaching for the baby with an unintelligible muttering. \"Mrs. Blackwood?\" Illya finally spoke, thinking that he should say something before he scared her unintentionally. Grey eyes snapped open, and she sat up abruptly, looking around the room in a panic before she settled her gaze back on him and blinked. \"... Viktor Petrov?\" She inquired softly. Illya nodded. \"Mrs. Blackwood?\" \"Oh good lord, I'm so sorry! I was told by Elliot you were coming for breakfast, but I came in a little early and,\" she gave a nervous laugh. \"I must have fallen asleep-how long have you been there?\" Illya gave a small smile to mask his confusion. \"Not very long.\" He assured, offering her a helping hand as she struggled to get up with the still sleeping child in her arms. She looked at the hand for a moment before returning the smile. \"Thank you.\" Rocking the child for a moment, she did a quick glance around the room. \"Give me a moment, please, I'm going to put her down in her crib. Do you mind watching Rosie?\" He shook his head, looking down at the baby on the rug. \"Thank you, I'll be right back.\" And with that, she disappeared through a side door, humming softly. Illya was left to his thoughts... ... She was not what he expected. Chip had talked about doe eyes, and Illya had expected a woman of possible manipulation-she was, after all, married to a man who shot people when he was in a mood, it wasn't that far fetched. But to see a woman who seemed so... normal, was strange. The child he'd been charged with watching giggled-Rosie, he corrected in his mind- and reached her little arms toward him with a string of babbled 'dah's and 'bah's. He crouched down to her level as best he could, hesitating for a moment before he held out his hand. Tiny fingers wrapped around his calloused ones, Rosies little eyes focused intently as she explored his hand, endearing herself to him through pure innocent excitement. The toothless grin won him completely. \"Sorry if she was any trouble.\" Mrs. Blackwood's voice entered the room once again, and smiling back at Rosie, Illya replied as he extricated his hand from the grip of the baby. \"No trouble, Mrs. Blackwood.\" His fingers lightly tickled the baby's cheek before he stood. \"She is a beautiful baby.\" \"Please, call me Margaret.\" She replied with a smile, holding out her hand to shake his. \"\"Mrs. Blackwood' makes me feel much older than I am, and since we are going to be in close quarters I'm sure we'll get to know each other well.\" Her chipper tone seemed so out of place, but he still took her hand with a quirk of his lips. \"As you wish, Margaret. I only hope your husband shares your belief that I'm a good choice.\" \"Oh he does!\" Margaret replied. \"Though I suppose you've heard the rumors that everyone who comes here ends up in some kind of trouble. Elliot is simply very...\" she paused and searched for the word she wanted. \"Protective.\" Illya thought to the poor guard who had been killed the day before- 'protective' seemed too pleasant a word. \"I hope Eddy didn't get in too much trouble. He's a nice young bloke, I'd hate to be the reason Elliot fired him, or made him do some kind of horrid guard duty.\" She went on, a wistful look on her face, hopefully looking at him... He suddenly realized she wanted to know how the guard was. Did she not know her husband had killed him? \"He's... coping.\" Illya answered vaguely, a part of him hoping she wouldn't prod further. There was something about the way she asked that made him not want to break the bad news so abruptly. Though it reminded him firmly of something else- \"is Mr. Blackwood joining us soon?\" Margaret furrowed her brow and shook her head. \"Didn't he tell you? He's got some business up at the factory, it's just you and I for breakfast.\" Rosie made a squeaking sound and Margaret laughed. \"And Rosie. Did you want to make sure we didn't forget you, hmm?\" Her attention turned to the baby who she picked up and nuzzled. \"Miles, my son, is with Elliot or he'd be here too. But you'll meet him later, I'm sure. He's five, and will probably shadow you for the first week or two just finding out what you're like.\" \"He sounds like fun.\" Illya deadpanned, unsure how well such a situation would be. He'd had little interaction with children since he'd reached adulthood, most missions having nothing to do with them... he liked them, but given that he was a living weapon with psychotic episodes he didn't think he was the safest person to be around them. Margaret laughed. \"Oh he is. Precocious as the day is long.\" She motioned toward the patio outside. \"I hope you brought your appetite, Viktor, I did order breakfast for three.\" A playful look entered her eyes as she passed him and led to the table, which he followed. Despite his gutteral discomfort at Elliots absence, he decided it would be best to try and enjoy the meal to the best of his ability. And Margaret, as it turned out, made for very nice company. Two hours later, the breakfast had moved on to the lawn behind the house, for the sake of Margarets other daughter, who Illya had discovered was named Jenny. While baby Rosie happily embraced him -she had amassed her toys in Illyas lap before she behavior plucking blades of grass and handing them to him like gifts- but the two year old Jenny was wary of him, and kept her distance. He couldn't blame her, based on the stories Margaret told, she'd had no less than ten guards come and go within the past twelve months alone. Jenny was not used to any of them staying for very long, which probably wasn't good for the poor childs psyche. The odds for him staying on were looking better and better- from a sarcastic point of view.[Chapter 3] \"So much for an 'extended vacation'.\" Napoleon groused, sipping on his scotch with a grumpy look. \"I don't think Waverley understood what I meant by 'extended vacation' when I handed him the leave forms.\" ","Summary":" A/N: Hello there !

Ella mientras me tenia atrapado me volteo hacia ella y la pude ver, tenia un lunar peque o en el labio inferior, sus ojos negros y el cabello rizado y casta o-amarillo le calculo unos 16 a os aunque parece de menos, pude notar que no es gorda ni es flaca, es de buena contextura fisica, cuando me volteo ella me explico que necesita ella y su grupo papeles de la profesora rusalka y el director alvaro los necesita para darselos ah un se or lider de un grupo mayor para poder unirseles y estar ah salvo Yo: le digo, ah salvo de que? aun nervioso. Ella me responde enojada, oye eres idiota oh comes mier...

Yo: bueno, mira estas fotos quisa te sirvan de algo, son del documento, ella las vio y de repente toda su maldad hacia mi desaparecio, al contrario, me dio un abrazo que me dejaba sin aire literalmente, ella dijo, pasamelas porfavor es urgente, si?, yo le dije si esta bien, se las pase por el telefono buscando su bluetooh charlene aguilar? asi te llamas? Charlene: Si si, asi me llamo. Yo: eres mexicana? Charlene: dijo con una carcajada silenciosa Jaj, soy argentina. Bueno, le pase las imagenes y me dijo que edad tienes? yo dude en decirle pero al final le dije tengo 15 a os y tu? ella dijo, 15? jajaja pareces de 13 oh 14 a os mocoso, yo tengo 16 a os.

Capitulo 5 UN TIPO LOCO SUELTO!, Charlene, me gustaria volverla a ver.. Charlene y yo nos escabullimos por la sombra, ella al igual que yo viste de negro, me imagino para no ser notoda y estar confundida con la oscuridad para los demas, en fin, llegamos a la rendija y pasamos burlandola facilmente, a los 5 segundos despues de pasar y caminar me detubo y me dijo. Charlene: arriba, mira! viste? Yo: oh ya veo, si hay camaras, pero estan muy ocultas para ser notadas, ademas son del mismo color del techo, Blanco. Seguimos adelante hasta el final del pasillo, atravesando las seccionales y direcciones, llegamos a la puerta del comedor, yo dijo. Yo: Se orita black, no es hora de comer, con un toque de sarcasmo. Charlene: Jaja aqui es el cuarto de camaras.. Yo: Imposible, es el comedor eh eh? como habran camaras? bueno, si tu lo dices, y como abriras el cuarto? esta cerrado. Charlene: Claro, es imposible abrir el cuarto, para eso estan las puertas o no? Jaj, soy inteligente, se como abrir esta clase de puertas con esto. Ella saco una especie de alambre pero mas grueso, era moldeable, efectivamente abrio la puerta, pasamos a la cocina y arriba hay una pintura de un delfin que decia: ''Yo no soy feliz humano y se reir, y no tengo la llave para ser feliz'' , ella me dice. Charlene: Ese cuadro por si no te das cuenta es un juego de mentes, vez hacia donde esta sonriendo y apuntando el delfin con su cuerpo? Yo apunto con mi vista hacia donde esta sonriendo, esta apuntando al florero de la mesa, ella va hacia alli y saca las llaves de alli. Yo: Vaya, jamas hubiese creido esto y mas de este colegio, me impresionas eh. Charlene: Claro, soy grandiosa, ahora vamos que quisa alla alguien mas. Segui ah charlene hacia el congelador de comida, me resultaba ilogico que estubiera la otra puerta alli, pero al darme cuenta hay estaba ocultandose con la pared.. Abrio ella la puerta del congelador y habia otra puerta mas al final en la derecha, fuimos alli y haybia otro cuadro. Dice: ''Dios es grande, si crees en el, mira arriba, ve con el.'' ella dijo. Charlene: A mi no me jodas!, no vere arriba, no creo en ti, ni en nadien, nisiquiera puedo confiar en mi, la sombra es bipolar, ella esta cuando hay luz pero en la oscuridad me abandona!. Yo: Charlene, no veas arriba por lo que dice el cuadro, ni por lo que diga tu mente, ni lo que creas, solo ve hay por las llaves para salir de aqui, dios no tiene tiempo para esto, nisiquiera se si existe, pero ese no es el punto, ahora olvida eso, y toma las llaves es todo.. Charlene: Valla, tienes razon, no debo estar preoc.. Ahaha olvidalo, hmm gracias, de verdad, me sacaste de un quisio que siempre tengo hacia el, eres especial sabes, yo tambien pienso asi las cosas.. Yo: Yo no soy religioso ni catolico ni ateo ni nada de eso, solo vivo mi vida por mi y ya, no me preocupo por creer en eso, el ser humano esta para vivir una vida feliz y triste, no para estar encomendado por algo. Yo no se si es real, pero igual respeto ah todas esas cosas, demonios, dios, etc etc. Solo me preocupo por mi y ya es todo, asi debemos pensar. Charlene: Si tienes razon, no todos piensan asi, y eso hace falta, pensar diferente, pero todo el mundo actua como quiere, valla, tu chica debe estar muy feliz de tener ah alguien como tu no? Yo: No tengo, ni eh tenido jaj, con algo de tristeza en mis ojos. Charlene: Si eres mentiroso, todo tipico ni o de 9 a os en adelante oh quisas menos de este pais ya tien... Yo la interrumpo diciendo.. Yo: Yo no soy comun, ese es mi problema, yo entiendo a las chicas y las ayudo ah levantar el animo y las ayudo en todo lo que me pidan y si no puedo, creeme me esfuerzo por hacerlo, por eso me convierto siempre en su mejor amigo, ese es el problema. Caigo facilmente en la zona de amigos. Charlene: Valla, que cosas, bueno no hablemos de eso, no vinimos ah eso, oh si? bueno tomare la llave. Tomo la llave y abrio la puerta de camaras, hay estaba el equipo, era peque o pero con 6 camaras, borramos todos los datos de las camaras, al irnos vimos que en una camara hay la figura en un hombre oh a mi parecer, yo le dije ven a er esto charlene, vimos la figura unos 7 segundos de repente se volteo ah la camara sonrio lo mas que pudo y corrio por el pasillo riendose de forma rara y macabra, como payaso del circo malebolo, una risa muy fea para resumir. Charlene saco una pistola, un revolver para ser exactos, y me dio un cuchillo. Charlene: estoy tras la puerta, oye si ese loco llega aqui lo matare, y si esta herido lo matas vale? Yo: Estas loca? le dije nervioso ella tambien lo estaba. Charlene: Claro que hay que matarlo! si nos ve nos matara, no quiero morir, al menos no ahora, tengo un grupo que liderar y sin mi estaran mal, aunque ya les haya ense adon bastante. Ya por lo menos quitamos los datos de las camas, nosotros nunca estubimos aqui, yo le dije ok, Oye notas algo extra o? no hay risa, ni pasos, ya deberia haber pasado cerca de aqui. Charlene: Tienes razon, cierra las puertas, veamos las camaras!. Haci hicimos y no vimos nada hasta que de pronto de un golpe se rompio un plato de la cocina, se escucho su estruendo al caer, yo le dije susurrando. Yo: Hay esta ten cuidado. Charlene, abrio la puerta de golpe y disparo las 5 balas que tenia al hombre, lo logre ver, era alto y flaco, con traje semi formal y tenia una camisa gris y pantalon algo da ada de color negro. Charlene no acerto ningun tiro ademas que solo tenia 5 balas, el hombre salio corriendo rapido gritando mas fuerte y corriendo de nuevo al corredos con su risa macabra. Charlene: No tengo balas!, y ahora?! hay que salir de aqui, dejame pensar. Yo: Hay que salir por el campo, es 1 de las 3 maneras para salir de aqui que eh logrado pensar. Ella saco otro cuchillo pues la pistola no le sirve si no para dar cachasos, intentamos dejar la cocina tal cual para no dejar sospechas, todo estaba bien exepto los huecos de la pared, ella golpeo la pared para que no se notara tanto. Salimos de la cocina. Yo: Estamos en el pasillo charlene y ahora tenemos 3 opciones de escape, la primera es salir corriendo a la rendija, pasarla y correr hacia el muro y saltarlo, lo malo si el hombre tiene mala intencion y esta en el corredor para el sera muy facil atraparnos pues tardaremos en el muro, La 2 darle la vuelta a la seccional numero 5 y salimos al corredor deberemos ir por el salon de arte y de alli al campo, el unico riesgo es que tardamos mucho caminando y no sabemos donde esta ese tipo, seremos vistos facilmente, ademas estan las camaras. La ultmima la 3 es seguir al lado de la cocina y ir ah la ventana, alli saltarla y llegamos al otro campo, el cual sera facil salir de hay pues esta el estacionamiento y la carretera. cual quieres? Charlene: La 3 la 3 ahora vamonos!. Pasamos por la cocina y a los 25 segundos corriendo llegamos ah la ventana, no podiamos abrirla asi que le di un golpe con el cuchillo, se ropio la ventana y el tipo corrio hacia nosotros, se escuchaban sus pasos, eran como una estampida, aemas su risa era macabra, sabia que lo que venia a nosotros no era bueno y que no hay nadien para defendernos si no nosotros mismos, ella salto de la ventana, ella sabe parkour, y valla! que si sabe una caida de 4 metros y cayo ilesa, me dijo. Charlene: vamos rich salta, yo te atajo, no mentira, salta o te quieres morir con ese tipo! vamos! tu puedes!. El hombre llego a pocos metros de donde estoy yo salte sin pensar nada, pero cai apoyandome en mis brazos, arrrrg rayos!, mi mano sono mas fuerte que aqueya vez con los perros en el muro, ella me apreto la mano, era la mu eca y senti otro dolor, pero me recupero. salimos corriendo por hay y salimos del colegio, al fin. Charlene: Jajaj valla debes practicar rich, el parkour es algo que hay que aprender, pero fuera de eso, gracias de verdad, me has salvado a mi y a mi grupo, jamas lo olvidare, por ahora somos un grupo de 10 personas, si quieres unirtenos buscame en las plazas de la ciudad entre las 3:30pm hasta las 6:30pm, en el la ma ana, serias muy bienvenido a mi grupo, gracias, de verdad gracias death. Yo: bueno la verdad no te mentire, no tengo palabras para esto, jej, bueno denada supongo, eso creo, denada, gracias a ti por no matarme blacker ...Ella se rio y se dio la vuelta para irse, lo mismo hice yo, pero me llamo yo me voltee y ella me dio otro abrazo el primero fue cuando le pase las imagenes, y me dijo, bueno ya que no hay palabras, intenta decifrar con palabras esto, me dio un beso, me dijo eso es para que no olvides que charlene no te mato, jaj descuida no es un beso de la muerte, hasta luego!. No lo puedo creer, esta chica me dio un beso de maximo 3 segundos y no hice nada, vaya que soy un nerd ja, bueno no tengo palabras, aun no puedo decifrar nada libro, esta chica me llamo la atencion, de verdad libro, voltee a ver la hora y son las 2:01pm yo dije mierda! que demonios? cuando paso el tiempo tan rapido, bueno debo apresurarme, te escribo apenas llegue, oh al dia siguiente libro. Capitulo 6 Dudas everywhere y no se que hacer u_U Camine tranquilo de vuelta a casa con un sabor a victaria libro, de verdad.. Lo que paso fue increible, ayer 15 de enero, bueno ayer porque fue hace poco que se termino el dia pasado, conoci a charlene, la chica mas loca que eh visto pero muy muy linda, y si fuera poco pues me ah besado!, see lo se aun no lo supero, fue un beso oh gran cosa en este tiempo, pero para mi significa algo bueno, en fin, no es un avance?, bueno libro son las 3:00am, ma ana hay clase y debo dormir, no tengo sue o en realidad, pero debo hacerlo, no quiero quedarme dormido, ademas parece que hay examen ma ana, buenas noches libro R. Que tal? como esta todo?, para mi esta regular libro creo que lo que, lo que te dire no es algo muy bueno, veras lei una pancarta que decia: ''Esta ciudad le guste o no a quien le duela oh no, vendremos por ella el 23 de enero, escucharan muchos disparos en rafaga y carabana y tendran una maldita hora para irse de aqui!. Vaya libro, no crei esto para ser sincero, yo sabia que algo iva a pasar y las cosas que ivan a poner feas pero no ahora, creia que mas adelante, bueno ya es 16 de enero son las 5:42pm y quedan exactamente 7 dias , una semana para que eso pase. Lo mas logico que se podria hacer es ir a las calles y llamar al alcalde oh gobernador y a la guardia nacional a proteger a los ciudadanos, pero cual gobernador? cual alcalde? cual jodid.. Guardia nacional? Me da risa y panico a la vez, vaya sera que es el fin de esto?, bueno libro a decir verdad ya el fin de todo llego hace mucho tiempo , solo que estaba en la sala tomando el cafe hablando con la vida, hasta que ya no haya un tema para hablar y la muerte se retire despacio, abriendo la puerta, y la vida pidiendole que se quede un rato mas, pero la muerte debe irse con el alma de la victima, que la muerte a la vida siempre le acaba de ganar. Es curioso sabes libro? todo el mundo creo que la muerte es la mala, y la vida la buena, pero si te colocas a ver desde otro punto, la muerte es la buena y la vida la mala, en fin, hoy fui a clases y pase la mayor parte con gil y mile, bueno en mis tiempos libres fui a saludar a lib, ella es una muy linda chica, es mas metalcore que scene, y pues justo ahora estoy sentado en mi cuarto, escuchando musica mientras te escribo, me siento algo cansado y tengo al parecer quebranto. Necesito algo para animarme, pero que? oh algo interesante para leer.. Si tan solo tubiera intern... CLARO!, LIBRO!, voy a leerte los documentos! dame tan solo, dejame ir a comer, ya regreso. Ya termine de comer, bueno libro, ah lo que vinimos, oh vine mejor dicho, leere todo y a la vez escribo, a qui vamos: ''Queridos profesores y alumnos, no le puedo facilitar mi nombre a la comunidad, solo soy un enviado del gobierno para decirles que me imagino, que estan enterados, la guerra aun no es guerra pero se esta viviendo su primera etapa, y quisa aqui en el pais oh en algunas zonas calmadas aun no la ven pero creame la guerra es inminente, por donde quiera que vayamos tenemos a la muerte, en este momento no se le puede decir hermano al otro pais ni enemigo al amigo, muchos paises se estan atacando por suministros y otras cosas y haci mismos tambien, y como vera venezuela no es la exepcion, usa so aba sue a dia y noche de como tener a este pais y algunos de sur y centro america, y ahora como esta la situacion, creame, aqui lanzan un misil y los que sufren son ustedes, sere sincero, no es mentira, en este momento hacen creer que la vida es bella, aqui no a llegado como tal pero otros paises ya esta escrito su destino, mexico por ejemplo, ah sido atacado por usa para probar sus armas ademas esta siendo usado en bases militares, al igul que colombia y chile y algunas partes de argentina, en mexico prueban sus armas radio activas y cosas que no se habian visto, no se cuales son esas cosas pero de que son letales lo son, y le dire algo a usted director, por que me agrada y le conozco, al parecer los que mutan y mueren oh estan traumados, bueno en el caso de los que mutan a esos ataque en mexico tienen deformidades y sus sentidos son mmuy perfectos, mas de lo que se puede creer cierto, no sienten mucho dolor, de hecho no sienten practicamente dolor, bueno quiero informarle que no le diga a nadien, aunque se que lo hara pero en fin, no lo hago, sabemos lo que hace, oh y digale ah la profesora rusalka que la espero en 20 de este mes a las 2:00pm en el boulevard 43 de la calle ilobar, vestire casual, pidale que vaya como me gusta, asi quisa la lleve a mi cama, algo que usted no hara nunca. Bueno usted siga con sus clases normal, hasta finales de julio, oh y otra cosa, la supuesta invasion que haran el 23, es falsa, solo sera una distraccion, hasta luego, pronto le dare mas informacion, buenas tardes, elimine este documento, saludos''. Libro no puedo creer esto!, e derramado jugo sobre mi teclado jod.. Era nuevo, que lastima, jaj, bueno ahora en serio, respecto al documento, me resultan muy interesante 3 puntos sobre esto, 1: ir a ver esa reunion. 2: Ya no me preocupa tanto el dia 23, aunque no se si creerle a la carta ''documento. Y 3: Seran zombies? JAJ, me dan tantas ganas de matar un zombie, bueno ahora en serio, esto es lo que le hacia falta al planneta, al mundo una guerra, y es doloroso para todos, pero era la unica manera, a mi parecer de reestablecer las cosas a su mejor estado, si todos nos matamos, quisa en algun futuro las civilisaciones futuras no cometeran el error de nosotros, sabes libro no se que hacer, por una parte estoy solo y puedo hacer cosas sin preocuparme, solo por mi, pero si me uno al grupo de charlene, aprenderia mucho, y podria usar armas, mi objetivo es matar libro, pero solo si la cosa se pone cruel fea y mala ademas solo si se torna un problema debo hacerlo, son las 10:39am, hoy tengo el dia libre, me ire a un curso de ingles gratuito, necesito aprender ingles, solo tengo una duda, unirme al grupo charlene, oh segui asi como estoy hoy saldre a las 12:30 regreso a las 3:00pm, ire al centro por unas cosas, voy a ducharme y a vestirme, te escribo al rato, hasta luego. Capitulo 7 Peleas..

Libro, primero que nada debo agradecer que tengo un lapiz, asi puedo escribir, en realidad eso quiero, y segundo, esto es, estoy en, estoy en estoy y esto es una mierda!, es un caos, un desorden, un pueblo fantasma si esto es!, son las 9:45am, creo que me quede inconsiente 6 horas casi... Me duele la cabeza, me duele el cuello, me duele todo en realidad, estoy sangrando en una herida en mi pie izquierdo ademas tengo una roca sobre el , lo que paso fue que una bomba, oh mejor dicho bombona de gas exploto y justamente estaba en una licoreria obviamente la explocion se hiso mas grande y el fuego se extendio por todos lados, fui bamboleado por la onda de la explocion y pegue de golpe mi espalda de la pared, me despaye y me desperte hace poco, no me di cuenta siquiere del golpe en mi pie, oh libro hay fuego por todos lador, y cadaveres incinerados, y yo me pregunto? donde estan los bomberos? la ayuda? donde? la explocion fue fatal pero aun asi los municipios de al lado pueden venir ayudar, ademas la estacion de bomberos de aqui esta algo lejor pero esta intacta es muy posible, no se como sobrevivi, me gustaria saberlo, no dire gracias a dios por que fue gracias a mi corazon y mis venas que no fueron cortadad para no morir desangrado, gracias pared que evito eso tambien, bueno veo que haya hay heridos y personas, voy a,, oh no... Libro volvi ah desmayarme, bueno son las 11:30am del 19 de enero, ayer era 18, bueno ayer hace horas, te dire lo que paso cuando desmaye por segunda vez. Veras cuando me levante y note que era un centro comercial, bueno en realidad no era un centro comercial, era lo que quedaba de el, desperte en una camilla, me levante y vi que por alla estaba un chico, voy a acercarme y le pregunto, donde estoy? quien me trajo aqui? el me dice: Chico: Esa no es la pregunta amigo, la pregunta es por que mereciste estar aqui? y la respuesta es pues, sabrina te vio cuando te desmayaste y recordo al verte que fuiste el chico que nos salvo de esos perros rabiosos la otra vez. Yo: Oh si lo.. GRACIAS!, si gracias! por ello me dijeron 2 chicas y 2 chicas. Yo: Ahahah si, ustedes le huian a esos perros rabiosos. Uno de ellos me dijo, aclarando ese tema, Dijo: Nosotros no huiamos en realidad. Yo: A que le huian entonces? con interrogancia les pregunte. Me dijeron, habian muchas personas mas de 16 persiguiendonos, ellos sabian parkour, ademas eran enemigos y no podiamos contra ellos aunque supieramos pelear y defendernos no podriamos ganarles, entonces corrimos y nos empezaron a perseguir perros y tambien la policia, corrimos hacia el colegio pero quedamos entre un muro, entonces tu llegas alli y lanzas algo a esos perros y tu llamas su atencion, era nuestro momento de escapar, por eso te decimos, gracias, de verdad... Ademas, charlene estaba alli y nos dijo que corrieramos, me imagino que la conoces, nos hablo de ti ya que le diste unos valiosos documentos en realidad, si no te conocieramos ya estubieras desmayado por alla todavia, quisas merto, yo les dije, bueno gracias a ustedes tambien. En ese momento llega un hombre digamos de 27 a os aproximadamente que dice gritando. SE VAN A MORIR FOURTEN! VOMITOS LES ENSE ... Aque tipo cayo al suelo de un disparo en la pierna, volteo a ver quien era, que obvio no? era charlene, traia puesto un traje militar pero negro con manchas verdes y el pelo liso al parecer se lo aliso y salto sobre el tipo y le dijo. Charlene: Quien te envio rata? El tipo dijo asustado, mi jefe! mi jefe!, no me mates, soy solo un mensajero!. Charlene: No prometo nada, quien es tu jefe? aun es el tal dilvio? El tipo dijo, no no no no, es dilvio, no es dilvio, es ahora samue, samue es el nuevo lider, dilvio murio.. Ahora dejame ir, por favor!. Charlene: Bueh lanzenlo por la escalera! quitenlo de mi vista. Lo lanzaron por la escalera, no murio pero es muy posible que este bien herido.. Charlene camino hacia nosotros, me dijo. Charlene: Vaya es un milagro de dios no? que estes vivo? con mucho sarcasmo.. Yo: Jaja, te equivocas, gracias a mis organos y mi corazon y venas que no explotaron y estoy vivo aun. Charlene: Jaj si claro, como digas. Aun sarcastica.. Ya conoces a mis leales? Yo: Pos de vista no mas. Charlene: Bueno, presentense chicos, descuiden es un gran amigo.. Bueno en total son 5 chicos, se presenta el primero. Ronal, tengo 17 a os, el es el mas musculoso y tiene el cabello negro, ademas es callado y timido. Yo soy andre tengo 14 a os, ella es albina y su cabello es negro corto y largo, la parte larga, tapandose media cara cuando ve hacia abajo, es flaca. Me llamo elegu, tengo 13 a os tiene 1? no me dijo su edad pero parece de 16 a os, es enano y tiene el cabello rojo pintado. Soy hammer el es de 15 a os tiene el cabello casta o, es flaco pero no tan alto y callado. Y de ultimo esta sabrina, tiene el cabello rubio es blanca y tiene cuerco de guitarra, tiene 17 a os y es la sub-lider del grupo, les pregunte si saben sobre la guerra y me dijeron, no sabemos mucho, los que mas saben son los vomitos, pero los mas pesados del grupo vomitos ademas los aneurysmy tambien saben muchos, esos 2 grupos estan sobre nosotros, nosotros somos el 3er grupo mas fuerte de la ciudad, ten mira este papel me dijo sabrina. 1:vomitos 52personas, 3 sub-lider, un lider 2:aneurysmy 29personas, un lider 3:fourten 26 personas, 4 jefes, 1 sub-lider, un lider 4:mummes 20 personas, 10 jefes, un lider 5:cookiesss 19personas un lider 6:needled24/7 14personas un lider 7:kill you motherfuckers! 14 personas, 2 lider 8:submissions! 10personas, 5 sub lider. Esa es la clasificacion como estan todos los grupos de la cuidad desde hace 4 semanas, eso explica esos grafitis llamativos. Charlene dice que hay que mantener un numero mayor de 5 para que no nos ataquen los mummes, los 3 primeros puestos son los que mas se respetan pues los aneurysmy y vomitos no atacan a los del 3 osea nosotros, hay que cuidarnos de mumes que quiere atacar pues como la ciudad es un caos, habra que dejar la ciudad pronto, y no arriesgare a mi gente a morir por algo que sera destruido pronto, Yo le digo, te entiendo. Bueno luego de la charla, les dije voy a mi casa, me despedi y justo ahora estoy caminando, bueno de seguro me espera el rega o del siglo, pero que es esto? no hay nadien? hola!, que es eso? una nota..

Capitulo 8.1 continuacion anterior HEY!, deja eso, le dije a una chica que revisaba mis cosas de la mochila, ella dijo, vaya me impreciona tu forma de escribir, y ver las cosas desde otro punto de vista mas alla de lo que vemos y mas aca de lo que tenemos. Yo le dije algo nervioso, leiste mi libro? con un tono algo molesto, ella dijo, si lo ley, mientras tu jugabas al parkour jaj, me llamo ashley, ashley surrender, yo le dije, bueno, lamento si soy lloron oh sentimental por leer mi libro, pero bueno, te daras cuenta de por que soy asi, ella dice, bueno te entiendo, no del todo, pero si te entiendo, bueno ah decir verdad los chicos que conozco solo se fijan en el fisico y siempre dicen que te aman, pero no, no es asi, lo dicen para que estemos ilucionadas y mostrarnos como su imagen bonita en cualquier lugar, no se fijan en lo esencial, y mucho menos lo especial, pocas personas en esta epoca oh siglo saben querer de verdad, de llegar ancianos y justo cuando uno debe morir es cuando se puede decir, eres lo mejor que me ah pasado en la vida, alli se debe decir eso.. Yo mle digo, vaya ashley, no te conozco pero me alegra ver que pienses asi, de verdad, por un momento fue como si me escuchara, ella dijo, escuche que algo se caia y vine a ver que era y te vi, estube aqui una media hora, tranquilo, no comi tus frituras, solo lei tu diario, yo le dije ah bueno, pues yoooo, que es eso?, me interrumpio ashley, yo le dije, que cosa? ella se alo a 2 chicos, parecen de 18 y 15 a os, ambos altos y con cuchillos largos, yo le dije ven corre, sigueme!, ella asintio diciendome que no, yo le dije, estas loca?, si nos quedamos nos mataran, alli vienen, ella dijo, hay que robarlos!, ellos son del grupo needled 24/7, si los dejamos vivos su grupo, su maldito grupo crecera y eso no les combiene a los demas, no me llames por superheroina pero no puedo permitir eso, tampoco me conviene a mi eso, yo le dije, eres de algun grupo? ashley dijo, yo era de los aneurysmy..

Ashley y charlene corrieron hacia el que estaba en frente y charlene saco su navaja y ashley corria atras de ella con un cuchillo, cuando charlene le iva a cortas por el brazo el superhuman lo esquivo pero para eso estaba ashley tras charlene, ashley corrio y apu alo al superhuman en el corazon, charlene dio un paso atras, ashley retiro su navaja de el pecho del superhuman y se puso atras de el, de modo que el tipo estaba a su frente charlene y atras ashley, corrio charlene a terminar de liquidarlo pero el superhuman se agacho y golpeo a charlene cuando llego a el, ashley corio hacia charlene pero el superhuman la siguio y le lanzo una patada, afortunadamente la esquivo, si le hubiera dado de seguro la dejaria muy grave, charlene saco la pistola y le dio 4 disparos en el craneo dejandolo brotar sangre a chorros, le quedaban 4 balas pues la 5 bala la uso ya contra el otro super human, el disparo hiso que los otros superhuman fueran a donde estabamos, bueno ya igual estabamos preparados, ahora solo debemos enfrentar a esos 7 que vienen, moke dijo, bien y corrio hacia ellos igual que ashley y charlene... Ashley corrio hacia el primero barriendosele y lo tumbo al suelo, ella iva a degollarlo, pero el superhuman tomo el brazo de ashley , charlene ya ha matad corrio donde ashley, pero ashley con su otra manoapreto el cuello del superhuman lo mas fuerte que pudo haciendolo igual que el otro brotar sangre por cada orificio en el que pasaban sus dedos, esas chicas estan ba adas en sangre y al parecer les gusta, al menos a ashley, como le gusta degollar, ella se aparto de igual manera pues manchaba a gotas su sueter, charlene la ayudo a levantarse y voltearon a ver que hacia moke, ya el habia matado a 2, y solo queda 1, lo que es extra o, 1? uno? deberian haber 2 mas, en fin, cuando fueron donde moke el tenia el brazo mordido por uno de ellos, ashley corrio al que estaba tratando de subir a un tejado, imagino intentaba escapar, ella lo tomo por la espalda y con su navaja lo degollo, vaya por que no me sorprende, ha degollado tanto que ya es normal ver eso, oh espera, le dije a charlene, cuidado! atras de ti hay uno! ese me imagino salio de sorpresa, charlene le dio tiempo de sacar la pistola y le disparo en la pierna, justo hay moke saco su navaja y le dio cuantas veces pudo con su brazo derecho en el ojo y el corazon, el otro super human le mordio el brazo izquierdo, bueno, un suspiro de victoria por haber derrotado a esos fenomenos, no fue facil, oh almenos asi lo veo yo, esas criaturas razonan, ademas me parece que tienen mas sentidos de vista y oido que nosotros pues esquivan nuestros movimientos rapido, debo aprender mas de ellos, todos estamos bien a exepcion de moke que salio mordido, mebyib, no paraba de decir que es peligroso y alla y rescatarlos..

Seguimos caminando y hay esta!, por fin, la alcantarilla!, bueno libro que te puedo decir? es asqueroso pero es asi, al menos no tiene agua desagradable, esa es la ventaja, abrimos la alcantarilla y bajamos todos, bien ya entramos, esta oscuro pero se puede ver el camino, como describirla? tiene insectos, basura, periodicos, charlene dijo, eeeemm debemos llegar a la 6secta puerta, vamos.. Bueno librohay que rescatarlos, me importa houtt, ella es una de, no me equivoco, es la unica chica que haria que me preocupara si algo pasara, tiene algo que la diferencia de los demas y eso que todos somos unicos pero en si, me agrada mucho, y freddy lo conozco desde la preparatoria, son las 11:12pm, la noche transcurre lenta, como evaporar aceitem deseanos suerte si es que tienes, aqui vamos. Capitulo 10 que es esa cosa? pero houtt? tenemos a freddy. Caminamos por la alcantarilla, no te mentire libro, es un fiasco, esto por lo menos no esta inundado ni lleno de desechos, solo hay mucha, muchisima basura, varios periodicos y muchos papeles, oh vaya, que es eso, tomare ese periodico que esta hay, dice algo interesante.. Lo leere, dice: Titulo, que es eso?, hay que tomar precauciones y tener cuidado con esto que se esta experimentando, y no, repito, no estar SOLO, grupos de anti-sociales de la ciudad se quieren adue ar debido a la ezcases y problemas con el gobierno y los militares.. Libro este periodico es de hace 5 dias, que raro, bueno sigo,, ATENCION!, un loco suelto! salio del hospital psicologico tras haber presentado sintomas, tales como, dolor de cabeza, nauceas y sentirce euforico y muy energetico, la victima decia que escuchaba voces y podia oler a mucha distancia, el doctor rivera dice: Es muy importante la salud del paciente, para eso soy medico, el paciente de apellido soleda o, tenia algo muy similar al sindrome NO DOLOR, el cual es una falla de un nervio cerebral que impide al sistema nervioso hacer bien su trabajo sensorial, aclaro, el pasiente siente dolor pero de esta manera, Un ejemplo, si lo pica un mosquito, el dolor de la picadura es tan grande como fracturarse un pie, es lo contrario al sindrome, pero es lo malo, lo increible y mas cruel de lo que tiene el paciente es que tiene un 30% mas de sentidos que nosotros, como ver las cosas en la oscurar, oirte a mas de 40 metros, ve a larga distancia, en total es un 60% con mas coeficiencia en sus 5 sentidas que una persona comun, es una persona, por asi decirlo, eem mas exacta, pero la consecuencia es el tener que sentir el minimo de dolor es FATAL y lo puede llevar a la muerte. Aclaro, no tenemos por ahora la cura, solo tenemos medicamentos para medio calmarlo pero de nada sirve.. Hay 189 casos en sur america, no sabemos su origen, esta bajo observacion... Ya, ya veo, libro, las personas que estan por hay, son ellas, con esas habilidades, ah las que yo llamo superhuman, pues sus 5 sentidos son increibles, leo otra parte que dice, algunas personas con este nuevo sindrome, al sentir mucho dolor sus ojos se tornaran de colores aun no confirmados, ademas al estar bajo este efecto, pueden reconocer a las personas normales y sabes quienes son, pero ellos no recuerdan que son, no son zombies jaj, ellos son inteligentes, al igual que una persona sienten, pero un 90% mas fuerte que lo normal. Libro, maldicion, exclame, osea que a los que matamos, esos superhuman, que son personas con sentido? antes de enfurecerm dije, NO, no lo creo, ellos intentaron matarnos, asi que esos superhuman, pero, quisa su sindrome este mas avanzadol.. YA OLVIDARE ESO, olvidalo, OLVIDALO, grite en mi mente, ahora es rescatar a houtt y freddy, no mas, Ya llegamos dijo charlene, bien estamos en la 6secta puerta dijo ashley.. Charlene la abre con su llave hecha de alambre, salimos arriba hay un cuarto, subimos todos y para nuestro favor perfecto hay armas!, yo decido tomas una pistola de 9 balas, hay 3 pistolas mas, moke y mebyib toman una, la restante esa la tomo ashley, cuando volteo a mi derecha vi una gabeta extra a, la abro y hay una granada de mano, yo la tomo, la guardare, para algo debe servirme, al menos eso creo yo, estoy loco, pero me controlo. Bueno, tenemos la puerta de salida enfrente de nosotros, ashley abrira esa puerta, jaj estaba abierta dijo ashley, charlene salio primero ah revisar la zona, sali y vi fue un amplio lugar, como una refineria grande, no hay nadie, no veo a nadie, es extra o, de pronto al fondo se escucho AYUDA! MALDITOS DEJENME SALIR!,yo dije, esa voz, es de freddy, si es de freddy estoy seguro, corrimos todos alli, al llegar al salon hay barricadas al estilo de imitar carceles, como celdas, era freddy, yo le dije: Vaya, que mas? ya te vamos a sacar de aqui, escuche tu llamada y rescatar a houtt, el dijo, si, es una mierda esto, que esta pasando en esta ciudad, vaya mier... CUIDADO! dijo mebyib interrumpiendonos, yo me voltee, era un tipo gordo. Capitulo 10.1 continuacion anterior. Con un demonio, libro que es eso? ese tipo debe medir minimo 2 metros, es alto y gordo de brazos, no solo eso, tiene puesto un chaleco antibalas y un bate de beisbol, al parecer de metal el bate, el tipo dice: largo del prisionero, oh los voy a matar a todos clavando este bate de hierro en sus craneos mientras ven como los mato, en ese momento el golpeo una madera que estaba alli, de modo que la madera se fundio en mil pedazos, todos nos quedamos callados un momento, libro y ahora? como se puede derrotar?! es humano, no podemos atacarlo corriendo hacia el, que tan fuerte es?!, debe tener un punto devil, maldicion, preguntas inician a inundar mi mente a cada segundo, de pronto el el silencio se cae cuando charlene saca su pistola y dice, tengo sangre fria, y sabes que no podras con todos nosotros, el tipo dice algo saarcastico y burlon, puede que tengas razon, charlene dice no vamos ah poder todos contra ti es lo que tu crees, pero no es asi, ashley y moke deciden ir por el, ellos 2 sin razon, corren a darle una paliza, yo me quedo en shock, se que si nos ataca que es lo mas seguro que haga, habria que contraatacar, pero ellos 2 se corren con la idea de que lo detendran, este no es un superhuman, asi que no es facil, que de por si un superhuman no es facil de matar, imagina este tipo.. Moke ataca primero usando su navaja y intenta degollarlo el tipo con su brazo toma el brazo de mokey lo avienta, charlene corre ah ayudar, ashley le lanza una roca por el pie y lo distrae, charlene corre hacia el y logra clavarle la navaja, pero en un brazo, afortunadamente fue en el brazo derecho, donde tenia el bate, el tipo intento abofetear a charlene tras lo que le hizo con su otro brazo, pero no pudo, charlene esquivaba cada intento de golpe, yo maldicion no podia ir a ayudar, cuando iva a ayudar me gritaron, NO VENGAS, ESTA ALERTA DE FREDDY Y MEBYIB!, o rompi forzando la cerradura de la carcel donde estaba freddy, y le dije estas bien? el dijo, yo si!, pero hay que ir por houtt, el dijo, ella no esta aqui, como que no esta aqui?! dije.. freddy dijo, la tienen los cakes, cookies algo asi, yo intente detenerlos pero eran muchos, yo dije, bueno no hay que perder la calma, hay que ir por houtt y listo, dije, oigan chicas, alguna sabe donde es el grupo cokies? charlene dijo, yo no se done estan ellos, ashley dijo, yo no estoy segura, hasta donde recuerdo que fue hace 1 mes ellos estaban abajo de la plaza, bajo los escombros, pero como hubo una gran explocion no se si se cambiaron, dudo que no se hayan ido de alli,, bueno solo queda ir a averiguarlo, no hay de otra.. te preguntaras libro, que paso con el hombre gordo? pues veras ashley, le bateo la cabeza con su mismo bate mientras charlene esquivaba los ataques del hombre gordo, aunque el golpe de ashley no lo mato, charlene de varios golpes con lo que tenia a la mano, le golpeo en la cara, eso lo aturdio mas, el hombre gordo cayo al suelo y moke lo remato con una barra de hierro lo remato, fue facil, aunque se veia dificil, pero como dice el dicho las apariencias enga an. Bueno libro, creo que esta claro, debo estar por mi cuenta y claro por el grupo que esta ahora, cuando este solo, freddy me interrumpe y me dice, hay que rescatar a houtt antes de el sabado, antes de las 11:30 pm, en la noche, yo le digo, y eso por que? y freddy dijo, pues si, es que un grupo grande esta rescatando y refugiando a los perdidos y secuestrados de la ciudad, no tiene nada que ver con el gobierno, pero de seguro iran a rescatar a houtt pues nos dijeron que irian por nosotros cuando nos separo el grupo vomitos y cookies, el grupo grande se llama glass of world, ellos... Charlene interrumpio y le dijo a freddy, CLARO!, ese es el grupo al que mi grupo, ex grupo perdon, nos uniriamos, pero debido a la explocion perdimos contacto, y no se supo que hacer, y no los volvi a ver, freddy dijo, ahaha si, bueno ellos rescatan en la noche puesto que asi no causaran problemas, ademas serian menos notados, han venido 4 veces, a segun son 10 veces que vendran, pero no puedo asegurar eso, ha que estar pendiente de todo a cada rato, bueno hay que buscar a cokies ahora, venga vamonos.

Son las 6:21 am, dormir 3 horas no es suficiente, ni es bueno, pero al menos se recupera algo de fuerza, en fin el plan es dividirnos en parejas, como todos tenemos telefonos sera exelente para comunicarnos, la se al ah vuelto, asi estaremos divididos para encontrar al grupo cookies, moke y mebyib, ashley y charlene, freddy y yo, es hora, ya estamos listos, partimos cada uno al camino... Freddy y yo vamos por la avenida, y de alli pasaremos por el centro comercial livemol, cada grupo tiene su emblema, ashley me dio una hoja de su mochila que tiene los emblemas de los respectivos grupos para identificar la zona.. Bueno, buscamos a cookies, debe estar por algun lugar de galletas no? pues bueno para que ponen ese nombre jaj, freddy ve a varios lados pero nada aun, las calles sucias y paredes caidas, casas casi destruidas y algunos cadaveres por la calle, freddy dice, que caos no? todo por la ambicion y luego dicen que se aprende de los errores, el error esta en lo que viene, oye richk que es eso que viene? yo volteo a ver, y digo, pues, si mis ojos no me enga an, es un perro. Libro parece un perro, pero es muy grande para diferenciarlo, nos acercamos con sigilo hacia alla y decimos... QUE? what the fock QUE ES ESO?!, es una especie de perro, pero con.. con.. con.. con una deformidad, tiene su pelaje de color negro como el color de la noche universal sus ojos grises y sus pupilas amarillas, es de un tama o de una moto harley, su ocico esta lleno de sangre y a su lado hay cadaveres y organos humanos, freddy dice, no vamos a pelear con esa cosa, estamos como a 3 metros de distancia hacia el, nos estamos apartando, muy bien, pero cuando todo esta calmado siempre pasa algo, maldito, maldito telefono, maldicion, oh pero que? vaya mierda, sono el celular y esa bestia se volteo hacia nosotros, es imprecionante, parece que es un pitbull con pastor aleman, es increible, el blackdog, haci decidi llamarle, el black dog se levanta, nos empieza a rugir y muestra sus dientes, tiene unos dientes grandes puntiagudos y con ganas de matar.. Esa bestia se paro del suelo, y su rugido fue muy feroz, tanto asi que de los nervios dimos varios pasos hacia atras, aparte de que tenia sangre saliendo de su boca por lo que estaba comiendo el blackdog, freddy saco su navaja y yo no me quede atras, tambien saque mi navaja, no quiero usar mi pistola pues aria mucho ruido el sonido del disparo y eso llamaria la atencion, yo al igual que freddy saque mi navaja, no tengo tiempo para contestar el telefono, nos pusimos en guardia esperando su ataque, y asi fue, no tardo mucho, intento avalanzarze sobre mi pero lo esquive, el se golpeo contra unos bloques, al parecer no le causo mucho da o, pero algo si pude notar, es lento al atacar, fuerte si te contemplamos golpea, esa es su caracteristica, oh por lo menos, por ahora es asi, freddy ten cuidado! le grite para que se fuera de hay pues le iva a morder, era muy tarde, pero freddy tambien tiene agilidad y logro esquivarlo tambien, del impulso el blackdog cayo en un hueco, corri hacia freddy ycontemplammos la criatura en el krater? ? bueno es un minicrater,oohoh ya veo, dice freddy, aqui exploto la bombona de gas, yo digo, oh si, si es cierto, aqui tubo que ser, este crater es justo donde estaba la licoreria oh algo asi, CUIDADO!? el blackdog lanzo una piedra aventandola hacia nosotros, es impresionante!, la velocidad y fuerza que llevaba la pidra, como una de beisbol, la criatura la tomo con la boca y se impulsa al frente y la lanza con fuerza hacia nosotros, freddy dijo, no voy a moprir ahora y menos por una piedra, dijo freddy, debo hallar a houtt y luego protegerla si muero no la dejare debil en este caos que vivimos ahora, en ese momento freddy saco una granada peque a no mas grande que una pelota de tenis, le quito la argolla y dijo unas palabras, libro esas si son palabras... Siento mucho que tenga que matarte, eres un ser que sufre de la mezcla de odio y rencor, y lo unico que tiene en mente es matar y mutar, y ese es el peor castigo que alguien pueda ejercer, uno puede reemplazar el trabajo de alguien pero la vida de un hombre jamas, y mi trabajo puede ser reemplazado, quiza lo hagan mejor que yo, tratando de encontrar lo que busco, pero no igualar mi sudor por la realidad...Vaya palabras, pero tiene razon, si no lo matamos nos matara, freddy le lanzo la granada y corrimos hacia unos escombros, se escucho el estruendo BOOOOOOM acompa ado de un sonido de tristeza que dejaba salir la criatura, pagando con una sola muerte, la muerte de muchos. Capitulo 11 No puede ser.. Asi que nos salvas! :D Despues de 10 minutos salimos a ver lo sucedido, no habia ni rastro ni sangre solo un crater mas grande de lo normal, y las piedras y rocas que una vez estaban alli, ahora son cenizas y polvo en el aire. Freddy dijo, no me siento mal sabes?, esa criatura habia matado ah muchas personas oh no, de hecho, la muerte de el no es suficiente por la muerte de muchos.. Yo le dije, si es verdad, oye, una pregunta, y esa granada, donde la tomaste?, el dijo, pues jaj, la tome de los vomitos cuando me encerraron, yo le digo, oh, ya veo, yo tengo una algo mas grande eso creo, no me acuerdo de donde la tome, pero la usare en algun momento, el dijo, jaj si tienes razon, justo en ese momento sono mi telefono, no reconozco el numero de quien me llama, lo que agradezco es que menos mal que no hay enemigos y no puedo llamar la atencion, contesto y son moke y mebyib, dice: Hola richard? veras...Nos han atrapado, pero no son los malos! es un grupo grande y trae camiones con gente refugiada y salvada de la ciudad, nos llevaran a las reservas, es un lugar donde hay atencion medica y muchas cosas, de hecho se puede vivir alli, es muy chido eso, deberias venir con nosotros, en lugar de rescatar algo que quisa te traiga la muerte, piensa por dios!, yo le dije: vaya eso es exelente, pero no, no te comprometiste a ayudar en el rescate de houtt ahora? tu y moke? que paso? de seguro el camion paso y conociendote fuieste a donde estaba el, bueno no te preocupes, ya tenemos a freddy, ahora rescatar a houtt es facil, oh al menos eso creo con el animo que tengo, de todas formas, ve, asi estaras a salvo, yo mientras con la ayuda oh sin la ayuda de los demas voy a encontrar ese ''algo'' como dices, ese algo se llama houtt, y no, dios nada, no pienso en dios, pienso por mi es es real, ella dice, bueno como quieras, debo colgar, esperamos volvert... Se corto la llamada, le dije a freddy lo que paso y el me dijo, yo sabia que no ivan a soportar mucho, oh al menos mebyib, en todo caso, 2 menos.. Yo le dije, si, es verdad, 2 menos, libro, no creas que me siento mal, al contrario, creo que me siento mejor, con mas libertad, sin menos preocupacion, moke esta herido, quisa pueda enfermarse, y ella tenia panico, es lo mejor, eso creo, le dije a freddy, es hora de seguir por houtt hisy, hisy es su apellido, el dijo, claro que si amigo rocker, caminamos por la calle, semaforos y edificios, malditos edificios me asustan cuando se estan callendo, bueno la calle, esta destruida y en otros lados esta intacta, el viento soplar se podia escuchar con cada uno de nuestros pasos, como una cancion, como FADE TO BLACK al iniciar los primeros 2 minutos, el tiempo es gris, me eh acostumbrado al ver el cielo llorar, y estar con esa tonalidad, pobre cielo, llora por la eternidad, llora por nosotros, llora para mantenernos con una tierra fresca, llora para darnos agua, llora por nosotros, sin cesar, sin quejas, sin rencores, llora para salvarnos, de la desgracia, cielo, llora sin fin, por la eternidad, nubes negras moviendose lentamente, esperando los minutos para desvanecerse y mientras caminos y escribo siento que la vida, no se expresa con la voz, si no con las palabras. Vamos por la ciudad, en realidad lo que queda de ella misma, llevamos caminando 10 minutos y vemos un letrero que tenia dibujado KILLYOUMF, era claro, era el clan killyou, bueno no vamos a saludar por hay a ese grupo, cambiamos el camino, ahora vamos sigilosamente desplazandonos por unas rocas grandes y escombros, bien, hay esta el camino, el de la plaza zamur, vi la hora, son las 11:43 am... Nos sentamos un rato a pensar y a ver en que lugares podemos buscar, donde iremos ahora? freddy dijo con una risa, jaja, a menos que sea un jodido fantasma lo que vi richk, habra que intentar matarlo oh correr, que opinas deathmetal? puse cara de interrogancia y dije, de que hablas? que? el me dice, pues amigo mio, tal parece que el maldito blackdog esta vivo, o no lo se jaj, voltea y mira, yo sorprendido volteo rapidamente y no podia creerlo, joder como algo puede sobrevivir a una granada que explota procticamente frente a uno, nos levantamos y el blackdog se volteo a mirarnos, el esta como a 15 metros, parecemos pistoleros del oeste, yo le dije a freddy, bueno yo usare mis pu os, y el dijo, de verdad?.. Hablas. en serio? tus pu os? usaras eso en lugar de las navajas y las pistolas? yo le dije, se que es estupido y ilogico esto, pero si esa cosa sobrevivio a una granada, tiene mis respetos, y se que no tengo posibilidad de ganar, los que se han enfrentado a el, han muerto... En ese momento el blackdog camina despacio hacia nosotros, se esta acercando, yo le dije a freddy, y quisa le hayan disparado y esa bestia aun sigue hay, y se bien que no sera facil ganarle, creo que no podremos ganarles.. Se sigue acercando..Yo usare mis brazos y golpes, toda mi fuerza, cuerpo a cuerpo, no lo se, quiero luchar asi, quiero pelear asi sea una sola vez, si muero, morire a manos de la bestia mas temida de la ciudad, el black dog.. Tu como lucharas me volee a preguntarle a freddy, maltido imbecil! ni me escucho jaja, estaba reuniendo piedras y vidrios y cargando su pistola, mientras yo estaba hablando solo, y el me pregunto, y tu como lucharas? a pu os? yo le dije, pues no, yo.. Usare navajas tambien jaj, muy bien, a golpes no lograras mucho.. Libro te preguntaras por que no las pistolas? veras estamos cerca de los killyou y no podemos llamar la atencion con disparos... Ya estamos listos, volteamos a buscar el blackdog, pero no esta, de repente nos rugio detras de nosotros ahaha maldicion, tipico, que tipico, nos pusimos en guardia, muy nerviosos, pero asi como asi, cuando el blackdog corrio hacia nosotros, a los 2 segundo que corrio, solo vimos su cuerpo tirado en el suelo y mil pedazos de cesos del blackdog por el suelo.. Capitulo 12 Bueno, creo que esto empieza a acabar.. No puedo creerlo, el blackdog estaba muerto, la sangre fluia, y el cuerpo en el suelo al lado sus cesos, y escuchamos un maldicion, debi darle en una pata!, yo dije en mi mente, no puede ser, es.. HOUT?! eres tu? ella vino hacia nosotros y freddy la abrazo, le dio un beso y la reviso, le pregunto como estaba, si estaba bien, le dijo todas las preguntas posibles que le llegaban a la mente, mil preguntas en un segundo para saber si estaba bien, sin esperar a un segundo para tener respuestas, estas bien? , como saliste? estas bien? le repetia freddy, ella dijo, si estoy bien! no me violaron, ni me maltrataron, ni me golpearon, de hecho no me hicieron nada, ya calma estoy bien, luego se volteo y me dio un abrazo tambien, sabes algo libro? nos hemos salvado de dos cosas este dia, el blackdog, y el rescate de houtt, oh no es cierto? bueno freddy y yo le contamos todo lo que ha pasado, ella dijo luego que le hubiesemos contado, pense que tambien ivan a buscarme meyib y moke con charlene y ashley no? pero buen0o, asi es mejor, no lo digo por mal, no, solo que a mi parecer, moke tenia que cuidarla, y ademas tenia que ver su mordida en el brazo, pues pudo ser grave, quisa este infectado o algo por el estilo, ademas asi tienes mas espacio, para poder estar mas libre de preocupaciones, mientras mas personas, mayor preocupacion, pero creo que esta bien que se hayan ido, es una grandisima suerte que encontraran ese grupo, oh no es asi? yo le dije, pues si es verdad, creo que,, si es verdad, tienes razon, pero dime algo houtt, como hiciste para escaparte? si cuentanos dijeron charlene y ashley corriendo hacia nosotros con su parkour, llegaron repentinamente, yo dije, woo como nos encontraron? charlene dijo con un toque sarcastico, pues veras, aparte de la explosion, los disparos, otra explocion, decidimos venir a ver que sucedia, ademas no habia se al, de hecho no hay se al en los celulares y no podimos llamarte, en fin, aqui estamos... Yo les conte lo de moke y mebyib, en realidad no se impresionaron mucho, ashley y charlene no los conocian mucho, asi que al final de lo que les conte que me paso me dijeron, que en realidad asi estamos mejor, ashley dijo, si, ese chico estaba herido, ademas la otra chica se preocupa mucho, y eso, en fin es mejor para ellos, y creo que para nosotros, yo les dije, pues si es verdad, tambien es curioso, todos me han dicho que es mejor asi, yo creo que tambien es mejor asi, ad... Me interrumpi y le pregunte a houtt que jugaba con su pistola, le pregunte, oye hout y esa pistola oh escopeta? tu no usas la telepatia y la mente para torturar a las personas? con tono de broma dije. Ella dijo, con tono aun mas sarcastico de lo comun, oh no digas eso, eso es secreto, nah ahora uso esto, que es mas efectivo, freedy dijo, dame eso!, yo debo tener eso, buscando de que tu jugando dispares y nos mates, con tono de broma, quien sabe si te lavaron el cerebro y eres un psicopata? todos nos reimos por unos 20 segundos, hacia mucho tiempo que no podia reirme, que buen momento, en fin, ya son las 5:06 pm, y dije, oye hout, no te hagas la loca, y dime, como te escapaste? oh huiste? Ella dijo, bueno por donde empiezo, cuando cookies me separo de freddy y el se fue secuestrado hacia vomitos, yo como algunas otras personas nos unimos para huir y inventamos una distraccion de que alguien le daba un infarto, y pues aunque no lo crean, me toco ese papel jaj, yo dije interrumpiendola, pues claro!, como dudarlo, ella me lanzo una piedra y me despeino, tengo ya el cabello largo.. Siguio contando, pues me hice la infartada y entraron guardias a ver que pasaba, justo hay se formo un revuelto y salimos algunos y me quede vagando por hay, no tenia telefono, dormi en la heladeria que estaba por alla, y pues me enoje, no tenia helados, y le di golpes a los estantes, justo despues de varios golpes, salio una pistola al suelo, y desde entonces se mas oh menos como se usa esto, solo disparas, y luego disparas de nuevo, es automatica, de pronto hoy caminando al cenro vi a dos personas que ival a pelear con un peero enorme y decidi dispararle pero a la pata, pero era muy rapido y le di en el craneo, le vole los cesos, lo mate al menos, y vi que eran ustedes, y ahora estoy aqui.. Nos reimos otros segundos, charlene conto su historia, ashley tambien y freddy, son las 7:31 pm, debemos irnos a algun lado, pues esto es una plaza. Capitulo 13, corriendo, llegamos a un grupo nuevo, el fin?!

El se or lider la interrumpio diciendole: cual grupo? te refieres a fourten, miralos aqui!.. De pronto varias personas dijeron sorpresa!, alli estaban todos, oh algunos de la mayoria de fourten, el se or rescato a fourten, charlene empezo a llorar de la emocion, ella dijo con sus ojos aguados de felicidad, como contemplar lluvia caer en algun pozo y ver su reflejo en esas lagrimas, que sin duda alguna dice, si estare, estare en su clan, me unire a usted se or ANUMYOUS, EL SE OR DIJO, de maravilla!, y quien sera el otro oh otra sublider en mi grupo, bueno libro solo queda para el puesto ashley y yo, ashley dijo me gustaria unirme, pero creo que richard se lo merece, ademas yo me ire a la capital ma ana, yo le dije, pues ashley yo tambien me ire para alla, usalo ashley, ese puesto, te lo encargo, te lo regalo, ese puesto es para ti, la que ah matado a mas superhuman, tu eres mas fuerte, tu mereces ese puesto, ella se nego rotundamente a aceptar el puesto...

Contemplo cada una de todas las estrellas brillar, aunque tengo 2 ojos, puedo mirar y no preocuparme por que veo mas haya y nada les pasara, yo no puedo protegerlas, no puedo tocarlas, de hecho solo las veo cuando necesito mirarlas, de mirarlas de noche puedo, pero verlas de verdad que fluyen dentro del corazon haciendote creer mas lo que crees en ese momento sea tristeza oh felicidad, sea muchas cosas, pero en realidad, se notan mas cuando te sientes triste, oh, en mi caso, solo, ellas dejan en el corazon, unas marca que se borra poco a poco cuando te hacen llorar de creer mas y mas en eso, contemplarlas no basta, mirarlas brillar tampoco, mis ojos son como ellas, brillan con la luz, ese es el momento cuando me doy cuenta que soy una oh uno de ellas, pues cuando las veo me acobijan con las lagrimas que me hacen llorar y que nunca caen, ellas chocan alrededor de mi, hacen que me ahogue con muchos recuerdos pasando por mi mente, recuerdo cuando me sacrificaba, hay entendi el signiicado de esa palabra, por aquella chica, cada vez que me decian, no hagas eso, no te sacrifiques todo el tiempo, pero sabes libro, es mi inocencia, no puedo decir que no cuando me pide ayuda, me han dicho que siempre me ah usado, y aunque fuera, fuera, fuera asi no cambiaria nada en lo absoluto, lo mas triste que me ah pasado es aquella vez que era el a o pasado, el 13 de diciembre, estabamos todos, y yo parecia la mascota de su amo, era inocente, soy inocente, bueno cuando termino el dia, ella se fue, la estube buscando casi toda la tarde, por todo el colegio, para decirle solamente, hasta enero, felices vacaciones, te quiero.. me habia tomado muchisimo tiempo antes para decir solo eso, me tomo mucho tiempo reunir el valor de decirle eso, yo la conozco desde hace muchisimo tiempo, pero aun asi, necesitaba mucho valor para decir esas palabras, si la veia, no fue asi, ellas se fue, no me dijo por lo menos adios, soy su mejor amigo, ella me lo ah dicho, pero se olvido de el ultimo dia del a o que nos veremos, solo queria que me dijera con la mirada hasta luego, pero nisiquiera la vi, ese dia fue triste para mi, para mi valor, para mi, habia practicado desde el mes de noviembre como despedirme, tenia tantos nervios, queria que fuera una linda despedida, no, no, ella se fue, y la busque, decidi irme a mi casa despues que todos en el colegio se habian ido, con la tristeza mas grande, en mi cara, mis manos en los bolsillos, mirando al maldito suelo, y decirme, no vallas a llorar ahora richk, llora cuando tengas la noche y las estrellas...

Contigo. Capitulo 14, una nueva arma, la despedida. No estoy llorando, esta maldita pero maldita vez no tengo lagrimas para hacerlo, no puedo llorar sangre, mi cuerpo no quiere que muera ahora, mis lagrimas se secaron, creo que paso una sequia de felicidad, y solo, solo hay un sol de color rojo, enrojeciendo lo unico que queda de agua tristeza, quisiera llorar pero no puedo, esto es triste, puedo fingir una sonrisa, me gustaria, pero creo que ya me eh mentido tanto que nisiquiera mentirme y creerme puedo, no tengo ah nadien para contarle mis cosas, no eh tenido a una chica, nunca eh tenido a una chica, es como sentirse tan solo que ni yo mismo me hago compa lia, mi sombra viene cuando hay luz, pero cuando esta a oscuras, se pierde, me abandona, y aunque lo intente miles de veces tratar de levantarme el animo, jamas podre, mi destino, cargar con esto, es mi prueba, es mi realidad, estar solo...

Corri muy rapido y apenas di mi primer paso unos ya me habian visto!, estoy corriendo y ya todos me siguen, joder... Oh pero que bien! hay una caja, y si salto hacia arriba con fuerza y agilidad, lograre subir a esa casa, corro rapido pero unos de ellos empiezan a ir mas rapido, maldicion!, no voy a poder, me han acorralado, uno esta a mi derecha, y el otro a mi izquierda, los demas a mi frente, detras de mi esta una pared alta. Ahora que hago? de pronto 2 blackdog de el frente se avalanzaron hacia mi, yo me aparte y se golpearon muy fuerte de la pared, han quedado heridos, esa pared es muy fuerte, de concreto, pero aun no estoy a salvo, quedan algunos... quedan 6... creo que es hora de usar mi arma de fuego, saco mi pistola, y de inmediato me rugieron muy fuerte todos, yo apunte al craneo de uno y sin dudarlo le dispare, es sencillo, lo mate, los otros blackdog creo que se asustaron, creo que al ver a la victima muerta, yo aun tiemblo por haberlo matado, por el disparo claro, pero debia hacerlo, era yo oh ellos, y yo tengo una meta, ellos solo quieren matar y matar, reproducirse y seguir matando.. claro, es de costumbre esto, los disparon.. Los superhuman estan aqui, no voy a gastar balas, son 3 superhuman, ashley pudo con 4 y creo que 6 ella sola, charlene se cargo a 3 sola tambien, y moke sin experiencia mato a 2 aunque salio herido, yo creo que puedo.. Haber son 3 superhuman, un chico y 2 chicas, los 3 parecen de 19 a os, tal parece que son del clan cookies, tienen el emblema en sus chaketas... Sus ojos estan amarillos y su pupila negra, muestran sus dientes y le sale espuma, que asco, que rayos les pasa? como pueden estar vivos y hacer eso? noto que empiezan a apretar sus manos bien fuertes, intentan gritar, pero no pueden, empiezan a correr.. hacia mi, los 3... No dudare en usar mi nueva arma de mano, la activo halando la cuerda, y rapidamente sale una navaja, corro tambien hacia ellos, se detienen, el chico sigue hacia mi.. el chico me intenta golpear, yo esquivo su golpe con dificultad, no se como lo esquive, fue rapido, me sorprende esquivar eso... uso mi cuchillo y se lo clavo en su garganta, su sangre es mas roja de lo normal, el me ve, pero da pasos atras, aun esta de pie pero viendome con ganas de matarme, intenta avalansarse sobre mi pero al caminar se cae, que bien, lo logre... donde estan las otras chicas? las superhuman, no las veo, se fueron.. Bueno, no me importa, solo estare alerta, salve mi vida, y es lo que importa..

Al menos asi veo las cosas, cada vez es como un piano siendo tocado con hermosas notas y melodias que poco a poco llegan tocando la puerta del corazon, solo para tocar y bailar sin parar, los dedos del pianista estan sangrando, no pueden mas, el no llora, solo hace la melodia mas triste y sin ver hacia adelante el piano, baja solo la mirada, el puede cambiar el ritmo, pero no es el quien toca en realidad, el alma olvidada con sus recuerdos a poco a poco, suda sin parar, no quiere hacer mas, solo sigue, no tiene expresion facial, esta solo, con la melodia que emerge de su corazon, lentamente se apaga la luz de su alma, ya no tiene razon, esta muriendo de la manera mas triste, nadien puede verlo pero el se ve haci mismo llorando por dentro, las notas sonar como vidrio caer, al vacio de la nada, se ve tan lleno, adios pianista, ah muerto...

There will be a wide range of genres, but mainly comedy. Also, I'm British and am not very experienced with Americanisms, so if you see any problems, please point them out. Disclaimer: I own no Zombies. I own no land. It should be clear that I don't own a combination. /^*^ When Columbus awoke to thuds at his door, and a girl screaming, he was at least ninety percent sure something was wrong. The last thing he remembered was being in the van with Little Rock, Tallahassee and Wichita- Christa, even. Damn, he still had to get used to that. Anyway, they'd been driving down a road, a huge oil tanker had come out of nowhere and they had hit it head on. Of course he hadn't been wearing his seatbelt, and had been thrown through the window and, presumably, died. Except that he was here, now. Alive and well. If anything, that whole situation had reaffirmed Rule #4: WEAR SEATBELTS. And he was going to stick to that rule a lot more strictly this time. A lot more strictly. That brought him back to the present, as he got up from where he was sitting to go to the door. Tallahassee and Wichita- Christa, Christa – must have dragged him into a block of flats so he could recover. Strange, flats tended to be infested with zombies. Maybe it was an oversight? He answered the door – the screaming had words intermingled, so he was reasonably sure that it was a human out there – and mused that, for some reason, he recognized the voice. As he unlatched the door and pulled it open, a girl stumbled in. Wait, was that-!? \"406?\" He exclaimed, eyes bugging at the sight. \"What- what are you-?\" \"Please,\" 406 cried, hugging him around the chest and sobbing. \"Please, there was this old guy, and he was running towards me, and I thought he was, y'know, running away from something, or towards something, and then he was running towards me, and, and…\" \"He tried to bite you?\" Columbus said, still in shock. This had all happened before. How in the hell was he back again? Was all that a dream? But if it was, how did he dream exactly what was about to happen? What was going on? \"Y-yeah…\" 406 said, the steam going out of her. \"How did you know?\" \"I…\" Columbus hesitated, searching for an answer. \"I saw it happen, a few days ago.\" That was true. They had seen a zombie tearing into a body on the road a few days ago. Tallahassee had taken its head off with the edge of shovel as they drove by. Columbus was pretty sure that gave him zombie kill of the week. \"R-Really?\" 406 said, looking up at him with red eyes. \"W-what do you think it is?\" Her voice wavered, and she looked on the verge of crying again. \"I hate to say it, but, given the evidence…\" Columbus really didn't want to tell 406 it was zombies, but… \"I think it might be zombies.\" 406 didn't laugh. She looked like she might start crying again. \"Z-Zombies?\" Her eyes began to well up. \"Oh god… I got… I got bitten…\" Tear streaked down her cheeks, and she hugged him again. \"Well, I don't have any actual concrete proof, so…\" That was a blatant lie, he had very concrete proof – or did he? Was that whole life a lie? He desperately didn't want to think about that, but if it had been… How had he predicted the future so thoroughly? \"Yeah…\" 406 said, tears still pouring out of her eyes. \"I'm just gonna… go to sleep…\" Columbus nodded, and she laid down carefully on the couch. \"I'll keep watch.\" He said. Until you turn into a zombie and I have to kill you, he thought, but left it unsaid. He had a lot to think about. 406 fell quickly asleep, leaving Columbus with his thoughts. If he really had gone back somehow… Was that even possible? It broke every law of physics that he could think of, but if he had somehow predicted the future in a dream… Well, one thing was for certain. This time, he would make certain to keep Bill Murray alive. Maybe find a couple of Twinkies to warm Tallahassee up to him quicker. He was distracted with his thoughts that he didn't even notice 406 succumb to mad zombie disease, and the advanced necrosis that seemed to overcome her as her flesh rotted away. He looked up to see her jump at him, one hand clawing at his face and her mouth tearing a chunk out of his neck. Seriously? Was his last thought before Columbus, sadly, died. /^*^ Columbus awoke to sharp knocking at his door, and screams and pleas firing a barrage at him through the thin wood of the entrance to his apartment. ' What. The. Hell.' Was a pretty direct translation of his thoughts as he got up and moved to open the door. And standing there was 406. He was incredibly tempted to slam the door in her face at this point, but seeing a crying girl activated instincts that he hadn't even known he'd had. After going through, for a third time, the whole spiel of calming her down, sending her to sleep, but this time without mentioning zombies, he cracked open two cans of Red Bull and downed them both. Hopefully, he'd be awake enough to realize when she started to turn, and be able to kill her before she attacked him. And on that note, he went off to find a weapon. He'd worry about what the hell was going on later, when his life wasn't in danger. /^*^ It had been a rough couple of months. The zombie pandemic had hit everywhere, and things were looking bad. So far, everything had gone according to plan – or at least, exactly the same as it had last time. He'd been visiting a lot more candy stores though, and – to his delight – found a few Twinkies. He'd had to expand from the little roller case to something slight bigger to hold provisions. He wasn't giving up those Twinkies. He'd made it to the highway he'd been on before, and he thought he was roughly on time. Of course, there really was no way to be sure, so he was walking slowly. If anything, he was ahead of schedule, and this was good. Better to be early than late, as it were. It was another couple of hours before he heard the familiar sound of a motor in the distance. He looked back and, sure enough, there was that black Cadillac, with the big white '3' painted on the side. He'd never gotten round to asking why Tallahassee had that. He backed up to the kerb, waiting for it to drive by, and held his gun at the ready. He was pretty sure the big man wouldn't shoot him, but he was ready to mind his words just in case. The Caddy pulled up beside him, and the window rolled down. Columbus had his gone ready, his finger off the trigger just in case. Tallahassee had his gun pointed at him, but this time, Columbus wasn't trembling. Tallahassee stared at him for a few seconds, eyes considering him. Finally, Columbus remembered what he had done first time around, and held out a thumb. He could see Tallahassee struggling not to smirk at that, and considered it a personal victory. He hadn't noticed that the first time. If there had even been a first time. Tallahassee jerked his head to the side, and Columbus let out a relieved grin. Things were going well. He hurried round to the side door and pulled it open, hopping inside. \"Thanks-\" he cut himself off before he could say 'Tallahassee'. \"Thanks. Uh, anyway, my name's-\" As expected, Tallahassee cut him off before he could continue. \"Look, just stop. No names. I don't wanna get too familiar.\" He pulled his knife out and stored it by his boot, but Columbus decided not to mention the alcohol. He'd rather not waste Tallahassee's stash. \"So anyways, where you headed?\" Tallahassee grunted at him. \"Ah, Columbus. You?\" He asked Tallahassee. Not that he needed to ask. He already knew. \"Tallahassee.\" He said shortly. \"Well, Tallahassee and Columbus are both, uh, east.\" He began, but again, Tallahassee cut him off. \"Listen, Columbus, I'm not easy to get along with,\" he started, flipping his knife, \"and I'm sensing you're a little bit of a bitch. So, I give this relationship till about Texarkana.\" \"Really? You'll take me to Texarkana?\" Columbus said excitedly, just like he had the first time. \"That's great.\" \"You're a plucky little spitfuck, aren't ya?\" Tallahassee said dryly, then shrugged. Columbus fastened his seatbelt, and settled in, resisting the urge to tell Tallahassee to buckle up. As they drove off, Columbus reached into his bag. \"Hungry?\" He asked, looking up. Tallahassee shook his head, and Columbus resisted the urge to smirk. \"Okay. More Twinkies for me, then.\" Tallahassee's head slowly turned his way. /^*^ \"So what was your first?\" Columbus asked. Tallahassee had warmed up to him considerably after the Twinkies had been revealed, and Columbus felt like he could ask a question like that. See how Tallahassee took it. \"My first what?\" Tallahassee responded cautiously, mind whirring through possibilities. \"Y'know…\" Columbus fought down the urge to laugh at the look Tallahassee sent him. \"Your first kill.\" Tallahassee relaxed considerably at that. \"Hmm, lemme think…\" Tallahassee thought for a few seconds, then nodded. \"I remember, it was this one fat guy, came running at me out of nowhere. At first thinking, 'what the hell is this fat bastard doin'?' and then I see he's got blood comin' out of his mouth, bits of skin hangin' off, and lookin' real disgustin'. So I think back, and I remember a lot of weird shit going down a week back, and then I think, 'it's a fuckin' zombie'. So I pick up the nearest thing,\" here he picks up his machete, \"and I swing it, and the bastards head comes right off, no questions asked.\" Tallahassee glanced at Columbus, who was nodding, a respectful look fixed on his face. \"What about you?\" He asked. \"Me? Oh, uh, it was pretty much the first day of the whole thing, right? So, I'm in my apartment, no clue of what's going on, and I hear someone knocking on my door and screaming. I get up to go check it out, and it's this hot chick from room 406.\" Tallahassee nodded, grinning. \"So she tells me about this homeless guy trying to bite her, and I don't think anything of it. We lie on the couch, and she falls asleep. After a while I do too, and when I wake up, there's this horrible monster in front of me. She tries to kill me, and I go into the bathroom, pick up the toilet lid, and hit her across the face with it.\" Tallahassee let out a laugh, and Columbus grinned. He shook his head, and they drove on. /^*^ The Twinkies, eventually, ran out. Well, when Columbus said eventually, he meant in about two hours. Tallahassee wasn't good at the whole rations thing. They stopped at a grocery store, the same one they had stopped at in his first time around. Columbus didn't say anything when Tallahassee started talking about Twinkies, and he took care of the zombies, again, singlehandedly. Columbus was building up some serious respect for him. Once again, they came to the back of the store, and Wichita – Christa? What should he call her? … Better stick with Wichita for now, he thought – walked out, surprising them both. Oh right, Columbus thought, I forgot how fucking annoying they are at first. He was incredibly tempted to take the opportunity and actually pretend to shoot Little Rock – he had gotten quite handy with the gun, and could probably aim over her head. See how scared Wichita got. As Wichita gestured for Tallahassee and him to come after her, he propped open the fire escape with a cardboard box. Rule #22: WHEN IN DOUBT, KNOW YOUR WAY OUT. Y'know, just in case. He really didn't want to lose the Caddy again. He jogged after Tallahassee and Wichita, looking at the situation. Little Rock's fake tears, Wichita reassuring her, and Tallahassee standing there looking solemn. As he observed, Tallahassee walked over to him and explained the situation, after introducing Wichita and Little Rock. \"Just don't act weird, okay?\" He said, and made to walk over. Columbus pulled him back. \"Hey, I have a really, really bad feeling about this.\" He said. He wanted to one-up Wichita this time around, so that she'd have a little more respect for him, and he could accelerate the whole relationship thing. Hopefully. \"The hell you mean?\" Tallahassee asked. \"Well, don't you think it's weird? Little Rock looks fine, a bit teary, and Wichita looks a little bored.\" Tallahassee gave him a look. \"You're reading too much into it, kid.\" \"Look, just don't make me use the shotgun. Use your dinky little rifle.\" Tallahassee gave him a confused look. \"Look, it's pretty clear what she wants. Why would she invite us here if she didn't want something? Little Rock clearly doesn't want to turn into a zombie, and the way they're looking at us, I mean…\" Tallahassee nodded, jaw still set. He didn't like it. They went through the whole situation again, as in the first time round. But this time, Columbus stepped back, allowing Tallahassee to step in and pull out his rifle. HE shook his head, aimed it, and- \"Wait!\" Wichita jumped in. \"I-I'll do it.\" At Tallahassee's look, she added, \"Please.\" Tallahassee reluctantly handed over the rifle. Wichita took it, and, here it came, she- Pointed the gun at Columbus. \"We'll take your guns, car keys, ammunition, and any food you've got on you.\" She smiled pleasantly. Columbus tightened his jaw. \"Now wait one fucking second here,\" He said, and stepped forward. He raised his gun, hoping to create a stalemate, only for Wichita to whip towards him, pointing the gun at him. Her finger brushed across the trigger, and a deafening noise rang out. There was an intense pain in his gut, and he fell to his knees, suddenly weak. \"What… The… Fuck…\" He wheezed, slumping to his side. Little Rock snatched she shotgun from his unresisting hands, and stepped back, shaking. This was clearly the first time she had seen an actual human shot, instead of a zombie. Wichita was staring at him in shock, one hand going to her mouth. Columbus attempted to speak, but instead he coughed up a mouthful of blood. Tallahassee was crouched beside him, pressing his hands over the wound, a grim look on his face. \"Hey…\" Columbus coughed out, and Wichita came a few steps closer. \"Christa… Fuck… You…\" Wichita stepped back in shock, and as Columbus succumbed to the darkness, he let out a pained laugh. Life was shit. /^*^ There was a rapid knocking at his door, accompanied by please and screams. Columbus twitched, then calmly stood up, picked up his computer, opened a window, and threw it out. \"FUCK!\" He yelled, infuriated and breathing hard. \"FUCKING WHORE BITCH!\" He was right back where he started. /^*^ So, that ends that, You have my apologies, readers of my other works. I watched Zombieland yesterday, and my muse wouldn't shut the fuck up about it. If you've read my other works, and came here from there, you have my sincerest apologies. I know it's been ages since I updated SS or BnK, and I apologise. SS may be retconned – I'm waiting for the results of the poll I put up, which might take forever. I am partway through the next chapter of BnK, but don't expect much for a while. I will come back to it at some point. In any case, the point of this Zombieland loop thing is, in essence, my attempt to turn Columbus into a badass. So if you're not a fan of that sorta thing, best to stop reading now. Thank you.[Chapter 2] Holy shit its been a while. You can thank Grochek1 for this, he mentioned an interest, and lead me to some other Loop stories, and I thought man, I have to get back to this. So here it is. Chapter 2 Columbus had gone through the whole goddamn ridiculous thing again and again, each time culminating in Christa and Little Rock getting trapped in the amusement park – although he was usually able to keep Bill Murray alive, that guy was hilarious – and each time, each, freaking, time- he had died. And woken up right back where he started. Now he was an old hat at zombie-killings, able to give Tallahassee a run for his money on a good day. He was due a vacation away from those guys. Even though he had eventually warmed to the three of them, they were downright annoying when they first met. This loop, he had decided, was just going to be filled with the sweet, sweet music of zombie death. That in mind, he wrenched open the door to see 406, and swept her up in a deep kiss. Him and Christa had been able to get a lot of practice, so he was fairly confident in his ability to leave her breathless. She pushed hard against his shoulders, breaking away from his kiss. \"What the hell, you creep?!\" She cried out, rubbing her forearm furiously against her mouth. He ignored her, instead going into his closet to find what he was looking for. He didn't have any guns, unfortunately, but he did have some blunt weapons. Seizing up a baseball bat, he hefted it in his hands admiringly. \"Yeah, this'll do.\" He said, smiling absently. \"Do for what?\" 406 said warily. \"Oh, are you still here?\" Columbus said airily, glancing at her momentarily. She spluttered. \"Help yourself to whatever you need. I'll just be out there, splattering some zombie brains. Ciao!\" He ducked outside. /^*^ Today had been a good day. He had set up a deckchair in the middle of the street, slightly leaned back so that he could have a nap in between zombie attacks, and the baseball bat clutched loosely in his left hand was virtually covered in blood and brains. The many bodies strewn across the street indicated just how long he'd been at this, if the bone-deep ache in his batting arm didn't. He heard a noise, a groaning, in the background. Sitting up slightly, he raised his sunglasses and peered down the street. There was another horde approaching. Columbus sighed happily and got to his feet. Setting himself in an exaggerated batter's stance, he raised the baseball bat in the ready position, and wriggled in anticipation. \"Batter up!\" He called out loudly as the first zombie, a fast one, reached him. He lashed out with his baseball bat and knocked the zombie's head clean off his shoulders. \"Woo! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!\" He crowed in excitement. There were three in a row approaching next, so he jabbed the middle one in the stomach and sent it stumbling back, knocked the left one's knees out from under it, and pirouetted into an overhead swing that pulped the right one's head. Taking a moment to kill the other two, he readied himself for another wave. The rest of the loop passed in happy contention for Columbus, at least until he was overcome by a particularly large wave of zombies that tore him limb from limb. /^*^ When Columbus woke up again, it wasn't at his home. He was staring at a white ceiling, and getting up revealed a very different room than he was used to. What the fuck? There came a knock at his door, and a British-sounding voice spoke up. \"I'm just going to the corner shop mate, do you want anything?\" \"Uh, could- woah, that is weird.\" He paused upon hearing the British accent come out of his mouth. \"Could you tell me what is going on, please?\" There was silence for a moment, then a muted ruckus outside, followed by furious whispering. \"All right, just, erm, hang on a moment.\" The voice said again. /^*^ \"So this is your first fused loop?\" Shaun asked, taking a sip from his glass. Him and Ed had gotten Columbus a couple of pints of lager for the explanation, which Columbus was greatly looking forward to. Finally knowing what the hell was going on would stop him from going completely stir-crazy. \"Yeah. I was wondering if I was going to have to live through those loops forever, I mean...\" Columbus shivered. Shaun nodded sympathetically. \"Well, this is a zombie loop, so-\" \"Hey, so was mine!\" Columbus said, sitting up. \"In America though.\" \"Hmm.\" Shaun said thoughtfully, as Ed returned with another round of drinks. \"Alright lads?\" Ed asked, sliding another pint over to Columbus. He took a sip politely, but I didn't really taste that great. \"Yeah,\" Shaun said, taking a drink from his glass. \"Turns out Columbus here is from a zombie loop as well.\" \"Ooh,\" Ed said. \"Maybe they actually take place in the same Universe, and you just got transferred over here?\" They were silent for a moment, contemplating that thought, before Shaun started talking again. \"Anyway, as I understand it, there's this thing called 'Yggdrasil'-\" \"The World-Tree?\" Columbus said, confused. \"Yeah. Except it's not a myth, it's some kind of server containing the multiverse. It's run by all the gods we thought were mythical, but something went wrong.\" \"That doesn't sound good,\" Columbus muttered, taking a deep draught from his drink. \"It isn't. Basically, in order to fix the problem, whatever it is, they set a bunch of worlds to 'Loop' so that they had time to fix it. In order to maintain stability or something, in each world there's an Anchor, the first person to start looping.\" \"That was Shaun here, but I started soon after.\" Ed cut in, as Shaun took another drink. \"Basically, after a while, other people will start Looping as well, usually those you were close to in the original loop.\" \"But no-one else in my world has started looping yet.\" Columbus said, brow furrowed. Shaun shrugged. \"These things can take time. It should be soon though – people are normally awake before your first fused loop.\" \"Right, you mentioned those. What are they?\" Columbus asked. \"Well, sometimes, a world crosses over with another world. We haven't had many, but we were lucky enough to meet some of the more experienced loopers, and they taught us a few tricks.\" Shaun held his hand up in front of him, and a cricket bat suddenly appeared in his hand. \"What the fuck?!\" Columbus exclaimed, leaping to his feet. \"It's called a subspace pocket.\" Shaun replied calmly. \"I'm not really that good with them, and Ed here is utterly hopeless.\" \"Never really got the hang of it myself.\" Ed said, before finishing up his drink and pointing at them. \"Another round?\" Columbus sank back into his chair. \"Sure, why not.\" He said. \"It's not like this day can get any crazier.\" He paused. \"So how do you do this 'subspace pocket' thing, anyway?\" Shaun grinned. /^*^ Columbus was... Well, not happy to be back in his home universe, but certainly relieved. Him, Shaun, and Ed had gone on a drunken rampage through throngs of zombies, happily swinging and putting them down with wild abandon, until the police had turned up. Ed still got turned into a zombie, but Shaun told him that that happened pretty much every loop. He'd gotten the subspace pocket down, for the most part. He wasn't able to store very much in there, but Shaun had told him that that was just natural, and that he would get better the more he used it. Currently he had a pump-action shotgun in there, for emergencies, and was carrying a rifle over his shoulder. He had decided it would be nice to meet Tallahassee and the gang again, so he was walking down the highway, waiting for the Caddy to show up. And there it was, rumbling down the road again. It pulled up next to him, and the window rolled down, Tallahassee's gun pointed directly at his face. Columbus already had his gun at the ready. Just as he remembered, Columbus jerked his thumb out to hitch a ride, and Tallahassee rolled his eyes. \"Get in, Columbus.\" Tallahassee said, then froze. \"Wait, what?\" Columbus said. Was Tallahassee Awake? \"Uhh...\" He stuttered a couple of times, then forced a chuckle. \"That's just something I call new people I meet, because... Uhh...\" Columbus held back a laugh. \"Tallahassee, don't worry about it. I remember too!\" Tallahassee blinked. \"Well, you better get in, and tell me what the hell is going on.\" \"The first thing you need to know is that there's this thing called Yggdrasil...\" /^*^ After explaining to Tallahassee what was happening, and teaching him the subspace pocket trick – he was even worse at it than Columbus was – they were driving down the road again. \"Oh yeah, I almost forgot.\" Columbus reached into his bag, searching for a moment. Tallahassee glanced over to see what he was looking for, and his eyes widened when he pulled it out. \"Twinkies!\" \"... Boy, you do not wanna know how much I wanna kiss you right now.\" /^*^ Him and Tallahassee enjoyed several days of hanging out, talking, and sweet zombie death. When Columbus told him some of the things he had gotten up to on his loops, including the few days of sitting in the street for a few days to kill some zombies, Tallahassee threw his head back and laughed. They decided not to head straight for Little Rock and Christa's place, instead spending a few days extra to clear out a small town of several zombies. \"Y'know,\" Columbus said, as he pulped the head of zombie. \"We could set up our own community here. Start building civilization back up again. Like they do in other zombie movies.\" Tallahassee looked at him. Columbus shrugged. \"Just a thought.\" They were back on the road a few hours later, but Tallahassee was oddly pensive. They met up with Little Rock and Christa, but they weren't Awake, which was disappointing. Still, this time they managed to prevent the fiasco that had happened originally – Tallahassee had gone and called their bluff, asking them to prove that she was bitten. He and Columbus had raised eyebrows when they saw her unblemished skin. \"Alright, fine. She wasn't actually bitten.\" Christa rolled her eyes. \"But we needed to get out of here, and some poor schmuck was bound to believe us at some point.\" \"Well, we can't just leave ya here to trap anyone walking by who more stupid than us.\" Tallahassee smirked, and Columbus barely restrained himself from laughing out loud – they'd long since come to realise the humour of the situation. \"Why don't you come with us?\" Little Rock and Christa frowned, then huddled together to confer. Him and Tallahassee withdrew as well. \"So what now? Just keep driving until... what?\" Columbus asked. \"Well, I figure we pick up Bill Murray – if you can keep yourself from shooting him this time – Then we set ourselves up a nice little home. See if we can't rebuild society, like in those other zombie films.\" \"Speaking of Bill Murray, this reminds me of that movie, Groundhog Day.\" Columbus said. Tallahassee thought for a moment. \"So it does. I wonder... do you think Bill'll start looping?\" \"I hope so. That would be so awesome.\" Columbus said, grinning. \"Although it'd be kinda trippy for him to actually be taking part in something so similar to his own movie.\" They were cut off from further talk by Christa and Little Rock breaking up their conversation. \"Alright, we'll go with you guys. For a while at least- we'll see how it goes.\" \"Alrighty then. I'm Tallahassee, this is Columbus, we name ourselves on where we're goin'. You two would be?\" Christa glanced at her sister. \"I guess I'll be Wichita, and this'll be Little Rock.\" \"Alrighty then. Hop in the Caddy and we'll be on our way.\" /^*^ Well, uh, that's a wrap. It's been a long freaking time since I watched Zombieland, so the characters might be a little off. Lemme know what you think, and I'll hopefully be able to get another chapter out soon. ","Summary":" GroundZombie Day: The Movie In which Columbus finds himself right back at the beginning of the movi"},{"Movie":"Zombieland","Title":"Omega strenght","Author":"mk94","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10939026","Passage":"[Chapter 1] There was one thing the survivors knew about Columbus. Columbus was no normal omega. \"When do you get into heat?\" Little Rock, the youngest alpha in the group once asked him one evening. The other two alphas glared at her for her crude question. Columbus, besides blushing furiously, looked nervously at her. \"Well, actually…\" he looked at the other two and grew even redder. \"Never mind…\" he said and went to the car, going to sleep. Little Rock received a clout. \"Do never ask an omega when the heat is coming!\" Wichita scolded angrily. \"Why not?\" \"It's very intimate. Either we can smell their heat or they tell us. And they would only tell us if they want us to spend it with them.\" The older sister explained. \"But we traveled for four month now and he should have at least once gone into heat, don't you think?\" Little Rock asked, clearly at lost what's wrong with their only omega in the group. Tallahassee and Wichita switched glances, also at lost about Columbus. … It has been a week since the incident and everything was back to 'normal'. Columbus and Tallahassee were wandering around a supermarket, searching for supplies and maybe some zombies to slay down. \"Hey…uh…maybe-\" \"You also want to know about my heat?\" Columbus interrupted annoyed. Tallahassee didn't answer, just acting as if he is searching for walking zombies. \"Ok, you want to know?\" Tallahassee turned to the young man, irritated by his outburst. \"You want to know? Ok, listen to this…\" Columbus snapped angrily. \"I can't go into heat, there, now you know! I never had my heat! I don't know how it feels like! Awesome right? An infertile omega as last survivor with two alphas and one child! And you only wait to fuck me, right?\" Columbus shouted angrily, pointing his finger at the confused alpha's chest. \"And you know what!? Forget it! I don't care! All the time an omega is treated like some softy! But I survived this shit here! Would a softy omega manage this!?\" Suddenly a zombie shot out and sprinted over to them. Columbus rudely took away Tallahassee's skillet and threw a hard punch at the undead's head. \"Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking you little shit!\" The teen yelled and threw many more punches at the zombie. The red neck watched the teen smashing the undead into a pulp. He smirked at the teen when he huffed, tired of his outburst. \"I'm sorry…I-\" \"Don't be, jus' happy that you let your stress out, ya know?\" Columbus gave him a week smile, nodded and walked past him. \"I'm checking on the girls…\" Tallahassee didn't know what overcame him. Suddenly he felt damn horny. He watched the omega walking out of the shop. Columbus smelled…very arousing. But the teen was clearly not in heat. Any other omega would be panting and crying for an alpha to claim him or her. Columbus obviously not. \"But his scent…\" Tallahassee shook his head. \"You just didn't get laid for a long time now, that's all,\" the alpha said to his crotch. But the whole week, he felt the torture. And not only him. Also Wichita seemed restless. \"Damn, do you smell him? Am I imaging?\" But Columbus didn't seem to notice any of it. Then, it was over. Just over. As if nothing ever happened. In the end, both alphas just agreed that both just imagine it and tried to forget it. Another two month went by, and obviously, their omega didn't go into heat. And only Little Rock was bothered by it. \"Don't you want to know why? I mean, that is really nagging my mind!\" But both alphas snapped at her to stop it already. Columbus just blushed as Little Rock asked him again. \"I don't know, ok?\" He simply stated and left, going into a shop to gather some warm clothes. Weeks flew by and Little Rock was nagging the omega to no end. Till he had enough. \"That's it!\" He snapped at her. He pulled her away from the others, who sit at their little fire in the empty house, and took her into a room. \"Ok, I will tell you everything I know but then you stop your questions, got it?\" \"Got it.\" Columbus nodded, still angry of the whole situation. He walked around till he just sat down on the old bed, sighing, \"My parents were Betas…and the greatest scaredy cats ever. So having an omega like me was stressful for them. When they noticed that I didn't go into heat like I'm supposed to do, they took me to a doctor. Well, he just said that I just won't ever get into heat which means I can't get bonded. That happens to few other omegas too. The problem is, while other omegas normally would freak out by this fact, I didn't. It just felt like 'I just will find my right Alpha and then I went into heat', you understand?\" Little Rock started to nod but then shook her head. \"What I mean is, that while other omegas are losing hope, I think that the right Alpha will show up eventually.\" \"Oh…so you didn't believe the doctor…\" \"No, I didn't believe him. And I almost fell into heat, I think-\" \"Wait, what do you mean with 'Almost'?\" Columbus sighed. \"There was that alpha in high school. He always was mocking me and making fun of me. But…I liked that…not in the masochist way! I had his attention and his alone. When he tried to beat me up…I had fun fighting him, showing him that he should try harder to claim me-I mean beat me up!\" Columbus corrected weakly, blushing to talk about that to a child. \"But then, he had another omega, his girlfriend…\" he sneered. \"He stopped with everything we had. And then, I didn't know how it happened. It was kind of a black out…\" \"A black out?\" Little Rock asked curious. \"You can talk about this with Wichita. It's like losing yourself but still be conscious of your actions, you know? It happens mostly to the alphas but also the omegas. Anyway…after a week and he still had this omega….I came to school….\" Now he would do this. He would show Donny that he had chosen the wrong omega. He went into the school building and immediately felt the looks on him. Obviously, because he was dressed in lose green shirt with seductive tight black jeans. His neck was free to see only to invite him for wonderful mating. His parents would freak out if they know what he was doing. \"Donny!\" He shouted over to the jock. Donny and his little omega were making out in the hall, not hearing him. Columbus made an annoyed sound, ignoring the open looks from the other alphas. He walked over to them and rudely pulled the girl away from his alpha. \"What the hell?\" \" If you would be so kind and get your hands of him. Thank you.\" The girl glared at him furious. Donny looked at him angrily. \"Who do you think you are!?\" The girl snapped, moving to punch him. \"I, my little omega, am his…\" Columbus growled, catching her fist easily. She gasped in shock. \"Let her alone you freak!\" Donny growled angrily. \" And let you go off with a weak omega like her? I don't think so,\" Columbus chuckled mockingly, shoving the girl away harshly against a locker and turning to his soon-to-be-mate. \"I want you, Donny. Show me how much you want me…\" Columbus smirked as he saw the aroused look on his alpha. The other omegas and betas around all hid away from them, the girlfriend sitting on the floor, not daring to move. The other alphas where also very aroused of the scene. \"Come on…show me.\" Donny attacked him, smashing him against the lockers. Then he smelled his neck thoroughly, which made Columbus moaned happily. But Columbus is a strong omega. A strong omega who wants a strong alpha… He pushed the jock away. Donny gave him an irritated look. Columbus cocked his head to the side. \"Show me you deserve me…\" And Donny attacked again. He tried to punch him, but the omega easily dodged them. He tried to grab him and pull him to the ground, but Columbus freed himself every time. \"How about round two?\" Columbus chuckled playfully, throwing a clean punch against the alphas face, triggering the alpha's instincts. Donny screamed at him, this time managing him to pin him against the lockers. But when he leaned down to bite him on his neck, the scent driving him crazy, a strong hand pulled at his hair. \"Do you think this is a game…?\" Columbus asked angrily, clearly insulted. He pushed the alpha away from him. \"If you want to mate me, take it seriously…\" The alpha shouted again, but Columbus was angry now. He dodged the jock's punches and kicked him in his leg, making the other teen falling to his knees. Then the omega then pressed his foot on Donny's chest, pushing him to the floor. Donny stopped fighting, just panting and looking at him with a scared expression. Columbus grimaced at that. \"You're a disappointment. You are not worth it.\" He then looked at the students and teacher around him. The other alphas didn't dare to make a move at him, his scent too strong. He then looked at the girlfriend of the weak alpha, \"Keep him. You two fit perfectly for each other…\" \"Doctors said, I broke his leg. Well, since then…I was the freak in school…and no one wanted ever to mate me- DATE me! No one wanted to date me…\" Columbus mumbled, blushing again and looking away sadly. \"Since then I never felt…in that kind of heat…\" \"Wow…I so have to tell that the others!\" Little Rock shouted, making a run for the door. \"No!\" Columbus shouted but somehow, he couldn't stop her. \"Damn, that child is fast!\" Columbus cursed. Now the other alphas will know…how embarrassing! … As the group packed up their things to travel on, Wichita walked up to Columbus. She didn't manage to say something because Columbus already started, \"I don't want to talk about it.\" \"But Columbus! Don't you think it's unhealthy-\" \"Unhealthy! PAH!\" He snapped, \"you just want to fuck some omega, am I right?\" Before she could reply, Columbus interrupted, \"why do you want to talk about my heat?\" Wichita didn't answer. \"I thought so…\" Columbus finished and climbed into the car. Wichita glanced over to Tallassee, and both got the scent of the other's. They both now were rivals. … Columbus knew that he was the cause of this. It has been two weeks since they knew his secret and since then Tallahassee and Wichita started to fight. At first, they were just teasing and annoying each other. After a while, they began to snap for each simple little mistake the other alpha made. And now they actually yelled their lungs out for the stupidest things like where Wichita left the bottle of beer or where Tallahassee's Twinkies are hidden. Columbus sighed and left into the old hut they chose to rest in. Little Rock watched the other two alphas nearing each other aggressive. \"Ok, now we have to deal with this shit once and for all!\" Wichita growls. \"What, don't can't stand his scent or what, princess?\" The redneck smirked. \"Come on, grandpa, you are just as aroused as I am!\" the female alpha snapped angrily. Tallahassee grumbles annoyed. \"Ok, but I try first-\" \"What!? No! I will-\" Both were shoving each other away from the house. Wichita fell and Tallahassee ran towards the little hut, quickly entering it. Little Rock giggled as she watched her sister groaned annoyed. \"Well, looks like Tallahassee wins…\" the youngest chuckled. Suddenly, crashes were heard. Things got broken. They heard Tallahassee's screams. And then, Tallahassee flew out of the window. Wichita quickly wrapped her arms around her sister, keeping her save from the glass shards. Tallahassee coughed lightly, slowly standing up, pulling few large shards out of his bleeding shoulders. The door was kicked open by the omega, a very aggressive omega. Columbus walked out calmly, with his pullover wrapped around his waist and his oversized blouse ripped half open to reveal his pale chest and neck. \"What's up? Already tired?\" Columbus asked, walking confidently over to the other and shoved him by the chest. Tallahassee just growled and grabbed the teen's wrist and pulled him to himself. Columbus gasped as the older man sniffed again at his neck, stroking his hair while doing so. But Columbus is tuff. He pushed the alpha away, grabbed his arm and flipped him over. Tallahassee grunted and stayed on the ground. Little Rock saw Wichita smirk at the unconscious Redneck and walking towards the omega. \"I'm so sorry guys!\" Columbus whined, nursing the injuries of the two older alphas. They sat around the fire, Tallahassee bandaged around chest and shoulders and with a Twinkie as apology while Wichita, also bandaged around shoulders and leg just as head, she got a half cold bottle of wine pressed to her forehead. \"Really, guys, I'm so sorry! I don't know what came over me-\" \"The heat.\" All alphas replied simply. Columbus blushed at that. \"I was not in heat…\" \"Sure…\" Little Rock chuckled. \"But I never saw an Omega like you…\" Wichita spoke up. Columbus blushed and looked back at the fire. \"I don't know what's wrong with me.\" \"But when you think about it, Columbus can be happy for that, right?\" Little Rock asked. When the others looked at her confused, she sighed. \"Think about it. When everything was fine, of course Columbus didn't fit. He is an aggressive omega if you could say that. Now in a world like ours now, Columbus can defend himself because he even is more on defense when he gets into heat. Look around! Do we see a normal omega around here? No! Because sooner or later they went into heat and had no way to fight!\" She looked at their friend. \"You can be happy to be able to beat up some ass!\" Columbus chuckled and the older alphas smiled in realization. \"Well, now that this is cleared…\" Tallahassee spoke up, \"I will have to work harder to mate you!\" Columbus' smile disappeared. \"What?!\" \"You heard me. You and me. Mating.\" The redneck smirked seducing at the teen. \"Well, I won't try again!\" Wichita chuckled, rubbing her head,\" your foot still hurts.\" \"Y-you mean…You want to m-mate…? …with me? Why?\" Tallahassee smiled at him softly. \"I have my reason, boy.\" Columbus suddenly stood up. \"You ass will then have to be more than a show off to be worth mating with!\" He snapped his mouth shut. \"Sorry! I don't know what overcame me!\" \"Simple, that man turns you on.\" Wichita points at the smirking maniac. Columbus chuckled, blushing still and sat back. Everyone then talked about other stuff. The curly haired boy was happy that his omega gender was not the center of attention anymore. … The group panted tired, watching Columbus running into the crowd of furious zombies. He smashed their heads with cooking gloves, kicking legs away, screaming all along to attract them all. As one zombie managed to be near enough to bite the omegas hand, said-hand grabbed its jaw, his other hand its upper jaw and ripping it off. He ripped of one zombie's arm and slammed it at the others. After a while he took out a gun and finished the rest of. He panted heavily, covered in dirt and rotten blood. \"Never was that happy to have a half-heated omega with us…\" Little Rock whispered to the others who just nodded. \"Ok, wish me luck…\" Tallahassee said, walking confidently over to Columbus. Columbus glared at the other, pointing his gun at the alpha. \"Don't you dare…\" Tallahassee just huffed and moved forwards… … \"What were you thinking?! You idiot! I could have killed you!\" Columbus yelled at the redneck, who got bandaged for his shot in the shoulder. \"Well, but you didn't. Now let's not talk about it… \"You idiot…\" Columbus said, brushing the man's shoulder. Tallahassee could swear he heard the omega purring content. … \"Why don't you just give up?\" Columbus chuckled amused, opening his shirt a bit, to show off his neck. Tallahassee growled aroused. \"I hav' ma reasons, spitfuck!\" he shouted attacking the other by grabbing the teens shirt, ripping it off. He became dizzy, quickly losing Columbus out of his sight. And then, he lay on the ground, face to the ground, Columbus' feet triumphal on his back. \"Maybe next time…alpha…\" Tallahassee watched Columbus walking away, slightly waving his hips. \"That boy will be the death of me…\" … \"Why are you still trying!?\" Columbus whined, nursing another bruise from the alphas face. He ignored the giggles from the girls. \"Accept that it won't work.\" \"No,\" the redneck stated. Columbus blushed. \"I want to mate with you, boy. And I mean it.\" The girls stopped giggling; now listening closely. \" Do you mean…?\" \"I like omegas who can go on their own…my wife was also like that…\" Tallahassee said quietly. \"My puppy would have been also like his mother. A strong omega…\" He rubbed his neck frustrated by his memories. \"Just so you know…I like you as Columbus, not as strong omega only. You can be a wimp…\" he chuckled as Columbus glared at him weakly. \"But you can be trusted and obviously stronger than you look like…you can be adorable, you know?\" Before Columbus could reply, Tallahassee sighed annoyed, \"enough smooch talk, I need some zombie to kill!\" … It has been two month ago since Tallahassee's confession and he still didn't manage to dominate the omega. One morning, Columbus was nowhere to be found. \"Guys? Where is Colly?\" Wichita asked worriedly. Little Rock woke up from her nap, tiredly looking around. \"Columbus!\" Tallahassee shouted. But there was no reply. \"COLUMBUS!\" They screamed but nothing could be heard from him. \"SHIT! Where is that spitfuck?\" \"Do I look like I know?\" Wichita snapped. \"Any idea where he could be?\" Little Rock asked worriedly. Tallahassee took a deep breath and sighed. He stiffened suddenly. He looked up at them surprised. \"Do you smell that?\" The girls switched glances. \"What do you mean?\" \"That smell…Columbus' I'm-going-to-kick-your-ass-scent. I smell him…\" \"What are we standing here? Come on! We have to get him back! Who knows what is happening to him!\" Wichita shouted quickly packing up their stuff, Little Rock following her act. They looked at the oldest alpha. \"Go ahead; we catch up with you with the car.\" Tallahassee nodded, walking on towards the scent he grew to know as Columbus when they were fighting. … \"Do you think it's a good idea?\" Professor asked. The omega glanced into the little room which showed their newcomer sitting on a clean white bed. \"Of course it is! How do you think we're gonna save our race? We have many omegas saved here and twice as many alphas. Almost every omega is in heat right now, why isn't this one? He is here now for two weeks!\" Boss said annoyed. Professor watched the boy walking around in the room in boredom. \"I can't deny that this boy is quite interesting. Every other omega would have released some scent of fright. His scent is completely different. I think we should wait…\" \"But he is here now for two weeks! We don't have time for this!...give him the drug.\" \"What? No! I don't think it's-\" Boss pressed him against wall. \"Give him. The drug…\" Professor looked down. \"Hey hey…\" Boss said soothingly, which made the omega looking at the alpha again. \"You know I just want to safe humanity…\" \"But the omegas just want a place safe-\" Boss kissed the teen roughly. As they parted for air, the alpha gave Professor a stern look. \"I…I-\" Professor started to speak but was interrupted by a thumb. The both men looked back to the window to the newcomer's room. Said-omega stood in front of the glass, looking at his 'reflection'. To their shock he was suddenly throwing the bed against the glass. Professor gasped as the glass got few cracks. The young man in the room panted lightly before he calmed down again and pulled the bed, now with difficulty, back to its place and sat down, looking around unsecure. \"What was that?\" Professor asked. \"Don't know, don't care.\" Boss replied, looking back to his omega. \"Just give him the drug.\" With that, he walked away. Professor blushed lightly from the happenings and quickly walked to his lab. … Columbus quickly stood up when a brunette teen entered the room. \"Hello there…\" he greeted awkwardly, \"uh…the mirror was like that already when I came…\" he lied weakly… \"Hello…you can call me Professor if you like?\" Professor replied, ignoring the mirror. Columbus smiled in relief at the young omega. \"Why am I here anyway? Your friends were not very nice when they attacked me while sleeping…\" \"I'm sorry to hear that…well, you have at least a clean room! Like the others here…\" Columbus smiled excited. \"There are more survivors?\" \"Indeed! And we are working on saving humanity!\" Columbus stopped smiling, looking at the syringe in Professor's hands. \"Oh god…I'm an experiment!\" He moved away from the other omega, shouting his fright. The young professor sighed and explained the syringe. \"You have to understand, we only want to save our race!\" \"By drugging me into heat and letting me fucked by some strange alpha!?\" Columbus shouted angrily. Professor gasped at the strange scent. The omega is dangerous… \"Please…just…\" \"You are also and omega! Why don't you do it?!\" The teen blushed and looked at his feet. \"My alpha is the chef here…and my circle is quite healthy…so yeah…\" Columbus pushed him against the wall. He smelled at the teen's neck roughly, pinning the other omega against the wall. \"You're quite a young omega for that alpha…what are you, 17?\" \"Wh-what?\" Professor gasped. \"But not mated yet…\" Columbus mumbled through his scenting. He then moved few steps away from the other. \"I'm sorry…I just…\" he took another deep breath and walked back to his bed. Professor cleared his throat. \"Ok,…shall we start?\" \"I wouldn't do that,\" Columbus said warningly. \"I mean it.\" \"But you must! Boss will be-\" Columbus sighed. \"He's not that nice, right?\" Professor didn't answer, just looking at the syringe. Columbus sighed again. \"I will regret it, I'm sure of it…\" with that, he held up his arm to the young omega. … Boss glanced into the newcomer's room. \"Still nothing?\" Professor stiffed and quickly shook his head. \"No, sir, he has only few symptoms of and upcoming heat-\" \"But he should be fucking some alpha right now!\" Boss yelled. He watched that new omega walking restless around the room. \"I have enough!\" he snapped. \"Send an alpha in. He eventually will get into heat-\" \"But that would be forced! You can't do that!\" Professor shouted, surprised by his own actions. His alpha turned around walking up to him, \"You know I can. And I will if I have to, understand?\" The Professor looked down, nodding lightly. \"I asked if you have understood.\" Boss' voice was deep and dangerous. The young omega blushed and nodded more, looking into those scary eyes. \"Now send in alpha #28 and #13…\" \"Two alphas?!\" Boss was glaring at Professor. The teen gulped nervously, nodded and left. … #28 and #13 were happy. Finally they get some nice young omega. \"How about I take him first and then-\" \"Come on, how about we both take him at the same time?\" They laughed excited. As they reached the door, #13 glanced through the window. \"Hmm…doesn't look like in heat now if you ask me.\" #28 also took a glance. Indeed, there the omega was, sitting calm on his bed, looking at the floor. \"Hello there! We are going to have fun!\" #28 shouted, knocking at the glass. Both men laughed at that. When they entered the room, the scent was madness. They grew quite dizzy, quite numb when they watched the omega standing up and removing his clean white shirt. He walked up on them with firm steps. The alphas did the same, both starting to corner him. But the omega had none of that. #28 grabbed harshly at the man's arm and suddenly was thrown against the wall. He watched the omega breaking #13's leg with one clean kick and knocking him unconscious with another kick. With that, the omega simply walked out the room with a final, \"worthless alphas…\" … Tallahassee, Wichita and Little Rock were taken aback when they found the military base filled with omegas and alphas. Most of them in heat. \"Damn, what's going on here?!\" Wichita snapped, holding a cloth to her nose and mouth to deal with the scents. But Tallahassee only could smell that one scent. Right now they were in a large room filled with Alphas fighting for their lives against zombies, which seemed to have found the way in. Also they were fighting to survive. For around three weeks they were searching for Columbus and suddenly, his scent was never as strong as it was now. And the older alpha immediately turned around to dodge the feet towards his head with his arms. Columbus jumped and with surprisingly grace landed back on his feet. \"You're here…\" Tallahassee whispered. Columbus smiled and attacked again with punches which Tallahassee could dodge this time. Around all this chaos with alphas and zombies, Tallahassee had to dodge every attack Columbus threw at him. The redneck shook his head in dizziness, trying to concentrating. He hated it when the omega took of the shirt when they fight. After he dodged the kicks towards his legs, Tallahassee realized Columbus actions. The boy always revealed his neck when he fought. \"You know, I think two can play this game…\" And when he ripped open his shirt, revealing his neck, he saw him. Columbus froze for a second, choking lightly for air. The teen then screamed, running towards him, avoiding and punching everyone who stood in his way. But Tallahassee caught his fist, pulling Columbus close, and for a moment, the teen just stared at him, waiting. The alphas held him close and kissed him deeply. And Tallahassee kissed him carefully, readying himself for another outburst. But it didn't come, Columbus closed his eyes, kissing back as good as possible. And suddenly there was another problem. \"Ta…Tallahassee…I…I…\" Columbus whined between the kisses and Tallahassee noticed this new scent. Heat. \"Oh no, Colly, not now!\" By then, Columbus kissed him again, his legs around his new found mate's hips and moaning happily. Tallahassee tried to leave the room quickly but a room filled with fighting alphas and enough zombies seemed to make it impossible. But Columbus was no normal omega… \"Tallahassee! LEFT!\" Columbus shouted, landing a kick to the redneck's left where an alpha tried to attack with an ax. Columbus chuckled, now slung around Tallahassee's back. \"I'm horny…\" he whispered into his alphas ear. Tallahassee quickly shot down few more zombies, searching for Wichita. Damn they were lucky that Little Rock is waiting in the car. \"WICHITA!\" He screamed through the chaos. He growled when he felt the boy on his back humping him lightly. \"Stop that!\" He snapped shortly. \"But I'm hooornyy!\" Columbus whined, and angrily kicked another zombie away from his mate's back. \"When we find Wichita, we leave and then we cane mate ok?\" \"Yay!\" With that, Columbus took on gun away from Tallahassee and shot down few zombies. \"She's that way!\" Tallahassee, too stressed to ask why Columbus knew it, moved on. He shot and punched zombies and other alphas away while Columbus kept on pointing out the directions and flirting into his mate's ear. Finally they found her, fighting against another alpha. \"Wichita! Let's get the hell out of here!\" Tallahassee shouted to her, ignoring Columbus biting his ear playfully. \"Not without him!\" She yelled back, dodging a shot from the other man. Tallahassee was confused when Columbus climbed down from him and ran towards them. He ran passed them and held tight onto an omega hiding a desk. Beside that the omega seemed to be around 15, Columbus carried him like a crying child, the legs on either side of his hips, the head save on Columbus shoulder, hand firmly pressed on it. \"Now be my alpha and get us out of here.\" Tallahassee once again shouted for Wichita. She quickly knocked her opponent out and followed. She and Tallahassee cleared their way out. \"Start the car! START THE CAR!\" The alphas shouted for Little Rock, who quickly started said car. They literally jumped into the car and only sighed in relieve when there was no sight of the military place anymore. And then, \"Tallahasseeee…\" Columbus moaned, climbing on his alphas lap. \"Now…\" He looked helpless at Wichita, who had the young omega on her lap, unconscious. \"Maybe we are in a more private place…\" Columbus huffed disappointed and started to kiss his alphas neck and down to his chest. \"Whoa…\" Tallahassee moaned surprised. \"Could you please do that somewhere else?\" Little Rock asked, feeling uncomfortable. \"No…\" Columbus growled angrily. With that he attacked his mate's lips, pressing his hips down for more friction. … \"How long does it take now?\" Little Rock asked, munching on her chips, looking at the car from afar, which was rocking lightly. \"Like I said,\" Wichita replied, \"it will take a while…It was either that or being there while they're mating.\" Little Rock shivered at the image and looked over at the new omega. \"And who are you?\" \"My name is-\" \"No names, our rule here.\" Wichita said, smiling which made the young boy blush. \"Uh…well, others called me Professor back there at the military base.\" \"Ok, Professor. What happened there? When we came, there was an apocalypse in there on its own.\" Wichita asked. \"Well, after we send there two alphas to mate with Columbus….he simply broke out. I heard him say that he needs a proper alpha. And before we knew it, he opened every door possible of every alpha we know. That was the chaos back there…\" He looked over to the still rocking car, ignoring the moans and sexual shouts with a light blush. \"May I ask why he didn't go into heat? Even in stress?\" The girls switched glances and explained everything to him. \"Interesting…\" he said in the end. He looked over to Wichita. \"Uhm…I wanted to thank you…for…for protecting me…\" \"It's ok,\" Wichita chuckled, leaning lightly over to the young omega. \"How old are you actually?\" Professor blushed deeply, looking at his feet. \"Seventeen…\" he said meekly, munching nervously his too dry sandwich. \"Please, Wichita, not you too…\" Little Rock said. Wichita then also blushed lightly, but still smirked over to the little omega. … They watched Tallahassee walking up to them, shirtless. They could see large bites on his neck and many scratched on his chest and back. \"Sorry for that…\" he said hoarsely. The girls chuckled amused by his expression. He was quite dazed, wide eyed and clearly shocked from the outcome. \"Are you mated now?\" Little Rock asked. Tallahassee smirked and nodded quite proudly. \"Finally…\" he said. \"Where is he now?\" Wichita asked. Tallahassee pointed back to the car. \"Sleeping. It was his first proper heat after all.\" There was silence. \"I think we need a new car.\" Little Rock said, making the redneck rub his face in embarrassment, which of course he would play up as annoyance. … \"I can't believe that this is happening…\" Wichita huffs annoyed, watching the omegas laughing together. Somehow, Professor became like a child for Columbus, even if they only have three years between them. Columbus being no normal omega from the beginning seemed to have strong mother instincts for other, younger, omegas. And now Wichita has to talk to him. \"I feel like on my first date again, where I have to deal with the creepy parents…\" she said. Tallahassee chuckled. \"Well, I think you will do just fine.\" She glared at him and walked over to Columbus. Said omega saw her approaching and send Professor away to get some blankets. \"Hey…\" She started. \"You want to fuck him, right?\" Columbus glared weakly. Wichita snapped at him angrily,\" I can't believe that I actually talk to you, you know that? But it seems that I'm in love with Professor so much that I'm stupid enough to talk to another omega to ask for permission to mate instead of walking straight up to him and ask him personally!\" She glared angrily at the now smiling Columbus. \"What?!\" \"I want too!\" She heard from behind and as she turned around, she found her omega hugging her tightly. She froze when Professor kissed her shyly. Both didn't notice the cheers from the other survivors. Columbus smiled at his mate. \"What is?\" Tallahassee asked curious. \"…I'm happy.\" Suddenly, he gasped, blushing furious. \"What is? What is?\" His alpha asked bit frightened. Columbus panted lightly. \"Just…just my heat…I think…\" He hugged Tallahassee, panting more heavily. \"Damn, I can't get used to a circle…\" he whined, roaming his hands on the redneck's chest. \"Don't worry, let me deal with it…\" the older Alpha smirked, already aroused by his omega. Columbus was turned on by the words and jumped at his mate, attacking his lips while his legs were around his boyfriend's waist. \"We are back in three hours!\" Tallahassee shouted between the kisses to their friends, walking out of the shop over to an old house where they camped in. \"I love you…\" Columbus panted heavily, biting on Tallahassee's neck teasingly. Tallahassee smiled as he threw Columbus on the bed. \"Let me show you how much I love you…\" \"Show me…my worthy alpha…\"[Chapter 2] Sorry for any mistake you see there, just so you know. Have fun! Professor felt calm when Columbus put an arm around him. \"Don't worry, our friends will be here in no time. Nothing will happen to us,\" he whispered into the younger boy's ear, reminding of a mother calming a child. \"But how would they find us? We are in an abandoned cave and those alphas closed it!\" Columbus didn't reply and looked down. \"We can do it\" Professor sighed and leaned deeper into the other body. \"If you think so…\" With them were few other omegas and even one beta. They all talked in hushed voice and were also cuddled together to keep warm. The sun was going down and the young professor noticed the others coming closer to them. \"What do you want?\" he asked carefully but Columbus just waved the others over. They quickly cuddled up to him. \"Everything will be fine,\" Columbus then said and Professor felt the thick tension of fright and stress lessening. He was amazing. Since Professor traveled with Wichita and her friends, he started to note down anything that he noticed about his omega friend. Columbus surely was no normal Omega. In last studies back in Uni, the teen read about a primal omega corpse which was found deep in the mountains of Europe. It read that the body and bones were ones larger and stronger than today's omega. And when he saw Columbus throwing the bed against the glass, the thought of this creature came to mind. And the theory in mind that Columbus might have degenerate as omega, Professor took note on everything different like his fun in power play with Tallahassee or the almost possessive way of mother instinct. Even that his heats only last three hours and comes once in two weeks was speaking for a primal omega. And Columbus' reaction to a group of distressed omegas? Motherly instinct. They all jumped in shock when the cave was opened and few alphas stood there with hunting guns. One shot hit a little blond woman and a dart was in her neck. She shouted in pain, started to choke and pant before the scents of heat came up. Another one hit a teen beside Professor and he saw that Columbus tried to catch it. The teen also went into heat in seconds. Columbus quickly stood up and stomped over to the alphas who tried to get the omegas in heat. \"You…\" one alpha growled furious and Professor froze as he saw Boss pointing his weapon at Columbus. Columbus stopped and hold his hands up,\" Don't do this. Please…\" The other prisoners shouted in fright as the strong omega was shot with immediately two darts under the collar bone. Columbus stopped and tumbled a little that he had to keep himself up by the cave wall. \"You destroyed my plan. You destroyed everything I worked for!\" Boss hissed angrily and shoved the heated omega to the ground which started to choke and gasp for air. Columbus had an overdose, defenseless and unable to keep the others safe. That also made him scream angry between his chokes for not being able to act on his instincts. The other alphas made their way into the cave. Professor was frozen with fright as the alphas grabbed the others around him. \" MINE!\" was screeched and Professor heard Boss screaming in shock and pain as he flew out the cave. Before the group realized, a new alpha stood between them, punching the other alphas in the critical places like neck and head. The man screamed and threw them all out of the cave, throwing stones after them, all the time screaming \"MINE!\" The young boy noticed the man staying by the cave before looking back to the others. It was Tallahassee. \"Are you alright!?\" \"Columbus!\" Professor shouted and pointed at the drugged curly omega. \"Shit!\" Tallahassee cursed and made his way to his mate. The blond woman in heat wobbly stood up and tried to go after the alpha but was hold back by other omegas around her. Wichita and Little Rock entered the cave and froze as the redneck screeched at them. Professor knew that behavior. Territorial behavior A primal omega in heat awakes an alpha's deeper primal side it seemed. And Tallahassee clearly is distressed with his mate like that. He lost his last normal thought when Columbus whined in distress and clawing at his mate in pain. \"Bow down! Bow down to him!\" Professor shouted to the other two alphas. They watched him confused but quickly did it when Tallahassee stood up and stalked over to them. He stopped as he saw them submit to him and went back to his mate. \"What's wrong with him?!\" Little Rock asked afraid, watching Tallahassee removing the darts from the omega's body and sniffing at his collarbone and neck. Columbus stopped whimpering and whining but still shivered in pain, still gasping and choking for air. \"He's in a dangerously primal alpha state!\" Professor replied, \"Like in a primal aggressive way! Everything that made him feel threatened will be killed!\" Tallahassee suddenly glared at the only beta sitting there and roared as he stomped over to him and grabbed him by the throat. The others quickly tried to held him back but where pushed and shoved aside, shown to their place by a deep dominating growl. The beta choked for air while the redneck smelled at his throat irritated. He gave the beta a confused look before simply dropping him and walking back to Columbus. The primal alpha doesn't seem to recognize a beta. Therefore the theory that far in the past, the beta didn't exist yet could be accepted. The primal alpha only knows that the beta is no threat to his territory and thus won't attack him. They gasped all in shock as one new alpha, Boss sneaked into the cave, holding up his shotgun and pointing it at the primal alpha. Tallahassee scented his omega once more before glaring at the intruder. Everyone gasped and shouted in shock as a new dart was shot but now at Tallahassee. \"Sleep now, princess,\" Boss chuckled evilly and calmly walked into the cave, holding his back straight in an arrogant and proud manner. Provoking another alpha and showing off his power. He tries to take over the territory! The two omegas in heat called for the new alpha. He just smiled and waved at them. \"I'm coming don't worry!\" He shouted as he was tackled to the ground. The redneck roared at him, his fury burning in his eyes. Tallahassee wasn't speaking anymore, only screaming and yelling his scratchy voice as he punched and hit the alpha under him. The dart had no effect on him. Slowly and quietly, Professor made his way over to Columbus, checking on his pulse. Very unregulated. Columbus gasped again for more air and his eyes became blurry. He seemed to lose focus every now and then. Professor had to do something or Columbus' heart might stop! He turned around and saw Tallahassee standing up and shouting at the now dead body. \"Alpha!\" Tallahassee snapped around. \"Water! Water!\" Professor stared at Columbus shouted again for water. They all watched the alpha leave. After five minutes, he was back with a box of six water bottles. He growled at Professor to stay away and the omega quickly obliged. Professor didn't know how to feel. Here he sat, watching for the first time for human ever, primal alpha and omega interacting with one another. It felt so world changing, seeing as he was a young scientist after all. They didn't speak. Tallahassee just held on to Columbus and was helping him to drink. When the primal omega choked again for air, Tallahassee massaged his mate's throat and nuzzling his curly hair. He growled as Wichita started to move but she just kept her body language on submission, slowly walking towards him. \"We have to go, Tallahassee,\" she whispered and the man stared at her with his dark eyes. The man just huffed and hugged his mate. \"Move. We have to move on,\" she tried again, looking at the other omegas and at her mate. Professor smiled at her. \"Keep them safe.\" \"Safe,\" Tallahassee growled and Columbus nuzzled deeper into his alpha. Wichita watched carefully as the man stood up, Columbus in his arms. He looked at the water and gave the other people around him a look. Wichita nodded and did as she was told; giving the others enough to drink so they could follow them. … When Columbus woke up, he noticed Tallahassee wrapped all around him. \"Talla…Tallahassee?\" he spoke up and felt his throat being dry. When he coughed lightly, his mate was up and wide awake. \"Everything alright?\" he asked before groaning and holding his head. \"Just thirsty. Are you ok? What happened?\" He looked around to find himself in their car. \"Shit, it feels like my first heat all over again,\" the young man sighed. Tallahassee chuckled. \"I feel like having my first hang over…\" he replied and slowly sat up. They sat there for a while and enjoying their calm moment together. \"I don't really know how, but I'm happy that you saved us,\" Columbus kissed his mate on the lips. \"Well, how about we ask the girls. Maybe they know what happens. I lost any memory after I had you in my arms so helplessly like that…\" \"But now we are all safe,\" the younger man replied and the kissed for a longer while before they decided to come out their sleeping place. \"What the hell happened?!\" Tallahassee asked as he looked around all the tents and cars and omegas walking around. \"You all saved them. You killed every alpha who did this and took them with us,\" Little Rock explained. \"We were traveling for few hours to be far away enough and rest.\" \"You were awesome!\" Professor shouted excited. \"You both were!\" \"Huh?\" Columbus mumbled confused. \"Look around! This is your pack! Columbus showed the others that he means safety. And Tallahassee showed with his strength and dominance but also his care for the primal omega that he is the primal alpha for the pack! Awesome! Never in my life did I think to experience such thing!\" \"We…have a pack,\" Tallahassee said. The others nodded. \"We?\" Columbus asked. They nodded again. The couple watched each other. \"I have no idea what to do now,\" Columbus said and Tallahassee put his arm around his mate before sighing, \"Me neither. Let's just find out how to be pack leaders another day.\" ","Summary":" There was one thing the survivors knew about Columbus. Columbus was no normal omega. \"When do you "},{"Movie":"Man From U.N.C.L.E.","Title":"The Spy Left Out in the Cold","Author":"Browncoats and Floral Bonnets","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12878258","Passage":"[Chapter 1] xxx Then \"It sounds like a simple extraction,\" Napoleon said with a sniff. \"Another rich politician's privileged son, taken for ransom or leverage or whatever these bastards are after. We'll just kidnap him back and take him home to daddy.\" Waverly looked unimpressed. \"Do try and remember this is a stealth mission. Our man on the inside says Janssen's son is being kept in one of the outbuildings. You're to retrieve him as quickly as possible without drawing attention to yourselves. Got it?\" Napoleon shrugged. \"It certainly isn't anything I haven't dealt with before.\" Waverly raised his eyebrows in a look that Solo had come to learn meant something like, you're completely bloody wrong. \"Well, um, how are you with children?\" the Brit asked, a hint of smugness in his voice. \"Because the prince's son is, I believe, six years old.\" Illya made a face, wrinkling his nose and pulling down the corners of his mouth. Napoleon, on the other hand, looked more terrified than disgusted. \"You may find this hard to believe,\" he said slowly, \"but even given my considerable charm, I am not gifted with children. Why don't you send Gaby with Illya?\" \"She's on another operation. Unless you'd like to trade places with her and seduce an arms dealer.\" Napoleon shrugged. \"Given the choice…\" \"Come on, Cowboy,\" Illya said, nudging the American in the ribs. \"Don't let him intimidate you. Children can smell fear, you know.\" Napoleon scowled at him, then turned to the Brit and narrowed his eyes. \"Fine. But Waverly, if the little brat gets anything on my clothes, I'm going back to the CIA.\" xxx Now \"How...how much further?\" Illya is startled at how frail the American sounds, and for what seems like the hundredth time in this hellish trek, he wishes he could give him a helping hand. Unfortunately, though, Illya's arms are full of a very small and trembling member of the Belgian nobility. \"Not far now, Cowboy,\" he answers. A lie. He knows it. He knows Solo knows it, too. \"How are you holding up?\" \"Okay. 'm okay,\" Napoleon responds, but it's another lie. Illya stops walking and turns around. His partner is barely standing, his face pale, forehead beaded with sweat despite the chill in the air. One gloved hand is clamped firmly against his right side, somewhere between his hip and ribcage. There's a red stain in the snow below him. Illya cranes his neck to see behind the agent and is overcome with a sinking feeling as he spies the trail of blood. He makes a decision. \"We're going to take a break and stop the bleeding.\" \" Pourquoi sommes-nous arrêtés ?\" wonders the bundle in his arms. Illya looks down at the boy and forces a smile. \" Juste un petit prince ,\" he replies. \"No. Just...you just go,\" Napoleon says, lowering himself gracelessly to the ground and landing in the snow with a light thump . \"What are you talking about? I'm not going to leave you here,\" Illya says. He struggles to get the words out, as his throat has grown suddenly and inexplicably dry. He can feel the child gazing up at him. Napoleon smiles slightly. He looks tired. \"I'm shot, Kuryakin. Even if...even if we get this bleeding stopped, I'll never make the rendezvous point. You need to take the kid and get out of here.\" Illya knows he's right. But he doesn't want him to be. \"Maybe we could…\" He sighs. \"What if they come for him? What will you do?\" \"Help me get off the road,\" Napoleon responds, ignoring Illya's queries. \"Into the woods, just...just a ways beyond the treeline. You c'n come back for me after you get him to...to Waverly.\" Illya sighs and nods. He turns his face down to the boy. \" Je te fais descendre, \" he says. The boy shakes his head, wrapping his arms tighter around Illya's neck and burying his head in his shoulder, making a sound of protest. \" Un moment ,\" Illya says, prying the boy from him and setting him down on the ground. He wraps the blanket tighter around the child, who now looks like he's ready to cry. \" Un moment, \" Illya repeats, and hurries to the other agent's side. Napoleon looks up at him, the corners of his eyes crinkled in pain, and reaches up with the arm that isn't holding the bullet wound. Illya takes his hand. \"You ready?\" he asks, and Napoleon nods. Illya pulls him to his feet, doing his best to ignore the grimace and barely-stifled cry. \"Okay?\" Napoleon nods again, panting. He doesn't say anything, just breathes, and Illya knows that's a bad sign. Napoleon's legs collapse beneath him after a few tentative steps into the woods, and Illya ends up half-dragging him the rest of the way, Napoleon making discontented noises the entire time (though Illya can't tell if it's because he doesn't like being helped or if it's from the pain). They finally stop next to a tree that's large enough to provide some cover from the road, should anyone come along looking for the child. Illya eases Napoleon slowly and carefully to the ground. The American is just conscious, lids parted slightly, eyes tracing listlessly back and forth. Illya's heart is pounding and he shakes his head as he kneels, then takes his partner's face in his hands. Napoleon blinks up at him. \" Go. \" \"No. No. I cannot leave you. You're wounded and it's cold, and it is only going to get colder. To leave you here would be a death sentence.\" \"You've got 've...Illya, you don't have a choice.\" He shifts his gaze somewhere beyond Illya's shoulder. Illya turns. The boy is standing a few feet back, shivering in the blanket, snot running down his face. Illya turns back to the American. \"I'm going to pack the wound with snow, it will stop the bleeding,\" Illya says, scooping up a handful of the white fluff. Napoleon raises an eyebrow at him. Illya shrugs. \"This is not the first time a partner has been wounded in the snow. Knowing you, it probably won't be the last.\" He presses the cold powder to Napoleon's side, hoping to whatever god is listening that he isn't about to freeze his closest friend to death \"Th-that's damn cold,\" Napoleon whispers with a grimace. \"I know,\" Illya answers. He looks over at the boy. \" Venez ici .\" The boy obeys, reluctantly shuffling forward. Illya reaches for the blanket and the boy shrinks away. \" C'est froid ,\" he whimpers. \"I know it's cold,\" Illya says softly. \" Je vais te garder au chaud .\" He tugs the blanket loose, then turns to Napoleon, draping the blanket over him and wrapping it tightly around his shoulders. \"There. Now you stay alive, okay? Stay alive until I return. I won't be long.\" Napoleon narrows his eyes. \"I don't...an-answer to you, P-...Peril.\" \"You will if you do not do as I have said,\" Illya warns. He stands, with no small share of reluctance. \"Please, Napoleon. I do not want to lose you.\" I can't lose you. A small smile. \"I'll be right...right h-here.\" \"You better be,\" lllya answers. He unzips his coat then turns back to the shivering child and picks him up. \" Bras autour de mon cou. \" The child nods and obeys, wrapping his arms tightly around Illya's neck. Illya zips the coat back up, enveloping the child, before looping one arm around the boy. \"I'll be back soon, Cowboy,\" he says. \"Course...course you will...Peril,\" Napoleon breathes. Illya nods before heading back to the road, clutching the boy and not daring to look back, lest doing so should turn his partner into a pillar of salt. xxx Napoleon shivers under the blanket, his teeth chattering so intensely that he's sure anyone who happens on the road will hear the noise and come looking. The bleeding seems to have stopped, though, which is good. It would be better if he hadn't already lost so much of it, but he'll take what he can get. He really hates the cold. Cold does things to a person. Looking out into the darkening woods, Napoleon can almost see them: three men, hands and faces black and purple with frostbite, naked bodies twisted in the snow. He remembers the day well. How at first he thought they'd been killed and stripped of their uniforms by the enemy, but they had no outward injuries. How it was another soldier, a kid from the Appalachians, that explained it to him. The cold played tricks on the mind, confused people until they were tearing their clothes off, completely unaware that they were only hastening their own demise. Napoleon's seen many things, things that he'll never forget, but nothing haunts him quite like those bodies in the trees outside Bastogne. A sudden snap pulls Napoleon from the memory, and he scrambles for his gun. His movements are slow and sloppy under the blanket, but he manages to get his left arm out from under it with his weapon drawn. He does a slow scan of his surroundings, staring out into the frigid darkness, the gun trembling in his hand as the shivering becomes more violent. He's beginning to think he'd imagined it when he hears it again-the unmistakable sound of a small branch breaking. He strains his eyes, struggling to spot whoever or whatever is out there with him. He doesn't even notice his fingers curling against the cold until his gun goes off. \" Fuck! \" he whispers, dropping the weapon into the snow. He needs to move, needs to hide , but his shaking limbs don't seem to want to obey. It takes every ounce of strength he has to make it to his feet, and even then he's bent at the middle, leaning against the tree for support. The blanket, stiff with cold, lies useless on the ground. He's catching his breath when he sees the light. He squints at it, fear lacing through him because there are really only two possibilities. Either he just gave away his position and one of the terrorists is on his way over, or Napoleon is so cold that he's hallucinating. He's really not sure which is worse. As he watches, the light starts to grow, ever so gradually, and he's starting to think it's real at the same time that he remembers he's dropped his gun into the snow. He knows that if he lowers himself to try and dig it out of the snow he won't make it back to his feet. His teeth are chattering so badly that he bites his tongue, and his mouth fills with the metallic taste of blood. He closes his eyes in frustration. He's so damned tired . And despite the numbness that's quickly overtaking his arms and legs, the bullet wound in his side hurts like hell. When he opens his eyes again, the light's even bigger and he can see its movement. Before long he'll see who's carrying it and after that, well… Napoleon closes his eyes again and lets his body sink back into the snow. xxx A/N: You have my apologies, not being a French speaker, I had to just use Google Translate, so sorry if you speak French and it's super wrong.

They were unlucky enough to also find three guards, one of whom managed to fire off a warning shot which meant that the quiet extraction was about to get a lot less quiet. \"They definitely heard that,\" Napoleon said. He could see the trembling child out of the corner of his eye. \"What do we do with him while we take care of the guys out there?\" Illya did a quick scan of the room before crossing to a large cabinet and pulling out the contents, scattering them on the cold cement. He looked up at Napoleon. \"Here.\" Napoleon scooped up the boy and stowed him in the small space. \"We'll be right back,\" he said, before putting a finger to his lips and closing the boy in. He drew his knife. \"Let's go.\" They worked quickly, taking out the men in the building's other three rooms. They had the element of surprise on their side, though by the time they'd gotten to the last man they'd both been disarmed. Illya wrestled him into a chokehold and looked up at Napoleon, straining. \"I've got him. You go get the boy.\" Napoleon nodded and ran back to the other room, rushing in and flinging open the cabinet door. The boy jumped and let out a cry. \" Qui es-tu ?\" he whimpered, shrinking away from the American with wide eyes. Napoleon sighed and tried not to sound as fed up as he felt. \"I'm here to help you.\" The boy stared at him with wide eyes, his lower lip quivering as he scrunched himself further into the corner. Napoleon rolled his eyes and let out a small sound of frustration, which he quickly smothered with a smile and quirked eyebrows. \"Listen, I'm a friend, you understand? Camarde !\" The boy just shook his head and sniffled. He was usually very skilled at keeping his personal feelings in check, but Napoleon was growing increasingly irritated. There was a reason he avoided children. They didn't listen to reason, they had the communicative abilities of a goldfish, and they were so damn emotional . He took a deep breath. \"Look, kid-\" Just then, the door burst open and Illya appeared, panting, his expression equal parts confused and annoyed. \"What is taking so long? We have to go!\" Napoleon shrugged helplessly and gestured at the cowering child. Illya bent down so he was eye-level with the kid and gave a small wave. \" Salut ami. Je suis là pour te ramener à ton père .\" Napoleon frowned, giving Illya a sideways look. \"Since when do you know French?\" he asked, simultaneously impressed and annoyed. Illya glanced over at him. \"Since Waverly had me and Gaby learn while you were studying Farsi. Now shut up and let me talk to the boy.\" He turned back to the kid. \" Allons-y, petit prince !\" The kid whispered something that Napoleon couldn't hear and Illya snorted. \"What?\" Napoleon asked, trying to sound less interested than he actually was. Illya grinned. \"He says he does not like you.\" Napoleon felt his eyes narrow as he opened his mouth, then closed it. He wasn't surprised, really. \"Why don't I go find a blanket. We have to get to the rendezvous on foot and he's not exactly dressed for the weather.\" \"Good idea,\" Illya answered as Napoleon slipped behind him and out into the hall. It didn't take him long to find a large blanket. Even evil child-snatching terrorists got cold, and the compound wasn't exactly cozy. He snatched up the olive green wool monstrosity and made his way back to Illya and the child. \"Here,\" he said, holding out to Illya, who had somehow managed to coax the boy out of hiding. Illya took it and wrapped it tightly around the boy, who watched Napoleon with a solemn gaze. \"How did you get him to come out when I couldn't?\" he asked, slightly unnerved at the kid's apparent ability to not blink. \"Children can sense when you do not like them,\" Illya responded, scooping the child into his arms. Napoleon snorted. \"I saw your face when Waverly told us the mission. You don't like kids any more than I do.\" Illya shrugged. \"I guess I'm good at pretending. Now come on, it's nearly dawn, and we won't have much daylight to get to the extraction point.\" Napoleon raised an eyebrow as he stepped back out into the hallway and did a quick sweep. \"Since when are you good at pretending?\" \"I pretend to like you, don't I?\" \"Ha ha ha,\" Napoleon responded. \"And that was me pretending to laugh. Now let's get the hell out of here.\" xxx Now Bastien looks up at the darkening sky and sighs, taking a step forward. His boot finds a branch, and its crack sends birds flying. He shakes his head at himself. It was stupid of him to come out hunting this late, and he has no doubt that he's going to make the long trek home empty-handed. At least he had the foresight to bring a lantern with him. He feels around in his coat pocket and brings out his tiny matchbox. He pulls one out. It takes him a few tries to light it, and he smiles when the tiny flame finally appears. He's about to light his lamp when a shot rings out, startling him and making him drop the match in the snow. He swears and gets another one out. Before he lights it, though, he takes a moment to just stand and listen. It's hard to tell, but the shot hadn't sounded far off. He doesn't know of anyone else hunting in these woods, but if someone had just shot something they may need help getting it prepared and hauled before the night turns completely black. Bastien sighs again and lights another match, then his lantern. You must be out of your mind, he thinks as he walks further from home and toward the sound of the gunshot instead. He hasn't been trekking through the snow very long, but the sky is already taking on an inkiness that worries him. No stars means clouds, and clouds mean snowfall. He can almost taste it in the air and he knows he should turn back, but something stops him from doing so. He hasn't seen or heard anything since the gunshot, and he knows whoever had fired the round is probably in trouble. He comes across the man so suddenly that it startles him, but any fear is erased very quickly as he realizes that the figure huddled in the snow doesn't pose a threat. The man is younger than Bastien and well groomed, and doesn't look at all like a hunter. Looking closer, Bastien can see that the man is shivering-a good sign, because it means his body hasn't given up yet against the cold. But it still could, and the temperature is only going to drop. He sets his lantern on the ground, carefully so that it settles on top of the snow rather than sinking into it, and closes the small distance between himself and the man, then bends down. It's been awhile, but he still remembers how to carry a person. He hooks his elbows under the man's armpits and stands slowly, grunting under his weight. By the time the man is on his shoulders, Bastien is breathing heavily. His eyes fall to where the man had lain, and his heart jumps. There's blood on the snow. The man must be injured, then, which means he's in even more danger than Bastien originally thought. It won't be easy getting home. It's a long walk, made longer by the dark and the man on his back, and he's grateful for his hunting experience and familiarity with the woods. It's hard at first, but adrenaline kicks in as the instinct to keep another of his species alive takes over. Even so, it's not long before he begins to tire, and he's forced to stop and rest twice on the way (though he doesn't dare put the man down for fear that he won't be able to pick him up again). When he finally reaches his cabin, he's gasping and sweaty as he all but stumbles up the steps. Once he's inside, he puts the man down as gently as he can manage and immediately stokes the fire. It roars to life, providing enough light for Bastien to get to work helping the stranger. He goes to his bedroom first, opening a drawer and grabbing bandages and sulfa powder, then pulls all the blankets from his bed. He dumps everything onto the floor, then sets about the task of getting the man out of his sopping wet clothes, starting with his fancy boots and working his way up until the man is stripped down to his skivvies. With his chest bare, the man's injury is apparent-a gunshot wound to his side that, luckily, seems to not be bleeding. Bastien lights a lantern to take a closer look, rolling the man part-way to check for an exit , there appears to be one, and he's not losing blood there either. Bastien figures it must be due to the man's low body temperature, which means that once he warms up he'll be at risk of bleeding again. Bastien grabs the sulfa powder first, pouring it on both wounds to help avoid infection before bandaging them up. Once the wounds have been tended to, Bastien wastes no time tucking blankets around the man. His shivering has decreased dramatically and his lips have taken on a bluish hue, and Bastien needs to get his body temperature up. He goes to a hall closet pulls out some furs he's recently tanned and maneuvers them under the man's body to insulate him from the cold floor, then make sure the man is cocooned well to keep his body heat from escaping. The only thing left to do now is wait. Bastien tries to settle into his chair to read, but the man needs close monitoring, and Bastien finds himself checking his breathing and pulse every few minutes. He's treated hypothermia before, but he's not sure how the injury will affect the man's body's ability to warm itself up. Blood loss and shock could very well make things more complicated, and Bastien is worried that without constant vigilance, the man might just slip away. After a few hours, however, the man's condition has improved dramatically. His teeth are chattering and his skin is still slightly cool to the touch, but his lips are no longer blue and he's stopped shivering. He seems to be stable, so Bastien feels comfortable leaving him alone for a short time. He builds a fire in his little wood-burning stove and gets a kettle of water on to boil before making a simple broth and setting it on the stovetop to heat up. Bastien is putting tea on the stove when he hears it. \"Illya?\" Bastien frowns and walks back into the front room. The man is awake, though perhaps not entirely lucid, looking around the room with furrowed brow. \"Illya?\" he says again, his voice low and scratchy. Bastien steps closer to where the stranger is name sounds Russian. Bastien doesn't speak it fluently (not by a long shot), but he's picked up a few phrases here and there. \" Ty...ty govor...govorish' po-frantsuzki ? Ty govorish' po-frantsuzki ?\" He hopes he just asked the man whether he speaks French. The man doesn't answer, so Bastien goes back to the stove, where the broth is already hot. He dips some into a bowl and grabs a spoon and heads back to the man's side, sitting down near his head. His eyes are slightly open, his Adam's apple bobbing as though he's trying to say something. \"Ssh,\" Bastien says, setting the bowl next to him. He cradles the man's head with one hand, propping him up so that he'll be able to swallow more easily, and spoons soup into his mouth with the other, relieved when the man swallows it. He doesn't quite manage to finish the bowl, but for now it's enough. The man falls asleep moments later, and Bastien returns to his chair to wait out the rest of the night. xxx \"He was here,\" Illya says, and he's trying not to panic. He's not doing a very good job. \"He was right here!\" \"Are you sure?\" one of the tactical guys asks, and Illya has to resist the urge to hit him. \"Yes, I am fucking sure,\" Illya all but growls, and the man takes a few steps back. \"Look, do you think it's possible he moved? Tried to find a more favorable position?\" It's Enzo, the leader of the special ops team, that asks. Illya eyes the little Italian before answering with sinking heart. \"No, I don't think so. He was...he was badly injured. If he did manage to move, he…\" He scrubs a hand down his face. \"He would not have made it far.\" He startles everyone when he lets out a shout and punches the tree nearest him, hard enough to bust open his knuckles. He closes his eyes and leans his forehead against the cold bark, forcing himself to take deep, even breaths. He's allowed himself the outburst; he will not allow himself another. \"Agent Kuryakin,\" Enzo says, taking a step toward him. \"I should not have left him,\" Illya says. \"I think we have to face the possibility that Agent Solo is-\" \"We would have found his body, no?\" Illya interrupts. He doesn't even want to hear the words. He opens his eyes and turns around. \"They must have taken him. The terrorists. Now that the boy is safe, we can storm their compound and get Solo back.\" xxx Qui es tu - Who are you? Salut ami - Hello, friend. Je suis la pour te ramener à ton père - I'm here to take you back to your dad.[Chapter 3] xxx Then \"Tell him to close his eyes,\" Napoleon said, carefully stepping over the arm of a dead man. His boot landed in a pool of blood. \" Ferme tes yeux, \" Illya said, and Napoleon almost smiled at the gentleness in his voice. \"You lied to me, Peril. I thought you didn't like kids.\" He moved over so he could turn and see Illya's face more easily. \"I don't,\" Illya said. \"I just know how to talk to them. You give me plenty of practice.\" Napoleon let out a sound of mock hurt as they picked their way through the carnage to the exit. \"You've been spending too much time with Gaby. Our little harpy seems to be rubbing off on you.\" \"She says the same thing about you. I think you're both to blame.\" Napoleon couldn't stop the small laugh the erupted from him. \"Yes, that's probably true.\" He was turning to say something else when he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. Things happened quickly from there-Napoleon, placing his body between the man and Illya at the same time that he shouted for his partner to look out, his gun already out of its holster, his finger already tightening. He'd barely got the shot off before he felt it, in his left side, hot and sharp. He heard the child scream, and Illya shouting his name. \"I'm-I'm fine!\" he gasped, his left hand clamping to the wound while he put his gun away with his right. \"Illya, keep him quiet.\" He took a few experimental steps forward and was relieved to find he could still walk. Illya didn't move from where he stood. \"Cowboy…\" \"I'm fine ,\" Napoleon insisted. \"I'll be fine. We have to get him out of here. Once we're beyond the compound we can try and figure out what to do about...this.\" There was a long pause before Illya said, \"Okay.\" He didn't sound convinced, but he started walking again. It wasn't long before he took the lead, for which Napoleon was grateful. The adrenaline was wearing off by the time they were clear of the compound (which by some miracle hadn't been stirred into action by the gunshots), and the pain in his side was getting worse with every step he took. He did his best to ignore it. The further he made it, the more likely Illya was to listen to reason. Because, though he didn't dare say anything until he absolutely had to, Napoleon knew he would never make it to the rendezvous. xxx Now Bastien is getting ready to make breakfast when he realizes he's run out of wood for the stove. \" Scheisse ,\" he mutters. It's cold out, and it's been snowing off and on all morning, and he doesn't particularly feel like going out in it. But he also doesn't feel like having a cold breakfast, and even if he did he has a guest. He quickly checks on the stranger, who's sleeping soundly, before grabbing his coat, hat, and gloves. He's bundled up by the time he gets to the door (though it still takes him a few moments to steel himself before he leaves the house). He's lucky enough to go out during a break in the snow, and he doesn't waste any time, in case it starts up again. Wielding the axe is hard work. It warms him up quickly and, as is often the case, he finds himself wishing he hadn't put on so damn many layers. He splits four logs and gathers up the pieces. It's a big armload, but nothing he hasn't carried before. The snow is just starting up again when he goes inside, dumping the wood in a pile. He'll stack it later, after he's eaten. He put a few of the pieces into the stove before he takes off his gloves and grabs the matchbox he keeps in the kitchen. He opens it and sighs, silently cursing its emptiness. He'll have to get one from the box above the fireplace, then. He gets to the living room and freezes. The man is standing in a far corner of the room, bent over in the middle. One hand is clutching a blanket, his arm curled around his injured side, while the other hand brandishes the large hunting knife Bastien keeps on the mantle. His hand is shaking and he looks like a slight breeze could knock him over, but his expression is determined, and the look in his eyes holds danger. \" Sprichst du Deutsch ?\" Bastien speaks slowly, holding his hands up to show he's unarmed. \" Nederlands ? English?\" \"All of the above,\" the man says, and Bastien feels himself frown. He can't quite place the man's accent, not until he speaks again. \"Who the fuck are you?\" xxx \"I said, who the fuck are you ?\" Napoleon all but snarls it, and he thinks he's done quite a good job of sounding as unpleasant as he feels. He's fairly certain that he looks pathetic, given that he's wounded and in nothing but his underwear with only a blanket preserving some small shred of dignity, so he has to sound as fierce as possible. The man, who's standing in the doorway with his hands raised, doesn't look intimidated. If anything he looks confused. \"You...You are American?\" the man asks. He's tall-taller even than Illya-and well-built. Definitely the kind of man a group of terrorists would want on their side. But he doesn't sound like them and he sure as hell doesn't look like them. He doesn't look ready to kill. That doesn't mean he's not one of them. Napoleon lifts the knife a little higher and takes a small step forward. \" Who are you? \" \"My name is Bastien. I found you in the woods...You look cold. I'll make some tea.\" \"I'm more of a coffee person,\" Napoleon says, narrowing his eyes. It's only partly in suspicion. Mostly it's because the bullet hole in his side is really starting to smart. \"Why did you bring me here?\" Bastien blinks, lowering his arms slightly. \"I'm sorry?\" \"What do you want from me?\" Napoleon asks. \"Information? Money?\" Much to Napoleon's dismay, one corner of Bastien's mouth lifts up in a half-smile that's surprisingly warm. \"What? No. No, I don't know you from a- wat is het -\" He gestures with both hands. \"A...hole in the dirt! I saw you out there, freezing, and I could not let you die. I do not want anything from you.\" Napoleon studies the man head to toe. With his thick flannel and beat-up boots and untamed beard, Bastien does look like someone who lives alone in the woods rather than a greedy, gun-happy bastard who would kidnap a child (or a dashingly handsome stranger) for the money. \"Alright,\" Napoleon says slowly, lowering the knife and letting it clatter to the floor. \"I believe you.\" No sooner does he say it than the pain in his side reaches a sudden crescendo, and he lets out a cry, dropping the blanket and clutching at the bullet hole. Bastien hurries forward, putting a hand on Napoleon's shoulder and bending down to peer at his side. \"You're bleeding again,\" he says, looking up at Napoleon with raised eyebrows. \"You need rest. Come, sit down.\" Napoleon lets the large man guide him to an open chair, and almost immediately Bastien is tucking blankets around his shoulders. \"We will talk in a moment. But first, tea,\" Bastien says before walking into another part of the house that Napoleon can't quite see. He's back a second later, an embarrassed look on his face as he grabs a small box from the mantle and gives it a little shake. \"Matches.\" Napoleon takes in his surroundings as Bastien busies himself with the tea. The cabin is well built and sturdy, and a lot of the furnishings seem to be handmade. While there are some lamps placed strategically around the room, there's not a lightbulb to be seen, so it's safe to say there's no electricity. Natural light floods through two windows behind Napoleon, and the fireplace contributes an orange glow that gives the room a comfortable hominess. The whistle of the tea kettle makes Napoleon jump, and a few seconds later Bastien appears with a two steaming cups in hand. He holds one out to Napoleon. \"Drink this,\" he says. Napoleon wrinkles his nose as he works one hand out from beneath the pile of blankets. \"I don't like tea,\" he mutters. Bastien responds by pushing a cup into his hand. \"It's chamomile. It's good for you. Drink it.\" Napoleon sighs. The man is probably right. He sips at the tea and tries not to grimace at the potpourri-like taste. It's on his second sip that his thumb grazes his chin and he almost drops his cup. He scrambles to free his other hand and immediately touches his face, feeling both cheeks and his chin with growing urgency. \"How long have I been here?\" he asks. Bastien sets his tea on the little table beside him and sits forward, clasping his hands in front of him. \"Three days.\" \"Three-\" Napoleon's heart pounds as he tries to stand, only to get caught up in the mound of blankets. \"Three days? Where are my clothes?\" he says as he tries to disentangle himself. He only entraps himself further, and ends up falling flat on his back. It knocks the wind out of him, and the pain radiating from the bullet wound becomes practically unbearable. He must black out for a moment, because when he opens his eyes Bastien is hovering over him looking worried. \"I'm sorry, but you can't possibly leave now,\" he says. \"In your state? You would be dead before you even reached the road. Stay there, I'll be back in a moment.\" Napoleon doesn't argue as he closes his eyes and tries to breathe through the pain. He doesn't think he could stand right now even if he wanted to. Even opening his eyes seems like huge task, not because he's tired but because he's pretty sure that opening them will, like a butterfly fluttering its wings, start a chain reaction that makes the pain even worse. He hears Bastien return a moment later. \"Hey,\" he says, and Napoleon feels two fingers against his neck. He frowns and raises one hand. \"I'm awake,\" he says, prying his eyelids apart with (surprisingly) no ill effect. A corner of Bastien's mouth lifts up in an almost-smile. \"I'm going to change your dressings,\" he says, and looks up at Napoleon. \"What's your name?\" \"Solo.\" \"Solo,\" Bastien repeats as he starts to remove the bandages. Napoleon winces, gritting his teeth against the pain. Hopefully some conversation will distract him. \"Where'd you learn to do all this?\" he asks. \"I was in medical school before the war. What I didn't have the chance to learn there I learned on the battlefield as a medic,\" Bastien says as he starts cleaning the wound. \"You're very fortunate, you know. The cold could have killed you, but it saved you instead. It stopped you from bleeding to death.\" Napoleon thinks back to Illya packing snow against the wound. He'll have to remember to thank him for that. \"Did you fight?\" Bastien asks, pulling him from his thoughts. \"At the end, yes,\" Napoleon answers. Bastien nods, then looks at him for a long moment. \"You must have been practically a child,\" he finally says. \"What about after?\" Napoleon is quiet for a moment to think of his answer. \"I stayed in Europe...selling art. And you?\" Bastien presses a bandage down on his wound, eliciting a low moan, before making a broad gesture with one arm. \"I decided to live alone in the woods, like war showed me enough of mankind for one lifetime.\" He furrows his brow in concentration. \"And…done. Now for the exit wound.\" \"Exit wound?\" Napoleon repeats. The pain is so omnipresent he hadn't even realized there was one. \"Lucky for you, yes. You're going to have to turn on your side for me.\" Napoleon grimaces at the thought. \"You know Bastien, I'm going to be honest with you here. I'm not sure I like the sound of that.\" \"Mmhm. And...infection, blood-poisoning, sepsis, and death. Do you like that sound of that?\" The grimace turns into a scowl. Napoleon sees his point, though. \"I can't say that I do,\" he says, then adds, somewhat reluctantly, \"I may need your help.\" Bastien responds by putting one hand on Napoleon's shoulder and the other on his hip. \"Try and stay relaxed. On the count of three. Are you ready?\" Napoleon nods. \"Okay, one, two, three .\" Napoleon leverages himself with his arm at the same time Bastien pushes, and a cry rips from him as his muscles tighten painfully. \"Are you okay?\" Bastien's voice seems far away as Napoleon lets out a long groan. \"Solo, are you alright?\" \"Uh huh,\" Napoleon manages between gasps. It seems he's in worse shape than he'd initially thought. He realizes with a sinking feeling that he's going to be out of commission for awhile. He lifts his head and turns toward Bastien. \"I don't suppose you know how long-\" \"How long until you can leave?\" Napoleon lets his head fall back to the ground. \"Yeah.\" The man is quiet as he puts fresh bandages on the second wound. When he finally speaks, he sounds apologetic. \"The nearest town is a full day's walk, even longer when the weather is bad, and that is for a healthy man, and you...You are very badly injured. I can take you there when you're ready, but…\" He sighs. \"It will take you weeks to heal, at least.\" A few weeks . Napoleon is rendered speechless. His only chance of getting back to London any sooner is Illya finding him out here. But the odds of that happening are slim to none. After all, it's already been three days... xxx Three days ago, Illya and Napoleon saved the child. Three days ago Illya left Napoleon to bleed alone in the snow. Two days ago, they went back to get him and found nothing. The search had been called off just before dark, and they'd gone back to London the same night. Illya had talked to (yelled at) Waverly as soon as he'd set foot in headquarters. Waverly had calmly (frighteningly) reminded him who gave orders and sent Illya to get a good night's sleep. (He'd stared at the ceiling til morning.) One day ago, Waverly came out of his office after an hours-long phone call looking livid and told Illya that he was doing what he could before muttering, \" Fucking politics,\" and shutting himself in his office to make more phone calls. Now, Illya is pacing in the foyer outside Waverly's door. There's a part of him-a large part of him-that wants to be shouting and throwing furniture and punching holes in walls. But that (as Solo is always quick to remind him) won't help anything and besides, when they go back for Napoleon he'll need his hands. So, he paces. One of the tactical guys whose name Illya never bothered to learn passes through, raising one hand in a small wave. \"When's the last time you slept?\" he says, and Illya thinks it's an odd question to ask a stranger. He doesn't answer. He doesn't even stop pacing. \"Well at least come grab a bite.\" Illya's not really sure why this guy is pretending to care. He wants to ask him. All he says is, \"I'm fine.\" The man looks at him for a long moment, then shrugs. He says one more thing before he leaves, an obnoxious attempt at lightening the mood. \"You keep that pacing up, you'll wear a bloody hole in the floor.\" Barely a minute passes before the door to the office opens, and a weary-looking Waverly ushers Illya in before closing them in. \"Have a seat, Kuryakin,\" he says. \"I'd rather stand,\" Illya says, and is surprised when Waverly rolls his eyes and heaves a sigh. \"You'll make me dizzy with all your pacing and lord knows your knees could use a break. Sit.\" Illya grits his teeth and sits down in the left-most chair. (Napoleon usually takes the right.) Waverly surprises him by leaning against the open chair, arms crossed over his chest. \"They think our little terrorist cell might be connected to the IRA, the first in a possible series of satellite groups planning on bringing the movement to the continent, and then to London. Since there are people on the inside, they planned on playing the long game, waiting to see what intel they could gather. They were more than a little reluctant to let us stomp around for an operative we aren't even sure is there…\" Illya feels his heart sink, even as he resolves to go back alone if he has to. \"...but I managed to persuade them.\" Illya looks up at him sharply. \"Really?\" Waverly nods. \"Our agent on the inside has already been alerted to the situation and will be out of the compound before the attack.\" He stops talking, and Illya knows there's a but coming. \"There is one condition, however,\" Waverly says a breath later, and his voice is suddenly stern. \"What is it?\" \"You are to bring the leader, Daniel Byrne, back to London. Alive. Do you think you can manage that?\" \"Yes,\" Illya says. Waverly's eyes narrow just enough for Illya to notice. He takes a deep breath before he speaks. \"Even if you don't find what you're looking for?\" Illya blinks. He hadn't even considered the fact that Napoleon might not be there. He shakes the thought from his mind. \"When do we leave?\" xxx[Chapter 4] xxx Now Illya sits in the cab of the first truck in the convoy, wedged between the driver and Enzo. His right leg bounces, getting faster the closer they get. Four days is a long time, and he has no idea what condition the cowboy will be in when they find him, and he's jammed in this tin can just thinking about it- \"You should try to relax,\" Enzo says, interrupting his thoughts. Illya grits his teeth. \"I am relaxed.\" Enzo sighs and mutters something in Italian that doesn't sound very flattering before putting a firm hand on Illya's knee. Illya freezes, his heart beating faster as he stares straight ahead. \"Get. Your hand. Off me. Now .\" Enzo doesn't move except to turn and look at him. \"Listen to me, Agent team is under my command which means that it's my responsibility. It also means that if this mission goes bad, it's my responsibility. If you let your emotions cloud your judgement, it doesn't just look bad for you. It looks bad for me, and it looks bad for Waverly. So I need you to calm down, focus, and approach this like you would approach any other op.\" He moves his hand and looks out the window as if nothing had happened. Illya wants to yell at him or punch him or both, but he doesn't because he knows the man is right. It's not going to do anyone any good if he goes in there angry, hands shaking, unable to think or shoot straight. He takes a deep breath and holds it a second, then lets it out slowly, unclenching fists that he doesn't remember clenching and willing his leg to stay still. He takes another deep breath before he says, \"How much longer?\" Enzo leans forward and looks at the driver. \"Hunt?\" \"We're about twenty miles out,\" Hunt answers. Illya just hums in response. It's not long, but it feels like an eternity. His mind starts floating back to his partner, what they could be doing to him, what they've already done- \"Let's go over the plan,\" he says. If he's going to remain calm, he needs to think about something-anything-else. Enzo looks a little surprised, but obliges. \"We're going to take the last mile and a half by foot. Once there, teams Alpha and Beta will take the main compound. We'll go in while Beta watches the perimeter in case Byrne tries to run. Charlie and Delta will take the outbuildings, and Echo will watch the road, keeping any enemy vehicles from making it out. Our primary objective is to get Daniel Byrne out alive, and our secondary objective is to find Agent Solo. Any questions?\" Illya's fingers brush the weapon at his hip. \"I know I can't kill Byrne, but can I shoot him?\" Hunt lets out a soft snort and Illya glares at him. Enzo, though, has been along on a few missions now and knows Illya enough to recognize that he isn't joking. \"I trust you know how to avoid anything vital. Or you could just do that Russian Kiss of Death.\" Illya's eyes narrow. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he says. No one is supposed to know about the Kiss. It's one of the KGB's best kept secrets. At least, it was. He glances over at Enzo. \"Who told you?\" \"Who do you think?\" Illya rolls his eyes. He should have known Napoleon would be unable to keep it to himself. He'll give the cowboy an earful once they get him back. Because they are going to get him back. \"Here,\" Enzo says, and the truck rolls to a stop. He looks at Illya as he opens the door. \"This is it. The men know to come to you immediately if they find your partner.\" \"Good,\" Illya says as he follows the man out of the truck. His heart has picked up its hammering again, so hard it feels as if it's trying to pound its way out. As he draws his gun, though, his hands are steady. It's easier to be cool and objective once he's actually in the thick of it, when his mind is entirely focused on what he's doing and needs to do. It'll be mayhem soon, but for now, with the last of the men out of their vehicles, it's quiet. Besides the wind rustling the trees on either side of the road, the only sound is the soft footfall of boots in snow as they move toward the compound. It's not long before he can see it, a dismal gray building that looks as cold as the snow. As they get closer, smaller dismal gray buildings can be seen. Napoleon is one of them, wounded and alone. But not for long. They reach the gate a few minutes later. It's tall and sturdy, and would be intimidating except that it's designed to keep out military vehicles. There's enough space on either side for a person to fit through comfortably, which means the tactical team can slip in quick and quiet. \"Alpha team, on me,\" Enzo says, and Illya and a dozen other men follow him at a running crouch. They storm the doors on the count of three. Chaos erupts the moment they open as the two guards inside shout for backup. There are three hallways branching off the entrance, one straight ahead and one to either side and at least a dozen men pour out the two rightmost halls, armed and shouting, and the fighting begins. Enzo makes eye contact with Illya through the melee and points down the empty hall. Illya can't hear him, but it's clear what he's saying: Go . Illya nods and grabs the man in front of him by the back of the neck before hurling him headfirst into the wall. He falls bonelessly to the ground. Illya steps over him and ducks down the hallway to his left. It's longer than he thinks, and the sounds of fighting fade away as he follows its long bend. There's only one door at the very end of the hallway and somehow Illya knows Byrne is on the other side of it. He's not surprised to find that it's locked, but two good rams with his shoulder takes care of that and he bursts into the room. It's large, with most of the space being occupied by a long oval conference table. There's only one man there, his back to the door, and he scrambles to his feet as Illya enters. He turns and pulls a gun but Illya has already close the gap between them and easily twists the weapon from his grip. \"Hello, Byrne,\" Illya growls. He grabs the Irishman by the front of his coat and slams him onto the table. Byrne is clearly winded, but he grins up at Illya and a chuckle rises from his throat. \"Have...have we met?\" Illya responds by driving a fist into his face. \"Where is he?\" he growls. \"Where's who?\" Illya hits him again. \"Where is he?\" \"I don't know who the hell you mean,\" Byrne answers, blood on his teeth. Illya hits him again, and this time he feels the bastard's nose break under his hand. \" Where is he ?\" Byrne lets out a groan before answering. \"Look, fella. You're gonna have to be more specific than that.\" Shouting can be heard now, and Illya glances over his shoulder. Enemy combatants could be here at any second. He looks back at Byrne, pulling him up so their faces are only inches apart. \"Where is Napoleon Solo?\" Recognition flickers in Byrne's eyes, and an unpleasant smile slowly creeps onto his face. \"Oh. Oh. You mean the American.\" He gazes at Illya with that smile on his lips. Illya can feel his hands beginning to shake, and he's not sure he can control it this time. \"What did you do?\" The question comes out as a harsh whisper. Byrne runs his tongue over bloodied teeth and says, \"I killed him.\" Illya is hitting him before he even realizes he's doing it, one, two, three times. When he stops, his knuckles are split. When he speaks, his voice is trembling. \"No.\" Byrne is lying. He has to be. \"Where is he?\" \"I…\" Byrne's shoulders start shaking, and his words are garbled by blood and laughter. \"I tortured him and I killed him and...and yesterday I burned his body!\" The roar that rips from Illya's throat is animalistic in its fury, and his fists...his fists pummel the man on the table until the man falls silent, and then they keep going. They feel skin break and bone shatter and they don't stop. \" Agent Kuryakin!\" He can barely hear the words over the sound of his own frenzied heartbeat. He pays them no heed. \" Agent Kuryakin, we need him alive!\" He's started now, and he's not going stop. He's not going to stop until there's nothing left. \" Agent, that's enough.\" It's a different voice, a calmer voice, that speaks now. It's just as easy to ignore. It's the sound that follows the words that finally cuts through the rage enough for Illya to take notice. It's the sound of a gun being cocked. He stops, one bloodied hand frozen in the air, and turns to see who's on the other end of the weapon. He doesn't recognize the young man at first, but when he does he feels his jaw tighten. \" You ,\" he snarls. It's the man he'd seen outside Waverly's office the day before, only his face isn't so friendly now. \"Did he send you to keep an eye on me?\" \"You know we need him alive,\" the man answers, and Illya's face darkens. \"Do you know what this piece of shit did?\" \"It doesn't matter what he did,\" the man answers. \"We need him alive.\" Illya straightens up and takes a step forward. His voice gets louder with each word as he speaks.\"He tortured him. He burned him!\" Another step forward and the gun is against his shoulder. He looks down at the man. His voice gets low and dangerous. \"You going to shoot me?\" The man looks back up at him, his jaw working. \"Yes,\" he finally says. Illya stares at him. \"Then you better point it somewhere that counts.\" The man is about to answer when Enzo pushes his way, panting, through the gathered soldiers. \"Kurya-what the hell? Williams, lower your weapon!\" Williams doesn't move, doesn't break eye contact with Illya. \"I had to stop him from killing Byrne. I might be too late.\" Enzo shoots a poisonous look at Illya before turning to the man next to him. \"Go see if Byrne is alive.\" The man nods and squeezes his way into the room, mumbling an apology to Illya as he steps around him. A few seconds later, he says, \"He's in bad shape, but he's alive.\" Williams's stance relaxes just enough to be noticed and he lowers his gun. Illya gives him one last look before pushing past him, storming into the hall. Someone grabs his shoulder and he wheels around, ready for a fight. \"Hey! Easy,\" Enzo says, putting his hands up. \"I don't want to fight you, Kuryakin.\" There's something in his expression that Illya doesn't like. \"What is it?\" he asks. \"I need to show you something,\" Enzo says. He won't meet Illya's eyes. They make their way through the halls and out into the cold, crossing the snowy grounds until they reach a small outbuilding at the corner of the compound. The door is open and there are some men lingering just outside. They all look up and he can see it in their faces, in the way their eyes meet his for only a second before shifting to their shoes. Illya is afraid he knows what's in the building, and his feet suddenly feel as if they're cased in cement. Every step forward is a struggle. He wants to turn back, because there's a part of him that thinks if he doesn't see it, then maybe it didn't happen. Almost against his will, he starts to pray under his breath, the prayer his mother used to whisper to him when he was young. \" Nash otets, kotoryy na nebesakh osvyashchen, budet vashim imenem…\" He steps into the building and the words catch in his throat, and he knows. No one heard his prayer. He recognizes the smell before he's able to identify the twisted black shape on the cold cement. He barely looks at it before fleeing, lurching out of the building. He stumbles and falls forward, his knees hitting the ground hard as he struggles to catch his breath. He doesn't feel the cold wet of the snow soaking through the knees of his pants. He doesn't feel the cold flakes that start falling, kissing his neck and sticking to his hair. He doesn't feel the hands that pull him to his feet and drag him away from the nightmare. He doesn't feel anything until he's back in London, standing before the familiar oak door. And then he does. xxx Waverly sits behind his desk, staring intently at nothing as he waits for the men to return. He's surprised at the sadness that's eating away at him. The guilt. He's lost men before, good men, family men. Soldiers, agents, civilians. But this...It's different, somehow, with Solo. More personal. It doesn't just feel like a casualty. It feels like a loss. Like a failure. Instead of the usual compartmentalizing, Waverly's thoughts run in circles, a hundred scenarios of what he could have done differently playing on repeat in his mind. For the first time in years, he's sorely tempted to return to his old habits. A needle in the arm to make him forget, at least for a few hours. Enough drinks will do the same. He sighs, reaching into his jacket for something to that will hopefully take the edge off. His fingers brush the box of smokes in his pocket before he changes his mind, opening one of his desk drawers instead. He rifles around until he finds the small box that contains his tobacco and rolling papers. He finds that rolling his own fags can be quite relaxing and he takes his time, concentrating on the task before him. A few minutes later, and he's got a perfect cigarette. He places one end in his mouth and reaches for his lighter. It takes a few tries, the infernal thing, but it eventually gets the job done and he takes a grateful drag, closing his eyes and leaning back as far as his chair will let him. There's a knock on the door and Waverly opens his eyes. \"Yes?\" It opens slightly, and a blonde head peers around it. \"Er, yes, Cynthia? What is it?\" \"You wanted me to tell you when they arrived, sir,\" the secretary says. \"Oh, yes, thank you,\" he says, straightening up. She nods, and the door closes again. Waverly stands slowly and walks around the oak desk. He takes one last drag before putting his cigarette out, and then he waits. Barely a minute passes before the door bursts open and Kuryakin storms in, slamming the door shut behind him. Waverly barely has time to react before the Russian grabs him by the lapels and pushes him against the nearest wall. \"You sent someone to fucking spy on me?\" he snarls, and he's angrier than Waverly has ever seen him. Under ordinary circumstances, Waverly would remind him of the precariousness of his situation using carefully worded threats and kindly ask him to take a step back. But these aren't ordinary circumstances, and though he's admittedly frightened (he'd be a fool not to be), he takes a deep breath and nods. \"I did, yes, because I knew what you might find there and I knew how you would react.\" Illya looks down at the floor, his fists tightening. \"Kuryakin,\" Waverly says. He's not sure what his plan is, but he needs to get his agent's attention. Illya doesn't respond. His breathing has grown fast and heavy, his chest heaving. \"Kuryakin.\" He says it a little louder this time, but the Russian doesn't seem to've even heard. The door cracks open and Waverly looks over to see Williams. He makes eye contact with the man and shakes his head, just slightly. It's enough to send him away, and Waverly returns his focus to the agent before him. \"Illya,\" he says, and the man stiffens. \"Illya, I want you to look at me.\" Slowly, Illya lifts his head. His expression is angry, but his eyes-well, his eyes are like looking in a mirror. Waverly is surprised to find a lump in his throat, and he does his best to swallow it before he speaks. \"Illya, I'm sorry.\" The agent's grip on him loosens and he looks confused. \"What?\" It's barely a whisper. \"I'm sorry,\" Waverly says again, and Kuryakin gradually releases his hold, his arms falling to his sides. Any trace of anger has left the Russian's face, and he seems...lost. For the first time since Waverly's known him, there's pain visible in his features. He opens his mouth, but quickly closes it again, clearly struggling to find words. \"I think your hand might be broken,\" Waverly says, breaking the silence. He really does think so, but he's also providing Kuryakin the chance to escape. \"I...I should go to the infirmary and have it looked at,\" Kuryakin responds after a moment. Waverly nods. \"I think that would be wise.\" He watches Kuyakin leave and thinks it's strange, how all it had taken to cut through the man's anger was two words, spoken sincerely. He sits back down at his desk, retrieves his wooden box from the drawer, and rolls cigarettes until he runs out of tobacco. xxx Gaby almost smiles at the rainfall as she makes the short walk from the cab to headquarters. Nothing quite like eight days in the hot, muggy, miserable weather of Egypt to make one appreciate the cold, rainy, miserable weather of London. \"Is he in his office?\" she asks as she enters the building. Cynthia looks up at her. \"Oh! Yes, but-\" \"Thank you,\" Gaby interrupts, setting her suitcase down and heading to Waverly's office. She doesn't bother knocking (she never does), instead bursting in and kicking the door shut behind her. \"Men are pigs,\" she announces, flopping down in the chair across from Waverly. She starts digging around in her coat. \"That being said...I got what you asked for. And more.\" She pulls the small leatherbound book from her inside pocket with a look of triumph and drops it on the desk. \"His ledger. It has everything-buyers, suppliers, even the calendar he uses to-and this goes back to my earlier statement-keep his mistresses straight. There's something else, too, but I don't know what. It's in code, but I'm sure it's not anything Solo can't handle.\" She leans back with a smug grin. It vanishes when she notices the look on Waverly's face. \"...What?\" she says. Waverly takes a deep breath and folds his hands in front of him on the desk. \"Something's happened while you were away.\" xxx ","Summary":" xxx Then \"It sounds like a simple extraction,\" Napoleon said with a sniff. \"Another rich politic"},{"Movie":"Zombieland","Title":"Coffee shop","Author":"mk94","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10680994","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This story was the idea of my dear friend PyqaFanGirl!

I call them Tallahassee = Jack Mullins Buck = Buck Mullins Columbus = Jayme Phillip Wichita = Christa Rock Little Rock = Stacey Rock (AN: She hates that name, so she wants to be called Little Rock) Ok, now on with the story! warning:Slash! Jayme found him standing around, crying while looking around frightened. \"Daddy…\" the child cried. It was heart breaking. Carefully he walked over to the boy. \"Hello there, what's wrong?\" \"I can't find my daddy…\" The boy cried, rubbing his eyes. \"How about I help you find him?\" Jayme suggested. \"D-daddy said to not go with strangers…\" he sniffed before crying again. \"Oh, okay. My name is Jayme. I work here in this coffee shop. And who are you?\" \"My…*sniff* my name is…*sniff* …B-Buck…\" the Boy said, slowly calming down. \"Ok, Buck. I just go over there and get my bag. I'm done working today. And then I help you find your daddy, okay?\" With that the young waiter made his way to the counter only to be stopped by a tiny hand. \"W-wait! Don't go! I' scaaared!\" Buck cried again. Jayme stood there nervously, taking deep breath before his next actions. \"Ok, come here…\" he said, pulling the boy up and holding him so the child sat on his hip. The still slightly scared Buck hugged Jayme who gasped surprised. He then got his bag and walked out the shop. \"Wait, I have something for you…\" Jayme spoke up and pulled out a Twinkie from his bag. \"A Twinkie for the brave kid.\" Buck's eyes widened and he smiled when he received his sweet. \"Thank you…\" He whispered shyly. Jayme blushed lightly. For a bacteria clustering of child, Buck was really adorable. Buck sneezed, which caused Jayme to shudder in disgust. \"There, there…\" he choked out, whipping the child's nose with a handkerchief. He looked away when Buck sneezed again into it (he had to ignore the image of the germs on his hand). \"Better?\" The young man asked, taking deep breath to keep calm. The boy nodded and smiled. Jayme smiled back. \"Sooo…do you maybe know where your daddy could be?\" \"I…I can't open my Twinkie…\" Buck whined and Jayme couldn't help it but chuckle. \"Here, let me help you…\" Meanwhile: \"What does that mean, you can't find him?! You are the police damn it!\" Jack yelled at two police officers. \"Don't worry, sir, like we said, we keep an eye open. Your son can't be that far-\" \"You don't know my son! Stop shitting around and- and-and…\" He broke off when he saw him with his little son. The young man sat his son down opened him some sweet and then lifting him up again on his hip. His heart jumped at this image. \"Buck!\" He shouted then, ignoring the officers and running towards his boy. \"Daddy!\" Buck shouted happily. \"That's your daddy?\" The stranger asked the boy. Such a nice voice…keep it together, Jack! \"Yeah…I'm his daddy. Uhm, Jack Mullins my name.\" \"I'm Jayme, nice to meet you\" Jayme smiled, shaking Jack's hand, Buck still in his other arm. \"Look, daddy! He gave me a Twinkie!\" \"No way!\" The father replied excited. \"Yes way!\" The little boy replied, holding up his half eaten Twinkie. Jayme chuckled by this. \"May I take him?\" The redneck smirked. The teen then blushed and nodded, feeling embarrassed. \"Of course! Here we go!\" Jack sighed relieved to have his son back in his arms, munching happily. \"Thank you so much for-\" \"No need to thank, really…\" the curly haired boy chuckled nervously, shying away. The older man watched him taking out a little bottle and putting some liquid on his hand. \"Any problems with my kid?\" He asked, light annoyance in his voice, feeling lightly insulted. The teen quickly shook his head, \"No no no! Okay, a bit. But that's my problem…I'm quite, you know…I have many phobias…and the thought of germs are creeping me out. And little Buck here had sneezed a while ago, so…\" \"Oh, I understand…sorry…\" Jack apologized. \"It's ok, don't worry…\" Jayme replied awkwardly, rubbing his hands with disinfectant. \"How about coffee?\" Jayme's head snapped up. \"…What?\" \"You heard me, you and me, coffee.\" Jack smirked seducing. The boy blushed furiously, stammering some apologizes and suddenly ran away. \"Hey! Wait!\" The older Mullins shouted after the boy. \"Great…\" he looked at his son, his mouth smeared with his eaten sweet. \"Any idea?\" \"He works here, daddy!\" Buck grinned and pointed at the Coffee shop where they were standing. The father smiled at his son. \"Wanna see Jayme again sometimes?\" \"Yaaaay!\" \"I thought so…\"[Chapter 2] Horror. The Horror! OH THE HORROR! \"Hello! Is Jayme there?\" The little clown asked a waitress. It had red fluffy hair, colored face and while the right side was yellow, the left color was blue colored. Jayme already jumped behind the counter, trying to take deep breath. Before he knew it, the clown was already standing in front of him. \"Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!\" He screamed, his body pressed against the counter. \"Hello!\" The little clown greeted sweetly. \"P-please, don't hurt me…\" the waiter whispered, clutching his notebook for dear life. The clown tilted his head to the side which made the red hair bounce. \"Okay!\" \"Fine….\" He whispered\"…fine…\" While Jayme avoided eye contact, the clown spoke up. \"Do you like my costume?\" Jayme's head snapped up. \"…what?...Buck is that you?\" The child giggled and nodded. \"I'm a clown!\" The teen tried to grin, \"I-I can see that…\" Buck just watched him. \"Do you have a Twinkie?\" \"What…?\" \"Oh! Sorry…Do you have a Twinkie… please ?\" Buck corrected himself. Jayme closed his eyes, smiling amused. \"Of course I have. Here you go\" he said and gave the clown his sweet from his bag, still not looking at him. \"Thank you!\" Buck said politely, trying to open the Twinkie. When Jayme carefully looked up at the child, he yelped as this clown's face was just in front of him. Buck was also shocked and took few steps back. \"I'm sorry…\" he mumbled ashamed, \"I just can't open my Twinkie…\" \"No, okay, I mean its fine…ok, let me help…\" Jayme rambled and opened the package for the child. \"Thank you!\" Buck said and bitt in his sweet happily. \"Sooo…\" Jayme spoke up, \"what brings you here?\" \"Oh!\" Buck remembered and took the teens hand. He squeaked at it but followed the boy out the shop. \"Nice to see ya again!\" Jayme heard and saw the father standing outside the shop. \"What took you so long, puppy?\" The man asked his son. \"He wanted to give me a Twinkie!\" Buck answered, showing his bitten Twinkie. Jack looked at Jayme, who just shrugged and grinned, looking at his feet. \"Now let's go! I'm going to be late!\" Buck shouted and ran to a black car. \"What's going on?\" the teen asked. The older man just smirked, \"I bribed your boss and now you have free time.\" \"What?!\" He looked back where said boss was counting some money. \"Christa!\" \"It's Ms. Rock to you, guppy. And now take your free time.\" She said simply and gave him his bag and shoved him to the other male. \"Have fun~\" She sang as she reentered her shop. Jayme just sighed. \"Ok, where are you taking me now, Mr. Mullins-\" \"Stop it, kid, and call me Jack. And I take you to a party!\" \"Happy Birthday!\" The crowd of children cheered as a little girl, dressed as a princess, received her birthday cake, which was shaped as a unicorn. Then her mother cut it into pieces for them. \"A birthday party?\" Jayme looked at the older man. He just watched little Buck laughing with the other children. Sigh…childhood is something wonderful. When Jack looked back at his companion, Jayme was smiling at him. \"What?\" The boy blushed, \"Nothing…just nice. You look…nice…when you smile like that-OK! Forget it! I didn't say anything!\" The teen rambled and quickly glanced the opposite way. He nervously was holding on his hem of his sweater. Mullins laughed. \"Don't be such a spitfuck!\" He laughed, clapping the blushing Jayme on his shoulder. \"Look children!\" The mother of the birthday child said. \"Say hello to our new visitor!\" The whole crowd was looking at him. No, not him, behind him! Jayme suddenly heard a honk. \"Hello my friends!\" Slowly, very slowly, Jayme turned around. \"AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!\" he shrieked, jumping up on the older man, who luckily caught him quickly. The clown who stood behind him also jumped a step back, shocked by this reaction. \"My, my…someone isn't fond of Mr. Funny?\" The clown asked, laughing. \"Stop scaring my friend, Mr. Funny!\" Buck shouted, running towards them. \"Oh? Do I have here another clown?\" Mr. Funny smiled at Buck. The child smiled briefly before looking serious again. \"Jayme doesn't seem to like you. But he is nice, so don't scare him, ok?\" The older clown glanced over to the boy and saw him flinching as they made eye contact. He then turned back to his little clown companion. \"I give my best to not scare him again. Promise\" \"YAY! Now come on!\" Buck cheered and took Mr. Funny's Hand and pulled him over to the others. \"Well,\" Jack spoke up, \"should that explain why it took him so long to get you out that café?\" Just then Jayme realized that he was carried bridal style by the other man while he hold tightly on said man's neck and quickly tried to get down again. \"Ye-yeah. Like I said, many phobias. Clowns are one of them…\" he explained. Can this get even more embarrassing? It could. After the Clown left, Jayme was greeted by the birthday child. \"Wanna play with us?\" The little princess asked Jayme. \"Oh no, I mean, I-\" \"Of course he want to!\" Jack answered, pushing the teen towards the wild crowd of wild children. \"YAY!\" The crowd cheered, pulling him with them. \"Hey Jack, I need some help here, would you mind?\" The mother called. \"Coming!\" Mullins shouted back, following the woman into the house. Meanwhile: While the boys (knights, clowns and cowboys) where running around shooting each other with water guns, Jayme sat surrounded by little fairies and princess. The girls were brushing his curly hair and giving it a nice hair bow while giving his face a 'pretty' make up. \"Now you look pretty!\" The princess spoke. \"Thank you, your highness,\" Jayme replied, smiling as the girl glee at this name. The other girls giggled. \"And now let's play marriage!\" a girl (a fairy) suggested excited. The others agreed immediately. Two girls ran off in different directions, getting few 'husbands to be'. \"And you have to talk!\" The princess told Jayme. He just nodded. After a while the first girl (a blue fairy) came back, with a curious Buck in tow. \"What are we playing?\" Buck asked. \"We play marriage! Now you have to marry Sophie!\" The blue fairy explained and pointed to the princess. The boy was thinking a while,\"…okay.\" \"Okay,\" Jayme started holding a coloring book like a bible, \"Do you, Clown Buck Mullins, want to marry your Highness, Sophie…uh…\" \"My name is Sophie Sunshine,\" Sophie helped him. \"Oh, really? Ok, …marry your Highness, Sophie Sunshine, and always be there for her and play with her?\" Buck looked at his 'wife to be' questionable. She just nodded. \"I do?\" \"And do your Highness, Sophie Sunshine, want to marry Clown Buck Mullins, and always be there for him and play with him?\" The princess nodded happily, holding the boys hands in hers. \"I do!\" \"Then, you are now husband and wife.\" Jayme finished. \"And?\" Sophie asked. \"And what?\" \"The kiss?\" By that Buck suddenly blushed. \"Ok,…you can kiss your wife.\" Jayme added and was surprised when Sophie jumped into the little clown'0s arms, kissing him on the lips. The boy was shocked and ran away. Jayme chuckled. \"I have another husband!\" The other girl (a red fairy) shouted, coming out of the house. Jayme laughed as he found the other Mullins walking out. \"So, who I gonna be my wife?\" He asked, rubbing his hands jokingly. His laughing stopped abrupt when the crowd of girls pointed at him. \"We made him pretty! He marries you!\" \"What!?\" the teen squeaked. Jack simply sat beside him. \"Chill, it's jus' a game,\" Mullins chuckled and put his arm around the younger man's shoulders. \"No! You are doing it wrong!\" The little red fairy shouted. The other girls agreed. The men were sat in the right position, sitting across each other while holding their hands and looking at each other. \"Now we can start,\" Sophie began, opened her coloring book and pretended to read. \"Do you want to marry Jayme?\" She asked Jack. He held back a laugh and answered, \"I do.\" \"And do you want to marry Uncle Mullins?\" Sophie asked Jayme. The teen was completely red by now. \"I…I…\" he tried to answer. He watched the man smiling at him and leaning over. The next thing he felt were lips on his. \"You are doing it wrong again!\" The girls shouted annoyed. Jayme broke off the kiss. And Jack received a smack. The teen stood up and left the party, wiping away the makeup and ruffling his hair in his usual way, which made him lose the hair bow. \"Jayme, wait!\" \"Daddy!\" Buck came running up to him, preventing him to follow the other. \"What is it, puppy?\" he asked his angry son. \"I want a divorce!\"[Chapter 3] To my dear friend PyqaFanGirl. Hope you like this chapter XD Since that kiss, Jack hadn't seen that boy for two weeks. The boy really knows how to avoid people! \"Do you know how hot you look, doing your work?\" The client behind him chuckled. It was a blond around 25 years old woman with a damn low neckline. 'Nice view' he thought, but he always had had eyes for a nice butt. \"Thanks ma'am.\" \"Oh, don't call me that…Jack.\" She said sweetly, reading his nametag. \"I was wondering if you want some coffee. When is your break?\" \"Sorry, ma'am , but I'm not interested,\" he answered shortly. The woman huffed disappointed, \"your loss then. How is my car?\" Jack wiped his hands on some already dirtied cloth, looking at the red Ferrari. \"Well, nothing's wrong with it. Maybe you just imagine it.\" \"How silly of me…\" the woman spoke and tried to look clumsy and innocent. She even made a gasp to try her tits get his attention. He didn't fall for it and just smiled politely and walking further into his workshop, tidying up his work place \"That makes 40 dollars. Anything else?\" He heard her huff again and a smacking sound on his desk. She paid and left with her car, disappointed and annoyed. Jack smirked and went back to cleaning some gadgets when his watch peeped. \"Oh, have to go.\" On his way to pick up his son from school, he looked out of his car window and watched a group of teenagers standing under a tree looking up into the crown. He noticed someone up there and stopped the car, stepped out and walked over to them. \"What's going on here?\" He snapped at the laughing group and many of them with their cameras held up. \"None of your business, old man!\" one boy snapped, clearly challenging the older man. \"Mr. Mullins?\" he heard from above. What he saw made his blood boil. Up there stood the waiter, completely nude with his schoolbag covering his privates. Not only that, but he could clearly see that the teen had a black eye (and that he is currently blushing, obviously). \"Who did this?\" Jack growled lowly, glaring at everyone around him. \"Who wants to know?\" The boy from earlier snapped back. \"Don' mess with me, kid-\" \"Donmesswithmaykiid…\" the boy imitated him badly, laughing with the group. Damn, in Tallahassee he would have just punch this twerp right in his ugly face. He took a deep breath, glancing around the crowd. The other teens where holding the clothes from Jayme, even throwing them at each other. Jack's hand harshly grabbed the leader's neck. The boy choked for air, demanding to be let free. \"MY…F-FATHER IS…LAWYER!\" \"Good, wanna hear what he thinks about your actions here as a professional. Jack growled dangerously. He glared at the now scared group. \"Now give me his stuff!\" He commanded and they obeyed immediately. \"And now, get lost before I change my mind and kick your asses with your parents happily watching!\" Quickly the teens ran away, shouting angry curses at him. Jack sighed and looked up to the tree crown. \"Planning to come down?\" He asked and had to hold back a smirk as Jayme started to blush. \"Uh…uh, caring to catch me?\" He asked, sitting down on the branch he was standing on. His feet were now reachable for the other man. \"What do you mean-WOAAAH!\" Jack shouted surprised as Jayme jumped into his arms, letting his clothes falling to the ground. Jack's arms were around the boy's back and legs while Jayme hold on the man's shoulders and head, his bare chest against the man's face. Jayme reddened even more before stuttering that the bag felt down. Jack let his friend down and picked up the bag and gave it to the teen. \"No problem. Just take your things…\" Jack mumbled, taking off his snake leader jacket and covered him from other curious people's looking, waiting for the other to get dressed. But Jayme didn't move, just hiding his lower half. \"Let…let just get into the car…\" the older man suggested with a sigh, knowing the boy wouldn't want him to see him completely. Jayme nodded, hold onto the jacket around his waist, watching Jack picking up his stuff and both made their way to the car. \"You can dress in the car, I have to pick up my little puppy from school,\" the older man spoke, opening the door for the other. As Jack started his car, he watched Jayme get dressed in the back seats from the rearview mirror. Suddenly he saw a butt in boxer short with printed straw berries pop into view. Before he could stop himself, he groaned low in arousal. A very nice butt. Said butt disappeared and a glaring Jayme appeared. \"Did you just-\" \"Never! What do you take me for?\" The older man defended himself quickly, ignoring the adorable flush of his passenger. \"We are here. I 'll get my son and you, make yourself comfortable here.\" … \"JAYME!\" Buck greeted excited as he sat on the passenger seat, looking at the teen. \"Do you have a Twinkie for me?\" \"Buck?\" His father warned him. \"Sorry…Do you have a Twinkie for me please ?\" Jayme smiled shyly, opening his bag carefully. \"Yes, sorry it's a bit-\" Buck then took the sweet from his hand, \"-smashed…\" \"Urgh, can you open it for me?\" Buck asked, holding it to Jayme. The teen just nodded and opened it. \"Thank you!\" \"Will this become a running gag?\" Jack chuckled, watching his son eating his Twinkie. … When Buck ran into the house, Jayme also took his leave. He was stopped by the other man. \"Do ya wanna tell me where this came from?\" The man asked calm, pointing at the black eye. Jayme looked down, scratching his head nervously. \"Well, let's just say the makeup from the birthday party made me kind of popular in school.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I had still smeared makeup when I left the party and ran into those guys on my way home. Well, since then…you saw it.\" \"I'm-\" \"Stop it. You don't have to be sorry!\" Jayme snapped. \"Just stop it! Stop being so nice to me! You may seduce other into it but I won't. I don't fall for it…\" Jack felt his heart sink. Didn't have thought that he was that bad… \"…damn, you are married! You have a wife! What will your wife think!? What will Buck think?!\" Jack blinked. \"Well, you may tell her…but she's not here right now…\" Jayme just stared at him, waiting for explanation. \"Where is she then?\" \"I don't know. One day I woke up with an empty side. No clothes, no car, ...NO GODDAMN NOTE!\" With that he kicked at his postbox which fell from his force. The teen flinched at that. \"I…I didn't-\" \"Of course you didn't know…\" Jack sighed. \"Is that the reason you slapped me?\" The teen blushed, \"y-yes and no…\" With that he rubbed nervously his arm. \"I mean…it was quite sudden…\" Jayme looked up at the smirking man. \"I'm not sorry, though,\" the man replied. \"…andmyfirstkiss…\" Jayme mumbled. \"Your what?\" \"It was my first kiss, ok! I mean, look at me! Obviously I'm not quite popular which means I never had a relationship or ever a kiss.\" Jack smiled at him and stepped closer. \"Wanna go out?\" Jayme blushed. \"Like…a date?\" he asked and grinned shyly as the man nodded. \"Ok…\" \"Are you coming daddy?\" Buck shouted from the door. \"Yeah, in a sec.\" \"A number would be nice,\" he said, pulling out his phone and gave it to Jayme. As everything was arranged, the teen made his leave. \"I wish I would have seen you like that in other circumstances, you know?\" \"Oh shut it!\" The boy shouted ashamed and ran off, but couldn't stop grinning when he heard the older man laugh.

I'll have my laptop back by the end of the week, so be ready for more! -Inky You are cursed, says Leviathan, its words felt in the prince's soul rather than heard in the air. The Cenobite, new and raw and unnamed, looks up at his god with open fear; but then, they always did. It is a tradition, It goes on, when a new regent is crowned. The Labyrinth itself places the curse, to ensure no royal shall forget their fallibility. It is your responsibility, to bear or to break. \"What must I do?\" The prince asks, his voice still too young and too human for his wretched, regal form. That is for you to find. The curse goes like this: on his one hundredth year, he will fall into a deep and impenetrable sleep. The prince learns this in his first year, and it is sung to him by the Labyrinth, woven into the moans and gasps of the souls being ripped apart and reshaped. He drops his knife which was set for the skin of an old man with a history long unpunished, and for a moment the condemned man thinks he is spared. It does not last; the prince sinks his chains into his subject, and the cries only momentarily distract him from the frightened shaking of his hands. He only gets one hundred years, when some Cenobite have lived for a millennia. Were he not worthy of being Leviathan's favorite, he would weep that it was unfair. He gives up finding a cure on the first night of his sixteenth year. The prince, like any proper regent, is respected. Loved is not a term spent so freely; such an emotion is more precious than pain, kept locked away to be shared only with a rare and special few. He is respected, admired, feared; a prince of order and discipline, a true Son of Leviathan. The sixteenth year is when the curse often manifests, he's learned; he has told nobody the conditions of his, and so he is congratulated by his favorites on an anniversary without incident. It is that night, alone in his chambers, that he decides that he will not give in to his dread of what may be. What matters is his duty, and souls, and exploration; what may come is for the future, and if he is meant to succumb to his curse then so be it. He takes a pin from the center of his forehead and wipes it clean, then presses his finger to the dull tip. He swears on a drop of dark red blood that he will make the rest of his hundred years worthwhile, that he would give his all to the Labyrinth and to Leviathan, and that he will trust his fate to them completely. The ground and sky accept his offering with a tremble that pulses through him. Every soul grows still to hear their sound. He is still an admirable prince. He is dignified, controlled, coveted; Cenobites nurture aches to either be him or be his, to have either his ethereal demeanor or undivided attention. The curse is far from their minds, trained on flesh and fortitude, and only Leviathan and the Labyrinth truly know that he is still cursed at all. For fifty years, he is content. He has stopped counting, but after many years he loses his breath for the first time. The girl who called him to her world is radiant even in her fear; her name is Kirsty and she is on the cusp of her eighteenth year and she is perfect. He has seen many like her in his time - brown eyes, dark curls, pale skin - but there is something in how her features come together and the way she looks at him as both awe-inspiring and awful that arrests his attention and seizes his mind. She is quick-witted, enough to temporarily escape her contract in exchange for another, one who has slipped from their grasp and back to the banal world past the box, aching and incomplete. The prince almost wishes for her to fail, but he stopped wishing early into his second year. She succeeds, and he is impressed. She succumbs to temptation to see her uncle's fate, and he is endeared. she escapes, and he is smitten. It is when he is sent back by her hand that he feels what he did not expect for decades; the last days are upon him. Outside he is calm; inside, he panics. How can this be, he wants to demand if his gods, I am not even into my seventieth year, how can I be so close to the end? Leviathan and the Labyrinth betray nothing, silent and steadfast. That night, for the first time since the Labyrinth last sang to him, the Prince prays with trembling hands. It is on the eve of what he has confirmed as his sixty-seventh year that he sees her again. She is beautiful still, strong, dedicated and deluded on the soul of her dead father. He allows her to go free into the Labyrinth; he promises her that they will have eternity to know her flesh. As she runs from him, he laments his exclusion from the promise. \"You were all human,\" she says. Kirsty has done more than explore; she has peeled away the covers over the secrets they didn't even realize they'd kept from themselves. Now she stands, eyes insistent, soul burning as she lays their truth before them. The prince looks at the photo in his hands, and he knows the man who looks back. He remembers slowly and in reverse; chains, hooks, his own pink hands working open the box for the first time. And he remembers something else. Elliot Spencer became a Son of Leviathan when he was thirty-three years old. The prince understands as he looks back at Kirsty. He understands as the false Cenobite doctor enters the room, he understands as he turns to face the harbinger of his curse. On the eve of his one hundredth year, the prince saves Kirsty Cotton and falls into a deep, impenetrable sleep. Today's my birthday, Kirsty thinks with bitterness as she kneels before the dead man. She is eighteen today, and her emergence into adulthood is christened in blood. She tries not to think about it, focusing on the former Cenobite. He is beautiful even with such a terrible pallor; some part of her wishes she could see him as he was before the Truth, just once. She has returned after defeating Channard and getting Tiffany home; somehow she cannot bring herself to leave. She will stay, she decides as she looks at him; and whatever the doctor did to him must have been temporary, because she can see the color draining and the scars emerging once more in his face. She waits and watches, and after several minutes the prince is restored to his true self. His pins glisten in the faint light. He is more beautiful this way, she thinks, and feels a pang of sadness that she will never know him now. Kirsty leans forward, her hair on his shoulder. \"Thank you,\" she whispers, \"for saving my life.\" She kisses the prince on his cold lips for just a moment, then pulls away. The prince opens his eyes. ","Summary":" I had another idea I needed to get down due to some uncanny numbers I worked out, so have this.

Hi, I am Chelsea. From Chelsea, New York.(no that is not my real name. just my character from zland). I have long golden blond hair, and deep blue eyes. When the virus struck. It took everybody with it. I have been looking all over the country to find somebody without blood dripping down their face, and skinn falling off every two seconds. I wish every night, that somebody. A special somebody will find me. I will cry sometimes. I will get angry, and kill things at times. It depends on how the thought makes me feel. Upset, that it is probable that nobody is out there, or angry that the zombies killed them all. I just... I dont know what to do. I pulled up to a gas station, and pulled out my handgun as I walked inside. I could really use a bag of sour cream and onion chips. I walked down the snack isle, and grabbed a few bags,\"Oo! Cornnuts!\" I said as I picked up the cool ranch bag. I grab a twinkie, before bolting out the door, and into my black Chevy truck. At the moment I was in Texarkana, but I saw nobody. Accept for a few zombies here and there, or a few bodies on the side of the road, half eaten,\"Quite the exotic road kill,\" I said to myself. I heard a suit case rolling not far behind me. I turned around, with my gun pointed. The rolling stopped, and I heard a shotgun pump. It didn't take long for me to notice what I was looking at. It was a boy. About 16 years old. He was bleeding a little on his lip, but not enough to be a zombie. Just a right cross or something. I gave him a thumbs up, to show I was human. He cautiously did the same, and I put my gun down. As the thumbs up, he cautiously did the same. This boy had short, curly dark hair, and dark brown eyes. He looked a little on the frightened, but lonely side. \"Do you have a car?\" I asked as I walked up to him. \"Umm... No.. I don't have a car,\" he replied. \"Do you need one?\" \"That would be nice.\" \"Then get in,\" the boy walked over the the truck, and got into the front seat. \"Chelsea. I'm Chelsea,\" I said. \"I-I'm Columbus,\" he stated. I nodded,\"Cool. I am guessing your headed to Columbus?\" \"Yeah. Where are you going?\" \"I was just looking for a friend, and I found you,\" Columbus smiled,\"I thought I was the only human left in Zombieland.\" \"You call it Zombieland too?\" he asked. \"Yeah. What else is there to call it? You can't have a country without people, and there are no people here.\" \"I saw the exact same thing.\" We sat in silence for a while, and I started up the truck,\"I wil give you a ride to Columbus if you want, so your not in danger of zombies. Walking is very dangerous,\" I said. \"Yeah, I know. Tallahassee said that he would drive me to Texarkana, and that was it.\" \"There is another human?\" \"Yeah. If your anything like me, you would not enjoy his company. He is very hard to get along with, and he enjoys zombie killing, like it's a sport!\" \"Sounds like a jerk.\" \"You have no idea.\" I started to drive the car. It was night time, so it was hard to see all of his features. He seemed nice enough, and he was a lot like me,\"How did you get that cut on your lip?\" I asked. \"Tallahassee. I thought we were getting along enought. I thought he could drive me a little farther. I guess not. He litterally threw me out of his Cadilac. That's how I got it.\" \"Ouch! He really is a jerk, huh?\" \"Yeah. Well, if I see him dead, I wont care!\" he said with a smile. I smiled back,\"How old are you?\" he asked. \"14. What about you?\" \"I am 15.\" \"Cool.\" \"We are getting a litlte to comfortable around eachother. We need to stop,\" I said. Columubus nodded,\"Right... You need to cut off all emotional ties, and care about your own survival.\" \"Yup,\" I replied. I continued driving. I wanted to get ot know him more, but if I did, he could turn into a zombie, or get eaten by one, and I would be sad. Sadness is volnerability. I know I said I wanted to meet a special guy, but I am not sure this is the one. He could be a friend, but nothing more. Maybe he could be something less. Could turn out to be an enemy. Some people play nice at first, then they go ballistic, and take all your guns, ammo, and car. All of your means of survival. I am just going to wait it out on this one. (not my AN-Starkiller) Authors Note: Yes Chelsea is based off of how I act. She is how I want to look, and how I dream of being. I am also in a mental relationship with Jesse Einsberg. Just Kidding! Anyways. See y'all around![Chapter 2] Starkiller again with Chelsea and Columbus (again) she wanted me to put up another. There is a box full of water what can you add to lose? I don't know if Columbus is the one. I am going to wait on it. \"Happy 4th of July,\" I said. It was dawn. \"Yeah. Too bad there is nobody to set off fireworks. Plus, that is a really bad idea, considering the zombies,\" Columbus replied. \"Sheesh, killjoy. I was just saying.\" \"I know. Sorry.\" \"It's okay. I am used to stuff like that. Dealt with it my entire life you know.\" Columbus tilted his head questioningly. I nodded, \"Yup. My family was awfully depressed. They didn't really care about holidays, or my peppy spirit at times.\" \"Oh, I didn't know. Sorry.\" \"Nah, its fine. Don't really care 'bout it.\" As we drove, we saw another car going by. It was a yellow hummer, \"That's Tallahassee,\" Columbus said. I looked over. As he drove by, he had a gun pointed at us. I stopped the car, and so did he, \"Hello there Tallahassee. My friend Columbus here has told me so much about you,\" I said. \"And, you are you?\" he asked. \"Her name is Chelsea. From New York. She is driving me the rest of the way to Columbus,\" Columbus stated. Tallahassee nodded, \"Okay. Good luck petunia, LOOK OUT!\" he yelled. He lifted his gun, and fired at a zombie running at my open window. The bullet grazed the side of Columbus' shoulder before it hit the zombie. Columbus howled in pain, and gripped his shoulder, \"What did you do that for? You could have killed him!\" I yelled. \"It was either just hit on the shoulder, or eaten by a zombie! I just saved your God dang life!\" \"Well then, let's see how you like it! OH LOOK OUT!\" I said mocking him. I shot my handgun right past him, and it grazed his other shoulder, \"Deal with it,\" I said before driving away. \"I pulled the truck over as soon as he was out of sight, \"Are you okay? Let me see!\" I said. I moved his hand, and the wound was large. It was bleeding real badly, \"Okay. Keep that pressure on it, and I will get my first aid bandages!\" I climbed into the back seat, and pulled out my plastic kit. I opened the box, and pulled out the bandages. Columbus moved his hand so I could put it on. I put it around the wound tightly, \"You will be fine. We just need to keep moving, before the zombies smell the blood. Columbus slowly nodded. I was now very worried about him, \"You didn't have to shoot him. He meant no harm,\" he said. \"He didn't seem to care that he hurt you, so I don't care if I hurt him.\" \"I know, but... He could die now.\" \"I was going to go back after I got you fixed up to help him,\" I said turning the car around to go where I saw him last. The hummer hasn't moved since we last saw it. When I looked in the driver's seat, Tallahassee was leaning back, gripping his shoulder. I looked at him, and then looked at Columbus, \"Do I have to?\" Columbus shot me an annoyed look, \"Fine!\" I said. I pulled out my bandages, and got into his car. Tallahassee didn't look happy with me, and I didn't blame him. He pulled up his gun, and pointed it at me. I put my hands up, so he could see I was just holding bandages. I put the bandages on his shoulder, his gun against my head. Columbus watched, his shotgun in hand, in case Tallahassee decides to fire. When I was done, I put my arms up again, \"I am sorry, but if you hurt him again, it will be worse than this,\" I said getting out. Tallahassee shot me an angry look before driving away. \"Happy?\" I said when I got in. Columbus nodded, \"You said if you saw him dead, you wouldn't care.\" \"Well, I lied. He isn't that bad,\" he replied. \"Yeah sure. He shoots you, and you say he isn't that bad.\" \"Okay, when you put it like that!\" he said smiling. I laughed, \"Yeah, that's what I thought,\" I turned the truck around, and started driving. We drove in silence for a while. I looked over at Columbus, and noticed he was looking at me. I blushed, and looked back to the road. Columbus did the same. Columbus glanced back at me for a few seconds, and looked back out the window.

I had this in my head for like a week now, but only just found time to start writing more regularly. Hopefully more updates will be up soon, so stay tuned! White or blue? Kirsty leaned back and squinted. No dice - she still couldn't tell. The glare off her computer screen hovered as a light between the two colors, fuzzy and discomfiting on her tired vision. She blinked and shook her head, reaching for her coffee cup. It was weightless as she lifted it, and she set it back down with a sigh. Her doctor had said no more than four a day. Maybe it counts as tomorrow? It was already 1 AM, and she was tempted; oh, was she tempted. It would make getting through this assignment easier. The word document stared at her, blank and impatient, save for the one sentence she had rewritten six times now. Kirsty sighed and closed the document without saving. She would think better in the morning, she knew that. She needed to sleep. She desperately did not want to, but her heart jackhammering in her chest and her slowly losing the ability to read had done her in. The computer powered down with a hum and Kirsty pushed away from her chair. She stood, in the dark, alone. It took ten seconds to finally start walking. She passed Tiffany's room. How Tiffany slept so easy she couldn't understand. They had seen the same horrors together, Kirsty thought as she walked into the bathroom, they had confronted the same beast. Wasn't she haunted? Wasn't she scared? Of course, Kirsty thought, running the sink as she brushed her teeth, Tiffany didn't lose everything. That wasn't entirely true - Channard had taken her mother, her autonomy, her freedom. His death had set her free from the proverbial rat cage; horrifying though the circumstances might have been, Tiffany had been saved. She had been set free from her demons, she had gotten a second chance. Kirsty had too. But the cost? Her father, her innocence, her mental health? Her clean conscience? Four - no, five with her dad - five people had died because of that damned box, and because of her. She couldn't save him, she couldn't save them. If she could turn back time- Kirsty spat. The mouthwash stung her gums and she knew it was too strong but she took it anyway, savoring the bite of cold mint in a way that seemed almost ironic. Her, enjoying a bit of something that was \"too much?\" You should have gone with them. Kirsty turned off the light and wandered into her room. Pajamas just meant a T-shirt and comfy pants, and she fell into bed with the weight of five people's lives on her shoulders. One hand reached for the bottle on her small table; the liquid medicine was so much worse than the pill, but it made her forget the dreams, if she had them. She gulped it and grimaced and set the bottle back down. She buried her face in the pillow, hugged it. She closed her eyes and waited. And waited. And waited. You should have gone with them. She could see their faces behind her eyelids; moments before their last, staring at her in shock in confusion. She had given them their humanity and taken their world away; she pictured him, the leader, the moment he'd decided to fight. To die. For her. What a waste. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered, not for the first time, and sobbed. The pillow grew warm and wet. She did not let go. She did not open her eyes. She was heavy, heavy and cold, and sinking into her mattress and the dark. A weight settled at her knees, and a hand ran through her hair. Joey, she thought. The thought didn't register. Kirsty didn't stop crying. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered again, and the hand pushed against her cheek - cold, thumb leather-clad. \"You say that often.\" She opened her eyes. They were red and puffy and masked with tears, and she could barely see a shape in the dark. She blinked but couldn't focus; instead she closed her eyes again and leaned into the touch, swallowing a sob. \"You died,\" she whispered, \"you all died. It's my fault.\" The hand pushed deeper, towards her scalp, curls falling back on her neck. She could hear the clanking of metal, and something brushed her leg. Chains? \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"though it is rarely that simple.\" Kirsty sobbed again, muffling it with the pillow; she didn't want him to see her like this. What had he said it was? \"A waste of good suffering.\" It was too gentle, too near; she couldn't remember him correctly, couldn't even give him that. \"Though this suffering has prolonged itself past any purpose. It happened, Kirsty; you cannot change it.\" \"I know.\" It was a whisper, breathless from crying, half-lost to the pillow. \"I don't know what to do.\" \"Live.\" He pulled away from her hair. \"We died so you may live, Kirsty. Do not waste that. Live, and wait.\" She didn't ask for what; she was too heavy, too tired even in her sleep. Instead she opened her eyes just for a moment and tried to look at him, and found two flecks of light that could have been in his eyes in the dark. Metal glinted around him. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered, and he stood. As he walked he grew darker, and as he leaned over his shadow threatened to swallow her whole. \"You are forgiven, Kirsty.\" His pins scraped her cheek, and she closed her eyes. The alarm cut through the silence and Kirsty jolted. She blinked once, twice. She was lying in her bed, the first rays of the morning sun peeking through her curtains and warming her cheek. She sat up - she felt rested, but heavy - and looked around her room. Had she forgotten something? She followed the walls, her eyes trying to pick out anything unusual, but nothing seemed amiss. Was something supposed to be? Wait. That word sat in the back of her mind. Something had told her. Someone. Who? Wait. Kirsty could hear Tiffany running the sink already - she was always the first one up. It was time to start the day - she had an assignment due in a week and hadn't gotten anything done last night. She stood from the bed and rubbed her cheek - why was it warm? - and made her way for the door. She didn't feel heavy now - in fact, she felt lighter than she had in months. One round of the mattress slowly decompressed. ","Summary":" It's me again!

It occurred to me that the Hell Priest would have to deal with this technologically-minded generation, and the widespread obsession with selfies. A sudden thought of Pinny's curiosity of a new victim's iPhone getting the best of him popped into my head, and...yeah. This is the result. XD Rest assured, our favourite Prince of Pain is completely in-character. I just had to get this plot bunny out, one I've had since January, and have been writing for a couple of months. I really hope you all enjoy it. It's just a bit of harmless fun, and something I hope gets a chuckle out of you all. Also, this happens to be my present for Nikette , also known as ArtGem on deviantArt , whose birthday it is today. Happy Birthday, buddy! :D Now, onward we go. PS - My humblest apologies for the lame-ass title. It was the only one I could think of. :/ - Laura Selfie-Obsessed Xipe Totec's lip curled upwards slightly as he observed his latest handiwork; remnants of what was once a young man reduced to nothing more than viscera and bone lay in bloody chunks before him. The Cenobite gazed upon the mess with an apathetic air, before he gave a sigh of boredom and moved slowly forward. With his task completed, he could now return to his realm. The hem of his floor length cassock brushed the dust-coated wooden flooring as he languidly and gracefully manoeuvred amongst the scraps of torn flesh and limbs in order to retrieve the Lament Configuration. The item in question was set where the supplicant had once knelt, almost as if in wait for its master, miraculously unstained by the human's shed blood, and nor tainted by his grease-coated hands. Though his newest supplicant did not put up much of a fight, none of the usual pleas of clemency or bartering, it was...a rather unusual summoning, that was certain. As he slowly leaned forward, his hand reaching for the configured box, his attention was piqued by something other than the key to his realm; it was something that Xipe could not have missed, as it was emitting a shrill and repetitive tone. A device lay on the opposing side of the bloodied remains, and Xipe recognised it as belonging to the boy he'd torn apart. He remembered, strangely, how the youth had held it up before him and pointed it in the Cenobite's direction. Why? He wouldn't know. His reaction to the Prince of Pain's presence and his subsequent behaviour was as puzzling as some of the humans he'd reaped over the centuries. Soon, the shrill ended, and it lay in silence. Despite himself, the Prince reached for the item, and grasped a hold of it. He turned it over in his hand and studied it closely. Then, it occured to him just what this... thing was. It was a device created in this modern era for its modern and technologically-minded citizens. Whenever summoned to earth, Xipe had heard whispers of this piece of human machinery amongst the mortals. Many of them, regardless of social status, held ownership of these things, and there had been various models over the years. It was rather frivolously referred to as an iPhone. Something, he understood, was the ultimate tool in gratification, and which combined many functions other than being a telephone. He was more than aware the earth realm was in its eighteenth year of the new millennium, so naturally with the advancing age came advanced technology. He gave a soft displeased rumble as he stared to the item that was seemingly consuming most of humanity with obsession. It was a wonder the humans were still seeking out the LeMarchand's box at all. The box, some of the newer in his Order had argued, was dated and obsolete. His younger brethren believed it to be a product of its time, old and too feeble for the newer, jaded generation whose desires needed to be indulged with digital machinery. It had even been suggested to him by a certain few of the lesser Cenobites that they should revamp the configuration entirely, with Leviathan's riddle posing as an 'app' throughout these gadgets worldwide. It was certainly conceivable. Surely, they argued, it would work just as well as this old-fashioned musical toy... But Xipe would beg to differ. Technology may have advanced significantly in recent years, but the Hell Prince was aware desire remained essentially the same as it always had been since the doorway between both realms was unsealed centuries before. Nothing of this advancing age, no matter how engrossing they were to the humans, or how gratifying, could ever steal the unconscious attention of the curious, the bored, and the weary from the path to ultimate sensation, and knowledge. The box still did its bidding as well now as it ever had. These so-called iPhones paled in comparison to kind of gratification he and his cohorts could provide for them. Absent-mindedly, the leather of his thumb ran across the screen, and it flickered to life, illuminating both the room and his astonished face. Staring back at him from the device's screen...was him, his black liquid eyes widened in surprise and pins glinted in the brightness like a halo. He held the phone at arm's length in confusion and consternation, still able to view his own countenance glaring back from such a fair distance. Eventually, he brought the device a tad closer and his forefinger tentatively prodded the screen, where soon the blood-stained tip brushed ever-so gently along the white circular panel displayed beneath his image. Then... The Prince was startled by a sudden shutter-type noise emanating from the device, and he stared to his squinting features- now frozen- plastered across the screen. \"What is this ...?\" Bemusement was not something he usually felt, and it was so unbecoming of him. Yet here he was, stood in utter bewilderment and gazing at the piece of mortal technology that now beheld a frozen image of his own face...until it disappeared, the device saving the image to one of its many folders. Xipe's hairless brow lifted minutely as he regarded the object of his incertitude, which was still held within his hand. There had been occasions in the past where situations had left him flummoxed, and even dumbfounded...but this? Never before had something so trivial and small in his eyes had disconcerted him like this piece of human gadgetry. Yet, there was something quite... appealing about it. Something that stirred the fragment of the human within him. He couldn't help but feel intrigued by it, no matter how inconsequential it seemed. A sudden crackle of energy emitting from the box reminded him that the veil between the realms was closing, and that he needed to return to his dimension, and also broke his train of thought. And the curiosity for the gadget that accompanied it. He squinted at this so-named iPhone, and cursed himself for being temporarily enticed by such banality, before he tossed it aside, turned on his heel and slowly ambled back to whence he came. The Lament Configuration, left in its master's wake, twisted its segments and slid immaculately into its default shape with an audible click, and its surroundings fell into normalcy...with only a lone iPhone as what remained of its owner, and the insanity that proceeded, resting beside it. The End... Afterword - Well, I sure hope you enjoyed this. It wasn't as funny as I envisioned it in my mind, but in the end I deliberately went for half-humorous, half-serious approach. And this very brief scenario; what if the box became obsolete, thanks to modern tech? This was something very briefly touched upon in the newest (so-called) Hellraiser film, but it was poorly followed though with how 'Pinhead' and co got around acquiring new souls. But don't get me started on that. :/ In the end, this is supposed to be just a small, for fun flash fiction type of story, and something I wrote for a friend's birthday. I did struggle to get this written, as I suffer with terrible brain fog lately which stifles my imagination and clear thought. Nevertheless I was determined to get this finished, regardless of how difficult it was. I'm also pleased by the fact this was freshly written from a blank canvas, and not an older story I've recycled. It's been a while since I did that.

Father Philip was alone in his church. He had been since yesterday. All his clergy. Sister Mary Helena and her nuns. They were all gone. The old man was alone now with nothing but his Church and the memories of the children. \"Ohh the children.\" Philip cooed. \"Oh Merciful Lord! Please protect the children from the evil that has invaded your house.\" In truth, Philip knew it wasn't the children the demons were after, it was him. They made that very clear when he first encountered them. They would get him any minute now, he could feel it. It all began when one of Philip's favorite children, Travis, found a mysterious puzzle box and brought it to the Church. Neither Travis or any of the children could figure out how to solve it. Considering it a distraction from their Bible studies, Philip confiscated the box and locked it up in his drawer. He figured that the box would never see the light of day again and that would be the end of it. But for some strange reason, Philip could not stop thinking about the box. Every day for at least a few minutes, he messed with the box in the hopes of solving it to no avail. Minutes turned into hours and his fascination with the box turned into obsession. An obsession he kept secret from the rest of the clergy and the nuns. It consumed him like an inferno and no matter how hard he tried, he could not resist the temptation of the box. One day, he finally managed to solve it. There was a flash of blue light and a earthquake that seemed contained to his room. When it stopped, three beings were standing before Phillip. They all wore black gowns connected to their bodies by piercings. Two of them were female, they're mutilated bodies barely covered by the dark latex and the only male of the group had nails driven into his skull. They were a terrifying sight indeed. \"Father Philip.\" The male creature said. \"You have opened the box and now you are marked. We will tear your soul apart!\" \"No!\" Philip grabbed a cross hanging from the wall and held it up to the creature. \"Begone demon! You are in God's domain! You have no power here!\" \"I believe you have it backwards, Father Philip.\" With a single movement of his hand, the creature summoned the cross out of Philip's grasp and into his. He snapped the cross in two with little effort. \"Go on. Run. It will make the suffering all the more delicious.\" Another flash of light and the creatures were gone. Philip spent the rest of that day trying to convince himself it was all a dream. That was the beginning of the end. The monster continued to torment Philip. At night he would see them in his dream. During the day he would see them lurking in the shadows. He never felt alone, even when he was in his office. He felt like he was being watched every second and every day it felt like the monsters were getting closer and closer. He had prayed that God would protect him but the fear remained. Today was the day Philip knew they were going to claim him. He had organized a last minute field trip to the local zoo for all the children and clergy. He made up and excuse about having paperwork in order to stay behind. After hours of waiting, he felt a shadow loom over him. He looked up and saw the male monster, his dead black eyes eating trough Philip's very being. \"It is time, Philip.\" The monster said. \"You're soul will be rendered to pieces.\" Hooked chains ensnared Philip and he cried out in pain. \"You will burn in Hell for this demon!\" He shouted. The monster bellowed in laughter. \"You threaten me with hell? Do you think I operate the same as your devils do? The Hell we are going to is not a hell of fire and brimstone but of flesh and suffering. Your God has no power over my domain. Just the same, I think you will find it very fitting Father. After all, so many of your kind are already there.\" The chains began to pull apart, causing Philip unimaginable pain. \"We'll see how you like being the helpless one.\" When the clergy came back from their trip, There was no sign of Father Philip or the box he was so obsessed with. There was only a puddle of blood on the altar. ","Summary":" A Monster's Nightmare Disclamer: I do not own Hellraiser. Father Philip was alone in his church.

Just straight lines until she ran out of room and then she'd turn and keep running. She had to keep running, she had to, she had to- She heard teeth chattering and chains. She squealed and sprinted. She slammed into a wall. It didn't stop her. Another turn and she was running, but all of this seemed the same, the same, the same… \"Sara, Sara,\" she repeated, her voice was going. Her lungs ached like fire in her ribs. She'd lost track of her own heartbeat. How long had she been running? There was a shadow in the corner ahead. She turned. Where was the entrance? She'd had to have come here from somewhere. She just had to find it, and to find it she had to keep running and running and running and And she tripped over her ankle And the stone floor was coming towards her And the chattering was still there and Sara- \"Sara…\" she murmured, dreamlike, as she was lifted into the Cenobite's arms.

As the Cenobite walked, his new student in his arms, he took just a moment to brush her hair from her face and peek into her mind. She had a song stuck in her head; it was so strange to him, how humans liked them so much, they always tried to cling to small things when they were scared, like organs to nerveless bone.

I haven't written anything concrete in a while, and thought I'd get around to finishing this piece off that I've had in progress for quite some time now. I'm usually more for writing Pinsty, but I do also enjoy writing for Joey - the protagonist of Hellraiser III, from time to time. This takes place several years after the events of the film, and somewhat serves as a prequel to Tainted Bonds, a Joey/Elliot/Pinhead story I published three years ago. I somehow feel Joey - as incorruptible as she appeared in the movie - could have grown more tainted and obsessed by the box and its wonders as time wore on, and Tainted Bonds delves straight into that. This fic intends to dip its toes into that domain, despite Joey's lack of understanding and hatred of Pinhead brought across. I hope you enjoy it! - Laura Remembrance and Regrets \"You are stronger than you think.\" It had been almost a year to the day that Captain Elliot Spencer had spoken these words to Joey Summerskill, former journalist and sole survivor of a mutilated creature's attempts to spread his craft of suffering from beyond the walls of his own realm. Joey placed the small leather-bound book she had been reading upon her lap, and leaned back into her comfortable armchair. She glanced to her left at the colossal bookcase chasing height up the wall, and her eyes fell upon the three slender books she herself had authored. She smiled grimly and tried to shake away the memories that spurred the inspiration for them, memories that were all too vivid in her mind. After the nightmare had ended, Joey had pushed to report on the very Hell she had experienced first-hand, but her pleas fell on the deaf - and rather concerned - ears of her station manager, who had dismissed her claims as a symptom of an ambitious colleague had had simply been working too hard. With so many people unwilling to believe her story, Joey decided to write down all she could remember about the Lament Configuration, the creature it swallowed, and its human counterpart who had saved her life...Elliot Spencer. Elliot . It was more than a push for the truth. Logic could easily distort facts over time, and those memories - as fickle as they were - had to be recorded for her sanity at the very least. It was important for her not to forget that there was something, a place that existed which went far beyond her own comprehension, this something that had claimed some of her friends. She missed them, but could spare no more tears for them. It would be a waste. The books she had published about this period in her life came in the form of a warning treatise masquerading as fictional novellas. They were not bestsellers, but there were buyers at least. She wondered if some of her readers were survivors like her, and if they would gain comfort in knowing they were not alone in their experience. She hoped so. It was a comfort to believe that there might be others like her who had escaped the torments of the Cenobites. It was a selfish thought, but she could not bear to be alone in that God-awful club she had unwittingly joined. In addition to the real-life accounts disguised as fantasy stories, she wrote articles in various magazines ranging from current events to vapid fashion pieces, to local hero news, all of which helped supplement her income which she had used to research that box that haunted her. For three years of writing and chasing leads, she had successfully managed to hide herself away in her apartment, not caring about big current events that were not confined within the accepted norm. All the important news remained separated from this reality and so simply smiling into the camera after interviewing local politicians or trying to catch the next big scoop by following emergency vehicles left her cold. When she quit the station and her burgeoning career, she left her old life behind, along with her luxurious apartment with the glorious view of the New York skyline...with that window. Joey smiled and thought of Elliot. He had first appeared to her as a ghostly Knight in a decorated military uniform. Captain Elliot Spencer was a fighter, and survivor from the Great War, ultimately to become a lost soul in the aftermath of Hell on Earth. She raised her hand and touched the cheek he had caressed when they had met in the window of her mind. She thought of him often, and in doing so her memories would awaken the fear of his unbound darker self. Even now, she felt the hairs on her arms prickle and the air in her cosy room felt decidedly cooler. She had named this vicious yet beautifully elegant being Pinhead . It was intended as a derogatory term and it seemed like childish name-calling now, but she hated him- no, not him, it . Still, the insult stuck and the thing with nails hammered into its gridded-head would always be known to her by that description. She couldn't bear to think that Elliot had joined together with this thing, and was still a part of that unhinged character, perhaps suffering somewhere another world away. Naivety was not part of her life's training and she knew that Elliot was human and had faults, but the fate that had befallen him was a punishment too far and too cruel. She blinked a few times in an effort to contain her tears, and carefully moved the book from her lap to the side table, taking care not to touch the current centrepiece. The book was old and ragged with dark splattered stains on the cover, which she suspected was dried blood. It was an item she had stumbled across whilst searching for information on the Lament Configuration; that small, expertly crafted puzzle-box that acted as a gateway to a dimension of otherworldly experiences. Following her own experience with the box, she became intrigued by it and gradually and obsessively gathered all the information she could muster regarding its secrets. As it wasn't in the concrete grave as it should have been, she felt the need to arm herself with as much knowledge as possible in case the thing was ever opened again, and its contents released. All the writings, journals and snippets she had amassed so far had all professed that the LeMerchand box contained pleasures beyond human capacity. Joey knew about those so-called pleasures and scoffed at the deceptive term. She had replayed Pinhead's words in her mind over and over; 'I will enjoy making you bleed. And I will enjoy making you enjoy it.' She couldn't imagine where that enjoyment would come from. It seemed like a massive contradiction, and yet maybe it was just another one of Pinhead's seductive oratories to lure the disenchanted to his world. It could have been that simple, but where that particular Cenobite was concerned there was no black and white, but shades of red. Perhaps with his warped sensibilities the pleasure was a product of the pain; she wasn't all that naive...she was aware the two sensations were a part of the same spectrum but of opposing ends that could be meshed until neither could be discernible from the other. But she could never begin to fathom why anyone would want to do such a thing in the first place. She sighed and pulled her feet up onto the armchair, tucking them beneath her. It had been another long day of research and writing, and the light in the room was dimming. She scanned her poorly furnished surroundings and felt a sharp pang of loneliness as she heard the sound of lovers laughing in the street below. After Pinhead had effectively destroyed what friends she had, she chose not to develop close relationships with anyone else, although she occasionally longed for some form of human contact and carried a longing acquiesce to the gilded life she had lived before. She also found herself longing for the man from Limbo, the handsome officer with the kind smile and twinkling blue eyes...the apparition from a war-torn Limbo who had saved her from his darker self. Sighing once more, she reached for the book on the side table and thumbed through the decaying yellow pages, eventually finding the last journal entry of Captain Elliot Spencer. 'For all I have seen, for every friend I have lost in this madness, I can count myself lucky to have retained what is left of my soul. For all the pleasures, for the burdens I have felt from each kill for survival and the demands they placed on my conscience, I can spend the remainder of my days knowing that my life is mine alone and if I do venture forth into that dark night, I will do so with strength of heart and the experience of one who has fought the good fight.' Joey closed the book and looked to the table, staring with longing towards the lone item placed upon its chipped surface. The box sat upon the wood, polished and full of promises that she knew would be tainted with hurt and regret as well as pleasure and longing. \"You're stronger than you think.\" She withdrew her hand which was tentatively outreached and ready to grasp the puzzle box. Elliot's words might have saved her again, and perhaps in time Joey would see him once more. Listening to the patter of rain hitting the guttering outside, Joey rested her head back in the seat and gave the Lament Configuration one last irresolute look before closing her eyes, where she gradually drifted into sleep. The End As I say, Tainted Bonds follows on from this. At some point, I will get around to writing an actual sequel, and explore what happens to Joey following on from...the events of that story which I won't spoil if you've not read it yet. If you haven't, then go look it up and have a read. :) I hope you enjoyed this, and it makes some sense. Thanks for reading. I'll try and write some more soon. :) ","Summary":" Author Notes : Hello.

Take the shot. \"Fire!\" Thunder. Thunder seizes my chest and I gasp for air. I open my eyes and the dust is gone. The war is gone. I am in the dark. I am alone. I am... I close my eyes again as the thundering of my pulse settles; the damned humanity left in me has more control of my body than my soul. Alas, the brain is an organ, and traces of old human sickness taint the darkness of my meditation. In shame I realize that in the midst of my concentration I have fallen asleep, perhaps for a long time. I do not know any longer. The wildness stirs; in my mind I can feel the other fragments of myself waking, undisturbed by the vision of the war trenches. And why should they be? The memories were like old viscera. They were interesting to study, certainly, but they contributed nothing and rotted in what was otherwise pristine concentration. Slowly sharpness returns to my mind and binds it tight; though I am not to move in my penance, beyond that which my body must to breathe, to see. There is nothing to see in such darkness, but that is the point. I briefly muse on past students, submerged in darkness for so long that their minds conjured images and sounds to fill the impossibility of the void. How long, I wonder, until I follow? No. A fragment of Cenobitic restraint takes hold. That is not who I am. I am a servant of Leviathan, a child of the Labyrinth; I am not to be shaped by such base human inclinations as compensating, as self-deceit in the face of the incomprehensible. Something softer answers; are dreams not the same? Ambitions? What is fear but the soul's response to uncertainty? I do not know the answer. I know this; I will remain here until my creator, my Leviathan, has been paid due penance. It will never be enough. That is not for me to decide. I close my eyes again, and I only know the difference for how dry they have become as I stared into the darkness. Visions flood through me; the trenches, the blood, a face. Curly brown hair. Kirsty. My one respite from the noise inside of me; every fragmented part of my mind quiets at once. It is a mixed blessing; for all that the knowledge that she is safe soothes me, our time together is exhaustingly brief. I linger on her image at moments, for moments are all I can grasp. I entertain, briefly, the notion of visiting her dreams. Just to hear her voice - just to break the silence in this darkness, to remind her that I have not forgotten her. Does she think about that? The thought hurts a part of me in a way I cannot enjoy. How very human of me. Dark curls, soft skin. Such an exquisite and tempting canvas for sensation - I quell the thoughts before I can lose myself to them, but I cannot deny they are there. The ache of a Cenobite is still deep within me even with my restored humanity; to draw out sensation, to push boundaries beyond the known realms of experience. There were ways to do that without hurting her - and all the fragments of my soul agree that I will never, ever hurt her if I can help it. She has had enough darkness; there is a reason the Lament Configuration opens the door with light. That is my resolve. I will see her again; I will be a proper Son and a proper lover, dedicated and driven. I will heal, and be whole, and reclaim myself. I turn my thoughts to my teachings and put the thoughts of love and comfort away. They will be incentive for the coming months of meditation, of healing, of restoration. The trenches that haunt my soul are far away. I will not fall into them again.

I guess it's an iPod challenge type fic, but not quite, as I've bent the rules considerably. For starters, I just wrote what the hell I liked, and took as long as I wanted to write them. I didn't time myself to write at the same length of the song I was writing a drabble for. I don't work like that; poor concentration is my greatest enemy where it concerns writing, and trying to write whilst listening to a song at the same time is going to be hard for me. Never mind. It turned out well, I guess, and I had a lot of fun writing these. Some of them I feel could have been better and I struggled to get right, but I'll leave it for you to judge. Oh, and some of these were written a while ago, and some are very new. I've only written ten drabbles; I didn't want to strain myself by writing twenty, or even thirty. But hey, maybe one day when my mind is a lot clearer I'd love to write a part two for this fic. Hope you enjoy! And please don't forget to leave some feedback, hmm? Cheers. - Laura 1: Always - Saliva She hated him, or at least...she always thought she did. She believed him to be the root of all her problems. Just one look at the Prince of Pain was enough to send Kirsty's blood boiling to the brim. Her nostrils would flare in defiance with every encounter, her skin would tighten and erupt in goose-pimples, her tear ridden eyes flashed with anger, and her heart would race to the rhythm of the chains swinging freely around her as she stared him dead on, fiercely determined brown eyes meeting calm coal eyes. The truth was...what she felt for him was far beyond hatred. It was an obsession. The two had shared this obsession from the moment their contrasting eyes had met across the hospital room over a decade before. Her obsession for him was far too powerful to comprehend or deal with, hence her misinterpreting it as hatred. Now blood was on her hands...she'd killed for him. Killed because her own obsession of him overwhelmed her, because she ultimately feared her destiny with him and wished to avoid it. The truth was...she loved him, even if she thought she also hated him, and she couldn't live without him. 2: Holding Out for a Hero - Bonnie Tyler If Kirsty Cotton was anything, it was certainly no damsel in distress. She was perfectly capable of fighting her own battles, and needed no man to come galloping to her rescue on a dashing white steed. She'd always been independent, and preferred it that way. Yet, however capable she appeared to be in taking care of her own self, Kirsty had a rather dangerous knack of over estimating herself. As her evil perverse Uncle Frank, dressed in her beloved father's skin, stalked her relentlessly around the old and creepy house years before, she had realised the enormity of the situation, and how desperate she was for Frank to speak his name through his own lips so that the pinheaded one could step in to save the day...and her. How strange it had been to think of this ethereal creature as the hero of the piece, to hope he'd save her. On the surface, the pinheaded Cenobite might not look like anyone's average hero with his fiercely blank stare, alabaster skin and scarred face adorned with glinting pins, but he'd certainly been hers on more than just one occasion. It seemed ludicrous to think of him by such a term, but deep down she knew that, even though she didn't need protecting, her aloof Cenobitic Knight would defend her to the death, if need be. She felt it like a fire in her blood. 3: If I Had You - Adam Lambert For many years Xipe Totec had everything his dark heart could ever desire, being that he was the favoured son to the dark God of this Hellish underworld, with legions of loyal Cenobitic minions at his beck and call, and with the power to strike absolute terror into the hearts of the most deplorable of sinners. But he had since grown weary, bored. None of that appealed to him the same, not since he had clapped eyes on her. ..Kirsty Cotton. His existence was lacking...his dark world empty. He needed someone to share it with. Someone dark, like him. If he had her, then none of this power, his high status...it could never compete. 4: Kiss From a Rose - Seal He'd been a Cenobite for nearly a century before he'd met Kirsty. He was merciless, cold, unfeeling and calculating. He'd had plenty of chances to manifest the same for her, yet when he was around her, she would temper the darkness that had utterly enveloped his soul so long before her birth. He'd been weary, bored of his dark existence...then she came along and lit up his entire world. For some incomprehensible reason, she had the ability to calm him and bring out the best in him. Whilst she ultimately grew darker with each exposure to him, he would grow more human...at least in thought. Without realising it, Kirsty Cotton had become the light on the dark side of him. 5: Looking Glass - The Birthday Massacre He'd been manipulating Kirsty from the moment he'd been reborn anew; manipulating her thoughts, making her doubt herself, forcing others around her to subconsciously fear her. He even succeeded in turning her insipid husband against her with subliminal doubting whispers, though it wasn't that complicated to do; the man was greedy beyond any human want. But Xipe Totec was also greedy; though not for wealth, just for her. Unlike Trevor, he'd had rightful claim over Kirsty, long before the weak minded male had ever violated her flesh, and he wanted this one soul for himself. He was mad with desire, and she was special, but she was also stubborn and strong willed. It would take a colossal amount of time to break her soul and spirit so she would relent and join him. It took years, but Xipe was an incredibly patient being. He could sense her will, her spirit, breaking. Her soul being chipped away piece at a time. He would cut so deep that her belief had fled her. She couldn't pretend around him no longer. Couldn't hide all of her desires, her weaknesses. The next time he came for her, nothing was said, no action was took. He'd succeeded. Kirsty was broken, and not strong enough to resist his pull. Her eyes were wide open now. Kirsty wanted to fight, but words failed her. She saw it coming, saw him coming...but she couldn't defend. 6: Monster - Lady Gaga Kirsty was more than aware he was a monster. A monster that had seduced her, utterly shattered the glowing former light that was once her spirit over time. Each time he smiled wanly at her she felt a little more of her heart break away. In time, she couldn't resist his devilish charms. She suspected deep down that he was merely using her to sate his own lusts, but she didn't really care. The Prince of Hell wrapped his arms around her waist, dragging her roughly to him, then mumbled something in her ear. \"Kirsty,\" he whispered languidly in his ethereal baritone voice. \"I find your flesh to be exquisite.\" Kirsty gazed into his onyx eyes, failing to break the stare. Those dark eyes glinted with possessiveness, a cunning smile weaving across his face. She really wished he wouldn't look at her like that. His pale fingers freely tore at her clothing,, which she allowed without a murmur. Soon, their lips met, their tongues entwined not long afterwards...then their naked bodies enmeshed. He truly was a monster in her bed. She'd dreamt of him for a long time, dreamt of couplings with him so passionate she believed she'd die. So deep in her subconsciousness she wanted him, yet she always fought him. Till now. She'd allowed it in her weakened state, and she hated herself for it. He was a monster, and he'd eaten her heart. 7: Set Me Free - Velvet Revolver Admittedly, Xipe was a very locked up and contained creature, both figuratively and actually. All the anger and hurt that had built up from his painful last years as a human being had been repressed through eternity serving Hell, and he was indefinitely leashed to the Lament Configuration without a way out unless jaded humans summoned him. But he'd had no memories of his humanity, of his tragic past, or his forced slavery for all this time. He believed himself to be a Hell creature from the very beginning of life itself, and had never been human...until she had revealed the truth to him. Kirsty Cotton had bravely confronted him, showing him evidence of his past life. She had thrust a photo into his hands, a photo of a human soldier...a photo of him as he had been before this life. For the first time in eons, or it certainly felt like eons to him, he was free. His soul was set free, anger and hurt unleashed, thanks to this one delectable if brave human girl. Now, years following on from that moment, from his death and rebirth, he longed for her to set him free once more...but not from his entrapment of lost human memories. Oh no, he would never forget the life he once had, and for that he'd be extremely thankful to Kirsty. No. He wanted to be set free, to be unleashed from his bonds. He wanted her to unlock the schism between Hell and Earth so he could have her soul...and in return he would give her his own. 8: The Reason - Hoobastank Hell was full of misery, regret and guilt, usually amongst the damned who'd tinkered with the LeMarchand's box. It was rare if one of Leviathan's creations ever felt it. Even though vicious and merciless on the outside, the God's own favoured son had one lamentation which thrummed from deep within his own heart that still continued to beat despite his immortality as Hell's Lead Cenobite. His human senses would spill into his darker consciousness, especially when he thought of her ...Kirsty, his Kirsty; her strong will and determination was the reason for his hesitance in taking her soul, of why he was weakened. Kirsty showing him one simple vintage photograph had reminded him of the good man he once was a life time ago, and with a flood of old human memories came also a flood of pain, and the regret of his actions as this Hellish being he'd been transformed into. How very nearly close he'd been to taking Kirsty's soul apart piece by piece, and how very glad he chose to let her go. Since this encounter which had ultimately resulted in his unforeseen but temporary death, Xipe was resurrected with a whole new outlook, a realisation. Kirsty is, and never was, not just any old human fodder; she was interesting, exciting, a worthwhile opponent, and he wanted to show her more than just simple pain...oh much more. 9: Haunted - Evanescence The box lay untouched on her night-stand, and Kirsty sat upon her bed, her brown eyes watching it intently and completely ignorant of everything else which surrounded her. She may have been merely sitting there, but she felt as though she was running desperately from the clutches of an unseen pursuer. A pursuer she knew all too well, she could hear him speak her name, whisper long, lost words to her. His dark, cold, ethereal voice sending delicious shivers down her spine, which she revered and hated simultaneously. She knew he was watching her, even all the way from his own dimension. Always forever there, always haunting her. Always wanting her. Saving her from those who were unworthy enough to touch her, raping her mind with erotic and painfully luscious visions of what could be their eternity together in Hell. She willed herself to remain strong, but knew she was fighting a losing battle, for her heart not only fearing him...but was loving him too. 10: Broken - Seether feat. Amy Lee Kirsty was broken. There was no doubt about it. Xipe watched her as she stared out into nothing, silent tears streaming down her cheeks and mourning for her lost humanity. It was one of those rare occasions where he was willed to her realm and was allowed to remain. She seemed so upset, and the human within him could not ignore the girl's pain. He sat next to her stoically, showing no outward sign of emotion, but inside feeling awkwardness and helplessness in the pit of his belly as he watched her sob. Eventually, his leather-bound arm curled around her shaking shoulders and pulled her close to him. A pathetic attempt at comfort from the Angel of Suffering if ever there was one. Despite the agony she was in, Kirsty registered just how strange this embrace seemed, but she knew nothing of the battle within him . The humanity in him ached to take her pain away, whereas the Cenobite he was moulded into decades ago wanted nothing more than to revel in it, to know it. To discover what it was that made her weep. He couldn't help it. The Prince of Hell held her close, lightly kissing the top of her head, his coldly pale lips brushing against her brown and tangled corkscrew hair. The human within him had won out, for once. He brought her closer, longing to feel her in his arms. It was then Xipe realised, as Kirsty finally relaxed into his leather-scented embrace, they were both lonely, broken shadows. The End...

The world is blinding in its darkness and overwhelming in its existence; everything happens all at once. The first sensation is cold, then an impact, and silence like nothing I've never heard before. I have never heard before; though these concepts are familiar to me everything is new, and I am consumed by it. Time is too much to measure, and so I will never know how long it takes me to realize that I have fallen to my knees on cold stone. Slowly knowledge comes to me; just as my eyes adjust to the dark outside, my mind adjusts to the dark that it is inside. I know that I am someone, though just who I am is unclear. I know that I am a man - I am unsure how I know, but it feels correct to me. I know I am an individual, contained within a body, and as I reach for the ground and push up I feel material at my legs. There is something at my waist; I reach with one hand and feel leather that sinks past my ankles, and I stand to find it stays touching the ground. I look down and see there is nothing else on me, only this material that is cold and rough against my legs. I reach and touch it again, and find it smooth on the outside. Rough, smooth. I know textures, sensations; I look down at my hands. White. Colors. I look to the garment. Black. I try to look down to my chest. Red. The ache comes quick and sharp as I realize six open wounds mark my chest; I stagger back from the sudden newness of pain and grapple for something, anything. My chest is warm with the sting of them and I can only barely grasp in my panic that I must be tall for how far the ground is now, and the sound of my voice in my frantic breath is deep and unfamiliar and feels too large for my chest. It is so dark, and despite not having a memory of light to yearn for I find myself wishing for it anyway. My hand reaches back and finds cold metal. I turn around and look up - and somehow, despite the dark, I can see it. It is a tall box, a chamber with open doors, dripping red and blue from glinted points that I can only just see in the dark. That is mine, I think, reaching forward and feeling cold metal of a blade protruding from the inner wall. That is where I came from. I am new; something about that puts me at peace, another idea I know without having to ask. It seems I have been made completely and all at once; for though I know nothing of this moment around me, I know of myself, and peace, and pain. Pain. The word is enticing in my mind, and I think of it again. Pain. Sensation. Experience. That is what I am here for, I think to myself, and all at once I can see the ground. There is still no light but I can see it all the same. The same metal patterns that mark my creation line the floor in a single line before me. I know there is more ground around it, but it is still all darkness; the only path clear is the one marked by the patterns, black-gold and the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I have seen very little, but I know I will always think of these patterns this way. I follow the path, leaving the box behind me and listening to the sounds of my footsteps against the cold surface. Walking becomes easier with each step; the air is cold, and I wish for something to cover myself above the waist, but I do not voice this wish. I cannot explain why or how, but I know that there is nothing more important than where I am going and who I am going to see. I finally hear something that isn't me. It is a great groaning, like gears, far over my head and all-encompassing. I can hear a pattern in the sounds but cannot understand it; yet I find myself filled with awe as I keep walking, the sound growing stronger with each step. I am walking towards it; and when I see the great white shape over my head I know that I cannot stop until I reach the shape's shadow. And so I walk. And walk. And walk. The shape's shadow swallows me after I have walked for so long that I am desperate to fall back on my knees. Black columns spiral down from its peak but those are not my destination; as I approach the center of the shadow I fall at last, embracing the sharp blow of the stone against my knees. My head bows, and something jabs my neck. I reach up to pull it from my chin. I find a long, thin piece of metal, and squeeze it only for a moment before letting go. I am suddenly aware that they are more; I can see them in the blurred edges of my vision, gray points that are mine to bear. I close my eyes and sit in the darkness. I feel the cold press into my skin and the floor press into my legs. My son. The words fill my mind and I grow tense; the voice is not a sound but a force, I hear nothing and yet I feel the words in my thoughts. They are in no language and I somehow understand them better than myself. Welcome, I feel, I have awaited you here. I am suddenly overwhelmed; my soul grows full, not with joy or despair, but with something I do not know how to describe other than awe. Lift your head. I do. My eyes are open for only a moment, but the moment is too much. The figure before me is impossible; I see a black shape vaguely formed as I am, but ever-changing and I cannot focus. In the one moment the figure is thin, firm, wide, fully dressed and completely bare, covered in scars and wounds that move and appear and disappear instantaneously along with eyes on what should be a face and palms of hands. I close my eyes and the image scatters, though I feel hands over the metal - the pins - that frame my face. My son, I give you your purpose. All at once I know what I am - a Cenobite, a member of a sacred order, an explorer, a teacher. My son, I give you your means. I feel a weight at my hips and know that it is my tool belt, hanging from my navel, and I feel a tightness over my skin. My robes, holy and mine alone. My son, I give you your name. All at once I know who I am; the word fills me and completes me, a missing piece I did not know I was seeking. I bow my head once more, filled with reverence, filled with purpose. \"My Leviathan,\" I say, and my voice is new to the air and to me, \"I am at your service.\" The hands are gone, but the metal groan above me signifies my god's approval. I rise, and turn to face the world that I can now see. The Labyrinth - my god as well - gleams before me, stone and steel and sensation. I am new, but this has been a part of me forever. I will never covet any realm when I am here. I step forward, towards its open and waiting walls, to begin in my duties. It's almost 1 AM but I had to get this down before I lost it to my memory. Slowly but surely my headcanons are swallowing canon whole, but that was kind of the point anyway. Hope you enjoy! ","Summary":" This is what I remember: At first I know nothing, not even myself.

But here we are. For now, this is merely a short drabble piece that I have intended to write for a while, but hadn't gotten around to. This is a small follow-up to one of my earliest stories here, Always Here for You . It's more along the lines of a brief peek into a much longer and detailed story which I had for a long time had in mind. I always wanted to do a follow up to Kirsty's final journey to Hell through that particular story. In planning in my mind, it was a much longer one shot story. But for now, I figured a more shorter, drabble-like story was for the best. I hope you all enjoy it anyway. Just something short and sweet, especially for Valentine's Day. :D Please do let me know what you all think. I apologise in advance it if makes no sense, or is poorly written. I did try. This is dedicated to all of my fanfiction friends and associates who have been nothing but incredibly encouraging, kind, and patient as I struggled to get my writing done. You know who you are. ;) - Laura Belonging This wasn't how she had imagined going to Hell would be like. For the longest time, Kirsty felt like a young child in naive awe, her dark brown eyes widening as the majestic being with the pins piercing the pale flesh of his head led her to the very heart of the Labyrinth. Although Kirsty couldn't quite describe the sensation, she felt overwhelmed as she bathed in the dazzling light of Xipe Totec's God in the distance. Mere moments earlier, she had unsealed the Schism for one final time, once and for all submitting herself to not only Hell's embrace, but Xipe's too. The two had solidified her final deal, and acceptance, by indulging in the rather too-human-deed of intercourse. Sex. Human pleasures should mean nothing to him, not least the act of copulation, but she had felt his enjoyment as they had passionately coupled more keenly than she had with any other human man she had ever been with. It had heightened their connection, their bond, more wholly than it had been previously. Xipe, too, was experiencing a similar feeling; no other female had fulfilled him quite like Kirsty Cotton. Now she was to be his consort, his mate, for all eternity. But only if his Lord and Master deemed their union to be to His approval. He had taken her to Leviathan, granting her an audience with the deity, which he proclaimed as a high honour to any individual. Her very presence in this otherworldly dimension, this Labyrinth, had swept her into a feeling of numbness. The place that surrounded her was utterly breathtaking. She had stepped foot on the earth of this plane before, but had never noticed its beauty those many years ago. Not until this very moment where her heart, her mind, and her very soul, had embraced her darkest desires. Her whole body shuddered as she walked through the dark corridors and endless passages. Before long, the Prince of Pain had led her to his Lord and Master, the behemoth with the same etchings and arrangements of the accursed puzzle box. The God rotated unsupported in the greyish dark skies above them, its disjointed droning and inhuman noises incomprehensible as ever to Kirsty. Instantly, Kirsty felt her body caving in from the inside as Leviathan basked them with a melange of light and darkness, much like trying to stare into an eclipse. Kirsty's past overwhelmed her as the God's beams of darkness swept over her, scrutinising every inch of her and delving into her very soul, forcing her to face her deepest desires, her lusts... and her pain. Then there was peace. A feeling of utter clarity. Beside her, Xipe dropped to his knees, bowing before his Lord as a sign of respect and dedication. Kirsty wasted no time and quickly followed his actions, wanting to come across as courteous. A thunderous inhuman rumble echoed throughout the mystical world, causing Kirsty to flinch. She wondered what this meant and what would happen to her. She threw a quick glance toward Xipe, who merely responded with a slight smile. \"You are being welcomed into our domain, Kirsty.\" \"How do you know?\" she asked, her eyes drawn to his as if searching for deceit. But even within such pools of pure obsidian, she could not find the slightest trace that he intended to deceive her. Quite the contrary; his eyes reflected such reverence, and genuine admiration as he stared into her questioning brown orbs. \"Only those who are truly devoted to Leviathan may hear His voice.\" Xipe revealed, his voice laced with a small hint of fervour. \"If you wish to follow this path, you will soon relish His glory. All in good time.\" Kirsty still felt somewhat unsure, especially when in the presence of a Godly being that far surpassed her wildest comprehension. But, with the Dark Prince of the Labyrinth by her side, one who had dedicated himself to welcoming her his world, she felt that the sights he had to show her would be worth all the pain she would undergo in the meantime. For now, all she would feel is an immense sense of belonging, following years of loneliness among the kind she had fought for years to remain a part of. This place she once tried to escape had been her destiny, her legacy...and now forever would be her home.

I have no idea if it's good because I'm posting this at 3 AM, but it's here, it's weird, and it's Pinsty. Enjoy. - Inky Lucid dreaming was when you were aware that you were dreaming, and could influence it, right? Then Kirsty could call herself a marginally lucid dreamer, she supposed. The 25-year-old knew she was asleep, knew this was all impossible in her realm, and wouldn't quite make sense in the only other she knew of. Maybe it did, in some pocket, but regardless she wasn't there because she did not, she did not, open the box. She was dreaming. Too bad there was nothing she could do about it. She couldn't wake herself up. Pinching didn't work, plucking a hair out didn't work, even deliberately kicking a wall did nothing. She couldn't influence the dream or change it no matter how she concentrated; she had control of nothing but herself, and so she was struggling to pull herself away from her surroundings, praying there was some quiet in this dreamspace somewhere, because it certainly wasn't here. The world around her shimmered in pale gold and black; the ground below her was polished tile, and the walls were gilded onyx framing diamond-patterned windows with champagne-colored glass. She was in a swirling and laughing crowd – a ball – and they danced with merriment in their sparkling black and pale gold regalia, swirling skirts and twirling shoes and finery. And, of course, blood. There was so much blood. Kirsty was trying to make her way out of the crowd. As they moved, she could see the revelers for what they were; bones and exposed tissue in fine gowns, mutilated, filled with wires and rings. Metal sang as it scraped against itself in their dances, leaving red footprints and trails from skirts behind them, and the dancers laughed and swirled like nothing was wrong. This wasn't even a nightmare at this point, Kirsty thought as she finally navigated away from the dance floor. This was just plain weird. She managed to get to the punch table, and in spite of herself, she poured a glass and brought it to her nose. It smelled flowery, and was a clear color somewhere between rose and champagne. Because this dream couldn't just be weird and uncomfortably pretty, it had to be pretentious, too. Still, it smelled normal, and dipping her napkin in it did nothing odd, so she carefully brought it to her lips and sipped. It was tart, and tasted like citrus and flowers. How she knew what flowers tasted like, Kirsty wasn't sure, but there you go. It was only now, glass in hand, that Kirsty managed to look down and see herself for the first time. She was dressed in black, like the rest; a full dress of something shimmery that reminded her of silk, and the bodice (corset? Top? The part covering her chest) was strikingly familiar to that Cinderella movie she'd seen with her friends in the theater. It had the same hug to her body, the same puffy sleeves that wrapped over her chest and met between her ribs. A single white-gold rose marked the meeting point, dusted with glitter. Her hands were wrapped in long white gloves – opera gloves, she thought. Kirsty was not going to check her shoes, because if they were glass, she was officially quitting dreaming. The music – which was almost but not quite earthly and seemed a little off-tune – slowed, as did the dancers. It lulled, then stopped, and as she set her cup down she suddenly felt many eyes on her. What? She wanted to ask, feeling looks behind bone-masks and wired flesh gazing at her. What do you want? A tap on her shoulder. She turned, and saw a pale hand extended to her, the thumb and small finger wrapped in leather. She took it before she recognized it, and by the time she looked up, the Hell Priest was leading her to the center of the room. She didn't scream. Impossibly, she wasn't afraid. Perhaps she was somewhere deep down, but this was a dream, and her mind was telling her that she was safe in the dream-space. And so Kirsty Cotton let the man with the gridded, pinned head put his arm around her, the other hand still holding hers, and pull her close. He had a calm, distant, but visible smile, and his eyes never left hers. If she hadn't been so baffled by what he was doing and by what she was doing, she might have thought he looked fond of her. The music picked up again. All chaos was gone; though the sound could not have been any earthly instruments, it was perfect, and it all but carried her feet for her as she began to move with him. Kirsty followed the Hell Priest, or perhaps he followed her, and the dancers moved in time with utter perfection. They blurred in the corners of her vision, as she was now fixated on him, her expression perfect calm even as a thousand questions reeled through her head. Did he create this? Is he real? Is he dreaming too? Can Cenobites dream? What does he want? What's the point of this- His hand left her side to cup her cheek, and that smile – for just a moment – softened into something she dared not call loving. \"It is a gift, Kirsty,\" he said, and she realized the music had the exact same impossible quality as his voice, \"nothing more. My gift to you.\" \"But why?\" He pulled her close again, and they swayed, and now there might as well have been nobody else at all but them. That should have worried her, she thought, that he could make it seem that they were alone. Even if it was a dream. \"Why this?\" \"To show you,\" he said simply, and when had he stepped closer because her chest was brushing against his now, \"that there is more here than what you know. That my world could be something wondrous to you, Kirsty. It does not have to be a prison.\" Slowly the world around them was coming back, and the music was winding down. He leaned towards her, his pins brushing her cheek. \"And you do not have to be a prisoner, Kirsty. Not as you believe. You belong to me.\" That smile again. \"And I belong to you.\" He kissed her. That was what she would tell herself when she woke up. He kissed her, and she certainly didn't lean towards him as he did, and she certainly didn't close her eyes as he did and allow the pin caps to scrape over her skin. She was about to relax, about to let herself succumb to the strangeness of it, when she was suddenly aware of her sleeves being ripped off her shoulders. And when she opened her eyes, it wasn't her sleeves, it was her blanket. She was lying on the sofa, and it had fallen to the floor. The TV was still on, the credits to Cinderella playing on mute. She'd fallen asleep watching it. Of course she had. Kirsty pushed herself off of the sofa and groaned, stretched, checked her face. No scrapes. She started walking towards the kitchen, licking her lips. She suddenly really wanted some lemonade, or maybe something like rose tea. Anything that tasted like citrus and flowers, something real to distract her from the fading gold and black of her strange, strange dream.

How's it going? So I wrote these drabbles a while ago and posted them as a two-part series, but took it down when I wanted to work on them again. I've fixed up a lot of errors and made some of these longer, and now I'm re-posting. I hope you enjoy them. :D I love me a bit of Jelly (Joey/Elliot), and I figured I'd exercise my writing skills whilst also delving into the Jelly dynamic for a change. Let me know what you think. Thanks for reading. - Laura Prince The dark side of the World War One Captain may have been the Prince of Pain, but Elliot was the Prince of Joey's throbbing, naive heart. Dreams Joey's night-time world of war, death and pain had allowed Elliot Spencer to enter into her subconscious. Her dreams had brought them together, and for that she was grateful, and so was he. Dark Limbo was a dark and desolate blood-soaked place of pain and regret, never failing to remind him of the suffering of his past. But then Joey Summerskill had stepped through the window from her world and brightened his. Hell It was the place Elliot has ever known, but Joey hoped and prayed he didn't have to go back to that wretched place known as Hell. Modern The world in which she lived was alien to the Captain, but Joey hoped that if there was a glimmer of a chance in which he could be saved Elliot would leave his old dwelling behind, and then embrace and grow accustomed to this new modern world. Alive He had claimed to be dead, and had been so for over seventy years, but Joey thought to the contrary. With eyes so vivid, vibrant and bright Elliot Spencer couldn't look any more alive. Quiet For a reporter, Joey Summerskill enjoyed the peace and tranquillity of silence, but she could not bear the quiet on the ghostly representation of the Western Front the longer she stood there, and neither could Elliot. Father Captain Thomas Summerskill; Joey had never known him for he'd died before she was even born. But she often wondered - having met Captain Elliot Spencer - if Elliot was anything like her long dead father. Sword If he had held possession of one, Elliot would certainly take up the sword against his darker self to protect the one woman who'd risked life and limb to keep the world from falling to Hell. Human Though he hadn't been one for a very long time, Joey Summerskill made Elliot feel like a human being, and not a supernatural entity who once governed an alternate dimension with pain and order. Rest There was no rest for Elliot, even following his redemption. But Joey could rest quite easily in her bed now, knowing she had helped him to stop Hell itself in its tracks. Bond The night of Hell had long since passed, and so had Elliot's sacrifice. But Joey could feel him each night for the bond they'd forged together that eventful night had never been severed. Regret Joey regretted a lot of things in her short but eventful life. But nothing quite like the regret she felt over losing Elliot Spencer to his darker self, and she would have given anything to spend more time in this extraordinary man's company. Trust Always ensure your source is trustworthy; that was one important rule in TV reporting. Though to trust a ghost telling you a creature adorned in pins was coming to Earth was another thing - but looking into Elliot's soft blue eyes, Joey couldn't help but want to trust him. Mask Pinhead's inhuman face was Elliot's, yet wasn't; it was like a mask of smirking, twisted sadism, the perversion of Elliot's gentle and kindly features. Tears Joey watched as Elliot's form merged with Pinhead's, swallowed whole by the creature, not being able to stop the tears of sadness that silently slid down her cheeks for the fallen Captain. Shine When Elliot smiled, his baby blue eyes would shine like beautifully polished marble, or the finest sapphire jewel. Key The window to her New York apartment had once been the key to Elliot Spencer's realm; now a month on following Pinhead's defeat she still stared intently toward it, completely seeing beyond the glorious city and wondering if her other-worldly saviour in the Army Uniform was still watching over her. Imagination Was it her imagination, or did Joey see a flicker of love within Elliot's frantic blue gaze as she was strung up like a piece of meat and bound in bondage by Pinhead? Kiss Joey felt so silly for wishing Elliot would lean over and kiss her lips following the reassuring gentle stroke of the cheek. Soft Joey's knees felt as though they'd buckle beneath her when Elliot Spencer began gliding his soft fingertips gently along her cheek. For a 'ghost' his hands were surprisingly warm and tender. Smile It wasn't just Elliot's soft, thin lips that smiled at Joey so beautifully, but his frost blue eyes too smiled, beaming brightly and warmly toward her. It was then she realised that a man with eyes that smiled should surely be trusted, even if he was once the Prince of Hell. Flame Once Elliot's masculine hand had ghosted across her cheek, the spark Joey had fought to ignore had just caught flame onto a very lethal and flammable trail of matches, setting her alight with arousal. Wings He was once a creature dedicated to pain and pleasure, almost demonic, but to Joey...Elliot Spencer looked every inch an angel; all he needed was wings. Ice Elliot's eyes were so vividly blue, like ice over a frozen clear river, but Joey seldom felt cold when she returned the kindly soldier's blue gaze. Instead she was enveloped with warmth. Hero Even the redeemed Elliot Spencer thought very lowly of himself. He saw himself as the villain all due to the hellish activities of his darker half. But Joey didn't see him as the villain; she saw him as the hero, her hero. Fool Back within the Labyrinth, a now Cenobitic Elliot thought constantly about the feisty but brave reporter who'd helped him to defeat his other self, whilst also battling along with his darkness which thought him a fool for having grown feelings for this human female. But the good Captain cared very little for his Cenobite other half's chastising mocking behaviour; to him, the Cenobite was the fool for attempting to mar such a beautiful creature. Victory Joey and Elliot had been successful in deterring Pinhead's plan to turn Earth into a garden of marred flesh. But their victory had been oh so bitter-sweet, for Elliot too fell with his darker self back to Hell. Touch Several times over the course of their meeting had their flesh met; the handshake, the stroke of her cheek, but Joey couldn't help but crave more of his touch. Goodbye As his unblemished human features mingled painfully with the decorated face of his darker other half, Elliot managed to gaze toward the frantic-looking Joey Summerskill through what was left of his increasingly darkening eyes; and as he finally felt the last remnants of himself sink into the darkness, the Captain felt a pang of sorrow in his heart for not being able to bid the beautiful reporter goodbye.

She thought that she would have been able to find him by now, but it seemed that no mattered how hard she tried to stay on one path she always kept getting lost. She wasn't even sure how much time had passed by now. Hours? Days? Maybe even weeks? She didn't know, but right now she didn't care. All she cared about was finding her father. The labyrinth was very dark and there was a bit of fog that also made it difficult to see where she was going. It was so difficult to see that she almost didn't notice the long rusty chain that stopped her search. Once she managed to see it she managed to stop when she was mere inches away from it. Before she could register her situation, the chain drew back almost as quickly as it came out. Just behind the fog emerged a cenobite, but not just any cenobite, it seemed the one that was their leader, the one she nicknamed 'Pinhead'. His expression was difficult to see at first, but once he got closer to her she could see it was eagerness mixed with something else she couldn't quite pin down. \"Ah, Kirsty,\" his deep dark voice purred with satisfaction. \"I did not think that we would meet up again so soon.\" Kirsty couldn't help but sneer. \"What the hell do you want?\" she growled, trying to sound as intimidating as possible. His expression went from eager to confused. \"I just wanted to have a friendly chat,\" he grumbled. \"No need to be so hostile.\" \"And why do you feel the need to chat with me? Don't think for a moment that you will take my soul!\" \"This isn't about that, child.\" Pinhead suddenly paused for a moment, then held out his right hand. \"Shall we dance?\" Now it was Kirsty's face that turned to confused. \"Why would you want to dance with me?\" she asked, trying not to let down her guard. Pinhead was grinning now. \"Why not? I feel like it would be rather fun to interact like this before I destroy your soul. Besides, I feel like we are physically compatible enough for a dance, don't you think?\" Kirsty glanced down at Pinhead's hand, then back up to him. She was starting to develop conflicting feelings for this creature. She was terrified of him, she knew that. On the other hand, however, she couldn't deny that there was a sort of sophisticated charm about him. She then decided that it would probably be nice to have at least one good memory if she really did end up in Hell for eternity, so she silently took his right hand while his left hand placed itself at her waist. There was enough space between them to fit a cardboard box. The two simply slow danced in circles for a long time. Kirsty made it her main duty to not make eye contact with him. Finally after some time had passed, Pinhead spoke up and his voice made Kirsty jump. \"Why are you so determined to find your father?\" he asked curiously. \"He's the only real family I have left,\" Kirsty sighed. \"He's the only thing I have left that I truly love.\" Pinhead raised a nonexistent eyebrow. \"And what makes you think that you will find him here?\" \"Well, back at the hospital he kept sending messages that he was in Hell and that he needed help. I just want to find him and try to start over again.\" Kirsty paused for a moment before asking another question. \"Why did you break the deal with me?\" Pinhead looked confused again. \"What deal do you speak about?\" he asked. Kirsty grew agitated. \"Don't pull that shit with me!\" she snapped. \"We made a deal that if I gave you Frank you would leave me alone, yet you and the rest of your friends decided to try and take me back to Hell anyway! Why did you break the deal with me?\" Kirsty then noticed that the space between them was becoming smaller and smaller. When their bodies were almost touching, Pinhead took a finger, placed it under her chin, and lifted up her head so that they finally made contact. \"Kirsty,\" he purred again, \"you have such a powerful soul. Not only would it be quite foolish of us not to take it well...I personally do have a preference for more powerful souls such as your own.\" Kirsty couldn't help but blushed at his words. It was the most bizarre compliment she had ever received, but it also felt like one of the most sincere. Before Kirsty could think of something to say next, Pinhead suddenly bent down and kissed her on the lips. Kirsty had no idea how to react to this, things had gone from unsettling to so confusing extremely fast. It felt like an eternity before Pinhead finally pulled away from the kiss. Kirsty was relieved and disappointed at the same time that he pulled away. She then asked herself why she'd be disappointed that he'd pull away. \"W-why did you do that?\" Kirsty stuttered while still blushing bright red. Pinhead's grin got wider. \"Just wanted to observe your reaction,\" he giggled, but Kirsty detected something else in his voice that seemed like he was hiding another reason. Their bodies were touching now and this made her uncomfortable. Before she could register anything else she pulled away from Pinhead and she quickly became angry again. \"That shit wasn't funny!\" she snapped. \"Now if you will kindly excuse me, I'm going to return to searching for my father!\" She took a moment to see his reaction. For a split second, he almost looked upset. However, it was only a few moments before his face turned serious again. \"Very well, child,\" he said in a stone cold tone, \"but I shall tell you again that your father is in his own hell, and quite unreachable. I have no idea who it is that has sent you messages, but I can assure you that it is someone with ill intentions.\" \"I don't believe you,\" Kirsty growled. Pinhead didn't say another word, he simply stepped to the side as Kirsty went on to search for her father. Still, as Kirsty continued her search, she couldn't get that kiss out of her mind. Why did he decide to do that so suddenly? Why did she sort of like it? Kirsty quickly got those questions out of her head as they only distracted her. However, one final question still lurked at her subconscious, could Pinhead be correct? Was whoever was sending her these messages someone who was out to hurt her? \"No way!\" Kirsty shouted to herself. \"That thing is only trying to play with my emotions!\" After that reassuring answer, Kirsty continued on her search, completely oblivious to the fact that Pinhead was keeping an eye on her within she shadows of the dark labyrinth. Hey everyone. I just want to apologize for being inactive for so long. The only reason I can give for such long inactivity is life and the fact that I kind of lost the spark I had for writing over the years, but now I want to work to ignite that spark again, so I'll try to write more now that I have a lot of free time. I know this is a short little thing, but I still love the ship and the Hellraiser series so much and this was just a little thing to help me get started again. Hope you enjoyed.

It's also a break from the old angsty-horror routine; it's a humour/parody with a smidge of an hilariously cute romance, AND it's a small crossover. And it's not really for taking seriously, so don't expect pain and suffering. LOL ANNNNNND...it just so happens to be a birthday present for a good friend of mine, ArtGem from deviantArt , and Nikkette on here. I've had a lot of fun rewriting it, and I hope everyone enjoys it, including the birthday girl. ;) - Laura Uninvited Guests Kirsty struggled through the door with three large grocery bags of party nibbles and colourful birthday paraphernalia. She deposited two of the bags on the kitchen worktops, and swore loudly as the third crashed on to the cool tiled floors, spilling out some coned party hats that looked as though they had been vomited on in Technicolor. All this mess was to be organised by night fall for her friend who had been invited round to Kirsty's apartment for birthday celebrations. Kirsty smiled to herself as she considered that term. Friend ...the first one she had made in so many years, and she was making damned certain she would keep a hold of her. A kindred spirit of sorts, Kirsty had met her online through a forum aptly entitled ' Victims of Supernatural Abuse' , and had struck up a conversation which admittedly wasn't hard as it was her new friend's own site. Kirsty had been the only one thus far to register to the unusual website, and she had immediately felt a connection to the young woman, and although she thought her new friend's troubled past was all too ludicrous to believe - a burnt, disfigured man killing teenagers in their dreams, come on now! - she felt at ease discussing matters which any 'normal' person would have seen her on the one-way express to the Loony Bin. Life, for the first time in a long time, was looking good. She had the kind of company that didn't want to strip the flesh from her bones, and that was good company indeed. When she had gathered up the party poppers and the last of the runaway cupcakes from beneath the table, she set to work in the front room to tackle the decorations. The decorating had gone well, with exception of an interruption by a man delivering a parcel. A bit odd for the time of day, but then she had ordered a gift online and in comparison to the surreal way in which her life had turned out, this was nothing to fret over. Kirsty gave herself a mental pat on the back for a job well done and distractedly opened the small parcel. When she felt the familiar lacquered surface brush against her fingertips, she dropped the partially unwrapped Lament Configuration, it bouncing lightly against the soft brown carpet. \"Fuck! Not again!\" she wailed, staring intently at the glowing box of Hellish wonders. For some time following her last encounter with him, she had attempted to get rid of the golden puzzle box which had stalked her for all these years, only to find that it had been recovered and sent back to her. She had thrown it in lakes, toasted it in her fireplace, and even tossed it into acid baths. She had once buried it and sown the ground with salt, only for it to be unearthed not long afterwards. She had even sold it on eBay, but the blasted thing was like a boomerang. Of course, once she had touched the box, it would open of its own accord. It wasn't even trying anymore. It was less of a puzzle box and more of a beeper nowadays. As the box variously lifted its intricately patterned pieces and clicked its dance of Hades, Kirsty began to panic. She had run out of things to bargain with and she was fairly certain that her pin-headed friend had become a little obsessed with claiming her for...well, she didn't know what for, but she was certain it wouldn't be pretty. Even now the walls of her small sitting room had cracked and spread wide open. The dull orange light of her bulb had flickered briefly and petered out, leaving the room to be enveloped in a cold blue hue which proceeded... \"You!\" The Cenobite known to her as 'Pinhead' glided gracefully into the room, followed by three of his party, in all his leather-wearing, pin-studded glory. He languorously manoeuvred his way around the sad little sofa she kept and ignored the cat which was stretching on his back and trying to occupy the entire length. The cat briefly looked at the figure approaching his food-bearer and realising that he had no tuna to offer, yawned and fell back into feline unconsciousness. Pinhead stopped ahead of Kirsty and gave her a menacing smile, at least Kirsty thought it might have been menacing. It was hard to tell with him sometimes. His icy onyx eyes took her in, from breast to legs, taking in her rather attractive and figure-hugging dress, in an almost hungry and predatory glance, like he was checking her out. His eyes lingered for what seemed like forever on her exposed thighs which made her want to blush and slap him at the same time, before he returned his gaze to her questioning face. \"Ah, we meet yet again. I am beginning to think that you enjoy our little encounters, Kirsty.\" he drawled. \"I...er.\" There was nothing Kirsty could think to say. Nothing new she could tell him, or offer him. She could feel the panic rising within her. Her new BFF would be there soon, and it wouldn't be much of a birthday present for her to see what was left of Kirsty's remains covering the flock wallpaper in her apartment. What was she to do? At this point, she noticed that the other Cenobite were looking about the room with what seemed like perplexed and maybe even horrified expressions; at least as horrified as the horrifying could look. The Female Cenobite was staring at Kirsty's attempt at a glitter ball hanging in all its tin-foiled glory next to the ceiling light. Kirsty felt a rather perverse sense of pride at the creation and it looked especially pretty when it bounced off the blue supernatural glow. The open-throated female seemed almost hypnotised by the crafted mess of tin and would remain so. The fat Cenobite, nicknamed 'Butterball' by Kirsty, was looking at the mini pretzels and overly crusty sausage rolls placed in circles on the pastel paper plates, gradually shifting away from them and shaking his bulky head in disdain. The Chattering Cenobite, in the meanwhile, had taken an interest in Kirsty's cat that was in turn taking absolutely no interest in him. With the three other Cenobites preoccupied, Kirsty jumped a little when Pinhead had seemingly drawn much closer to her, close enough to feel his icy breath upon her cheek. The elegant and regal Cenobite turned his head to the left and then to the right of him, looking upwards toward the explosion of death-by-pastel. His features ranged from the disgusted to confusion as his coal eyes followed the hanging decorations from each corner of the room. Kirsty wondered if it had been a huge mistake to put up pink paper chains. It took a good long few minutes before the Lead Cenobite finally brought his gaze back to Kirsty. She still couldn't think of anything to say and it seemed for the moment, neither could he. \"The box,\" she finally gasped. \"It was sent to me-\" \"You opened it. We...\" Pinhead watched with evident bewilderment as one of the paper chains came loose and fluttered sadly to the carpet. \"...came?\" \"Listen, I-\" \"No more deals, Kirsty. There have been many and I have afforded you each opportunity to prove your mettle, which you have done admirably. Now it is time.\" \"No! No deals I promise. It's just...It's just...\" Kirsty scanned the room, desperately trying to think of a way out of this sorry situation. Her eyes finally fell on the paper hats on the side table. She inwardly groaned, knowing what she had to do to postpone her soul from being reaped finally by the ever-devious Cenobite in her present company. Well, it was either this ...or have her sorry ass dragged to Hell for an eternity of pain. After what seemed like a lifetime of deliberating, Kirsty snapped her head around to face the Cenobite, grinning inanely. \"Happy Birthday!\" she chirped, her voice high-pitched and wavering. Pinhead's gaze darkened and he studied the figure in front of him, who was wavering her hands outstretched in some kind of mocking celebration of crucifixion. \"What is this game?\" he growled. \"No game. Remember when I told you that you were once human, you were Elliot Spencer?\" \"That was an age ago, girl, and there is little that remains of him.\" \"Well,\" Kirsty said, sidestepping toward the paper hats. \"The part that remains has a birthday.\" She grabbed the hat and a paper party kazoo for good measure and approached the flummoxed Cenobite slowly. \"Soooo...Happy Birthday!\" she said again with a big grin that she hoped gave the impression of sincerity. The pin-studded Cenobite watched in growing confusion as Kirsty carefully placed the cone hat on top of his pins and weaved the elastic strap between the rest of his piercings. She blew once on the kazoo nervously and then loosened the paper tongue stuck on the Cenobite's chin pins. \"Sorry about that.\" she muttered. Before he had a chance to say anything, she leaned forward and cocked her head this way and that, trying to position her nose so it wouldn't encounter the metal protuberances that decorated his - in her mind grudgingly - handsome face as she moved in to kiss him. His eyes seemingly widened slightly in puzzlement as her lips touched his softly in a gentle kiss, it was barely even that. It was merely intended to be a quick birthday peck on the lips, and then retreat, so she was more than a little surprised when the Cenobite's hand pushed into the small of her back to hold her in place, with his lips now hungrily devouring hers. Well, this was an interesting if unconventional means of yet again bargaining her way out of his grasp, not to mention a pleasurable one. Never in all the time did she ever believe she could actually share a kiss with this creature of Hell, let alone enjoy it. Still, least it was keeping him satisfied for the time being, and preoccupied from his default plan of tearing her soul to shreds. As they kissed - his tongue pleasantly cool and not too probing - Kirsty noticed that the Female Cenobite was still mesmerised by the wafting globe of silver, Butterball now seemed to be bravely prodding his chubby finger into the guacamole dip, and Chatterer was gently tugging on the cat's tail. He hadn't noticed that the feline had opened one lazy eye and did not look pleased to be disturbed from his catnap. Relieved that she and the pin-studded Cenobite in her embrace were not in the general watch of the three in his Order, Kirsty settled back into the passionate kiss, her hands holding his shoulders as the kiss deepened, and was evidently enjoying it, before the doorbell rang. Pinhead pulled back quickly, scratching Kirsty's cheek with a pin in the process. The rest of the Hell's Angels-to-some broke free of their distractions, except Chatterer who was struggling to tear Kirsty's angry cat from his face. Kirsty gazed up at Pinhead who stared back at her perplexed. He looked thoroughly confused about what had just occurred between he and the beautiful brunette, and finally breaking their stare and looking to his fellow comrades only deepened his confusion, especially upon seeing Chatterer with new bloody welts on his face. The ever stoic Hell Priest frowned and slowly picked the colourful and jubilant cone hat from his pins, handing the offending item back to Kirsty. \"I guess the party's over, huh?\" she said, exceptionally pleased that she had finally gotten a chance to say that, but deep down feeling somewhat disappointed her magical kiss with him had also come to an end. \"Mmm.\" the pinheaded Cenobite halfheartedly replied, looking almost lost in his thoughts. Kirsty stood motionless, watching as each of the Cenobites turned with a swish of their leather cassocks and returned from whence they came, obviously very empty-handed. Their diamond entity God was obviously not going to be very pleased with the lack of a soul, the Cotton girl thought, feeling awkwardness on their behalf. The Female and Butterball sauntered away together, shaking their heads, with Chatterer following behind and sheepishly picking at his weeping wounds. Pinhead left with some regret that he never had the chance to bellow some magnificent one-liner or an exquisitely turned phrase, and that Kirsty would yet again not be joining them. But that kiss though... He kept touching his still-tingling lips, the memory of sharing a kiss with the considered and supposed nemesis of Hell forever meant to haunt him, and glanced briefly over at Kirsty, then at those ghastly pink paper chains. His broad shoulders then dropped slightly as he shuffled forward into eternity with nothing to show for his troubles except for a very surreal - if pleasurable - memory. As the walls of her apartment joined back together, Kirsty clamped her gaping jaw shut and, trying to control her erratic breathing, headed toward the door, toward the sound of the door bell. Opening her door finally revealed the presence of a lady not much older than her; her light brown hair curly with an odd streak of grey through it, a pair of deep blue eyes that gleamed brightly toward her in merriment and genuine friendship...despite the obvious bags, and bruising dark rings beneath such beautiful eyes, which told Kirsty sleep was something hardly experienced by her. Kirsty's visitor smiled, despite looking like she could pass out at any given moment. \"Hi Nancy. Happy birthday.\" Kirsty finally greeted, and gestured for her kindred spirit to enter with a friendly sweep of her arm. Nancy Thompson, infamous survivor of the notorious Dream Demon Freddy Krueger of Elm Street, smiled an even wider smile and gave her new BFF a huge gratifying hug. \"Hi Kirsty. Thanks so much for the party you've organised. It's so sweet of you.\" Kirsty merely shrugged with a slight smile, still half-dazed and somewhat distracted about her kiss with a certain pin-headed someone to properly invest herself in the party she had taken time to organise for Nancy. \"Think nothing of it.\" \"Sorry I'm a little late by the way,\" Nancy said as she shook off her coat and tossed it on to the nearby couch. \"Traffic was terrible. Plus, trying to not fall asleep on the way here was a bitch.\" When she turned around, having just finished admiring Kirsty's handiwork with the birthday decorations and the glorious food buffet she had set out, Nancy took in the distinct distraction and faraway look in her friend's eyes. \"You all right? You look a little...peaky, distracted even. Has your demon buddy been bothering you? Or Krueger even?\" \"Oh no,\" Kirsty let out a reassuring laugh and waved her hand carelessly, trying her best not to give away she was telling a blatant lie. \"I'm fine. I'm just...Would you like a drink at all?\" \"I could murder another coffee. Make it black. Trying to avoid sleep as usual.\" Nancy took a seat on Kirsty's light brown couch next to the now content and sleeping cat before noticing something else upon Kirsty's troubled face. \"What happened to your cheek?\" she said, pointing toward the slight scratch caused by one of Pinhead's wayward pins. Naturally Kirsty could not divulge this information to her bosom buddy, about sharing a wondrous if not-planned-for passionate kiss with the Cenobite Lord. Nancy may have been purposely avoiding sleep and necking coffee like it was going out of fashion in fear of this Krueger guy finally catching her out, but least she was not indulging in steamy make outs with her supernatural stalker. That was something that was never going to be the easiest topics of discussion. Nevertheless, Kirsty gave a slight chuckle and touched her small wound. \"Oh, yeah. That was my cat, Elliot. He's in a bit of a mood today.\" As Kirsty and Nancy settled down to celebrate the Elm Street survivor's birthday together, Kirsty silently pondered over the series of events featuring the strange man she had thought of variously as a demon and angel (and now lover , whispered a mischievous voice in her mind). There was a connection there between them, but she had never anticipated anything more than a grudging respect, and now that seemed to be just a step on a further plane to understanding and exploration. She was sure that he did indeed have sights to show her, but she had shown him some too and that was all it took to survive in her strange little world. Maybe it was erroneous to make a deal with the devil when all it takes is to thoroughly confuse the hell out of him with pink paper chains and a kiss. No matter. Kicking the Lament Configuration away from Nancy's view and beneath the couch before she could clap eyes on it, Kirsty turned to her friend and smiled before handing her the one item which had previously flummoxed her Cenobite companion. \"Happy Birthday Nancy. Here, have a party hat.\" The End... LOL Well, that's that then. Yep, as you may have guessed, Nancy Thompson from the ANOES movies was the mystery crossover character celebrating her birthday. And nope, she is not dead. It's a humour story, and I guess AU, and every ANOES fan loves Nancy. So why not have her be alive and well? *flips off Krueger* I always figured if this crossover happened Nancy and Kirsty would be friends. Maybe I'll do a serious fanfic one day with these final girls. :) For now, I hope you enjoyed this. As I said, it's an older story but more fleshed out than before. It's more of a parody-humour thing so if you complain about the lack of anything Hellraiser or the fact Kirsty distracted Pinhead with an absurd plan involving a forgotten birthday and passionate kiss, then you really should go back and read the description, or just not have read. :/ Again, this is a b-day present for a good friend of mine, thus aimed for her particular fanfic tastes. ;) For now, till my next fic, I bid you all farewell, and please leave some feedback.

As you may all be aware by now, I find Elliot much easier to write than his demonic counterpart, and have always felt the good Captain doesn't get enough love in the HR-verse. Anyway, this will be short-I'm struggling with insomnia and depression at the moment too, so the story may reflect that. If you would like to know more about Nadine, plase check out my stories, Hellraiser: Break The Silence , Hellraiser: Unleashed , Forbidden But Never Forgotten , and A Temper Like My Jealousy . This takes a little bit of a dark turn at the end, unexpectedly. It just wrote itself. / For Laura . / 'Down the dark decades of your pain, This will seem like a memory of heaven.' -Pinhead, Hellraiser: Hell On Earth 'We are each our own devil, And we make this world our Hell.' -Oscar Wilde Before Elliot acquired the strange little puzzle box, things were relatively normal between he and Nadine. Well, as normal as two people who loved hurting as much as pleasuring each other, could possibly exist. They were a couple, but not an exclusive one, neither of them willing, perhaps, to admit their feelings went beyond mere sexual excitement and bloodlust. Not willing to admit that maybe, they actually did love each other. But the war had scarred Elliot's soul, left him, while not quite wholly incapable of feeling, certainly incapable of expressing his feelings. Consequently, his relationship wiith Nadine was in equal measure casual and violent. Nadine herself, having lived through the horror of an abusive marriage, which had left her reconciling love with physical violence, was no better, or more whole. They were soulmates, really. Or, at least, they would be...if they had any souls left to mate. Yes, before the box, things were relatively normal. She wished things had been different, that they had met at a different time, before the Great War, when they had been happier, healthier people. Not these shells of humans, who tried to hit and cut and screw away the pain and never could. And now, all Elliot seemed able to concentrate on was this blasted puzzle box, this box, within which, he seemed to have decided, his salvation lay. Nadine knew different. She knew that whatever lay beneath its lacquered walls and intricate design, it was not salvation. ' A gateway to unknown pleasures.' the man who had sold it to Elliot at the market had told him. Nadine had, initially, found the very notion of a box containing 'unknown pleasures' highly amusing. Until she laid eyes on the thing, and knew in the very core of her being, that if Elliot were somehow to solve the puzzle and open the box, something terrible would happen to him. And she didn't want to let that happen, even though she knew her newfound circumstances would ultimately change nothing of her and Elliot's situation, would not soften his heart, because poor damaged, soulless, Captain Spencer, would care nothing for the life he had placed within her. She, who was as damaged and callous as he was. And yet loved. Loved this broken man with every fibre of her being. And now, she was pregnant. And the worst thing was, she knew that wouldn't be enough to convince him to stay. The moment that box was placed in Elliot's hands, it became his obsession. He was fixated on it, determined to discover its pleasures. Or die trying. / In the days following Elliot's disappearance, Nadine was beset with the strangest dreams. Dreams that did not quite include Elliot, but she swore she heard him whispering to her in a voice that was his, and yet not his, darker and more sinister.. ' We have such sights to show you !' She dreamed of long, dark hallways, cold, dank walls, the screams of people in agony, and all the time, that voice called out to her: ' We have such sights to show you !' She saw blood and broken flesh and faces contorted in the most unimaginable pain. And on the final night, the night before Nadine's transformation into a vampire and the loss of her child, and her humanity, she dreamt of one person. He was torn to shreds, his bloodied, dismembered face peering out at her pitifully. His limbs lay in pieces beneath him like some sort of perverted jigsaw puzzle, his mouth moving, but no sound emitted from it. He was clearly in the throes of anguish. And she laughed, even as she slept, laughed and laughed, at the sight of the monster who had, in turn, made her a monster, reduced to nothing more than scraps of bloody meat. The late Captain James Winters. Her husband. A movement, as a hand came down to offer yet more torture , and she caught one last glimpse, of another face, familiar, but not, a face studded with pins. Elliot ? ' Oh, he suffers beautifully .' Then darkness, and the clink of chains. Fin. / Wow. Ok, that last bit came out of nowhere. I really didn't intend to write that, but Nadine's husband was an abusive ass who got what he deserved...who's to say that he didn't open a Lament Configuration too, right? I would say that maybe Elliot pulled a few strings (or spinal cords) down there, but this was only a few days after his journey to Hell and transformation into a Cenobite, so he probably didn't have that much authority yet. Either way, I hope you enjoyed-keep in mind that I wrote this on 3 hours sleep and while I did a spellcheck and grammar check, there may still be some mistakes, so apologies in advance.

A rather belated one, any way. Yes, there will be a trilogy. Here we have the third and final story in the Silent Night saga. I'm sure you remember the first and second stories. If not, I suggest you read them first before this. Originally, I wasn't intending on writing a third story, but then an idea came to me - two ideas in fact, and I just knew I had to do it. As it's written, the two ideas are merged into one whole story, and you'll see why when you read it. The first part is quite dark and admittedly depressing, whereas the second is...well, slightly more happier. As always, this was a collaborated effort between myself and my boyfriend, Rurrlock-God of Power , who wrote the first draft. Again, I fleshed out and edited. So, we both hope you enjoy this, and have a lovely Christmas. - Laura & Rurrlock Silent Night 3 Life is fragile as it is complex. It moves in a linear pattern, and yet, all it takes are a few small cracks on the road to change the journey and lead to different adventures and destinations. Some for better, others for worse. We can never tell where we will end up, only how we came to make our final decisions by looking back from where we came. On one fateful night, a religious and joyous night, two very different stories can be told and experienced. Two of the same souls with very different circumstances... It must have been the coldest Christmas Eve that Kirsty had ever seen. Weather forecasters had already foretold warnings throughout the day to people not to venture outdoors, and to be prepared for the likelihood of being snowed in. Not that it mattered to Kirsty. She had nowhere in particular to go, and no family or friends to visit for the holidays any way. Time and time again she had been hurt, whether by humanity itself and the humans she kept company with, or the losing battle with the demons of her past. Her inner voice would continuously taunt her, proclaiming every wrongdoing and failure in life as her own fault. She would continue with leading a normal life, going to work, doing grocery shopping, and even trying her hand at dating...but of course there was no escaping the dark memories from years past. The images of her twisted family in her uncle Frank and Julia, and the thought of her father's life being taken away far too soon bombarded her mind. She felt powerless against the nightmares that would plague both her sleeping and waking worlds. There was no one she could turn to. Either everyone close to her was dead or those she had lost contact with. She hadn't seen Tiffany in years, and she preferred it that way, not wanting to drag the innocent young woman into her web of misery. Most people who did get close often did, and many kept their distance. Her soul had long been tainted since that day. She was strong, at least, that was what she told herself. Anyone that dared to double-cross her would feel her wrath. But it did nothing to ease her loneliness. Solitude had its moments, and she would rather quietly sit by the windowsill and watch the weather change than partake in the banality and shallowness of humanity any day of the week. Though, there would come a point when she would crave particular company. She did have someone, even if she did try to deny it. The Dark Prince had approached her the previous two Christmases, so she knew for certain he would appear once again if she willed it. Her cheeks burned at the memory of the year last; of such a harmless kiss beneath the mistletoe which grew into a full blown night of fervid love-making. She closed her eyes and sighed, remembering the intense intimacy between them, of how such a cold touch set her whole body alight with need and desire, of how skilled his hands and lips seemed when they explored every length and breadth of her aching body. The sex had ventured well into the early hours, and she hadn't wanted it to end. But now her racing heart seemed to ease when remembering his promise to her that passionate night; \"Believe my words when I say that I won't leave you out in the cold...\" \"I have always been truthful with you, have I not?\" What should have been empty words had filled her with a sense of euphoria, made her feel significant. He seemed to be the only person in her life who had stayed true to promises. A being not of this world showed her more humanity and love than any of her own species ever had. It was ironic to her; when they first met, he had promised pain awaited her by his own hand. But as the years passed by, and with every betrayal and pain by a fellow human being, he had always been the one who would save her from the hands of those who would cause her harm. She found she could depend on him, no matter what. It wasn't just about the tension between them, when locking eyes with one another, or stealing passionate kisses, or even engaging in hours of intense love-making. He listened to her. Desired her. Made her feel like a royalty, a rare and beautiful Rose amongst twisted thorns. If only she could think that way of herself more often. Whenever she was with him, she did. But going into the cold, cruel world outside reminded her of everything that was wrong with her own mortality. Being reminded of this the year last, she shifted her gaze upwards toward the ceiling and smiled to see the mistletoe she had placed there a day before, reminding her of the two Christmases last. She stared at the decoration intensely, whilst remembering the feel of the box in her trembling and eager hands; how it thrummed with anticipation, of how her fingers would skate across the lacquered faces and grooves. Disenchanted with her own world, she was tempted to peer past the door into the other world, the one that Xipe Totec calls home. He had made it no secret that he desired for it to be her home too. For years, she had been reluctant to the idea, unsure of venturing into something so taboo and otherworldly. It looked and sounded so dangerous to her limited human mind during her first visit years before. Deep down, she was aware one day she would overcome that fear, and Xipe knew that too, knowing that one day she would come of her own free will and accept her calling. Slowly, the idea of giving herself fully to him...it didn't sound so unappealing. Could it be...? Was it finally time? Suddenly, she felt scared and uncertain of what to do. No, if she was going to go through with this, it had to be with complete conviction. It had to be this night, this festive night on which they had once consummated their bond. She glanced around the den quickly and then found the Lament Configuration, the gateway into that other world, sitting upon her bookshelf, almost as in waiting. Others would refer to it as a doorway to Hell, but for Kirsty, it would be the doorway to paradise. Once she unlocked the schism, she knew that there would be no turning back. He would know that she was calling him to finally give herself and let him lead the way into his world. It was now or never. With a heavy sigh, her trembling hands took the box, and her fingers danced over the imperceptible etchings. In seconds, the enchanting if mournful melody of distant bells chimed, echoing in her ears. Her fingers skillfully completed the configuration, and the box shifted and twisted its segments, taking on a new formation. Soon after, she felt a presence behind her, a presence she knew all too well. It brought with it that familiar and welcome scent of leather and vanilla, one she had grown to love. It was his stench, and an intoxicating stench it was. She exhaled shakily and felt chills swarm her body when she observed an icy if tender hand stroke her brown locks of hair. \"I have been waiting for your call,\" His low, resonant voice caused the pace of her heart to quicken, even more so when he spread tender kisses along her exposed and inviting neck, the ends of his pins dragging along the tender flesh. She moaned and tilted her head backward, leaning into the leather-bound cradle of his arms. He responded by bringing her in closer, his chest touching her back. \"Do you know what time of year it is?\" she inquired of him, her tone husky, and melting into his kisses. \"I do, my Kirsty,\" he breathed, drawing away from her neck to cease his kisses, but remaining close enough so that she could feel his chilled breath on her skin. Goosebumps rose along her arms, and she reached behind to behold his muscular arms, to feel him. She had missed his touch. Without even needing to look at him, she could feel his lips curve into a smile. \"You appear to enjoy making this a tradition for us.\" \"It wasn't my intention, but it is what it is.\" Her head tilted questioningly. \"You don't mind?\" Xipe gazed at her with something akin to pride and amusement. \"Oh Kirsty, the time spent with you brings me nothing but joy and pleasure. It is exquisite to be near you; not just in thought, however vivid they may be, your thoughts and dreams of me pale in comparison when actually being within touching distance of your flesh.\" His usually depth-less black eyes were now brimming with emotion as he took her in. \"I can stare into your fiery spirit through those beautiful eyes of yours.\" Kirsty's smile was beaming as she slowly turned to face him. \"The compliments are rolling off your tongue tonight, aren't they?\" Xipe opened his mouth to reply until something seemed to change in Kirsty's expression that caught him off guard. It was a momentary slip-up that she hadn't even noticed she made, but a slight falter in her smile was all that it took for him to see that something was troubling her on this holy night. His gaze shifted away from her for a second to find that her room hadn't been festively decorated in the way he would usually find it in on Christ's Day. The only thing that he could find was a mistletoe hanging above, a lonely ornament in an empty room. He glanced down at her. \"What is troubling you?\" Kirsty hesitated, not wanting to be caught out in such a way. She shrugged her shoulders and refused to make eye contact with him. \"Nothing, I just...wanted to see you.\" He wasn't convinced by her words or tone. \"There is more to it than that. Do not take me for a fool.\" \"I'm not,\" she insisted. \"There's...it's...I'm just trying to find the right words to use.\" \"You are an intelligent woman, so you finding it difficult to express yourself is uncharacteristic. Stuttering is unbecoming of you.\" \"I know, I know,\" she mumbled, frustrated with herself more than anything. She thought that this would be easy, that she could just explain to him of her desire to join him and accompany him to Hell indefinitely, but it was like there was a part of her mind still trying to grasp the reality of the situation. She had thought she'd come to a definite decision, but clearly she was still clinging to that last shred of defiance and humanity. \"I'm... lost .\" The Cenobite kept his gaze on her and listened intently as she continued. \"I feel so weary of life, of this world. I feel I don't belong, and I want to find a purpose But I don't know how. I thought I did...I do, I mean...\" She paused, collecting herself to try and make it clear. \"You can't be summoned without my call?\" He nodded slowly. \"Your soul beckons me.\" \"You used to say it cried out for you. Well, it does cry out for you. Tonight, I wanted you to come to me, and then...I wanted for you to take me along with you.\" she said, looking set into his eyes, and waiting for his response. Time seemed to slow to a crawl for the Dark Prince. He couldn't believe the words that passed Kirsty's luscious lips. He knew she was being worn down, and was aware the day would come when she would finally accept her place at his side, but hearing it made it seem so unreal. Yet here he was, standing before Kirsty Cotton who now freely admitted her destiny, marvelling at seeing the fire in her eyes return, and for the burden of her mundane normal life lifting from her shoulders. Still, even though expecting this inevitability, sincere confusion swept his senses. Kirsty could see the shock mapping his usually inscrutable features, and it puzzled her. \"Isn't this what you wanted?\" He smiled broadly, and it reached his eyes. \"I have longed to hear you say that. But there can be no doubt that this is what you want. You must submit yourself fully. Otherwise, I would be taking you against your will. It would taint the moment like black ink. If you truly do wish to become one with us, with me, then your heart must want nothing else other than this desire.\" The intensity around them seemed to increase to drastic levels. Kirsty's heart was beating frantically, and her skin began to feel warm to the point she could feel sweat sheen back of her neck. Even for Xipe, she felt him begin to tremble. He was so close to getting what he desired most in her, but he wouldn't act unless Kirsty was certain. He was willing to wait for her. Once again, this man, what many would consider a monster, made Kirsty feel like she could have anything in the world, respected her. He had this way of making her feel more. He didn't force her, knowing that it was worth the wait if it was played on her own terms. He laid out the rules and didn't force Kirsty to submit and follow them. Feeling her confidence swell, she took one last look out of her apartment window and stared toward the snow glistening the exterior windowsill, and she absorbed the sight. She knew it was time. She turned back and gazed into his eyes. \"I'm ready.\" she said determinedly, her fingers entwining with his. \"I want this.\" A pause. \"I want you .\" Xipe's smile grew and he cupped her cheek with his free hand, the leather enshrouding his thumbs grazing across the sweet flesh. She reached up and covered his hand with hers, stroking his knuckles tenderly. \"A wonderful night you have chosen to begin your new life.\" he remarked, assurance lacing his tone. Kirsty couldn't help but smile lightly. \"Well, you know what they say; wishes come true on Christmas.\" Now, her fate was in his hands. She had made up her mind and was now ready to follow him into Hell, literally. But she was bewildered when she felt him guide her toward the other end of the den, away from the Lament Configuration. She gazed up at him questioningly, but said nothing, trusting him to do as he pleased. Eventually, he stopped and tilted his head upward, gesturing for Kirsty to follow suit. She looked up to see that they were standing under the mistletoe. The mistletoe that helped to pave way for her final act. \"Before you come with me,\" he spoke softly, his rich baritone voice making her shiver with longing. \"I want for this to be our final act in this world. Kirsty, please indulge me in one last kiss under the mistletoe.\" Understanding him completely, Kirsty didn't need to verbally reply. Instead, she opted to move in closer and close her eyes. Pinhead leaned downwards and their lips touched in a sweet, tender kiss. His fingers delved into her hair and he dragged her in closer, whilst her arms wrapped around his shoulders, wanting desperately to hold on to him. Their kiss seemed to last for eternity. They didn't want to part ways. He couldn't wait to have her accompany him, yet he didn't wish to spoil this moment of short bliss with his haste. After all, they now had an eternity. All that mattered to them was this final kiss under the mistletoe on a cold Christmas night, and then finally venturing into the Labyrinth to begin anew... This is how a life could have been forever changed in one way. But in another life, things could play out very differently. Although, some feelings would always remain the same... The sound of light bawling was muffled and distant, stirring Kirsty from her soon forgotten dream and back into the harsh reality of the real world. The wail became clearer and familiar as she recollected her thoughts. She shifted around in her warm, comfortable bed, balling her fists to rub her heavy, sleep-coated eyes. She was reluctant to remove herself from the covers because of the biting cold that had been forecast for the night; yet that made it more urgent for her to check the tiny wailing which rung throughout her bedroom. She grabbed her dressing gown, sprung out of bed and drowsily hurried to the source of the crying, continually rubbing her eyes and yawning. She hadn't even bothered to check the time. Not that it mattered. All that mattered was tending to the helpless being crying out for her, who simply had no perception or comprehension of what time of year it was. He wasn't old enough yet. Soon, Kirsty had reached the crib set up in the corner of her bedroom and peered inside to see her three month old son crying and flailing his tiny arms about. The cry was soft, but desperate and needy. \"It's all right, Kyle. Mommy's here.\" she soothed the fussing baby. She reached in and picked him up gently, quietly hushing him in a soft tone. As tenderly as she could, she rocked him slowly in her arms, cradling him closer to her chest to keep him warm. His little head clung to her breast, his healthy pink lips smacking together persistently, giving his exhausted mother the obvious indication that he was hungry. Finding a spot next to the windowsill, beside her dimly-lit Christmas tree, she sat herself down, along with the baby, and then swathed the tiny one in the layers of her dressing gown. Holding her infant son firmly in place, she freed her breast from her loose-fitting shirt, and presented her rosy nipple to him. The baby's lips found what they sought and soon he was suckling, feeding and lapping up the milk from his mother's breast greedily. The baby's beautifully vivid blue eyes gleamed as he gazed up into his mother's calming facade, a very familiar blue. One similar to what Kirsty remembered so long ago. She found herself stroking his tiny head with a free hand, her fingertips running through the strands of the small amount of dark hair growing there. With her son now feeding contentedly, Kirsty leaned back against the frame of her bay window, smiling amused as she gazed out onto the street and watched the soft snowfall. She held her son tighter, hoping that the body heat from both of them would keep the two of them warm, but a draught was felt through the slight crevices of the window frames. She wouldn't stay for very long; she just wanted to enjoy the view for a little bit longer. Luckily for her, it didn't take long for the infant to have his fill and drift calmly back to sleep across his mother's chest, his little mouth dripping with leftover milk. She chuckled lightly; little Kyle was such a messy eater, but a very heavy sleeper. Walking back over towards Kyle's crib, she carefully placed him inside and made sure to drape his crocheted blanket over him, keeping him warm and protected from the cold. As Kirsty looked down at her adorable little boy, a sudden realisation came to her. This was the first Christmas in a long time where she wasn't alone, at least, to a certain degree. For the past two Christmases she had at least the company of a certain Cenobitic individual, and his presence was most welcome, yet she had no other of this world to call family, or even a friend. But having been blessed with a child, the void she once felt on this earth had been filled. She had a purpose, and a light to guide her out of the dark. Before she had discovered her pregnancy, Kirsty had considered abandoning her mortality and giving herself fully to Hell's embrace, to Xipe. But the Labyrinth was no place to raise a small human child. Xipe, too, knew this. So here she stayed, for now at least. Yet she knew she was secured between two worlds; her own, and Xipe's. After ensuring baby Kyle was safe and sleeping soundly in his crib, Kirsty found her gaze drawn toward the mantelpiece, where the Lament Configuration sat, taunting her as if it had a mind of its own and knew when she would need it to summon him out from his world and into her own. It wanted to open. Kirsty knew this. Sometimes, she didn't even have to completely solve the puzzle in order to open the doorway to his realm. Sometimes, the simple touch of her fingertips on the polished lacquer was enough to rouse him. Confident her son was now in a deep slumber, Kirsty wandered over to mantelpiece, her eyes firmly set on the box. It appeared to be beckoning her, and begging her to solve its riddle. She took hold of the device, and soon felt it pulse with warmth in her eager hands, as she turned it over to study its gold plated surfaces. Then her fingers went to work, gliding effortlessly across the seams. She thought back to the Christmas last, knowing that it was on this very night the previous year her baby had been conceived. The very thought helped to guide her fingers, knowing the father of her child would be at the other side of the door to Hell, waiting to greet her...and their son. It wasn't too long before the sights and sounds of Hell greeted her senses. It felt so familiar to her now. She would never have thought that she would grow accustomed to the tolling of the bells or the eerie blue light of Leviathan. As eager as she was for this moment, she was almost afraid that the commotion of another reality spilling into hers would wake the baby from his slumber, but thankfully, the sounds announcing his father's impending arrival ceased. Silence followed, until she felt a familiar and welcome presence beside her, and cool lips brush against her earlobe. \"Kirsty.\" she heard him say lowly, his voice laced with a sensual caress that makes her knees want to buckle. She felt his ice-cold fingers slip in between hers, causing an infectious smile to slide across her lips. As his hands and lips cherished her exquisite body, a thought flashed through her mind; how her life would have turned had she not ended up with a child... their child. It was almost hard to believe that they had this beautiful little boy together, almost . She hadn't realised it was possible for a Cenobite and a human to create life, and it came as a shock to discover she was pregnant following their festive night of passion...to them both. But the moment their son, the boy Kirsty had lovingly named Kyle Elliot, had been born, both of them knew that this...this merging of their flesh, was meant to be. Xipe would visit their son whenever he could, and despite the absurdity of the situation - sharing a tiny human infant with a human being - he would take utter pride in the boy, and even love him. Having greeted his earthly lover, Xipe approached the crib with caution, and stared down at their sleeping boy. A slight smile tugged the corners of his blueish lips as he took in Kyle's perfect little features, from the line of his nose to the thick layer of hair on his little head, to even how his delicate chest rose and fell and with every breath he took. He was the Prince of Hell, a Cenobite Lord. Human indulgences and attachments should mean nothing to him. Yet here he stood, watching his infant son sleep and taking joy from the moment. Usually apathetic and indifferent, the forgotten humanity within the Hell Priest swelled in abundance, and he revelled in it. After all, this was his creation. His and Kirsty's creation. Nothing could ever take that away from them. \"Ah. It is wonderful to watch him grow,\" Xipe murmured, then added on with a sigh; \"Painful.\" Kirsty looked into his scarred face, and arched an eyebrow. \"Why painful?\" She knew the answer before he answered, but he responded anyway. \"I am a spectator from afar. This child's flesh and blood were woven together by us, and you bear most of the burden of raising him. I long to observe every minute of his life,\" Xipe reached into the crib to gently caress the baby's soft pink cheek, before adding on solemnly, \"But I cannot. I have nothing to offer him.\" \"Maybe not right now,\" Kirsty said, placing her hand across his cheek. \"But you're his father, and he will always need you. And when he is old enough to understand, he will want to know you. Don't cast yourself out into the cold thinking that it'll protect him.\" \"It's not simply about protection, Kirsty. I feel... inadequate for the duties of fatherhood. I have raised Cenobite young, but never human young. This is new and foreign to me.\" Kirsty drew him closer, planting a tender kiss on his lips. \"Don't think like that. What we've created is wonderful and ours. You have just as much to do with this as me, maybe more so, seeing as he wouldn't have been born if you hadn't come on to me last year.\" He shot her an amused glance. \"I believe it was because of your customs during the day of Christ that led us to consummate.\" \"True,\" She paused, her eyes shining as she remembered. \"Speaking of which, we're forgetting a little tradition of ours.\" Grasping his hand, Kirsty led the confused Cenobite from her bedroom and into the den, with Xipe wondering what she had in mind. Then he saw the mistletoe, hanging there, almost in wait. Once they were both beneath it, Kirsty wrapped her arms about his shoulders, staring deeply into his coal eyes before she leaned in and swept her lips over his in a very welcome and passionate kiss. Xipe returned the gesture eagerly, pulling her in closer and enjoying the feel of her body against his. The cold outside was nothing, but he always relished the warmth of Kirsty's body. The kiss gradually became more heated, to the point where she could feel his tongue delving between her moist lips, which she accepted happily. Soon, a delicate wail broke the silence, bringing their kiss to an abrupt conclusion. Kirsty's eyes sprung open only to find she was now on her own, stood beneath the lone mistletoe, with Xipe no where to be found but the box left in his wake, still configured in her hands. Kirsty sighed and placed the box down to tend to her young one, but basking in the glow of Xipe's brief yet appreciated gift. The End... Well, there you have it. A full completed trilogy. What did you think? I'm not really all that pleased with this one, if I'm honest, and I don't feel it's as good as the previous two. But I enjoyed coming up with the two concepts, and writing them together with Rurrlock. I'm sorry it took a while to finish up and post. I was actually having a hard time trying to keep the tone darker and not have it *too* sappy. But I was also took up and exhausted with the Christmas celebrations. :/ Anyway, which ending was your favourite? I enjoyed writing the two, but I feel I much preferred the first. The Kirsty being a mother one was interesting, and I was stuck between the two ideas. So I decided to do the two. I think they both work, but it is down to personal preference really. So, I hope you enjoyed this. Sorry if it's not my best work. Like I say, Christmas is exhausting for me. :( Please leave feedback, and if you'd like for me to start up a sort of 'verse for this trilogy, sort of 'in between' stories, let me know. And yes, baby Kyle is in fact named in honour of the kindly doctor from HR2. ;) Just thought I'd put that in.

Thanks for reading. - Laura Bound in Pain The days were long, and time seemed to drag by the longer he was encased and trapped within this stone pillar that had been forged from the blood, flesh and souls of the humans he'd come into contact with over the years. Xipe Totec - the former Hell Priest - knew that he had to escape, that he needed a willing and able army to bring about his plans for this realm. A whole world thronged in flesh and desire awaited him...a husk seemingly without a consciousness, without any morality or humanity, and he marvelled at the feeling. This feeling of liberation. Though, he would be liberated was he not tethered by this stone prison. To think, the very reason he had been imprisoned within this pillar of sorrow and regret was down to one woman...the very woman who had shown him pity and had weakened him, resulting in his 'death' at the hands of an interloper. Part of him resented Kirsty Cotton for doing this to him...yet a huge part of him was thankful to her, and much part of him would think of her during those long, daunting days he was alone and not being given the nourishment of blood that he so craved and needed to escape his bonds. He also craved her... She was unlike any soul he had ever come across; he conceded that there may not be another like her in his inky eyes. He wanted her... needed her, yearned for her soul in a way he had not with any other. But Kirsty was a stubborn-willed woman, and not all that simple to persuade or take. Years had passed since their chance meeting, and his obsession of her had never abated, even rooted within this troublesome stone. His thoughts often drifted to her, everything from her looks to her voice, to her intelligence. She was forever on his mind, forever taunting him. There was no desire greater to him that to finally harvest Kirsty's soul once and for all, once he was free of what bounded him. She had intrigued him at first, but over time she had left this impression over him that lingered like a small flame, with sparks dancing into nothingness. Before long, that small flame had turned into a raging inferno that was Kirsty Cotton's vibrant spirit and will. This woman, this one seemingly simple human woman, seemed to bring about an array of unwanted thoughts and emotions. At first, she was just another soul that he wished to tear apart. Her delectable flesh was aching to be explored by the tools of his trade. Over time, the dream of remoulding her flesh had faded away, as he dared not harm a single part of her body. It was like he wanted to preserve her. He felt he would taint what made her special if he carved into her like every other soul who had crossed his path before. His Cenobitic nature was being overshadowed by buried feelings toward the woman... human feelings. Feelings he thought was not part of him any more, feelings he'd dare not admit aloud, or to himself. To admit to human thinking was to appear weak, and if he appeared weak...to rival Gashes, to a human, to his God...He'd dare not think of anyone hurting his Kirsty. Lest he bring about a fury and vengeance on them that would make Hell itself quiver with fright. He couldn't place it, this sudden desire and urge to protect her and keep her safe. At first, he believed himself greedy, wanting to keep her for himself. But it was far from it. Again, the wish to preserve her and not let the damaged world taint what he viewed as a perfect creature was what drove him. The bravery she shown to forces she couldn't comprehend was admirable. Her tenacity was commendable. The resolve she had shown into helping him remember his humanity was... Was... It made him grateful, made him see her in a different light. A light that seemed to shine brighter when he imagined her smile in his thoughts, and his dreams. Yes, even in his dreams she resided. After all, they were all he had at this point. Though many times, his dreams of her were far from innocent. Not that dreams of lust and sex were anything new for the Hell Priest. But now, only the idea of Kirsty's exquisite and delicate body pleased him. To this day, he had not seen her naked, so all he could rely on was his imagination. The fantasies he dreamed of with her would make him go insane. Within his old chambers within the Labyrinth, he could visualise her coming to him. Not begging, nor pleading...well, unless it was part of the act she would be willing to play. He couldn't work out if she would be the one to dominate him, or let herself be submissive to his deepest desires; again, he left that part to imagination, an agonising prospect which drove him insane. She would come to him babe-naked, her curves rounded and whole. Utter perfection. One moment, she would imply the innocence of a virgin, and at other times, the erotic nature of a masterful seductress. He would let her unclothe him, working her way to feeling every part of his muscular, lean body that lay beneath his hellish leather vestments, slowly clawing her fingertips along the marks and scars of war and Hell along his chest. Her warm hands would melt his icy body, then he would pull her in close and ravish her wholly and thoroughly. Her back would arch as he pleasured her in every conceivable way possible. He would love nothing more than to explore every possible pleasure and desire with her, something which intrigued, aroused, and angered him simultaneously. To this day, his greatest sexual fantasy would be to see the look on her face as she reached the high of ecstasy, and all because of him. That was his sexual desire, yet he had other less erotic desires for her as well. A desire to merely to know that she was safe and well was one thought that plagued him. In his dreams, after tiring her out from their sexual exploits, he would curl his arms about her shaking, wet body and hold her close, tenderly, letting her know that no matter how rough he would become, she was still safe in his arms and in his presence. Though he had never experienced this feeling, at least not in his whole existence or time serving Hell, he soon realised why he was tormented every waking, and sleeping, moment. He was in love. He had fallen in love with the human known simply as Kirsty Cotton. Love . Such a sickening human emotion...yet he felt it. He, the epitome and manifestation of a human man's desires, impulses, and anger, felt love for a mortal woman? How in the name of the Lord Leviathan could this have happened? The once Leader of Cenobites, the manifestation of Elliot Spencer's darkness, a being known as Xipe Totec, sighed, almost mournfully within his stone prison, and reluctantly froze and rid his sculptured face of all expression when the Monroe boy returned from his dalliances. He had to cease all these thoughts of Kirsty. He had to focus on his plans. He knew Kirsty could be his undoing, and he couldn't afford to allow this beautiful creature to sway him. Not yet. Not while he had plans for this pathetic little world...this world where he would make Kirsty Cotton his Queen. The End... Yeah. Figured I'd have him realise he was in love. Hellraiser III, for me, would have been the perfect time for him to suddenly be aware of his feelings for Kirsty; romantic or not, she was special to him. Think about it; he's all alone, trapped within a stone pillar. He's had around four years to deliberate what he's to do, and about the past. And Hellbound was the time these two saw each other in a new light. I happen to believe his feelings for her were not just from his more human perspective. Even without his humanity, he would feel something for her. Well, that's my two cents on the whole thing. I believe he fell for her during Hellbound, and realised it during a moment unseen in Hell on Earth. ;) Hope you enjoyed. I certainly enjoyed writing it.

Damn the idea of her perfect spot on the shelf with the other porcelain dolls. If she shatters on this dance floor in the red light district to some indistinct pop song, then let her shatter, let her make that choice to come apart on her own terms. Kirsty can't dance, not like this, but her hands are up and she turns and if anyone notices then she couldn't care less. It's her night, for no other reason than that she wants it for herself. She's nineteen and the age of a thousand young heroines who go looking for love and find adventure. She seeks freedom from herself and her head and her worried doctor and finds it here, in some underground hole that's too dark but oh, the red and blue light from beneath frames everything so beautifully. She's danced with three guys and one girl who was too beautiful to lead on, one who now is chatting up another girl at the bar. Good, Kirsty thinks, let her get away and find love. I'm just here for the music. She closes her eyes and throws her head back and doesn't hear the disturbed shouts from the bathroom. A man on the speaker sings. Back to ones, from the top, ready or not, here it comes… This isn't his usual domain. Give him old buildings, slums, condemned monuments to man's misconceived immortality. He feels out of place in this flashing hole with young and bright-eyed dancers who are almost all too young to truly know anything. He enters to the muffled sounds of some song behind a closed bathroom door, beeps and pounds and what sounds humans use to create music. Here it comes for you and me, but that was easier said than done The Cenobite Prince doesn't dance, but something calls him past the door beyond the two souls swept away - lover boys with too-large eyes who didn't know what they were doing or how their love would soon be re-forged - and into the dingy altar dedicated to the goddesses of inhibitions lost. In the light of day things can change from slim to none He lets the portal close behind him and glides through, unnoticed by the dancers in their black and silver regalia. He is as they are in their liquor-trances, another soul seeking respite. He finds it in her dancing as if the world could not contain her in its core. I succumb But loving you's a loaded gun Kirsty doesn't open her eyes immediately but feels the weight in front of her, a cool shadow parting the hot air. She moves with the buzzy beeping notes and the singer's bubbling voice and her shadow follows her direction. I, I, I don't wanna be this No, nobody needs to see this Another spin and a large hand catches hers over his, cold. I, I, try to resist He pulls her close and she winds right into his chest, But the light's getting low Kirsty opens her eyes and looks up at last, To a glow, She realizes. Till you're touching my lips. The music falls and for a second her pulse goes with it. He's a shadow like the rest, blue and red tinting his pins and flooding the lines of his grid-ridden face. The prince looks at her with an intensity that makes her reconsider risk-taking, because she really might just shatter. The music returns, and the singer's voice is hushed for them. Wanna go but I wouldn't His hand closes around hers Wanna stay but I shouldn't And now hers is too Wanna say no but I couldn't And the fire that seized her earlier and brought her here takes hold again, tonight is hers, and if he wants to be part of it then it will be on her terms. She steps back and he lets her, and Kirsty starts to dance. So meet me in the dark Kiss me in the shadows of every spark He can't let go of her hand. Something irrational in him says if he lets go he'll never catch her again, so he lets her dance around him, turning and facing wherever she went like the ocean grasping the pull of the Moon. His cassock dusts the ground and catches shreds of light, and he looks like liquid. She spins close again and their eyes lock and she's away again in an instant. I know we shouldn't start But baby I'm a slave to the rhythm Slave to the rhythm of your heart! The last line echoes as they move, or she moves, because he hasn't changed places besides turning. He's actually listening to the words now, or how they move, trying and failing to line them up with Kirsty. Slave to the rhythm, slave to the rhythm of your- Meant to be Maybe just a dangerous fantasy He doesn't care about human music but for a split second what's left of Elliot Spencer grabs onto the words, recognizes himself in them. This isn't the music he knows, but he still, in his core, knows music. He knows this. But before the fall you were always real to me He can't know that Kirsty is listening too, finding him in the words, finding the man in the black and white picture, now changed beyond recognition but not wholly gone, not really. And after me comes to you so easily So easy But loving you just sticks to me I, I, I don't want to be this, No, nobody needs to see this They both remember the first moment, and they don't need to look at each other to know what to do. He pulls just enough I, I try to resist She steps in But the light's getting low to a glow They're facing each other and Kirsty feels his icy breath on her cheek Till you're touching my lips It takes the Prince a moment to find her voice lacing with the music, but when he does it's his turn for the world to stop. She's barely whispering, and he holds onto her words. \"Wanna go but I wouldn't,\" she murmured, \"wanna stay but I shouldn't, wanna stay but I shouldn't…\" \"Kirsty…\" So meet me in the dark! She pulls away again and now he does step with her. Any other dancers have faded from his mind because the only thing that matters is he'd, those words she chose for him. Go with me, he says, stay, say yes. But they're lost in the dark. Kiss me in the shadows of every spark! I know we shouldn't start, baby But baby I'm a slave to the rhythm, Slave to the rhythm of your heart! As the repetition picks up again Kirsty lets go of his hand, but does not lose orbit around him. They step in circles around each other, his cassock following her skirt, leather chasing Cotton. Slave to the rhythm, I know Oh, but you don't leave me so…! She can hear the music picking up, urging her on, and she finally steps back into his grasp. He catches her. He's so close. Meet me in the dark! He leans down just enough for her to reach him and Kiss me in the shadows of every spark! And they do look like sparks on his face, those pins scraping her cheeks I know we shouldn't start, baby She pulls away and for a second he looks at her as if she is everything, and then something catches his attention But baby I'm a slave to the rhythm And he's walking away, back to the bathroom Slave to the rhythm She follows him Of your heart! He's gone. Kirsty steps out of the club a half-hour later. The air is stale and cold. She hugs her jacket a little tighter around her as she tries to figure out if that actually happened. It's too dark to walk, so she grabs her phone and starts texting friends, looking for one to get her home. The phone screen lights her face red and blue.

Well it's been a while since I've posted a new story, and it's exciting to finally post this effort and share it with you all. Seeing as he is hardly given the attention he surely deserves, and I love him a lot, I decided to focus all my efforts in finishing this story I've been writing for a good while based around Pinhead's alter ego Elliot Spencer. It's set during the first year of World War 1, and I'm basing it around the first battle of Flanders, which took place between October and November of 1914, the year when war broke out. I hope all is accurate. I did do some research. I'm not entirely sure when Elliot was promoted to Captain so I just put in that he rose up a rank from Lieutenant after the first few months of the war. Like I said, I hope I am historically accurate. If not, please let me know. I hope you enjoy. As I state above, it's the first story I've uploaded in ages. I've had this on my computer half-written for a good while now, and some parts have been recycled from an older story. I did intend to make this a flashback for Pinhead during the Hellbound 'You were human' scene, but it was dragging on too much, and besides I am already writing another Hellbound-based story and don't want to clash too much. :) Please enjoy, and don't forget the feedback.

But war changes a man, and the longer this war had raged on... for each day, and for each month, he felt a little piece of his humanity being chipped away at, leaving a small semblance of the sympathetic and kind man he had been a lifetime before this campaign had begun. He was truly fatigued by the living Hell which surrounded him day after day. The suffering was never-ending, the death toll high and ever needless, and there was no mercy...even for those who had hardly started living. Captain Elliot Spencer stared down at the wounded young man who lain before him in the muddied quagmire. The Private was struggling for breath and groaning in agony from the multiple enemy bullets embedded in his chest. \"What's your name, son?\" The gunner looked up at his superior officer and gave him a wan smile. As he spluttered his answer, a rivulet of blood crept out of his mouth and trickled along his sweat slicken jaw. \"S-Spencer...\" the lad wheezed, trying desperately to keep his pained gaze locked with the Captain's empathetic blue eyes. \"W-Wilfred Spencer, s-sir.\" Elliot felt a pang of guilt about forgetting the young Private's name, but it was always difficult to identify a face whose features were so contorted with pain. Recognition never got any easier, despite the vast number of anguished features he had encountered during the campaign. His heart sank when he noticed that the lad had no stubble on his face. Elliot's lips thinned at the sight; it was clearly obvious that he hadn't even started shaving yet. 'Another boy who had never disclosed his real age to join the campaign, hoping for adventure.' Spencer thought sadly. There had been many child soldiers, oblivious to the true horrors of war, and many of them had ultimately perished. It was such a waste. Elliot gave the wounded soldier a warm smile and kept his hand firmly on the boy's chest. He was certain that the compress would be ineffectual but company for the wounded was the tiniest of luxuries that could be afforded those not killed outright by sniper bullets and shell fire. It was the presence of a friendly face that distracted the dying from the dead that lay beside them. In a small way, it also afforded them a slice of hope even if hey knew in their heart of hearts that it was a futile promise. \"You have the exact same surname as me,\" Elliot remarked, keeping the boy's gaze. \"A strange coincidence, wouldn't you say, old chap?\" Elliot smiled again and re-positioned his palms across the gushing wound. \"The stretcher bearers will be here soon, and the medics will fix you up in no time at all.\" It was a lie, and one of many he had told in the field. He idly wondered if there was any such thing as a good lie. Still, it was a small sin in comparison to what he and his comrades had done during the last few months. So many had gone, some by his hand, some by the hands of others, but there was little choice; if you didn't shoot, you would be shot. No, this wasn't murder. It was war, and maybe with enough repentance you can still keep your soul. Not long ago, he had been quickly promoted to the rank and position of Captain. It felt like a lifetime ago, for there seemed to be no end to the conflict which had begun a little before the time of his promotion, and of course...no end to the reams of dead youth whose eyes lost their sparkle as he watched on helplessly. He could barely remember the days he felt honoured to be part of the British Expeditionary Force and serve his country, of the last time he felt so proud of his promotion, and when the promise of duty was the beginning of a thrilling adventure. Those days were long gone. Elliot felt movement under his hands and clenched his jaw as the boy's body began to jolt. Wilfred's lungs were desperately trying to embrace the freezing air, but were simply too ravished by the bullets which had peppered his chest maybe an hour before. Elliot was surprised and horrified that the Private had lasted this long. Of course, he wanted the young man to live, but there was a part which prayed for merciful release from the pain he was obviously suffering, and it now looked as if his prayers were being listened to. Breaking his gaze from the boy soldier, he peered into the smoky night sky and caught sight of a shooting star, leaving no more than a ghost of a scratch in the heavens. \"Do you know that when I first arrived here, I saw a shooting star and made a wish? Did you know that, son? That you can wish upon a shooting star? Alas, they have never come true on those occasions, yet I keep wishing each time I see one.\" Elliot gave a soft sigh. \"I suppose you young lads might say it was naive, but...\" Elliot paused when he realised that the boy's blood beneath his hands had eased its pulsating barrage against the pressure of his fingers, and the jolts had ceased. He glanced down at the stilled body, looking into what once was vibrantly green eyes that were now empty and void of life, and exhaled calmly. \"They never come true. Rest in peace, son.\" Captain Elliot James William Spencer rose from the mud and left his young namesake where he lay. The wagons would be around soon to pick up the freshly deceased body, and the rest of the corpses that littered the once beautiful countryside. Elliot stayed in a crouched position for a while, wondering if he should doff his cap in respect for the newly dead before he headed back to safety. He knew that officers in the field were coveted targets for the enemy's trigger finger, and although the enemy charges on both sides produced massive casualties amongst the men, any officer leading would be effectively torn apart. Indeed, Captain Garrington had been slain the day before, giving Elliot a band of his orphaned troops to fight alongside his merry lot. The dead boy had been under Garrington's command yesterday, and under Elliot's command today. Tonight, he was in no man's land under no man's command...except maybe God's. Elliot clenched his jaw again. God. He had wanted to believe that there was a place better than this Hell on Earth, but with every dead boy, for all the slain and mutilated corpses, and every single loss of life under his command made him question the existence of any Deity. He rose to the standing position with his cap firmly on and looked upwards, peering through the gloom toward no man's land and the enemy lines beyond. He shook his head, wiping his blood and mud-smeared hands along his coat, and then retreated, making his way back to the trenches. On the journey, he stopped besides dead comrades and searched in their packs for any rations that could be distributed to his young charges back at base. The first time he had done this as a Lieutenant he had felt as though he was violating the sanctity of the dead, but as time passed the needs of the living were of priority. The dead were quickly mourned and you moved on. That's what you did, that's all you could do. Once he had taken a few items, a can of bully beef and a pack of Woodbines, he set off again, aware that to linger above ground was foolhardy. It took a few minutes before he reached the man with the barbed wire shrapnel in his face and knew that he was maybe a few hundred metres away from safety. Because the dead soldier's wounds were so severe, he had become a rather gruesome marker for Elliot. In order to get his bearings amongst the mud heaps, severed body parts and bomb craters, it became a morbid habit for Spencer to choose the corpse that was most memorably disfigured and use him as a human beacon. The poor soul captured Elliot's attention at first sight. His pitiful image was burned onto his retinas and the revulsion of the grotesquely deformed man firstly hammered into his brain. The mortar bomb had gone off next to the barbed wire, which had exploded into a million ragged pins into the solder's face. Elliot wasn't sure if he had died instantly, but he hoped that was the case. He looked back at the propped up nail-riddled face of the soldier and felt a few tears stinging his cheeks. It was the first time Spencer had cried in months, helping to moisturise his smoke-dried and tired eyes, but allowing him to feel human once again...if somewhat a wretched one. \"I'm so sorry.\" he whispered to the long-dead man and bowed his head with respect. But he couldn't linger. He wiped his cheeks with his sleeve and pushed onward toward his destination. In the distance, to the side of him, he caught sight of the medics winging their way around the bodies strewn across the scarred grounds. It took a while before Elliot managed to reach the trench on legs that felt drained of strength. He gave the barbed fence surrounding the base a wide berth as the man riddled with shrapnel and needles, and the myriad of horrific images bombarded his mind, combining to make Elliot feel sick to his stomach. As he descended the ladder into the muddy labyrinth, a soldier scurried up to him, straightened his posture, and saluted. It was one of his orphaned soldiers. Another young lad, possibly no older than poor Wilfred whose body was now being bundled along with the other corpses and laid to eternal rest in the unmarked grounds of this hellish land. \"At ease, Seagrove.\" Elliot spoke authoritatively, but with softness evident in his tone. The lad relaxed his shoulders, but held his respectful bearing before his superior. \"You alright, sir? You look peaky. You're not injured are you?\" Seagrove inquired. Captain Elliot Spencer gave a tired but genuinely warm smile. \"No, I'm fine, thank you Benjamin. I just...I simply need to rest. Close my eyes for a little while.\" Elliot hoped the young man would take the hint and leave him in peace. \"Yessir.\" The concerned boy nodded and made his way down the mud passageway, alert to the tremulous tone in his superior's voice and recognising a fellow soldier's need for solitude. Elliot uncurled his shaking hands from the wooden rungs of the ladder and crept down the trench a little way. He then realised that his dug out was near the other end and knew he could never make it with legs that were about to collapse from under him. Weary and shaken, he found an unoccupied funk hole and leaned heavily into the circular hole cut into the wall. As fatigued as he was, there would be no sleep for the Captain. Not for the first time, Elliot felt that perhaps he was falling into insanity. He glanced upwards, out from the trench and into the sky, only to catch another shooting star zipping through the atmosphere and as before...he made a wish. He didn't want to be here anymore. He didn't want to remain alive, not when so many were gone. Most of all, he wished for an end to all the needless suffering. His thoughts returned to the man with the barbed pins in his head and an unwelcome feeling suddenly grabbed at his heart like a black clawed hand. He didn't feel pity for the man now; he only felt an overwhelming sense of envy. The End ","Summary":" Author Introduction : Hello my friends.

I thought I'd kick off 2019 by posting this brand new tale, and it's rather different to what I usually write concerning the Pinsty pairing, and in particular...Kirsty's submission to Hell. Well, I like to explore other terrains of their relationship. I'm not only limited to loving and humanistic aspects of this pairing. I just prefer to write them that way. ;) It's another post-Hellseeker, of course. I've been writing this one for a while, and from bits and pieces of older works, and it was challenging to piece it all together. But here it is, all finished. I'm hoping to also post more fics, drabbles and one shots I've been working on over the Christmas holidays, but we'll see. As stated on my profile, my writing is taking a backseat whilst I focus on my personal life. But for now, enjoy this brief one shot. Feedback is very welcome. :D - Laura And to Think, I Hesitated Kirsty Cotton sat alone within her apartment, dimly-lit by many sweet-scented candles. The seductive and alluring Lament Configuration rested quite comfortably across her eager palms as she stared to it, taking in its artistic and intricately lacquered features. It had been several years following on from her husband's death. Other than the hefty sum of her inheritance bequeathed by her long-passed father and uncle, of which sat untouched in her account, Kirsty realised the world which surrounded her was a woeful and despondent one. She had been deadly serious when she had told him she was done running, but not till now had she realised the significance of her own words. Those very words were what guided her now exploring fingers. They glided effortlessly and professionally along the grooves of the golden puzzle-box in her grasp, finishing off by fondling the circular panel. Her efforts were rewarded with an audible click Utter darkness engulfed the room which she occupied, the flickering flame of her candles having been extinguished. A blue hue proceeded the blackness, and she knew there was no turning back. The sound of dry leather, like a snake slithering along concrete, greeted her ears from behind. With a deep breath, and bracing herself, she ever-so slowly turned and he was there, fitted in sensual black. He was the same as he had always been; a hairless head framed by a distinguishing halo of gleaming silver pins, oh so simple and neatly arranged, but so...brutally erotic; ever perpetual pale hue skin, marred by strips of neatly cut exposed flesh of his chest interwoven with the leather of his uniform. Tools swung at his hips from a belt laced through his navel, old but razor-sharp and wet with blood and meat. But as always, her eyes came to rest on his own deep, onyx pits. They were essentially inscrutable, yet so much wisdom and intelligence swam the depths of those dark orbs in his pierced skull...and they took her in, sweeping the length of her body with a hunger not usually present. They expressed an urgency and eagerness for more of a sadistic pleasure. Yet you can see the torment in his eyes. The hint of sadness sprinkled ever so slightly across them. She wondered what he saw when he looked upon her, no longer so young, but just as frail and mortal as always. He had been in her life for so long she barely remembered the time before she had come into contact with the box and its horrid wonders. Her family was gone, the few people she had invited into her life came and went, or were gotten rid of, but she could always count on him being there. Watching. Waiting. She felt a curious mix of fear, familiarity, and arousal looking at him. He was here for her again, and this time she had no plan of survival. Those mesmerising onyx eyes locked with hers, and without preamble her hand rose to give a delicate command. \"Wait.\" She didn't scream it as she had the previous encounters. She spoke in confidence, more of a request than a plea. He thought at first, wondering what she would do if he would not heed her. There was no reason to. Despite himself, he paused, but did not give her the chance to continue before interrupting. \"And how many souls is yours worth this time, Kirsty?\" he chided. \"Ten? Twenty? One hundred? Have you so many enemies to offer us? Or perhaps you are merely lonely and seek us out of amusement.\" The emphasis on the word 'lonely' was cruel, but hugely significant, and she couldn't help but wince. Maybe because it was too close to the truth. He stared with more than a passing interest, and Kirsty shifted uncomfortably, yet refused to back down. This level of defiance was new for her; either she had become much more brave, or perhaps foolish. Or maybe she no longer cared. Whatever the cause, he was delighted by the progression. He had watched her whenever the moment allowed. He thought of it as keeping tabs on a promising investment. Whatever the other Cenobites had thought they wisely kept to themselves. He would never tell her how much he had enjoyed, more than usual, tormenting her late but not-so-lamented husband. Such an ungrateful man. He had no idea the prize he had, yet he had overlooked her for the cheap pleasures of lesser females. Perhaps Kirsty had underestimated her own worth, or maybe she knew no decent man could satisfy her and had chosen a doomed relationship. Trevor Gooden still screamed in some dark corner of the Labyrinth, his cries of woes enmeshing with the many more foolish to tempt the LeMerchand's box. Perhaps, the Priest allowed himself to muse, he would give him to her when she was ready. \"Don't you have enough souls to play with already?\" \"That was your offer. Not mine.\" \"That doesn't mean I wanted to.\" \"Of course, and what is it this time? Ignorant of the box's true nature the first time, didn't open it the second...didn't want me here the third...\" He started to walk, a purposeful half circle around her. Kirsty turned as he moved, feeling like a cornered prey. \"I think you did want me here. Clever, cunning little Kirsty. With Trevor's true nature revealed, what other choice did you have? You could always depend on us to take care of your less than admirable family members.\" She wasn't sure how much of that last sentence was mockery. \"I was doing what I could, just like I always did. What difference does it make if I got a bonus out of it?\" The Prince chuckled darkly as if pleased by her callous disregard for the souls she had damned. \"I told you once before; nothing I have given to you came without a price.\" Part of her knew this. She just didn't want to admit it. \"This life you fight so hard to keep...is is even worth it anymore? You don't belong with them. That world is empty for you.\" \"Why me?\" \"Your soul longs to discover such untold agonies. It called out to us, and we answered, as dutifully as with all the others. You were ...are ...no different to them. \" \"But why?\" she repeated, her lip trembling, and a misty sheen in her eyes. \"Curiosity, desire . You wanted to know. We would have shown you. We...\" He stopped, and corrected himself. \"... I still long to show you the way.\" She risked taking her attention from him to scan the darkness for the others. She remembered the last time he had come to her. There had been some new creatures lurking in the shadows during their last encounter, but the Cenobite with the chattering teeth - the one who had also been slain years earlier - had also been present. Now, it was just she and her otherworldly Prince. No others. Kirsty turned back, her gaze now once again locked with his. She smiled wanly. \"I see, I...guess. I can't have really been so innocent...especially now. Not after Frank, or Trevor. You were right about that; my family always made it so easy.\" She looked to the floor for a fleeting moment, then bravely met his potent and lingering stare with a defiant, and rather flirtatious, look. \"You always did like talking to me.\" She raised an arm, fanning their empty surroundings. \"Where are the others?\" She was smirking now, and inched ever so slightly forward to the Prince, almost standing toe to toe with him. \"Or did you want me all to yourself this time?\" Those usually emotionless eyes of purest black were now alight with mirth. \"How presumptuous, Kirsty.\" \"Then prove me wrong.\" The Hell Priest made no noticeable move to call for the others of his Order. He simply stood there, studying her. She had hoped for a reaction, but she received nothing but silence. He continued staring, and she stared back. The silence was stifling. Finally, he broke that silence. \"It's time for you to join us.\" Her eyes still lingered on his - surprisingly soft and pitiful - gaze as she attempted to seem fierce and belligerent, yet failing. She opened her mouth as the all-too-habitual, and rather sudden, fear swept over her, and readied herself for her usual protests and bartering. He humoured her, the corners of his pale and soft lips twitching upwards. \"What would you offer us this time?\" he posed his earlier question to her. Her gaze never left his as she processed their conversation, and mulled over the last seventeen years of her miserable life. She felt she didn't belong in a world of her own kind anymore. She knew he was right; he had been right all along. She did belong with him, and she certainly wanted him. More than anything. She wanted him to take her, and she wished to taste the pleasures that he had promised her so long ago, the pleasures he had experienced himself, and to exist amongst his kind. She had thought about it all ceaselessly since that fateful day she had bargained her husband's soul to save hers. Forcing her chin upwards, and her brown eyes still looking determinedly into those eyes of polished obsidian, she said, \"I have nothing. Only myself.\" With one final step forward, and observing his look of satisfaction, Kirsty's hand reached for his, his palm starkly cold in her warm grasp, just as she heard the usual clink of chains in the shadows. And she couldn't wait for the inevitable. To think , she thought, I was hesitant. The End... ","Summary":" Author Notes - Hello, all, and a Happy New Year.

Chatterer gnashed his teeth together. \"The Leader will be here soon.\" Butterball reassured his friend. However, he himself was wondering where the Leader was. He should be here by now. Suddenly, there he was. The Almighty Cenobite Leader had entered the room. \"Deepthroat my love.\" He said. \"Is she ready yet?\" \"Yes.\" Deepthroat turned around and beckoned her dark master/lover to come closer Pinhead approached without fear and laid eyes on his child. The baby girl resembled in most aspects a human, save for the grid mark on her face and her blue skin. She looked up at her father without a hint of fear, giggling at the Lead Cenobite. Pinhead smiled. \"A first for hell. he said. \"A natural born cenobite.\" \"What will you call her?\" Butterball asked. \"We have decided on Lilith.\" Pinhead said as he picked up his newborn daughter. The infant cenobite continued to giggle. Pinhead felt happy. Excited even. He knew that being naturally born of the Labyrinth, the child could one day rival that of Leviathan. And with him and his entourage to raise her, Pinhead knew that his child would grow into a queen that Hell deserved. A smaller cenobite by the name of Little Sister came into the room. \"It's time.\" She whispered. Pinhead returned the child to her mother's arm for a moment and beckoned his entourage to follow him. The four cenobites plus their precious cargo walked to a podium directly underneath Leviathan, surrounded by cenobites at every corner. \"My people.\" Pinhead began. \"I am proud to present the first natural born cenobite, Lilith.\" Pinhead held up his daughter for all to see. The cenobites cheered at Hell's newest milestone. Pinhead looked into his child's eyes. \"We have such sights to show you!\" (Hey everybody! Hope you enjoyed my fanfic. Still trying to get into it and hopefully by October I'll be submitting something every week. Sorry if this first chapter was weak, I promise the story will get better. Chibi out!)[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: Father and Daughter The chains dripped with blood. The latest victim of Hell now hung from these chains in pieces. Pinhead, leader on the cenobites, smiled at his work. Standing next to him was his daughter, Lilith. She had grown in a fairly powerful cenobite. Like her father, Lilith had pins skewered into her skull. They were hammered so as to cross each other and form an \"X\" on both her face and the back of her head. As with most female cenobites, she scantly clad in leather. Two hooks tore a hole in her abdomen where her belly button once was. \"Come daughter.\" Pinhead said. \"It's time to return to our kingdom.\" \"Yes father.\" Lilith. Both cenobites walked back into the portal, leaving the box behind to claim another victim. The all-too familiar sight of Leviathan reminded Pinhead and Lilith that they were. Chatterer was there to greet them. He gnashed his teeth. \"Another successful reaping.\" Pinhead said. Lilith is surpassing all of my exceptions.\" Pinhead patted his daughter on the back. Lilith turned to him and smiled for a few seconds before returning to her forlorn expression. Pinhead became confused. Lilith always seemed to be forlorn when they harvested souls. \"Chatterer. I'd like a moment alone with Lilith.\" Chatterer gnashed his teeth in agreement and left. Pinhead then turned to his daughter and asked \"What seems to be the problem?\" \"It is nothing father.\" Lilith said. \"But I must ask you a question.\" \"Very well.\" Pinhead agreed. \"How long have you and the others...been...here.\" Pinhead was shocked at the audacity of such a question. \"As long as we can remember.\" He answered. \"And in all the time you've been here, have you ever once thought about the Flesh Realm and it's pleasures?\" \"The pleasures of the Flesh Realm are mere child's play compared to our realm. They are not even worth a passing thought.\" \"Oh.\" Lilith said with disappointment in her voice. \"Have you grown tired of Hell's pleasures?\" Pinhead asked with concern. \"Of course not!\" I just thought maybe we could go to the Flesh Realm and- \"No!\" Pinhead shouted. \"The Flesh Realm is only for harvesting souls and nothing more.\" And with that, Pinhead stormed off. Lilith felt rage build up inside her butshe suppressed it like she always does. \"It's not fair.\" She thought. Lilith sat in her room or the closest thing she had to a room that is. It was her favorite spot in the Labyrinth, the place where the used flesh was dropped. The smell usually calmed her down but this time the rage was still there. \"I can't help it that I've grown tired of this realm. All I'm asking for is a chance.\" A familiar chattering sound startled Lilith and she turned to see who it was. \"Chatterer Beast!\" She cried out in delight. The cenobite/dog hybrid gnashed it's canines in delight. as Lilith petted him. \"Oh CB. What am I going to do? I want to experience the pleasures of the Flesh Realm so badly.\" CB turned it's eyeless face to Lilith and gnashed it's teeth. \"You're right! I'm going to be ruler of the Labyrinth one day so I should be able to do what I want! Lilith jumped to her feet. \"We're going to the Flesh Realm!\" ","Summary":" Lilith: Daughter of Hell Disclamer: I do not own Hellraiser Chapter 1: A First for Hell \"Pinhead s"},{"Movie":"Hellraiser","Title":"Pieces of Hell","Author":"iridescentZEN","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9928573","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Pieces of Hell A/N: These were supposed to be part of a random word drabble challenge. I asked LJ1983 to send me some random words to write some drabbles like she did in, \"Hellish Love.\" Drabbles are too short for me so I ended up with short stories. This is my collection so far. If you have a word you would like to see in the future then leave me it in a review or a PM and I'll see what I can do. No guarantees, but you never know … you could inspire me. Trigger Warning: This is all dark fic. Sexual abuse, rape, violence, adult content and other Hellraiser themed nastiness ahead. If you are easily triggered, it would be best to not to go forward. These short stories range from rated T – M as follows: Title: Talk – Rated T, Title: Promise – Rated M, Title: Wings – Rated T, Title: Laugh – Rated M, Title: Box – Rated M Title: Talk Julia Cotton walked with a sway that was as deadly as a rattlesnake's shake. The labyrinth was her home now; Leviathan was her God. Her mind had been expanded from the tunnel vision she had in life. Not everything was about Frank Cotton. Everything Frank Cotton had finished the moment she felt his knife intended for her far too clever step-daughter sliding into her gut. The truth was that she knew Frank had a deviant sexual interest in the girl and it irritated her beyond belief. It was bad enough that her boring husband lit up like a Christmas tree every time his daughter came to visit, but for the man who truly had Julia's heart to desire the little bitch was disheartening. Still, she often wondered about Kirsty's skittish behavior around her uncle. The girl craved attention like a lap dog from everyone. She wanted to be included except when it concerned her Uncle. It was possible he had taken Kirsty before. The thought of it disgusted her in more ways than one, but Julia knew Frank well enough to know the man had no boundaries. Finally meeting up with her prey, Julia circled the studded cenobite who was known as, \"Pinhead.\" She just wanted to have a little talk. He was naturally nonplussed by her presence, barely tilting his head in her direction to acknowledge that he knew she was there. There was a reason he was Leviathan's favorite. \"I heard she killed her husband,\" Julia said, her blue eyes scrutinizing the demon. \"And I thought we would never have anything in common.\" Julia was, of course, referencing Kirsty and her recent fall from grace. \"Four other people as well?\" Julia inquired. \"I'm so proud.\" Pinhead blinked, regarding the woman with some disdain. This woman was linked to Frank Cotton, a despicable soul. She had a hand in killing her husband, Larry Cotton, Kirsty's father. She was also the reason the Channard cenobite ever existed and was indirectly responsible in temporarily killing him and his gash. He had no benevolence where it concerned Julia Cotton no matter how sinfully sweet she was. \"You test my patience,\" he said simply, barely glancing in her direction. \"Is it true?\" Julia asked him in her dulcet tone of voice. \"You want Kirsty as your consort?\" The woman's name rolled off Julia's lips with audible distaste. If he did want her, then it further exacerbated Julia's puzzlement as to why anyone would find Kirsty attractive let alone Hell's reigning champion. \"Who are you to be asking these questions of me?\" he asked, his eyes alight with the promise of violence. \"Oh.\" Julia's lips pursed at his answer, then widened into a Cheshire cat smile taking his deflection to mean that he did want Kirsty. \"It is true. That explains everything.\" \"It explains nothing,\" he stated wearily. \"It explains why you let her go.\" She circled him again, in constant movement without moving much at all. \"They say you even courted her this time.\" She watched his face as though looking for a subtle tic that only she could find. \"Baited the husband, did you? Did you know he would be exceptionally cruel with his delivery? That he would give the Lament configuration as an anniversary gift? Even I'm not that cold.\" Julia continued circling him, keenly aware of the clinking chains she could hear in the distance. \"Imagine that. Her own husband essentially gave her a loaded gun and asked her to blow her brains out so that he could have her money.\" She smiled but it didn't reach her eyes. \"Nothing but the best for our girl!\" she said, enthused. Pinhead narrowed his eyes. \"All problems solved.\" \"Yes, except that all problems weren't solved, right? You still want her and she is still not here.\" \"Do not fret. She will be here soon and I will give her the gift of tearing the skin from your body inch by inch,\" he stated as though it were an unavoidable fact. \"You're such a sweet talker, but I highly doubt Daddy Leviathan would allow you to give me to our girl. He's quite fond of me, you know.\" Julia looked deep in thought. \"Perhaps when she does arrive, I'll give her to her Uncle.\" This time when Julia smiled, it did reach her eyes. \"Imagine what he would do to her after so many years of lusting and no release.\" The demon snarled and brought up a weapon from his belt, a wicked looking curved blade. He pressed it to the woman's throat, watching as a bead of blood appeared from the tip of the blade that was digging into her skin. She didn't seem bothered by the action. Why would she though? She had been completely without skin on more than one occasion. \"You know you can't kill me,\" she said, leaning into the blade's tip, allowing more of her blood to trickle from the wound. \"Killing you would be far too kind,\" he assured her. Just then his attention was diverted by his diamond shaped God, whose voice thundered in his mind, insisting that no harm come to his pet. He was rendered impotent in the face of the cold woman, and he was far from happy about it. The pressure against Julia's throat eased. She laughed. \"Until next time, Prince,\" she said, walking away with merriment still shining in her eyes. End. Title: Promise Kirsty Cotton was sixteen years old, curled up on her bed in a fetal position, blood and her uncle's essence staining the insides of her thighs. As much as she was hurt, she was angry. It was the kind of anger that made her bones ache and her teeth clench. \"I'm going to be the death of you,\" she said, tears streaming down her bruised face. \"I promise,\" the words were said with such conviction that it momentarily gave Frank pause. Frank studied his niece for a moment: a piece of art work in his eyes. She was naked, shaking with exalted rage and luscious in her pain. Covered in wounds of battle with braces on her teeth and teenage awkwardness in her frame, she was the very epitome of a victim: his victim. He laughed at her then, hearty and deep. That Kirsty thought she was any match for him was amusing. \"Ah, Kirsty. Cheer up,\" he said while buckling his belt buckle, \"Your dad just got married.\" The next time he saw Kirsty she was even more beautiful. There was a dark, alluring quality to her that was new. A halo of darkness surrounded her. Frank preened, wondering if he had been the cause of it … that darkness. Surely, he had been. Frank had plucked that forbidden fruit from its tree, bit into the sacred apple and enjoyed every moment of it. He was a man with no regrets. When Frank heard the bell toll, when he realized the little bitch had set him up, he felt a grudging respect for the slip of the girl he had so thoroughly used for his own pleasure, his niece. After all, she delivered on her promise. End. Title: Wings All that Hell and its God Leviathan had to offer was bestowed upon Kirsty Cotton upon her evolution. Her hair was as black as pitch, the corkscrew curls falling slightly past her shoulders. Two railroad spikes had been shoved into her skull; one on each side of her head each three inches tall mimicked devil horns, peeking out slightly above her hairline. Eyes that were once a warm chocolate brown were now completely black, devoid of the white sclera around the irises which made them look like pools of oil, inky and wet. When light hit upon those eyes, an iridescent halo appeared, making lower level demons scurry away in fear. The flesh above the bridge of her nose was pierced with a small but perfectly formed metacarpal bone. Ashen lips were vertically sewn shut with black leather cord. Leviathan wanted no words from the Cotton woman before she was re-created or after. Words were exactly the reason she had escaped so many times before. It was best to keep the tongue silent. However, her lips were not her most defining feature. Protruding from her shoulder blades were a fibula and tibia, impaled there by forces unknown and joined to her skeletal system; attached were wings constructed of stretched ashen skin, the webbing that held them tight was a series of interconnecting bones of various shapes and sizes. Despite the fact that the grotesque wings looked as though they were not natural to her frame they moved with her; they were connected to her nervous system and twitched when she was uncomfortable, flapped when she was excited and spanned large and proud when she was feeling particularly confident or aroused. They were hers, part of her, maybe even constructed from pieces of her. A leather corset, stiff and uncomfortable looking adorned her torso and it was paired with a skirt whose material was woven through her flesh on the outside of her thighs. A pattern of square patches of missing flesh made up a design across her chest. It was a tattoo of pain, exposed and glistening from her left collarbone to her right collarbone accentuating a generous amount of pale cleavage. Black combat boots covered her feet; the laces were piano wire that threaded through the flesh on the top of her feet before digging deeper into the meat of her ankles and calves. In the many levels of Hell and to those unfortunate enough to look upon her when the bell tolled, she was known only as \"Wings.\" To the pinned demon, she was and would always be … Kirsty. End Title: Laugh Kirsty's playful laugh rang in his ears from her earthly dimension. He felt like he was choking on ash, because it was a genuine laugh, filled with love, ringing with happiness and he was suffocating on his own unexpected jealousy. Kirsty Cotton was his. Everything about her, he owned. The laugh was out of sorts in the labyrinth, but he heard it playing over and over again as did his gash, who fidgeted in the shadows. The Cenobites were uncomfortable with the emotion the audio transmitted to their realm and frightened by the ominous scowl that graced their leader's face. Kirsty Cotton was in love. Kirsty was happy – and the studded demon was decidedly not. Every soul he reaped was more vicious than the last. The chains he commanded rattled and clinked chaotically, whip-like with his rage that seemed to have no end. The day finally came when the young woman was asked to be married by the pitiful man she so adored, a man whose name was Trevor Gooden. The proposal was sudden and no ring was offered. There was no chivalry, no down on one knee and glittering engagement ring so common of the time. Simply a kiss shared between them and a question. \"Kirsty, will you marry me?\" Trevor asked her, and she smiled a blinding smile; so bright the demon had to close his eyes briefly against the strange feeling it caused to well within him. She let out a strange feminine sound of joy and embraced the man, planting kisses on his thin, undeserving lips. \"Yes, of course I'll marry you, Trevor!\" Kirsty laughed again, and from his throne in the labyrinth, the demon blinked, unsettled with the noise and how it reverberated within him like she was beneath his skin, a part of him. The demon watched as they celebrated their proposal with a round of love making, the man offending him to his very core by taking what was his and his only. His ire rose with every keening noise of pleasure that escaped Kirsty's lips, with every tremble that ran through her body at Trevor's touch. The man would do this to every woman he thought he had a chance with. There was nothing special about his touch, no genuine love. It was the act itself that Trevor so adored as carnal and hedonistic as it was. He was addicted to the pleasure. Not to the lips that he kissed or the heart his forked tongue professed to love. When Kirsty reached her bliss, her eyes closing, her hips gyrating, the demon moved in. Catching her off guard while she was in the throes of passion, he put the image of his own face behind her closed eyes. He suffocated her with his own lust that was built from watching her and felt her body react to him, her orgasm rolling through her much more intensely than what was elicited by her soon to be husband. She felt him there as if the demon was with her and he preened at just how strong their connection was despite them being of two different worlds. Kirsty opened her eyes briefly and saw only the pinned demon, his black eyes locked onto hers. One stark white hand kneaded her left breast; the other held her right hip in a bruising grip. She looked down at their joined bodies to see his pale, scarred form cradled by her hips and his thrusting welcomed between her legs as though he had always been there. Instead of being disgusted, her entire experience was heightened, alarmingly so. She was trapped as the two worlds merged, a victim to her mind and the demon's machinations. \"I love you,\" Trevor whispered in her ear. \"I love you too,\" she responded automatically, not sure if it was Trevor or the demon she was saying it to. She shook her head, attempting to right her world again, but it never would be. The demon was still there, still with her despite the years that had passed by. For the moment, Xipe Totec's anger abated. Kirsty was his and there was enough lust, greed and deception in the man she planned on marrying that he was sure he could leave breadcrumbs of temptation for Trevor to follow. Until his trap was set and his quarry caught, the demon would watch enraptured every time she laughed. End. Title: Box AU. The toll of the bell rings in the demon's ears. Its incessant chime is more painful than the hundreds of mutilations mapped out across his flesh. Its noise pierces through his head, making the tips of the pins driven into his skull vibrate. The bell signals a lost soul following sin flavored breadcrumbs to find its way home. Someone has opened the lament configuration; his or her desire is as thick and as cloying as cigar smoke. The demon known as Pinhead can already taste the rot the soul has to offer. It's a man in his mid-thirties who has a penchant for rape and who lines his pockets with the money of others. There is not one bit of him that looks as sleazy as his soul reveals he is. The man is impeccably dressed in a sharp black suit and tie and looks like a wholesome boy next door. However, something is not quite right as the man's head is tilted to the side. The scent of blood perfumes the air and the demon is unsettled by the fact that it was not him or his gash responsible. Buried in the crook of the man's neck is a woman's face, her features obscured by a thick swath of curly dark hair. She is standing behind the soul, her hands keeping him in place with an iron grip. The woman is Kirsty Cotton. She has apparently hijacked her way into his dimension, and the demon is glad for it, elated and surprised. It had been over a year since he felt her soul snuffed out, their connection lost. \"I did what you wanted me to you stupid cunt. I opened the box now let me go!\" the soul demands even as his life blood is being drained from him. The woman disengages her mouth from the man's throat, a trickle of blood dripping down her chin in a most enticing manner. \"I think you owe me an apology first,\" she says petulantly. \"For what?!\" the man cries. \"Well first for calling me a cunt ,\" Kirsty says, kicking him behind the knee. \"What a nasty word.\" The man falls to his knees on the ground beneath her. Pinhead commands his chains to attach to the soul's flesh, his ears tingling with the sound of the man's screams. The man finally looks in his direction, his eyes widening comically. \"What the fuck is happening here? Who is this freak?!\" he asks, his blue gaze firmly locked onto the studded demon. Kirsty ignores his questions, intent on getting her apology. \"Also, there was that little mishap in the alley – where you tried to rape me,\" she says with nonchalance. The chains pull tighter at those words, stretching the man's skin inches away from his body like a rubber band. Kirsty's eyes meet the demon's eyes for the first time and he feels his skin prickle. She is breath taking. Whatever she is now, it is not human and the demon is enraptured. \"Say you're sorry for calling me a cunt and for trying to rape me,\" she demands as if she were speaking to a child. The man screams as the metal in his flesh tears at his skin; pulled as it is every millimeter is one small agony closer to ripping apart. \"I-I'm not sorry!\" the man wails, unrepentant to the end. Kirsty sighs as the chains tear the man apart, the blood spraying against her face and all over the room. She seems to revel in it, opening her mouth to drink it in. \"They never say sorry,\" she says, fangs showing at the taste of blood. \"You are a child of Hell, Kirsty Cotton. The question is: what kind of child are you?\" he asks. \"Vampire,\" she informs him, moving faster than any human possibly could. He blinks and she is in front of him, scrutinizing him as much as he is her. \"I have no soul. Technically, I'm dead. That's why I had to hitch a ride. I couldn't open the box but oh, I wanted to. I wanted to so badly.\" She invades his personal space and before he can stop her, buries her incredibly sharp, long fangs into his neck. Nuzzling his pale skin, she drinks from him deeply and he allows it while being both aroused and amused. Kirsty lets out a sensuous moan as his blood, thick and magical hits her tongue. It is an elixir, far better than any human blood she has ever tasted. It tastes ancient like a two thousand year old wine: bitter, dark and powerful. \"I've been obsessed with your face,\" she tells him, taking a moment to lick a small bead of blood from his neck. \"Your blood is sky blue and tastes like the closest thing to Heaven that I will ever know.\" The feel of her tongue on his skin is indescribable. It's headier than any soul he's reaped. He decides instantly that she will remain with him. \"I wish you to remain here at my side forever,\" he tells her. \"If you cannot sustain yourself on cenobite blood then you will drink from the souls of the damned.\" She smirks and answers, \"Wish granted.\" End.[Chapter 2] A Circling Vulture by iridescentzen I own nothing. It has been over four years since I've written a single piece of fan fic. This is my poor attempt at getting back into fandom and writing again. It was in the fog of an Ambien and a glass of whiskey that Kirsty opened her eyes to her long dead stepmother sitting in the chair across from her. \"Hello, Kirsty. It's been a while, yes?\" Julia said in her meticulous way as though every word was mulled over in her brain before she uttered it. Kirsty's eyes narrowed dangerously, taking in everything about the woman she had only ever detested. The most noticeable feature was her skin: whole and pure like it was before Kirsty wore it like the world's worst costume. \"It has,\" Kirsty said coolly, eyeing the cigarette perched between the dead woman's fingers. \"If you put that cigarette out on my hardwood floor I'm going to punch you in your icy fucking face.\" Julia laughed the sound coming deep from her belly. She assumed her best \"innocent\" face. \"I'll be good girl, Kirsty, just like you used to be. I promise.\" She stood up, the sleek silver dress she wore now looked dated, but she was perfectly preserved. Walking to where Kirsty was sitting, she circled the woman until she came face to face. \"Daddy's brown eyed girl,\" Julia said, crouching to Kirsty's eye level. Her cool blue eyes studied Kirsty's face intently. \"How old are you now, Kirsty? 40? 45? Time ceases in the labyrinth, but I can see the crinkling around your eyes and the deepness of the lines on your face.\" \"Do you have a point? I could be dreaming of better things right now than you.\" Julia cocked an eyebrow. \"You assume you are dreaming? How interesting.\" Not knowing why, Kirsty indulged her by answering with her age, \"I'm 44.\" \"Ah, so like a good little cockroach you have outlived us all,\" Julia replied, taking a drag from her cigarette. She made a circle of her lips rather dramatically before blowing the smoke in Kirsty's face. \"Daddy would be so proud!\" she said, deadpanned. Kirsty barely reacted to the smoke in her face, but frowned at the word daddy. \"Except that he wouldn't be, because you killed your husband just like I killed mine,\" Julia put her finger on Kirsty's lips before any utterances could be made. \"Shush now. No excuses, darling. No comments about how we're nothing alike. We are the same. It's what fuels us that make us different. I loved a man so much I was willing to kill to bring him back to life. You loved a man that wanted you to kill yourself so he could have all your money. You killed your husband because of rage and spite.\" Julia's finger was lingering much too long on Kirsty's lips. Kirsty shrugged. \"We are nothing alike, Julia.\" \"Oh, how the fallen angel lies,\" Julia said, smirking. \"One day you are going to close your eyes and not wake up, and when you do – Uncle Frank and I will be here waiting for you. Who will you run to then, Kirsty? The demon lover you tell yourself doesn't exist even as he thrusts inside you?\" Kirsty startled awake, happy that the dream didn't have a shred of reality in it. That is, until she turned her head and noticed a still lit cigarette burning a mark into her hardwood floor. Julia. Kirsty scowled. What a bitch. End.

Mason could say with certainty that there were two sides to Tyler Durden. When he joined the Fight Club he hadn't thought much of it. Any man who liked to fight as brutally as Tyler did had to have a few screws loose. It wasn't until he joined Tyler's movement that he realized just how loose they were. Tyler liked to think of himself as their leader, their father, and Mason would never challenge that. Tyler was a father to them. He trained them, taught them, laid down the foundations of their very lives for them. He was an inspiration, there was nowhere Tyler could go that his men wouldn't follow. But there were other sides to Tyler. Another part of him, unlike the one Mason first met. That side called himself Jack. Mason knew the moment he realized that there were two distinctly different personalities in Tyler Durden that he should have left. That he should have gotten away from the madman that would inevitably destroy them. But he, like the other recruits, could not resist the image that Tyler offered. That Jack offered too. Because if Tyler Durden was their father then Jack Moore was undoubtedly their mother. Jack Moore was different from Tyler in a way that utterly baffled Mason. Tyler Durden was a leader, a man's man. The kind of man women wanted fuck and men wanted to be. And yet there was Jack, ever-present Jack. Jack who looked at them in confusion whenever they mentioned Tyler's plan. Jack who brought them inside after Tyler's hazing. Jack who fed them and housed them and looked at them like they were still people . It was unnerving. Mason wondered if the other recruits felt the same way as him. If they saw the changes and bruises and confusion in both Tyler and Jack. If they wondered like Mason did. Because Tyler Durden was their father, hard and strict and caring in his own way. And Jack Moore was their mother, softer and kinder and remembering to call them by name . It hurt to think about. Sometimes Mason wondered if he was going crazy. If he was losing his mind in this place. He had become a part of the hive, a new hive. One controlled by Tyler who denounced the idea of being part of a group. Of being individual or collective. But not Jack. Jack was an individual. And he softened Tyler in a way no child soldier of Tyler's ever could. He could hear them sometimes, somehow becoming one. When the bed would creak and the ceiling fall and he could hear Jack screaming out for Tyler. He wondered what it would be like if they were separate. If they were real. But that was not his concern.

Justine was anxious as she opened the door leading to the basement. Justine felt a rush she had never before experienced as she walked into the dank and dirty area filled with shirtless, bruising men, just waiting for their chance to prove themselves to others, or themselves. She had no idea what would happen, if she would be welcomed, laughed at, removed, or treated with hostility. There was no going back now. Maybe thirty men crowded the basement, in a vaguely circular shape. A tall tan man with spiky hair and a wild smile on his face paced back and forth, waiting for the din of speaking men to quiet down. A pale and tired looking man who was slightly shorter than his companion stood to the side, a small smile graced his face though, and his eyes held a spark, signifying to Justine that he must come here because it was the highlight of his week. Once everyone quieted down the taller man spoke loudly, \" Hello ladies!\" Justine tried not to snort at his ironic choice of words for the night. \"It looks like a lot of people have been breaking some rules…\" He tsked, and shook his finger at the group. \"Can't have that now can we?\" His voice suddenly rose in volume as he said, \"What's rule number one?\" His voice demanded the crowds attention and they all responded with enthusiasm; 'You do not talk about fight club.' \"Second rule!\" You do not talk about fight club. \"Third rule!\" \"Fourth rule!\" \"Fifth rule!\" Everyone responded as if they were enchanted robots, so caught up in this man's magic. \"Sixth rule!\" No shirts, no shoes. \"Seventh!\" Fights go as long as needed. \"And last, but not least…\" He crossed his arms and gave a knowing smile to several faces throughout the crowd.

Granted, I wasn't wonderfully endowed like my three sisters, but men tended to stare regardless of a woman's breast size. Silence had dragged on for a few seconds before another man spoke. He was Vietnamese if I had to guess, about six feet tall and had shaved his head to show off some silly tattoo. \"I'll let you have the first five hits for free,\" he chuckled. \"If you thi-\" \"No,\" I stated firmly. Bored but still watching Durden, I began to pop my knuckles. \"My mother always told me to go big or go home - usually right before she lost two weeks' of money at the casino.\" With all the swaying hips of a well-fed cat, I sauntered to the ring leader. Light and sweat did interesting things to the contours of his chest and stomach. He was wearing those same red pants as the first night I'd watched them, the same tacky red leather jacket discarded by his shoes. This time he was grinning, and he flicked the cigarette against the far wall where it would no doubt be forever forgotten. \"Well,\" he shrugged. \"Momma's always right.\" With a roar of cheers from Durden's men, we lunged for one another. My fist connected with his ribs so hard, I couldn't tell which of our bones made the cracking sound. The next thing I knew, his arms were around my waist and I was being slammed onto the cellar floor. The wind was knocked out of me, and stars swirled across my vision. A rock cut into some part of my upper back, but the adrenaline was already flowing. Tyler's smug grin floated above me, blue eyes glittering with confidence. I landed a strong right hook to his cheek; faint pain welled up in my hand and wrist. He groaned and tired to roll with the hit, but I'd clocked him pretty close to the ear. With any luck, it knocked his sense of balance off. I pushed him up with my knees and kicked him back hard enough that his feet slipped on the wet cardboard and he fell on his ass. Someone in the background laughed while others continued to cheer. As quickly as I could, I jumped to my feet and aimed a kick for the leader's jaw. He was quick; I gave him that much.A massive hand caught my ankle. I felt it just a moment too late. Tyler pulled my off my feet and dragged my head cracked on the floor again. This time I could feel the cold, wet splatter of blood as it dripped from my split forehead. Tyler straddled my hips, one hand gripping me by the hair as he forced my cheek into the cardboard mat. Reluctantly I tapped out. I didn't have much of an option, really, but I knew I left him some new bruises. When he stood up, he grabbed me by the arm and hauled me up with him. \"Not bad for a first timer,\" he conceded. Despite the iota of praise, I still felt wounded by the loss. After all, I was a prideful thing. The fights went on for hours, but I wasn't allowed in any more after my first show. Regardless, I watched with muted interest as I had for the last week. There was something about the air down in the fight cellar that made everyone feel alive again, like they never could during the day. As I was leaving, walking behind everyone else as usual, someone grabbed my wrist. Naturally I turned, fist prepped to fly, and stopped short at the sight of Durden. \"What's your name?\" he asked. Glacier blue eyes looked me up and down, just as he had everyone else that attended. Again his eyes lingered on my chest. I pulled free and smirked. \"Who is asking?\" He stepped forward, and I stepped back to match. \"A middle child forgotten by the world, just like everyone else in the club.\" This time I stepped back and he stepped forward. \"Why should I tell a child my name?\" The dance continued, something dark and coy - my meaningless questions and his desire to know the name of the only woman to challenge him and his sausage-fest of a club - until I was leaning against the door of my abandoned truck. I wrapped my hand around his jaw and pulled his lips to hover just above mine. \"Irma,\" I whispered. Those damned eyes of his searched my face for something. \"Irma,\" he muttered back. Without warning his mouth crashed into my own. He tasted sweet, of honey and bitter tea. In the darkness we tore at each other, filled with need and primal desire. He commanded with his hips and hands, and I obeyed only as far as I thought would suit me. Much the same way, he teased and nipped and prodded at my flesh as we slipped into my truck. \"If this continues,\" he sighed into my ear. \"You will be only mine.\" I flashed him a toothy grin, mischief lining my touch as I held his chin. \"And I will ruin you in ways undefined,\" I answered.

La letra de la canción 'where is my mind' tampoco es de mi propiedad, es de Pixies. , , , A este punto ya no sabes qué es real y qué no lo es, tu cabeza está a punto de colapsar y empiezas a destruir todo lo que comenzaste con tu propio alter ego. Para acabar con Tyler, debes terminar contigo mismo. —Te agradezco todo lo que hiciste por mí. Pero esto es demasiado, no es lo que quiero—dices, mientras lo miras cara a cara. El arrepentimiento empieza a brotar desde tus entrañas. Tyler, en cambio se levanta furioso de su asiento deja el cigarro a un lado y está a punto de enfrentarte otra vez, y lo hará mil veces más si es necesario. —¿Qué quieres? ¿Volver a ese trabajo de mierda? ¿A tu casa y tu televisión de mierda? ¡Al carajo, me niego! En ese momento pareces un niño confundido, que no entiende cómo fue que llegó al punto cero de su vida. El dolor físico ya no significa nada, golpes visibles en tu rostro, hematomas aflorando por toda tu piel, pero hay algo que te duele más que todas esas cosas y es que tu cabeza está dando vueltas y vueltas como un tiovivo. —Esto no puede ser real—Quieres sentir, llorar y hacerte a la idea de lo que vives es una pesadilla que creaste, lo cierto es que es más real que tu propia existencia. —Ya todo está hecho—dice Tyler molesto—, así que cállate. Mira su reloj y termina agregando que faltan sesenta segundos para un espectáculo sin precedentes, la destrucción que planeaste sin saber que se llevaría a cabo. —No… Puedo resolver esto, ni siquiera es real. Algo en tu cerebro empieza a funcionar, la parte coherente comienza a trabajar a marchas forzadas. Comienzas a crearte la teoría de que si Tyler tiene una pistola y piensas en que tú tienes esa pistola serás el que la tenga entre sus manos, la cosa resulta cierta y Tyler se ve un tanto interesado. —Qué suerte, pero eso no cambia nada. Su tono despreocupado, el cigarrillo en su boca y la manera relajada de su torso te hace pensar que no es posible que tu otro yo sea tan tranquilo y que parezca siempre tener el control. Sin embargo empiezas a razonar cómo puedes detener tu propia pesadilla, y cómo puedes destruir a Tyler aunque sabes que hacer eso es matar una parte de ti. Miras la pistola como si fuera el mayor de los bienes sobre el mundo, te permites admirarla y sabes que ella será la solución a todos los males, es perfecta para el fin que deseas lo único que te falta es ejecutar la acción. —¿Por qué colocas un arma en tu cabeza?—Tyler luce por primera vez desconcertado, manea la cabeza no entendiendo que pretendes hacer. Y por primera vez tú tienes el control y sabes lo qué harás, y eres tú, finalmente eres capaz de tomar manejo de la situación y no sentirte como un títere de tu propia mente, de la propia mierda que te fuiste creando con el pasar del tiempo. Tuvieron que pasar diversos sucesos para darte cuenta que estabas perdiendo la razón y que todo lo que creías cierto se disolvía como la grasa, así tal cual como cuando hacían los jabones. Tyler Durden es todo lo que tú quisiste ser, o al menos eso piensas. No sabes en qué momento tú te volviste esclavo de tu propia mente, y cómo fue que él te dejó a segundo plano, ahora sabes qué hacer y colocas el arma en tu barbilla. —No es mi cabeza Tyler, es nuestra cabeza. Con aquella última declaración estás más que dispuesto a ponerle fin a todo lo que empezaste. Tyler también está preparado para tener la última pelea contigo. Molesto, arroja su cigarro y lo aplasta, se acerca a ti como si fueras su presa. —Interesante, ¿qué pretendes con esto, consumista ? Tragas saliva, tu mano sostiene el gatillo y con más fuerza colocas la pistola. Tyler nota tu decisión y cruzado de brazos trata de convencerte de que lo que estás a punto de hacer es una tontería. —Escucha, somos tú y yo—Mira tu rostro, pero ve en ti arrepentimiento, tus ojos sólo piden un descanso a toda la mierda provocada y Tyler quiere impedir que te dejes llevar por tu razón—, ¿amigos? Intentará hasta el último momento de hacerte caer en razón, pero tú sabes que un hombre como Tyler nunca podría ser tu amigo, él te ha manipulado a su imagen y semejanza, es irónico pensar que él es todo lo que alguna vez quisiste ser, tiene el físico que quisieras, la actitud que tanto anhelabas. Tyler Durden, Tyler Durden. Lo que cuesta trabajo creer es que Tyler eres tú mismo. —Tyler, quiero que me escuches muy bien. Él te mira cual cachorro arrepentido, esta vez eres quién se para y deja por un efímero momento el arma, él cree que dirás algo más quizá un discurso sobre lo que piensas acerca de su existencia, tal vez piensa que te arrepentirás de todo y comenzarás a llorar como un bebé en brazos de su madre. —Está bien. Dice, no muy conforme con lo que va a pasar, él es como un niño regañado en ese momento y lo disfrutas, Tyler está bajo tu control esta vez y es algo que te excita. Ya no habrá más peleas ni luchas, todo terminara en menos de sesenta segundos. —Tengo los ojos abiertos. Te metes la pistola en la boca, sin arrepentimiento y sin temor jalas el gatillo. Caes por inercia y sin fuerza sueltas la pistola, la sangre cubre tu boca y te atraviesa. Tyler está desubicado, sale humo por su boca y esta vez no es ocasionado por los cigarrillos. El juego ha terminado. Un chillido en tu oído se prolonga, es la orquesta del preludio final. —¿Qué es ese olor? Tyler Durden cae, su cabeza está hecha mierda y expira. Ya no habrá más club de pelea, ya no más. Ahora, realmente quieres vivir. Has despertado de tu propio coma inducido y anhelas paz, estás y te sientes vivo. El dolor llega a ti como una corriente de aire que te destruye, las heridas se abren y la sangre no deja de flotar, no sientes ya tu oído y en tu boca sientes el sabor a plomo y metal, podrías ahogarte en tu propia sangre pero esta vez sí te darías cuenta de ello. Llegan tus hombres, y uno de ellos se sorprende al verte en tal estado. Deja caer una bolsa repleta de latas de cerveza y se acerca a ti realmente preocupado, para ti ese hombre de nombre 'n' carece de importancia, no quieres verlos, no deseas saber de ellos. —¡Señor Durden! Se dirigen a ti afligidos y te sugieren que deberías visitar al doctor, tu aspecto es el de un muerto viviente pero a ti ya no te importa porque jamás te has sentido tan vivo en tu vida. —Estoy bien. Tu voz está distorsionada, ya no estás tragando saliva sino tu propia sangre. Aquello les parece repugnante y hacen una mueca de asco, desean ayudarte pero tú ya no quieres eso, ¿llamar al doctor en una llamada de emergencia? ¿ahora cuando te sientes más real que nada? Tú estás bien y te lo repites a ti mismo, es entonces que la otra comitiva trae a rastras a una mujer y reconoces el ruido de sus tacones —aquello perfora más tu oído— sin embargo te da gusto. Por primera vez sientes alegría de ver a Marla Singer. —Déjenla conmigo. Nos vemos abajo. Ellos no te reconocen, piensan que te has dado un buen viaje, no comprenden tu cambio de actitud pero eso no importa mientras sepas quién eres. Marla luce desconcertada y cuando se acerca a ti suelta un grito de horror y desconcierto, ciertamente parte de tu rostro luce desfigurado, y tu cuerpo se asemeja más a un saco de patatas pateado y polviento. —Oh por Dios, tu cara… —Sí, ya lo sé. Después de todo te sientes bien que ella esté ahí regañándote y soltando insultos al aire. Ella es la parte humana que necesitas para afrontar el día a día, es la parte coherente y real que habla por ti. Mente y corazón están en armonía si aquella loca mujer de tacones altos está cerca. —¿Qué pasó? —No preguntes. —¡Tienes un disparo! Nunca la habías visto tan preocupada, su voz parece ser más dulce. Ya no está la Marla que fuma y usa un vestido usado de un dólar. Ya no es la Marla que suele soltar groserías, ni aquella mujer que tiene la filosofía de que la vida se va a terminar en cualquier instante. No. La chica que está frente a ti es como cualquier otra mujer, su instinto maternal sale a flote y en un intento torpe trata de limpiar la sangre que no ha dejado de brotar, no siente asco, sino que trata de salvarte de una posible hemorragia. Te reconforta su actitud y permites que se acerque a ti, ya no hay rencor ni enojos, solo son ustedes dos. —¿Quién hizo esto?—Con un pañuelo te limpia, sus ojos nunca parecieron ser tan grandes. —Yo lo hice. —¿Te diste un tiro? —Sí, pero estoy bien. Marla, mírame, Le parece incrédulo y estúpido que hayas hecho aquello, nadie está bien de su mente pero lo que ella nunca sabrá es que Tyler Durden ha muerto de ti, ella no tiene que saber sobre toda la mierda que rondaba en tu cabeza antes de conocerla, ahora es un nuevo comenzar. —Marla, estoy bien—repites, mientras tomas parte de su rostro—, créeme va a salir todo bien. En tu cabeza sabes lo que está a punto de suceder. Una explosión, un sonido hueco se reproduce y ella salta de la impresión mira hacia la ventana y todo pasa frente a sus ojos. La canción de 'where is my mind' de Pixies suena una y otra vez en tu interior, le das 'play' y parece un bello y trágico desenlace. Edificios desplomándose cual piezas de dominó, caen uno a uno como castillos de arena, se disuelven y partículas de polvo inundan el ambiente. Todo cae por su propio peso, tomas su mano y ella voltea a verte confundida esta vez lo hace como una mujer tímida que no sabe qué decir. La has dejado sin palabras. —Me conociste en un momento muy extraño de mi vida. Finalmente, se miran cara a cara, sin contemplar como el último edificio se desplaza frente a sus ojos. Marla Singer es todo lo que necesitas, ella sabe mucho mejor que un cigarrillo y una cerveza juntos. \"Con los pies en el aire y la cabeza en el suelo. Intenta este truco y gira, tu mente colapsará si no hay nada en ella y te preguntarás donde está mi mente… Saliendo del agua, la veo nadando\" N/A Recordaré este día como el primero en que hice un fic de una película.

My name is Robert Paulson, and I will be forty-eight years old, forever. I am forty-eight years old, and I was part of fight club. I am forty-eight years old, and I was part of Project Mayhem. Only in death will we have our own names since only in death are we no longer part of the effort. In death we become heroes. My journey to this point began when I met a man calling himself \"Cornelius\". I went to Remaining Men Together, as I usually did, and wrapped my arms around Tyler Durden, though he was calling himself Cornelius. I smothered Mr Durden into my bitch tits and cried. I cried because I had lost my huevos. I cried because I had been divorced three times. I cried because my own two kids wouldn't return my calls. They were embarrassed to have a dad with bitch tits. They were embarrassed to have a dad with no balls. I lost everything when I got cancer. I lost my wife. I lost my kids respect. I lost my money. I owned a gym. I was on TV advertising my gym. I couldn't do that anymore. Who would want to go to a gym owned by a guy with boobs? My life was over. Then, one day, I heard about a club. I heard about it from David. He said he'd gone to a wonderful club the night before. A club that lets you fight the cancer in a metaphorical way. A club that allows you to stay a man. Fight club. At this point, Cornelius had left. We thought he'd died. We'd mourned him. Everyone at Remaining Men Together decided we would disband. We would go to fight club. That would be our new therapy group. I was chosen to stay behind and inform anyone else who arrived that we we joining a different club. Cornelius walked in. I smiled. \"We thought you were dead.\" \"Yeah, me too.\" \"Well, I've got good news.\" \"Where is everybody?\" Everyone had left to go to fight club. \"That's the good news. The groups disbanded. I only come here to tell any guys who might show up.\" Cornelius collapsed with his eyes closed on one of the plaid thrift store couches. \"The good news,\" I said, \"is there's a new group, but the first rule about this new group is you aren't supposed to talk about it. And the second rule is you're not supposed to talk about it.\" Cornelius opened his eyes. \"The group's called fight club,\" I said, \"and it meets every Friday night in a closed garage across town. On Thursday nights, there's another fight club that meets at a garage closer by. The first rule about fight club,\" I said, \"is you don't talk about fight club. The second rule about fight club,\" I said, \"is you don't talk about fight club. Only two men per fight. Only one fight at a time,\" I said. \"You fight without shirts or shoes. The fights,\" I said, \"go on as long as they have to. Those are the rules invented by the guy who invented fight club.\" I asked, \"Do you know him? I've never seen him, myself,\" I said, \"but the guy's name is Tyler Durden. \"Do I know him. I dunno,\" Cornelius said. \"Maybe.\" I would find out later that Cornelius' real name was Tyler Durden. He had started fight club. A few weeks later, I heard about Project Mayhem. I heard rumours about how if you withstood Tyler's abuse for three days, you were admitted to Project Mayhem. I did it. I showed up to 5123 NE Paper Street with five hundred dollars cash, two black shirts, two black pair of trousers, one pair of heavy black shoes, two pair of black socks and two pair of plain underwear, one heavy black coat, one white towel, one army surplus cot mattress and one white plastic mixing bowl. I stayed there for three days. I joined Project Mayhem. I carried out a few assignments. On my fourth homework assignment, I died. It was a regulation chill-and-drill homework assignment. Nothing I hadn't done before. I sprayed some R-134a into the lock cylinder of the automatic bank teller machine. I drilled into it, shattering the lock. I was interrupted by a police officer. I turned and, I assume, he mistook my cordless electric drill for a gun. \"Freeze! Drop the weapon!\" It was better to get hurt than arrested. If you were arrested, you were off Project Mayhem, no more homework assignments. The cop's gun fired. Time slowed down. The bullet moved. It hit me in the middle of my forehead.

Tyler has never said that in the basement were Fight Club is happening. Tyler has said once 'Ladies' and it was in a mocking tone, but never seriously. Its weird. This night we have a woman among men, Tyler said. All of the men shifted their eyes to the lone woman in the middle. First rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. Second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. She laughs a quiet laugh. She is a lithe woman, yet her chest is slightly full of herself. She's holding her bust on a tight sports bra like the ones you see in the commercials in the TV, with shorts of the same kind on her thin legs. Third rule is if someone says \"stop\" or goes limp, taps out the fight is over. Fourth rule is only two to a fight. Why would a girl be doing here? Tyler said that the first fifty to come in first and that's it. Was she one of the fifty? How could she enter? Was she aware of the Fight Club? Fifth rule is one fight at a time. She seems like she had worked out before, like most of us. Her nails are trimmed, her black hair is short, like Marla's but this one has been taken care of. She looks like one of those woman you see fighting in the UFC or in regular boxing. Sixth rule is no shirts, no shoes. The woman had already solved the problem with her sports bra. She definitely knows about Fight Club. Who told her? Seventh rule is that fights will go on as long as they have to. How long will she last against one of these men? With whom will she fight? Eight rule is that if this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight. So I have to fight, she asked and stepped forwards. Who wants to fight this lady? I remember that, when I was in high school, I hit a girl taller than me and she hit back. I was thrown to the ground and to the principal's office. A man who works in a car wash stepped forwards. He said that he's not afraid of hitting a girl. She laughs a quiet laugh. The group of men start to form a circle around the two as they step over the little piece of cardboard we put as a mat. The smell of sweat is starting as the two start to walk in circles. The man is taunting her, who has her fists up. I am more convinced that she had a professional fight before. That or she practices. Hit me, the man says. The rest of the men yell in anticipation as Tyler and I walk around the people. She throws two fists, the man caught one but the other was too fast and it connects with his cheekbone. She lifts her leg and pushes his abdomen, making him fall to the ground. She kicks his knees and steps on them as she plummets a fist towards his nose. She hits him once, twice, four times until he takes hold of her arm, twists it and makes her fall face-first to the ground. She manages to hit his ribs with her elbow once, twice as he takes her hair and throws her face to the concrete like when it happened to me and ended up with half of my face printed on the floor with blood. But she manages to escape the third hit by breaking one of his ribs, hitting the side of his face with her elbow and twisting his arm, ending up in the same position she was before, but roles are now reversed. She doesn't holds his hair, but his arm and punches the back of his skull and makes his face bounce on the ground with every punch. Half of her face is now covered in blood from her forehead, but she keeps a straight face. He yells stop after the seventh punch. She throws herself away from him, sitting on the ground while he is taken to his feet with a broken nose, lip, cheekbones and bleeding from the back of his head. Who else wants to go, she yells. Who else of you motherfuckers wants to be beaten by a girl? No one answers. She sighs and walks to a nearby wall and sits down. Two men are now the center of attention.

I was the new Captain, or Commanding Officer, in the Eastern District, and it was my first day in my official capacity. It took me twelve years to become captain, and that was with help. I intentionally stayed as a primary or first grade detective, having been the first position or two that I really earned. My badge was gold to others, but to me it was a dark crimson red, almost a dark purple. It was waterboarded in blood. Many people call it a shield. I find that ironic.What it represents is so much more symbolic!Of course, you can't possibly understand what I mean yet. Ultimately though, I wear it to remind me what it means to me. What it cost me. I wear it as a badge to honor my last word of honor. COURT OF APPEALS THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK VS. Francis Bentley Ford I became detective-inspector first, at third grade detective. Not by my doing, but nonetheless it was mine for the taking because I hadn't a clue that there were strings attached to me. But, when I learned the truth, that's when I really excelled at my job and used every tool I had been taught, whether through studies, or massive experience and tragedy, and attacked every homicide scene where the victims were clearly dead. I treated it as if I had a chance to save their life by solving the crime. A couple of years later, after I was moved to another precinct with a different last name that I had chosen because I didn't want to let my name interfere with my career, I showed my brilliant abilities and was quickly bumped up to primary, first grade detective. I was making a great salary. I stayed their content for a while. I was even going to retire there. But, then my world and life were destroyed. Maybe I'm part to blame in some of this for falling in love and starting a family. Maybe because I always had a rule, in which my family comes first before anything else. I wasn't one of those cops who constantly left their minds at the crime or murder scene when they returned home. I always came home to make time for my family. I didn't know though, that I was making, what was the greatest weakness, so publicly aware. At first, I received cryptic death threats, but I never anticipated that it all resulted in planting a seed, or the seed. It was distorting my perception at work and my thinking, which was my real advantage. I then lost my edge, and I lost something special. Love had consumed me and replaced my primal instincts with emotions so profound with feelings towards my family's happiness. My senses were all dull. I was weak, but worse I was vulnerable. Then one day, I woke up not knowing that when I was brushing my teeth next to my wife, it would be the last time she would laugh at me and tell me I was so gross because of the gurgling noise I always made. I would try to retort in a comeback, but she would quickly interrupt, before I lit the fuse to the cannon, and would tell me every time and casually say she knew I was going to tell her something about the way she spit her toothpaste. I was never able to tell that come back with the humor I intended unfortunately, but she was right and knew I was going to say it the whole time, anyway. A switch was turned off in my brain. I was like a bottle cork floating in the middle of a great sea with nothing in sight around it. I was lost. What's worse I would soon learn I had lost my shadow. My past had caught up to me. My past, that's right. The landmark of Hell! I forgot who the interior decorators were and who was the narrator of my life. It was all hidden in plain sight the whole time. I just wasn't looking because I let love distract me from the hate that was always present. Everything I set up was in a position of being attacked. The sky in my world was unzipped by a shooting star that opened it up. That time I had called happiness and love, looking back it was all too brief like a great dash of light captured for a marvelous moment shooting across the skies. But, you realize it was so fast you couldn't even tell someone to look at it, and then a stranger comes along one night and zips up that opening left by the star that shot through your world, your skies, and closes it! I couldn't get out of bed. I didn't have the strength, nor did I have a reason. I would stay there waiting for my body to expire, so my soul can escape. I wasn't afraid of anything. I learned that hell had no limits and I was residing in it all my life. I feared nothing of this world. Everything had been done to me, anyway. I embraced death because I knew to leave this devilish existence may be a place without suffering. Here, I was living a bleak existence of crying every time I woke up because I was still here. So, I did what I had to do. I took my gun and clamped down on the cold barrel. I knew exactly what angle to squeeze to end all of my suffering. I can't articulate or express the words what the moment was like to justify its clarity. All the rage and hate I had towards myself, and all the hosts along the way of this Hell where bats thrived in, the hosts that rented space from the architect that was responsible for building and creating this world, for killing the person that held my heart in her hands, especially, had finally consumed me! My heart was the only thing that was able to escape this darkness because it was hers for safe keeping, and so it died with her. My child, the extension of our love, a girl that would remind me every time I looked at her, of the women I was in love with, was killed too. Hailey was an echo of the love shared between her mother and I, and our love produced the purest form of an ultimate love between two hearts intertwined. The finished product was a daughter that looked like her mother but had her father's expressions and preferred the same side of the toilet paper. Hailey had seventeen different laughs. I only heard her cry four different ways, including her first cry entering this world, but that night she cried a fifth way I've never heard before. The last way she cried while exiting the same world she had entered, but it was different because memories and love were attached to the final cry! All my love and passion were replaced with rage and extreme hate. When you take away everything from a woman or man, anything they care about in their life; hope, love, family, meaning, purpose, then they become primitive and I from then on, acted out of natural instinct. Like a barbaric savage, only some are very intelligent and prepare for the blood lust. Yes, that dayI held the gun in my mouth and applied pressure to the trigger and my final thought was a chess board. I told you I can't explain it, but it all then just made sense to me. My mind was the only thing that was still intact. Barely, but it was still there. My feelings and emotions were absolutely flatlined. No paddles to my body could bring back empathy or compassion ever again. But, I had the chess board. Life! Psychological warfare is what it really was not just a game. My mind then resorted to a criminal mastermind as if the paddles shocked a rhythm to my flatlined pulse. The beeping had stopped. The loud crying had silenced and now I was left with extreme focus. I returned to work two weeks after the tragedy happened and after convincing everyone, including the doctor that I was fine, I asked to take the lieutenants test. Many people were shocked, and they felt like they were losing a great detective too. There was no way anyone thought I was in the right frame of mind to return two weeks later and take a test for promotion. It was also proof that I had gone mad. It meant I was striving for the offices of rank and position, then the streets that I had thrived in and mastered. But, to be honest, I haven't at the time grieved at all, or would until my only purpose was completed in life. Before I knew it, I was a lieutenant. I had two to five years before I could become a Captain. All that time was like a foggy phase at work. I was on auto-response. I was so good at my job that my mind didn't have to be where my feet were all the time. Only when needed. I worked tons of overtime because I no longer had a home to go to at the end of shifts. I used endless amounts of resources for the only reason why I didn't squeeze the trigger that day. I used all the time and years to plan my revenge. The hardest part for me was controlling my rage and never taking off my mask. Imagine standing next to the man that destroyed your family's lives. Having killed them and having to stand next to him. I knew moments like that would come to light frequently. But, I thought of the chess board. He would talk to me and I had to smell his stale coffee breath with a strong hint of cigarettes. I often wondered if he dipped his fingers in an ashtray before applying them to his neck and wrists. In my whole career as a cop, I've learned many things, but it's the small details that stick with me. Our coffee cups for example. Sometimes we're so busy or not busy, making us feel tired that were constantly drinking coffee and never take the time to properly clean the mug after we're done. Just a rinse, right? But, no. So, many mugs had coffee ring stains on the inside. His, it was spotless and smelled like Gin Rye! Maybe you're wondering if I had nothing to lose, why not put a hole in his head and end it? Or maybe you're not thinking that because you're not out of your mind like I've been accused of being. I couldn't do it. There were a few reasons. You would have to know the things that led up to this point, first. And this point isn't where the story currently is. This point is strategically planning for years my revenge. That was my only purpose. Anyone that tried to get close to me, I assumed was a threat to my operation. This is a simple story, or a case if you listen to me. Please don't overthink it! This is in a sense a goodbye. By the time you read this, I will have finally escaped this hell and found peace. If I'm lucky, a place where I'm with my wife and daughter. I wish I could say that I mean it when I say I'm sorry, but I'm just scar tissue. My scabs were picked with each tragic event in my life and bled until finally, they were picked so much that my wounds turned into this, scar tissue. Note, this is my confession, with a goodbye letter sprinkled throughout it. Most importantly it's for you! Check mate! My current official position made me responsible for my squad, the detectives in in it, and the finest police officers to protect this city. I was only thirty-four years old. I was told by my father who was a high-ranking police official, but now retired, that the worst thing for a man is for him to lose his shadow. That for some people, time will always catch up. At the time I didn't know what that meant. It was a meaning you would only understand if you had fallen into the great abyss. It took me until that day when I tripped and fell. For some people the worst interpretation of the meaning is experiencing life's valleys and peaks. I walked in and I looked at the bulletin board of the highest-ranking command, and saw they placed my picture towards the top already. I thought it was odd. I noticed the sergeant below me was a twenty-year-old year-old male wearing plainclothes. It was clearly a joke at the sergeant's expense. I took it down before he saw it. The officers were all staring at me and were chatting amongst themselves. I didn't know who put the picture there, but I didn't share the humor. I continued towards my office. I walked by Katrina, a talented primary detective. \"Second day CO, how you liking It? Stupid question, sorry. Don't worry we'll figure this all out.\" She seemed genuinely concerned. \"I know you will. I have the most faith in you and, I can't believe I'm saying this, but Mercury to.\" Mercury was a first-grade homicide detective as well. Just as good, but a douche. \"Just get situated. Let us do the heavy lifting now. You've been through so much in the last year and a half. This is the city's worst event, so we'll do the best for you!\" She walked away, and I believed her. Fortunately, I did my best too, and I would continue to. So, the day finally came where I found my peace. I accomplished the purpose of my life. The event happened on the day which was the day of reckoning. The day of revenge. The question you're going to ask me is was it worth it, do I finally feel better like justice has been done? I'll let you judge that. The following is my confession. I wanted this read for you before you found out what I'm charged with, so you wouldn't judge me. So, you can really listen to me without knowing anything that's important to this. I wrote it down because I have a knack for remembering a lot of events in my life. Landmarks in my mind! Some of the conversations with less important people aren't exactly as told, but captured in the way they spoke to me. Every name is real to prove the validity of this testimony. It's written down this way to allow me to make this difficult project easier. These events are hard for me to re-live. At times you may be confused, don't worry I've re-read this and made sure I didn't leave any loose ends. Things that may have seem meaningless in the very beginning, will play a role into my story. It's all right here written in plain sight. Don't overthink it! He keeps pushing me. I feel like I have no strength left then he asks me if I'm tired. I express how exhausted I am. He then pulls out the thing I can't stand the most. It scares me, but at my age its intriguing. I'm not able to comprehend what's really going on. He tells me how it's so powerful and to make it part of me, would make me special. I couldn't stand it. It didn't feel right. The first time he made me hold it, I quickly let go. He looked at me as if I insulted him. I thought then that I probably made him feel like something so important to him, made me scared. So, I went along with it. He tells me to do it and we'll stop for the day. I was too young, so I was clumsy. After I did it, and after I would always do it, he always asked me a series of questions pushing me and challenging my limits. He pushed me to the brink and what I found out, was my brinks limits were further than I thought. My limits were limitless, and it made me feel special. This was his intention. I thought what he was teaching me must have been working. So, instead of riding bikes like other kids at my age and riding them feeling so liberated by not having any structure of the summer days. No camp to attend to then. When you were a boy then, you would wake up with a whole day of doing whatever you wanted to. Maybe you were exploring stuff in the woods near a fascinating waterfall, but really you were discovering yourself and childhood, and exploring forts in woods, making tree houses, but not me. I didn't do any of those things. I didn't have the escape kids my age did. I spent my time with him. He was my babysitter and he was highly trusted, it seemed, by my father. So, I assumed my father approved of what was going on and what he said I was learning. Little did I know the seed was planted and wouldn't bloom for a long time. He had so much anger in him I could feel it. I became intrigued with him by the things he would tell me, well, he would be talking more to himself, I just happen to be there I would realize. I researched him. I learned the man he was. Things began to make sense. At my age I was incapable of comprehending the realistic truth. My brain was still developing. Things were more of an adventure or fantasy and escape to me. Perhaps it was his story that enchanted me, or what I was being taught, but I never connected the dots until later. I was homeschooled for all of my childhood. My father was very stern and didn't want me going to school. He received a lot of threats, so he became overly paranoid and protective. I'm trying to remain as objective as I can. My mother had a heart problem from giving labor to me, so she couldn't work, and would be at home during the days too. She would get dizzy spells and I would find her often on the floor. At first it was the scariest feeling, actually the first four times her heart made my heart stop. She then explained to me that she had a big heart, and because she loved so much she would always day dream of the best fantasy and fall asleep occasionally. As i grew older the story would be revised to eventually she had a weak heart and needed a new one. The one she had at that time, had a clock on it counting down its expiration date. That has always been my most important goal in life. I wanted to save her. She was on a list. But, she wasn't officially on a list until I didn't find her name and learned she kept it a secret from my father too. \"Jesus woman, what were you thinking? Well? Ok, fine. I'll tell ya. You weren't thinking! This will be fixed at once. I will not lose the one person I love in my life! Do you hear me?\" I heard my father through my thin walls say to my mom. He then cried in the long moment it took her to answer. \"I love you too, dear. You know you have to be strong, remember?\" That was the last I heard before falling asleep. I asked her later on, why she would not let the doctor put her on a donor's heart? I was crushed by her answer. \"Look at me my beautiful son, I don't want a stranger's heart attached to my soul! My heart that I have may be a lemon, but its filled with so much love for you. So much love that the juice would never taste like the lemonade I make! Everything is instilled in my heart. To take it out and replace it, I can't live with the thought!\" I didn't know the great love she knew then, but when I did know what she was talking about, I understood her point. But, life is tricky like that, by the time you find out the truth about life, time will have already moved on. The two greatest battles of one's existence, life and time. A constant battle that time always won throughout life, and especially by the end of your life. I was homeschooled by my neighbor, a retired teacher. He taught me all my studies. My mother thought highly of him, so I knew he must have been a good man. Mr. Wells. Boy, did he have a bottomless well of meticulousness. Very calculating. He had a son a few years older than me that I befriended. He first came to our house to tell his father he needed a ride to the comic book store. His father told him never to interrupt his work again, but his son said that he had broken his promise. Mr. Wells was supposed to bring him yesterday I learned. So, I asked if we can go, and he took off his glasses and rubbed the corners of his eyes, but finally resigned maybe realizing he was over matched. The three of us went to what anyone else would say was just a comic book store, but for me it was a whole new world I was entering, and about to inhabit. The store was called Brave Traveler Comics. That's where my first friend talked to me. He asked what my favorite comic was, and I saw his face resort into a look of utter bitterness, like he just ate the sourest candy ever. He knew by the look in my eyes what I was thinking and what I was about to say. He then said to me he couldn't believe I've never read a comic book before, and then asked Mr. Wells the date. After being told, he looked at me and told me that the date was a special day, the day I discovered a whole new world! \"Today, well today is the day you are born! The day you've become alive! You haven't lived if you've never read one of Alan Moore's comics. I only have enough money to buy a certain amount ok? I washed and mowed a shit ton of cars last summer, so let's see what will be the makeup of your DNA!\" He then started picking up tons of comics. I was lost in the array of the covers and illustrations. I saw one cover that just spoke to me. The man looked so intriguing and mysterious, yet simple. But, it was the symbol that made me notice him. A white skull. I opened the comic up and I was lost. I was consumed. Now, I imagine how life was, and everyone were moving around me in fast forward, while I was perfectly still, hanging on each unique word, forming the snappiest and wittiest dialogue that was so brutally cool and not trying to be edgy at all. It was a break from novels that I had read and was like traveling to outer space and learning the extraterrestrial material that was read. From the covers that immediately made me open the thirty-page comic or the glossy pages, that even had a divine smell, contained pure explosions of all kinds of colors! And there were even frames sequencing the events. But, loved this character with the skull. I wanted to-- and then my friend invaded the moment I was having. \"Great choice! The Punisher, so now that I know I kind of have a feel for you, I'll show you the rest of the comic series. That's the first issue by the artist.\" Then his father stepped in and crouched next to me looking at me. He showed me something that I'll never forget. It changed my life that day. Twenty-four comics were bought but only one was the one I was reading. It wasn't a world I walked into, when I came into the store, it was a universe. The comic was my world! I left it in total awe. On the ride back, I was explained by Wells son how lucky I was because I was about to embark on the best journey of my life. I had never read Alan Moore's work of comics such as The Joke, having to do with Batman and Jokers relationship and the great artist, Frank Miller who gave Batman his balls back. There were so many comics. He bought Watchmen for me, Sandcastle, V for Vendetta, and tons more. But, it was only the man with the skull I wanted to read about, and then read again and again. Eventually I was given every comic about him! I had over fifty comic books of the best the store carried, and it was just scratching the surface, he said. Little did I know it was all about to bite me in the butt. That night I started the one that intrigued me the most. I didn't sleep all night and my father opened my door to wake me up, but found me with all the comics around me, and me reading the last comic that was bought at the store under my table lamp. He was angry. He took all the comics and threw them out. My father told me no more comics were allowed again! It was like he took my whole world away that I discovered a day before and lived in for the next day and had thrived in. It defined me and gave me meaning. He took it all away. That day I didn't pay attention to what Mr. Wells taught me. He finally asked me what was wrong, and I told him what my father did. My mother was in the room and I saw him Iook at her before answering me. It's weird what the memory retains. That look stuck with me until I finally understood what in that moment it all meant. He told me that he would let me read them during breaks with him. He told me he had all the issues. I said of course you do! My mom smiled, I saw it from the corner of her face as she washed her hands. Again, I saw his eyes lingering on her. I smiled to. I guess my heart was ahead of my mind. But life's greatest journey is sixteen inches, from your heart to your head. Mr. Wells was a widower. His wife had died along with his kid. She died in a hit and run. I asked him how he felt, another fork fell, and he left for the moment while he was so clearly detailing it, but it was like he was somewhere else, there, somewhere with them, perhaps. He said he would find the person and make them beg for him to kill them. He said he was left with nothing in his life but revenge! I read in the Bible something about that, so I knew what he was referring to. My Mom dropped a plate in the kitchen, but I didn't hear it. I was still processing Wells words, but I saw him break from where ever he was and return. It was like my mom told him enough when the plate dropped and shattered. Two weeks later Mr. Wells and my father were in the driveway talking about my school progress. They whispered a lot. I tried to listen. I heard Mr. Wells tell my father that the commute to work must be a hassle. I wondered why they were talking about work. Then my father opened the garage. He never opened it! I was on the side of the house and heard my father ask Mr. Wells if he could fix it. I thought my father was referring to me. Maybe I was failing in my studies, but then I saw them staring at something. I looked and saw a dent on my father's car, but it was the way my father asked about fixing something. I guess I never noticed the dent before because he always left early and came home late \"due to the job\", he would put it. Mr. Wells bent down and put his hand on it as if he could feel something or someone. It was odd. My father didn't seem to think so, but I knew Mr. Wells more than he did. Wells then put his head down. I realized in that moment even then, that my father had hit his wife and kid. His whole life and love was taken away and what was left was an imprint of a dent. What I didn't know was what Mr. Wells said next. \"Sure. I'll let you drive my car for two weeks max, then when your car will seem brand new! How's that sound?\" My father nodded his head and shook his hand ,and Mr. Wells smiled with him. A smile they both shared, but a smile that was expressed for two entirely different reasons. When Monday came so did Mr. Wells. Again, he asked me what was wrong. He asked if there was something on my mind. So, being that it ate me up all weekend I asked him. \"I don't get it! If my father hit your wife and daughter, why would you help fix his car? He should be punished!\" He looked at me for a moment as if we were equals for the first time. It wasn't teacher looking down at a student, but for a fleeting moment he let me see him. He had a hint of a smile. His eyes though, were like a lava lamp of wisdom. \"I won't ever lie to you. Your father is a very bad man. He killed them. I thought it was an accident at the time, but I investigated it. After, I realized I still had something to live for, I knew your father had to answer for what he had done. For what he had taken from me! I found out it wasn't an accident as much as it was carelessness. I don't want to say anymore, but this. You don't need my help teaching you. You're highly intelligent. Why?\" He asked me. \"But, what does that mean?\" He then sighed and said told me back to studying. I heard a fork drop and realized my mother was in kitchen the whole time. While I was reading a comic book Mr. Wells gave to me, my mother came in. I tried hiding it. She told me not to bother, she was the one that told him I had finished the last issue. I was surprised. I still don't know how she knew what I was reading and that I had finished it. My mom was the most intelligent and intriguing person I met in my life. Mr. Wells wasn't intriguing. He was exactly what you thought. He didn't hide it. I found out how much of a genius he was, but he had one weakness, and that one thing prevented him from getting what he wanted. My Mom taught me that night how to play a game. She said I must treat life just like the game. If I mastered it I would always remain two steps ahead of everyone, well at least two steps ahead. As she continued to take my queen I increasingly became frustrated. I kept saying I stunk at the game. She said it's not about that. She taught me how important each move is, and the difference between the pieces. She showed me so many ways to protect my king. With each move she taught me something. Like the man in the garage, she connected a move with a situation to build something inside of me. Did you know that you can be taught instincts? I played defense for a few years until I finally mastered it. I learned every possible way to prevent an attack. Every which way in life to prepare for such a situation. Unfortunately, she never said who the person was, or I would have been better prepared and not disarmed by my instincts, but in hindsight, what she taught me was meant for something more. She came in one night and asked if I was ready for our first game? All along I thought we were playing. She told me she was teaching me, preparing me for the first time I played. She said her one goal was to put me in check mate, so I knew her approach was offense. I thought knowing everything about defense made me capable of defending against whatever offense was set my way to attack me. I ended up learning everything about offense. I had my pieces set and ready for all attacks. I knew all the scenarios of questions shed ask me. I had mastered my defense, so I knew she couldn't get through, in a couple of moves she had me compromised in check mate. Her offense was like an art. I begged her to teach me it because I had to learn it! I felt like I was half the player. I spent two years playing and I didn't know how to play. TO BE CONTINUED...

Wads of half-chewed food slide down my throat, courtesy of the local poverty buffet. I am Jack ' s struggling esophagus. \"Tastes like shit...\" Murmurs Marla with a cheek full of food. \"That's why it's so fucking cheap.\" I instantly finish her sentence. A variety of people attempt to enjoy the slop that was concocted hours earlier in the kitchen. An obese man sits by himself in a booth behind Marla. He has a thick novel open next to his plate. Spatters of food fall from his mouth, landing back on the plate and sprinkling the book. Light reflects off a shiny dribble of saliva from the corner of his mouth. A young couple in their mid-to-late twenties sits at a table near the buffet line. Between bites of food they talk about who-knows-what, with a small laugh peppered in the conversation. How fucking romantic . The restaurant smells of off-color meat products, marinated and cooked in a sauce consisting solely of cholesterol and MSG. It lingers in the stagnate air, like a cloud of radioactive gas, ready to poison whomever is luckiest to walk through the doors. At the buffet, a male employee wipes down the counter with a white cloth, of which is thoroughly covered in red and brown stains. He seems less than interested in his job as he takes a mushy tater tot and pops it into his mouth. Sneeze guards would be considered a luxury item at this establishment. The sneeze guard's lack of presence gives me a slight uneasiness about what germs, viruses, mucus, skin, and hair may be present in my food. Next to the door is a small sign in the corner of the window. On it is a large capital \"C\", assuming it is from the city's Department of Food and Wellness. The grade seems generous to me. I can slowly feel my waist expanding, putting an uncomfortable pressure on my pants. It feels as though the metal button is going to burst, sail through the air and land in someone's lukewarm tomato soup. \"I'll be back.\" I wipe my mouth with the top of my hand and head toward the bathroom. \"Marla quietly replies with little interest, \"Hmmhmm.\" She knows where I'm going. Crossing the much-to-oversized restaurant I approach the bathroom door. At the top of the brown wooden door, in black cursive letters, reads, \"Gentlemen.\" It's ironic that a C-grade eating establishment would find it acceptable to label the bathroom in such an elegant manner. The solid wood door requires actual effort to push open. Upon entering the bathroom, the lingering aroma of dried urinal cakes and recently evacuated buffet scraps overwhelms my senses. My eyes start to burn and my gag reflex kicks in. I am Jack ' s ascending bile pool . Two stained urinals hang on the wall to the left. On the right wall are two sinks with accompanying mirrors. Beside them are two toilets, one normal size, and the other much larger to accommodate the handicapped. The handicapped stall is occupied while the smaller one is open; the door half ajar. What is with people's love of the larger handicapped stalls? Is it cleaner compared to the other stalls? Or is it that people enjoy the spaciousness and like to sprawl out? It doesn't make sense. It's a fucking toilet, not a living room. Besides, if so many people have this mentality, then the handicapped stall would have to be twice as dirty as a regular stall. All logic is invalid in this argument. I digress. Upon entering the only empty stall, I lock the door behind me as I stare at the dilapidated toilet. Yellow drops of urine dot the seat and bowl. Apparently the previous occupant found it too inconvenient and unsanitary to lift the seat, however, found it perfectly fine to leave their piss on the seat. Again, I digress. With a handful of toilet paper so thin it seems transparent, I wipe the seat, throwing the soiled paper in the water, and flush, watching it swirl around, eventually disappearing from sight. My stall mate coughs, sniffs, and clears his throat, which reverberates against the tile walls of the restroom. I unzip my pants, letting my bloated stomach and intestines expand even further outward. The feeling is almost orgasmic. In a single fluid motion, the pants slide down to my knees as I take a seat on the porcelain throne. Almost immediately my bowels evacuate themselves into the bowl; Quick and slightly painful, yet satisfying. \"Yeah this place will do that to yah,\" says my toilet partner, unexpectedly. With an uncomfortable laugh, I breathe out, \"I guess so.\" A couple of minutes pass while I struggle to push out whatever remains of yesterday's cheap and most likely unhealthy meals. \"Hey buddy, mind sparing some shit paper, I'm out,\" asks the man next door. \"Yeah…sure,\" I reply. I pull a plentiful amount into my hand, hoping it would be enough that he won't ask again. Lowering my hand below the stall's divider, he grabs the paper from my hand. \"Thanks.\" During the split second it took him to take the paper, I noticed his hand was muscular and a rich tan color, appearing as though he doesn't spend much time indoors. His nails were trimmed short, bordered with what looked like dried blood. Most notably was a massive scar on the top of his hand. It looked like two lines of blisters, connected on both ends. Even after his hand disappears, I stare at the floor, memories flooding my head. No, it can ' t be … With quick haste I finish my \"business\", flush the toilet with my foot, shove the stall door open and head for the sink. Placing both my hands on the counter, I stare down at the stained porcelain bowl, searching for some sort of answer. Shaking my head I snap out of the trance and vigorously wash my hands, desperate to exit the bathroom. I hear the other toilet flush… he's done. Frantically, I grab a handful of brown paper towels from the dispenser and start rubbing my hands dry, stepping toward the door. \"Where do you think you're going, sweetheart?\" Immediately I recognize the voice. A drop of cold sweat rolls from my forehead, down my temple, and borders my jaw. Slowly I turn, and our eyes meet. He leans against the stall, arms crossed, and a small smirk across his lips. His clothes are a complete mismatch; Haggard, yet handsome in a rough sort of way. It's him… Tyler Durden.

On the third day, Tyler returned. Christ-like. (Although I'm pretty sure he wasn't quite so in-your-face about it.) Tyler returned – but how can you return to something you have never left? Heine argues that one event should always coincide with another, and that no one action is original; Nietzsche argues that time is like a grindstone, and reality its ever-grooving, ever-deepening depressions; I'm standing here in my dockers fishing for something witty to say – Tyler returned and said, \"You're looking well.\" One of the side effects of shooting yourself in the mouth is that you have to take a lot of your food ground up or boiled soft. The desire to eat hasn't returned to me since I left the Sanitarium... So what am I doing in the kitchen? \"I don't know,\" Tyler says, flung so heavily against the countertop that anyone would think he was drunk. But Tyler's been pretty docile lately, all things considered. I think the suicide scare must have fuddled his brain a little. Fuddled my brain a little. I am Joe's losing grip on reality. Sometimes Marla comes home. It is her apartment after all. She'll come home and we'll sit opposite each other on her falling-to-pieces lounge set. You never notice how loud cutlery is until you're stuck in a quiet room with a total stranger. Marla comes home, but not often, and right now is one of those often days. The days where I have Tyler all to myself. \"Let's go out,\" he says, slinging himself at me, ticking me under my ribs, \"Let's go dancing. Come on.\" He smells like weed. Or maybe I smell like weed and I'm just projecting it onto him, I don't know. \"Please Tyler,\" I say, \"I'm tired.\" \"You're always tired. Just go out with me, come on. I'll cheer you up.\" I'd like to say that I agree, and that I do go out with him, and we do go dancing. That I ignore the black-eyed service staff and somewhere between our fourth and fifth round of drinks realize that hey, maybe this isn't so bad. But I can't. And I don't. Instead, I slink back to the bedroom, and Tyler? Tyler doesn't follow me. In this, at least, we are agreed. I'd been worried about the money I would need to spend on my treatment once I got out, but the Sanitarium hasn't bothered to call. This isn't odd. Neither Marla nor I have paid our respective rent in months. Bills turn up mysteriously paid. Checks are made out to me and I don't know who they came from. I'd appreciate the gesture if I hadn't experienced first hand just how they are getting what they're giving me. My insurance agent, he nods to me from across his long desk, a thin streak of blood splitting the line from his nose to his chin. \"You no longer need to work. You have achieved what you have set out to do. You should feel happy but instead you just feel selfish.\" This is the Millennial Generation in a nutshell. \"Stop being so fucking moody,\" Tyler tells me. I shout that that's easy for him to say. That he's the adverse of me. He's happy, I'm sad. I'm happy, and Tyler... Tyler, you're something worse . I shout this and I slam the door, but then I'm standing on the footpath outside the house Paper Street. I don't know how I got here. This has been happening more and more lately. I ask Tyler if he's seen any Space Monkeys at all since I got out. \"No,\" he says, \"No one but you.\" I expect that's about to change, but when I push the hulking front door open the mansion is as empty as it was the day Tyler dumped me. As the day I found the bathtubs. \"Where is everyone?\" I ask. Tyler shrugs, spitting out a glob of tobacco. \"Gone,\" he says, \"Moved up in the world,\" and for some reason, this makes my heart ache for him. Tyler is not the sort of person people abandon, but they have. He's been left alone in enemy territory, without a compass or a map. But if I know Tyler, he'll make it work. I tear through the strips of police paper blocking the kitchen doorway. Tyler says not to bother. We've been cleared out. This refrigerator doesn't have any condiments to soften the blow. At my shoulder, Tyler's skin is sweaty and cold, so different to the hot, dry heat I usually associate with him. Tyler says that the point your skin starts to burn is not at the base of the fire, but several millimeters above it. I'd say this is why he's letting me top, but that would be a lie because of the present participle. I have no idea what Tyler would let me do, because Tyler and I stopped sleeping together around about the time I lost my job. Maybe I'd lost my usefulness too, so Tyler didn't thinking fucking me was necessary anymore. That that false sense of security could be taken away. Or maybe he found someone else. Who knows? I don't. I don't know much of anything anymore. I see my doctor – Dr. Teller – once a month so he can assess me. Mostly, these meetings go off without a hitch, and I'm left alone. Sometimes, they'll do tests. One night, the toilet won't flush and for a moment I think it's this elusive weed of Tyler's. The weed that always makes me nervous about my urine samples. Instead I discover that Tyler's been hiding zip-locked bags of cash in the filter tank. Tyler was an Eagle Scout. I never made it past Cubs. There's twenty thousand dollars in total, and when I ask him about it he shrugs and says, \"We might need it for something,\" but I don't think this is true. Tyler and I have fallen into what Chloe from Brain Cancer described as 'the first stages of death.' You get up in the morning, you eat breakfast, and that's... it. Domestic bliss. Giving it all over. So the money will dwindle and then eventually run out altogether, just like everything else on Paper Street. And I will finally, finally fall into the sweet embrace of death. \"You're starting to sound like Marla,\" Tyler says. \"Shut-up, you fucking druggie,\" I snap, and Tyler laughs and laughs and laughs like he did the first night I punched him. I wonder: was that it? Was that when I lost him forever? Or was it earlier? Think Ireland. Think Blarney Stone. How long have I been Tyler? How long has Tyler been me? These are the questions I ask myself late at night, in my blessedly quiet house on my blessedly quiet block. Nights where I know I'm not really asleep on my lumpy mattress, I just think I am. Sometimes Marla calls, though she doesn't visit. At first, Marla had been pissed that I'd just upped and left without so much as a word, but she's slowly come to accept that this is just part of my 'healing process.' Isolating myself from everyone and everything that ever got me put into the Sanitarium. Which is kind of ironic because technically being here is not at all beneficial to myself. Something Dr. Teller would have called a 'negative choice.' (See, in Dr. Teller's philosophy, people's lives are made up of positive and negative choices. The negative ones affect us negatively, and the positive ones affect us positively. These decisions lead us towards our goal in life. The Final Frontier. The Promised Land. The cosmic g-spot we have to finger until we hit our enlightened climax. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Amen. I can't help thinking of Chloe and her pornography). 'Self improvement is masturbation.' Does that make self-destruction the answer, or is it just sex? I know that what I have with Tyler won't last forever. That it's all part of some vicious cycle and that eventually he will leave me like his father left him, and his grandfather before that. He will leave me again and again and again. Sometime later, when the weed runs out and Tyler stops being so docile, he buys us two first class tickets to Idomeneo . (Meaning I buy us two first class tickets to Idomeneo .) I'd be surprised but, then, it's Tyler. I see more bruises than I do people as we're lead to our seats; the usher's face is like a modern art piece. Tyler likes theatres because they remind him of his old job with the Union, and of all the fancy banquet halls he used to work in. Dr. Teller says that we feel nostalgic for the pain we have overcome in the past. Too fucking right. When Tyler props his legs up on the seat in front of him I feel a sharp twist of panic in my gut. Is this me or is this him? It's him. He asks when they're going to roll the previews and I smile because Tyler really doesn't know much about opera. The part of me that knows about opera and poetry and folk music is the part of me I hate, so naturally the very concept of such things is nonexistent to him. Tyler won't stop wriggling around in his seat, humming and drumming his fingers like he's waiting for something. I start to wonder if this is a coup. When the fire alarm goes of during the interval, I know it's a coup, and suddenly Tyler's got me on my feet and he's saying, \"Oh boy oh boy oh boy,\" and jostling me towards the fire escape. The night air hits me like a steam train and I go flying across the rain-slick pavement. And Tyler's laughing, he's laughing, he's laughing… Lying there on the ground you think back to when he first kissed you. It had been after the acid burn but before Project Mayhem, when the sight of his lips on the back of your hand still made your stomach do somersaults, and all you could think was: I can't believe this is happening, I can't believe this is happening... Is this dream mine or is it Tyler's? You'd been behind the tank-stand, and you'd both been drunk, and maybe you'd used that as an excuse in the morning but he hadn't. He never apologized for anything. You'd both been drunk and Tyler, chuckling, had pressed you back against the cement foundation, making like he was reaching for something. Making like he was... like he was... patting you down? Well, that's one word for it. You'd both been drunk, and the look in his eye had been predatory, and maybe kissing wasn't so different to fighting. (There were other things that were even more similar, but they would come later). In that moment, it was just Tyler's hair under fingers, and Tyler's hands up your shirt. Tyler's tongue in your mouth. You suppose Tyler's tongue has always been in your mouth, one way or another. You just couldn't believe it was happening right then. So when Tyler offers you his hand, you take it, and when Tyler says, \"Let's go for pancakes,\" you say, \"Sure thing Tyler.\" Tyler says jump, you say, \"How high?\" We ate pancakes in the kitchen of a diner four blocks away, the cold metal table freezing my ass through my slacks. The pancakes were of the toaster-pop persuasion, underdone and rubbery, but this New Enlightened Me didn't mind. I asked Tyler what caused the alarm. He said it was anthrax. \"Does this mean you're back on the inside?\" I'd asked, but what I was really saying was, \" Please don't say this means you're back on the inside.\" To my relief, Tyler had shaken his head. \"No. No, this was just a little fun.\" He pauses. \"A sport fuck.\" \"Who'd you send the anthrax to?\" \"Lead actress,\" he replied, \"Ilia. Flat as a nine-year-old girl.\" \"Her voice or...?\" Tyler snorted. I snorted too. There's a certain pleasure that comes from dragging people who are, ultimately, happier than you are. At least Ilia seemed happy when she was with Idamante, which is more that I can attest to. I'm not Tyler's lover. I'm his failed experiment. A volcano at the elementary school science fête left dried up and sodden. A condom with a hole poked in the tip. Other metaphors Marla Singer would probably use. Dr. Teller thinks I have issues with self-loathing, but this isn't true. Me? I'm the vainest person in every room I walk into. Because who else can say they've fucked an idealized version of themselves? Not Tyler. Never Tyler. \"Anyone from The Brady Bunch , who would you fight? I'd fight Marcia.\" \"I never watched The Brady Bunch .\" He regards me from across the living area. \"Really?\" \"Yeah, really. I take it you did?\" \"Every episode.\" Now it's my turn to regard him. \" How? \" \"You remember Con Martinez?\" Con Martinez was a star player from my old high school lacrosse team; a guy who both awed and terrified me. \"What about him?\" Tyler waterfalls the smoke from his cigarette, eyes flashing in the darkness. \"You paid him fifty dollars for the box-set.\" \"I don't remember that.\" What I do remember is turning my room upside down looking for the money my grandparents gave me for my birthday that year; tearfully explaining to my mother and receiving thirty for being honest about it. \"I don't remember that at all,\" I murmur, and Tyler stares at me and murmurs back, \"I do.\" The prospect of travel is no longer appealing to you. In the grand scheme of it all, everything is the same, and nothing is original. You have experienced everything there is to experience. Sure, you've never tried three-hundred-year-old fermented skate fish, but you've tried tuna, and how different can the two really be? Every country has its problems. Tyler once told me that skinny guys are difficult to beat, that they fight till they're burger, so I suppose this is why I don't die when I throw myself in front of a car outside one of Project Mayhem's many company-owned coffee houses. As I lay there on the warm, sticky asphalt, I think of all those little yellow frogs and of the deforesting that these eco friendly drivers are trying to prevent. The frogs that can wave. I don't know what they're called. But this isn't a for real suicide. This is one of those cry-for-help things. Tyler is not in the least bit impressed. His bedside manner has never exactly been gentle, but now he's just being downright vicious. \"We found trace samples of an analgesic drug in your system,\" the doctor says, and I think, oh Tyler, you didn't, did you? \"There are some men here who need to ask you some questions.\" Tyler, you asshole. \"We think you might be putting yourself at risk.\" 'Suck my dick, Tyler,' I want to say, and he's laughing, laughing, laughing... I wet my lips. \"I have a doctor – Dr. Teller. He can set the record straight. I'm really very ill.\" \"We're going to give you some pills.\" \"But pills don't work for what I have.\" Think of the 1950s; all those women using the glow-in-the-dark makeup, the irradiated lipstick, eye-shadow. In the same way, I have Tyler. \"We're going to give you a sedative.\" I don't struggle as the needle slips under my skin. On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero. I accept the sweet embrace of death. When I get to Heaven, there's an angel looking down at me who says, \"Wake up, fuckface.\" But he's the fuckface, really. I prop myself up on my pillows and say, \"Oh, it's you,\" because that's the sort of thing you say in a situation like this. Angel Face looks nonplussed. He pulls me out of bed and hands me back my clothes. \"There's a car waiting round the front,\" he says, \"Be there or be square.\" And then he's gone. Behind me, Tyler is draping his arms over my shoulders. Behind me, Tyler is saying, \"He's a sweet kid, really.\" \"He's a fucking smug little shit.\" Tyler chuckles into my neck. \"You're still Mummy's favorite.\" \"I see someone's regained their sense of humor. What was it? Heroin?\" \"Fuck no! Who do you think I am?\" He rests his chin on my shoulder. \"I wouldn't do that to us.\" And we stand like that for a couple of minutes, listening to the various beeps and boops that so characterize Heaven. I think I hear somebody's life support give out. We watch as the nurses run by with their push trolleys. \"Any M*A*S*H character, who would you fight?\" He's silent for a long while, and I can tell he's thinking deeply, but in the end he doesn't answer. Instead he just says, \"Let's go home, man.\" We ran into Dr. Teller on the way out. I've never liked doctors, even since before the almost-cancer on my foot, but Dr. Teller is an okay guy. He asked me if I was okay, and I said, \"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.\" He asked if I was happy and the back of my palm itched. Tyler and I had stayed in that hospital ward for what seemed like the longest time, neither of us making to move. With my eyes closed, and the length of him pressed against me, I could almost believe that we were two separate people – he seemed so solid and real. He was waiting outside for me when I exited the hospital. No one tried to stop me, and when I passed through the foyer the security guard had winked at me. He was waiting outside for me and there was a black Sedan pulled up onto the footpath, Angel Face and two men I didn't recognize sitting inside. Dr. Teller asked me if I was happy and I said, \"No, not really,\" but when Tyler asks me if I'm ready to go I say, \"Sure thing.\" In this, at least, we are agreed. I remember kneeling in front of the fridge while Tyler explained about the life line, the love line; him holding my hand on his thigh and me thinking: maybe he's going to fuck me. But he hadn't, and I think the saddest thing is that, even after the chemical burn, I still wanted him to. We're somewhere outside Pittsburgh now and the light through the front windscreen is blazing white off of the dashboard. The indicator sounds with the hollow click of a magazine slotting into a gun and I don't know where we're headed, but we're turning... turning... turning... and Tyler? Tyler's just laughing. If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't. ","Summary":" If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.

I'm tightening his the contrasting black bow ties to the only thing in the entire house that's still real white. Everything else is stained with blood, with sweat, with deodorant, shit, vomit, semen stains. Whatever you can think of, it's gotten onto our clothes. Our shoes. Our walls. Our porno mags. My porno mags. When you don't even have the static of the pay-per-view porn you think you're too good to buy, you revert back to what our fathers, and what their fathers before us used. There was a stack of them in the house when I moved in. Cliches aside, the pages really were stuck together. Sometimes, when I'm washing my hands after I've jerked myself clean and added another addition to the inevitable UV light realization, I wonder just how much semen it takes to physically every page of a magazine together. How many times did whoever owned this godforsaken shithole open the same page to the same coy, shy, half-covered girl we're secretly convincing ourselves is virginal and pubescent? Twenty? Thirty? I wouldn't know. I try not to spend too long thinking about it. Tyler tells me one day, while I'm tightening his bowtie, he tells me that there's this tribe in Brazil of people the US hasn't messed with. White people haven't touched them, he says, staining the suit with the smell of cigarettes and unprocessed soap with every second he's still standing here. Inside of the shithole. He says they have these specially made mittens. Except he doesn't say mittens , he says gloves . These mittens hold the Paraponera clavata , he says. The bullet ants . They're the worst ants on the planet, according to Tyler, and men put the gloves on to prove they're really men-that they've really got the balls to do it. I say, that's pretty brave. He doesn't say anything. He just scoffs and leans over the last batch of soap. We made it this morning, with the rest of Marla's mom that was in the freezer. It's setting up nicely. Pale lavender, crusty at the outer edges with cold process veins. When you make soap, you can make it two ways. The lye in soap stays active until you either let it dissipate or you burn it out. Cold process is the former. Hot process is the latter. Cold process makes a nicer looking bar, Tyler says, even if it takes six weeks to cure. When you make hot process soap you can use it once it sets up, but it smells like a rotting animal in your house for days, and days, and days. Tyler says, the first time they do it is just a test. I think about the scar on my hand while he keeps talking. They do it more times, he says, until the elders of the village are satisfied with his physical sacrifice. Like the guy that crucifies himself every year and god. How many times, I ask. Twenty. Thirty. He shrugs his shoulders. When we get home from work, I'm thinking about the bullet ants. I'm undoing his bowtie and setting it aside in my laundry basket. Sometimes, I wonder if he knows how to do anything but crumple it up after he pulls it off. He's checking at the edges of the soap, poking the silicone mold to see if it's set up. He lets me take his shoes, so they don't get scuffs in them. Or lye. Or blood. Sweat. Shit. Vomit. Semen. The thing about the bullet ants, he says, is that they don't just make you hurt for a minute or an hour or a day. If you have them biting you for ten minutes, you'll shake for a week. But they still do it. Twenty times. Thirty times. I listen, standing there, holding his bowtie, holding his shoes, waiting for the grand point. He doesn't say anything. I set his shoes by the door.

He catches me off guard while I'm brushing my teeth by the kitchen sink and whispers in my ear that he was waiting. With my toothbrush in my mouth, I ask, for what? \"For a better moment,\" he says and leans his chin on my shoulder. Even after all this time, Tyler's company feels more natural than Marla's. And I love Marla. Much like i once I loved Tyler. Can you move your head off, I say. I have to rinse my mouth. He chuckles and the noise reverberates inside my head. Tyler takes a step back to assess the kitchen. He asks me if I ever went back to IKEA since the day he- well, I blew my condo up. \"I got myself another yin yang coffee table,\" I admit as I clean the toothpaste off my face with the running water. When I'm finished, Tyler turns off the faucet for me. \"Do you miss the old place? I really do,\" he says, right next to me. \"That smell of gas and those broken windows find a special place in your heart and never leave.\" If you don't want to hurt me, why are you here, I ask him instead. He is completely taken aback. He blinks a few times before a large grin makes its way onto his lips. I think of the scar on my hand for a split second. \"You remembered to cut the foreplay this time around,\" he laughs. Then, \"I'm here because I want to make a truce.\" I stop to consider this for a moment. Tyler Durden and truces did not rightfully belong in the same sentence. The combination of the two itself was a solid freak of nature. That's very uncharacteristic of you, I say. \"I haven't changed,\" Tyler says. \"I just realized I've become bored with organized chaos.\" Has death made a bigger philosopher out of you, I ask with utter lack of surprise. \"I never really died. I only faced a setback in my inevitable cycle of evolution. Through utter destruction I have been able to make it this far. For that, I want to thank you. Seems like your bullet in my head was a blessing in disguise.\" Tyler then puts his hands around my shoulders affectionately. Somehow this too feels more natural than when I'm with Marla. My eyes shift away from his. I am Jack's Nausea. \"Should I feel happy for you,\" I say. \"No. With this newfound understanding, I decided I want a truce,\" Tyler continues without missing a beat. His arms become heavy by my neck, which is ironic, because he isn't real. I shake my head. \"I don't want to become a justification for the rebirth of Project Mayhem,\" I say. Tyler sighs. No, no no, he says. \"This isn't at all about Project Mayhem. Fuck,\" he says. \"It's not even about the Fight Club anymore.\" I shift my gaze back onto him. \"It's not?\" I ask. \"Well, not really. Look,\" Suddenly, Tyler leans in close and his forehead bumps against mine. \"My proposal,\" he says, \"is that you trust me once again. I've been away for a while. I want you to give me a second chance.\" I scoff. Tyler's hand holds my head against his. \"Like I said, I don't want to hurt you. It's not about that anymore.\" I catch myself thinking: Tyler Durden's middle name should be Pain. Pain in the ass. \"How is trusting you a truce? It works only to your advantage,\" I say. \"Then let's call it a compromise. And in return, I won't commit crimes under our name.\" \"Your name,\" \"Our name.\" His hold against my head tightens. I don't feel scared. I don't think I want to feel scared. \"I won't accept,\" I say. Tyler steps in. There is no negative space left between us now. Our noses brush the other's. This is too close for comfort, obviously. But Tyler is me, and I am Tyler. I have no excuse. \"How many people can you say have been fucking shot through the head and lived to talk about it?\" Tyler laughs. His breath smells like mine -a minty toothpaste. \"No one, except for me. I want to teach you what I've seen at the other side, man! I can show you a whole different perspective to life as you know it, but you have to trust me back into your life.\" I tell him nope. No, thank you very much, but I don't want any of this Resurrection bullshit involvement in my life anymore. \"Is that your final answer? This is the proposal of a lifetime,\" he tells me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not interested at this point in time, I groan. Ever since I shot Tyler in the head, it's as if he needed permission to regain his control over half of my life like he used to. Sometimes he hangs around me like a ghost. I wonder if that's what he's truly become: no longer part of me, but a separate entity altogether, trying to reattach itself to its original source. i realize this isn't about what he's trying to teach me, or any of that crap. These are all trick questions to allow himself back to me. Tyler Durden doesn't want to educate me, or be my friend. He wants to regain ownership. The epiphany strikes me like a slap, and my stomach churns. I correct myself: Tyler Durden and altruism do not rightfully belong in the same sentence. \"You'll be missing out,\" he pouts. \"I'm tired,\" I say. Tyler Durden hums. Then he removes his hand from the back of my head and lets it explore the space between my clavicle and my navel. I won't be too happy if Marla walks in on us, I say. \"She can't see me, remember? Only you.\" I nod offhandedly. Tyler gives me a little peck on the cheek and in a minute I am Jack's minor panic attack. \"What was that all about?\" I ask. I step away from Tyler and crash into the counter. \"Affection,\" Tyler responds coolly. \"Consider this a warning. I'll be coming back later.\" Suddenly I blink and Tyler is gone. He is like a glitch in my life: temporarily bothersome but otherwise imperceptible, and part of the system. I know the glitch will turn into a virus. I know this because Tyler has decided this. I've already shot myself once to get rid of him. Now that he's returned, I must admit, I don't know what to do. Hello! It's been a while! I just wanted to add that this story probably has no plot and makes little to no sense. Please forgive any spelling/grammar mistakes. I did try to emulate Chuck Palahniuk's writing style a little bit, but I don't think I'm at that level to get it right so quickly.

As much as I squirm and wriggle, I've got no way of out of these guys' grips, their hands all clammy and calloused from working on whatever crazy kind of terrorist act they've been so hard at work on. When we would reach the top floor, they'd let go of me immediately, and I have no idea why they would at first. I sooth the sore spots on my arms from where those creepy bastards manhandled me. I would turn around and yell any number of insults at those guys as they hurtle back down the stairs in a strange, silent panic, but something else had struck me as more important- the cold stare of a man hidden by the blue-grey camouflage of the night as it seeps through the windows. It becomes the cold stare of a man that is gradually illuminated by the slight moonlight as it shoves aside dark clouds. It's him, that guy, with a pool of blood beside his neck that looks black in the low light. Well, at least he doesn't have to live with the huge pile of issues he had now. I slowly walk in closer, making myself oblivious to the horrid stench of death, and strangely, his eyes seem to have a small glint of light from the moon. They're gazing at me…I think. I tried to forget our time together previously, pushing aside his greediness and neediness and his confusing, messed-up head and the way he liked to be one person one day, and another the next, the indecisive asshole that he was- but I guess he made me feel like I may have been…worth something? Could I have been worth something? I guess so. When he wasn't fooling around, when we had our small moments of intimacy- if you could even call it intimacy- made me feel a little like somebody wanted me in their life. Hell, he even came to see me when I'd thought it was all over. Keeping an eye on the doses was something I'd only seen importance in after I'd met him. Burning glows of flames explode from the high-rise buildings just across the street. Normally I would have screamed, but I don't this time; I just stare into it for a little while. It's actually kinda beautiful. I sit down and watch them as they look so bright in the night. Down they come, collapsing in a neat, dusty pile. What a shame. I hold onto his palm, digging my fingers into the cold flesh and tightening my palms around it to warm it. He would have done the same for me, probably. I think I'm gonna miss him, but I have no time to be dwelling too much on him. He's made me wonder if I'd be of any worth to anyone else. If he'd given it a try with me, I didn't see why there wasn't one more guy out there that would. Author note: This was quite difficult, but fun practice. When I saw it, I automatically considered the ending I thought was going to happen- that Jack would die, and that Tyler would die with him, and I wondered what Marla's reaction may have been. I found her voice very hard to write, and I just hope I got this somewhat right. Also, for fandomblind readers, a small bit of canon- 'my eyes are open' is the line Jack says before shooting himself in the film. Thanks for reading! ","Summary":" DISCLAIMER: I do not own Fight Club or any of its characters. I do not own the cover image. THE CHA"},{"Movie":"Fight Club","Title":"Against Current","Author":"Song of Grey Lemons","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9836781","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Note: Set in the film universe, after the closing scene, though I attempted to reflect the book's depictions of the characters. Apparently, this is what happens when I read Fight Club while in St. Petersburg. Most information about the city is true - yes, there are statues of lions everywhere - and Lena's Russian was done by yours truly. Finally, a large virtual cookie goes to Tomazine, for the beta and the birthday. -Lem Against .Current From this height, nothing seems real. Through the oval of the airplane window, everything is so distant, a copy of a copy of a copy. The cotton candy clouds, the little Lego buildings, the cars like ants, crawling down motorways. Weird. The really funny thing is, all I can think about is this is where I met him. Somewhere, up in the air, in the clouds. Marla taps me on the shoulder. She's looking at the safety card, with the blank-faced Hindu cow people. \"If they're all gonna die, why're they so… calm?\" she says. And I want to laugh, because, for a second, the person next to me isn't Marla. It's Tyler, who once told me his theory about the oxygen masks drugging passengers into a calm trance. Tyler, with his blond hair and strong jaw lines and garish Hawaiian shirts. Tyler, Tyler, Tyler. I force myself to keep breathing, swallow hard. I can feel my ears popping from the pressure change. No clue, I say to Marla, as I watch the clouds float by. X I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see him, smiling, leering. Tyler, Tyler, Tyler. My eyes are burning from dryness, my head is swimming. I try to focus on something else, anything else. I think about Marla's dead great-aunt, the one that left all of her money and property to Marla despite never having met her, her reasoning being that everyone she'd ever met had annoyed the hell out of her and that Marla was probably absolutely lovely. Apparently, Marla's whole family is crazy. Not that I'm complaining about the money. Plane tickets and a life in Europe are expensive, and my own account was a total mess after Tyler – no. Stop. Don't think about Tyler. Whatever you do, don't think about Tyler. Sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating, like there's not enough room in my head for the two of us. I feel the weight of Marla's head drop onto my shoulder, feel her even breathing against my neck. Out like a light. I raise my hand and tangle my fingers in her soft hair. I've read articles about therapy animals – pet their fur, and your soaring blood pressure lowers, your pulse drops, you fall asleep easier. Seems fitting, somehow – Marla, my power animal. I hardly notice the flight attendant as she approaches, pushing her trolley of disgusting packaged meals in front of her. She's all smiles and cheerful nodding, a caricature of a person. I can see her eyes flicker with horror at the still-healing wound in the side of my face, but then the cartoon smile is back, like some sort of clown mask. \"Pasta, or chicken casserole?\" she asks. The light glints off both her teeth and the tin foil coverings of the dishes. Casserole, I say. As always, the chicken will feel like rubber on my tongue and the carrots will have cooked down to a mush. I'll probably only eat the roll, anyway. \"And for your girlfriend?\" She's not –, I start to say, but cut myself off. Marla nuzzles into the place where my shoulder meets my neck. She'll have the pasta. X We end up in Strasbourg, a quaint little French town, with its rows of houses with the wooden beams showing and flowerbeds under the windows. We rent a room at a tiny motel for two weeks, which we spend wandering the narrow alleyways and eating too many pastries. Marla soaks up the language like a sponge; I don't bother getting past 'hello' and 'goodbye'. I hated French in school, and wound up taking German, instead. We stay until I avoid the hotel's pink soap bars like the plague and Marla finds a bottle of lye drain cleaner under the sink and refuses to go anywhere near it. After that, there's an attic room in Prague. Marla gets up at an ungodly hour each morning when she thinks I'm sleeping and wanders out to the Karlov Bridge. The stars fade from the sky as she watches, and then she slips back into our temporary little home and pretends she never left. I don't mention it, but I think she knows I know – I rarely sleep these days. We only stay until the numbness the change brings with it wears off, until the past catches up to us, and then we're grabbing train tickets and leaving without warning. I insist on Germany so I can finally be better than Marla at a language, for once. We walk the streets of Heidelberg in the nighttime and she forces me to interpret all of the signs until I give up and admit that my schoolboy German is dead. \"Told you so,\" she says, her lips curving into a smirk. Yeah, yeah, Marla. Rub it in. When the lights in the windows and the castle on the hill stop being enough, it's on to Denmark. We stand for half an hour under a lighthouse. The clouds race by on the strong sea wind, and the tower looks like it's tilting in contrast to them. Sometimes, we can't decide where to go next. The property Marla's crazy relative left her in the will sells itself. For the first time in our lives, money's no object. I want Belgium, Marla wants the Netherlands. We both want Finland, with a cabin in the forest and a dark, deep lake that reflects the sky. We never stay long – two weeks, or for however long we can bear it. We count on the novelty of it all to hold back the ghosts, and when that crumbles, we're off again, because only in death - and maybe Europe - are we no longer part of Project Mayhem. And we never hold still. We never stop running. Until, suddenly, we do. X It's getting late, and the lake is reflecting the colours of a sunset. Marla is sitting on the edge of the little boat dock, dangling her feet in the water, and little ripples spread in all directions. Marla. \"I was just thinking,\" she says, \"I think I could… I could learn to like this.\" She tilts her head back, settling back on her elbows. Actually, I was considering Russia, next, I say. St. Petersburg, and then maybe – \"Why?\" asks Marla. \"Why right now?\" Everything, I say. All the things we've tried to get away from. \"Is it – I mean, he's not back, or – or is –? Why the fuck didn't you tell –?\" No, I say. No, he's not back, because he never really left. He's dead, but his memory, everything he used me for – that's never gonna go, Marla. Tyler used to have half of my time, only the part when I was asleep. Now, his ghost has it all. \"God,\" says Marla. Her lips twist into a wistful little not-quite-smile. \"You were so in love with him, weren't you?\" She doesn't bother with giving me time to respond. Just as well, I'd have no clue how to answer. She pulls her feet from the water. \"Can we… Can we just try? Just a little longer, somewhere – I don't care where, but I want to stay still for a little,\" Marla says. The wood under her feet is becoming darker, soaking up the water that drips down from them. \"We're never gonna outrun him. I wanna see if maybe we can just face him, instead of…\" She doesn't need to finish, I already know. Because Marla's right. He'll always catch up. One day, we'll have to stop running, whether it's the money running out or an accident or anything at all, really, and it's always best to be able to choose your time to face any unpleasant situation. Your time to go. God, that sounds morbid. Not here, I say. We've already had too much time, here. \"Fine, sure. How does Russia sound? Rent an apartment for a month,\" Marla tells me. I glance up. The faint form of the moon is floating overhead. Yeah, I say. Yeah, I could learn to like that. X \"…And you have… nice view… from bedroom window,\" says Anton, in broken English thick with an accent that hardens his consonants and strains his vowels. He fiddles awkwardly with his shirt cuff. \"So, you… you want to rent?\" Yeah, we do, I tell him. \"How long?\" The people one floor under us have Shostakovich's Waltz No. 2 blasting at full volume, and the louder strains rise up through the floorboards. \"A month,\" says Marla. The refrigerator hums. Anton, still fidgeting with a pen, names a price. Marla's eyes bug out. \"What?! That much, for this –?\" I elbow her sharply in the ribs. \"Ow! What was that –?\" Marla. Rubles. Different currency. \"Oh,\" she says, rubbing her side. To a rather stunned-looking Anton, I say, yeah, fine, we'll take that. The lacy curtains breathe with the breeze from the open window, rustling softly. I pull out my wallet, dig through the euros and dollars, and finally pull out the money I painstakingly took from Marla's inheritance account, using a Russian-language-only ATM at the train station. I press the bills into his clammy hands. \"Thank you,\" he says. I'm getting the impression that this place doesn't get many tenants. \"You have my telephone, if you need me?\" I nod, fish a card with his number out from my wallet to show him. \"Yes, good,\" he says. We stand for a moment in uncomfortable silence. Then: \"I should go, now. Good-bye,\" says Anton. \"Bye,\" says Marla, waving as he slips out the door. A beam of light from the hall sweeps across the yellowing linoleum as it closes behind him. The ceiling light over the tiny kitchen-slash-dining-slash-sitting room buzzes with the electrical charge. A green wire pokes out from one side of it. \"I want to check out that view he mentioned,\" Marla says, kicking off her flip-flops and padding, barefoot, into the bedroom. I set our two small suitcases against a wall and follow her in. She's pushed the window open and stand on tiptoe, leaning out the window and looking out. So? I call. How's the view? Marla pulls her head back to look at me. Her wild hair is sticking out in all directions. \"Have a look,\" she says. Without opening the window, all that's visible is a red, scruffy-looking wall of the building opposite. She shifts to the side to make room for me, and I crane my neck and lean out the window. It is beginning to drizzle, and the wind is blowing the drops into my eyes. The street opposite is lined with old houses, the paint chipping and fading from their facades. The pavement is cracked and dark from the rain. The sky is layered grey. Well, I say, there is a view. She laughs, flops down onto the bed. Her hair splays out, framing her face. The springs creak. Do you want the bed, I ask, or the sofa? Marla arches an eyebrow at me. \"Bed, definitely,\" she says. \"Only a lunatic could possibly want the sofa.\" Hey, be nice to it, I point out, it's apparently my sofa, thanks to you. \"Yeah, but you don't want it. I'm forcing you to sleep there. There's a difference,\" Marla says. I sit down next to her. You okay with this place? I ask. \"Yeah. No worse that 8G, anyway,\" she says. \"And definitely not worse than Paper Street.\" Paper Street, with its leaky pipes and peeling walls and broken everything. With its space monkeys, crawling over it. With Tyler. It's difficult to be worse than Paper Street, I say. The rain pours harder. X I drift in and out of a light, dreamless sleep. I'm jerked awake by various noises – a cat screeching next door, a violin concerto from downstairs, the sound of the rain. Every time I open my eyes, I think, am I still here, on a sofa in this two-room apartment, or am I somewhere else, sometime else, someone else? Next time I wake up, will I still be me? I keep looking at my watch – how long have I slept? An hour? A day? How much damage has he managed to do? It's rarely more than ten minutes. The light is already streaming in through the lace curtains by the time Marla wanders into the room, barefoot and wearing an over-sized shirt. Sleep okay? I ask. \"Well enough,\" she says, covering a yawn with her hand. She looks me over. \"Did you at least sleep?\" A little. \"A little, as in, not nearly enough?\" she clarifies. Pretty much. She shakes her head, opens her mouth to speak, then closes it and starts rummaging through our cabinets. \"Could've at least left us some cereal,\" she complains, moving aside dishes in hopes of finding something. \"Empty.\" I say, there's a low-price grocery store two streets down. \"Well. Get changed, then,\" says Marla, and vanishes back into her room. X We're sitting at our tiny dining table, scraping the remains of our yogurts from their cartons. Marla's wearing a bizarre, scarlet dress printed with little white daisy-looking things that she picked up at a second-hand store a while back and her hair is sticking out every-which-way. Bach is blasting up from underneath us. \"I wonder what sort of person lives there,\" says Marla. A very musical person, I say, who has no regard for the sanity of their neighbors. Marla laughs, and gets up to throw away her carton. The refrigerator starts up its odd humming again. \"Still beats Mrs. Bishop's top-volume knitting shows from back…\" Marla begins, but stops short. \"I… I keep wanting to say home, you know? But it's not anymore. Not sure it ever was.\" She shrugs. \"It's just got, I don't know, sentimental value, or something. I mean, it's where I overdosed on Xanax. That's gotta mean something, right?\" That's Marla for you. She takes my container, and chucks that away, too. The refrigerator stops humming, and the room is silent for all of five seconds, when there is a knock at our door. Marla throws a questioning look over her shoulder at me as she goes to answer it, and I get up and follow her. The woman standing behind our door is holding a cat. A huge, fluffy cat – Maine Coon, probably. The cat opens one eye, yawns, and meows at Marla before wriggling out of the woman's arms and landing on the floor with a thud. \"Здравствуйте,\" she says, smiling. She's older than us – forty-five, at a guess. She's barely over five foot, thin, all bones and sharp angles. Her blondish hair rivals that of her cat in fluffiness. \"Можно зайти?\" The cat darts past Marla and sits in front of me, casually licking one paw. \"Здра-вствуй-те,\" Marla sounds out in response. He-llo . \"Um…\" She looks to me for help, and shrug. You're on your own, Marla . The fluffy-haired woman seems to have caught on, though. \"Not Russian?\" she asks. Her accent is lighter than Anton's. \"From… England?\" \"America,\" Marla says. \"Tourists?\" Of a sort, I say. Travelers, at least. \"Ah,\" she says. \"Can I… come inside?\" The cat curls up against my shoe. And that was how we met Lena Volkova. X Let me tell you a bit about Lena. Lots of what I could tell you about her involves 'was' and 'could have been' – which, Lena thinks, are the two saddest phrases in any language. Lena was a photographer, but most of her photographs never got sold and wound up in cheap frames all over her apartment. When Lena was a child, she studied at an English school, where they taught her the language. Unlike my German – or lack thereof – it hasn't fallen completely into disrepair. She used to lead tours in English, to make a bit of pocket money. Lena used to be beautiful. There was a time when the prominent cheekbones were rosy and the spaces under them were less hollow, maybe even a time when her hair was combed and carefully managed, not ignored or clumsily piled. At one point, Lena didn't even have a limp. Lena was a sister. A daughter. A girlfriend. A lot of things. Lena could have been happy, loved. She could have built a life for herself, a good distance away from this building with peeling walls and leaky pipes. The reason Lena's story doesn't involve 'is' is because Lena isn't , but I can throw in a few 'is'-s to keep you happy. Where our apartment screams with noise, Lena's is dead silent. The empty, lifeless space eats at her. It's hollowed Lena out. To mask the quiet, Lena fills her space with life. There's a jungle of potted plants, a huge tank of guppies and goldfish, and a huge cat named Napoleon. After the cake, not the French emperor. She's taken to talking to it all – the cat, the fish, even the plants. She rarely talks to any humans. She has a limp from a car accident ten years ago. Lena lives off of tea, biscuits, and canned vegetables. Her only income is from a few photographs sold to magazines yearly, accident compensation, and the remnants of the money her wealthy fiancée left her with twenty years ago. She rarely leaves her apartment. The reason there is no 'is' for Lena is because she isn't. The shell of Lena Volkova continues to function, but don't confuse that with being alive. X I think I haven't slept in three days. Maybe I have, and I can't remember. The dark circles under my eyes give me a deranged panda look. Every morning, when I open my eyes that I might not have closed at all, the light is too bright. The usual thrill of a new city is absent. \"I wanna go out, look around,\" says Marla. \"There's a whole city out there, and we've been sitting here for three days.\" Maybe that's my problem. Marla, it's raining. \"So? Lena says it's always raining or cloudy. Get used to it.\" Marla – \"I'm going out whether you're coming or not.\" She crosses her arms over her chest. I need fresh air, or maybe coffee. Okay, yeah, fine, I'm coming, give me a sec. She smirks. I realize there's not enough coffee in the whole world. The metro is crowded when it rains – forget about sitting, there's not enough room to breathe. The metal bars we hold onto as the car lurches are clammy from too many human hands. Marla insists on getting out at every stop and wandering through the underground palace. This is nothing like the New York subway. This place is gorgeous, like it should be a museum or something and not a public transport system. The river of people parts around us. Chattering in an unfamiliar language, hurrying past. People. Thousands of stories, all around me. A guy with a little girl clinging to his leg who keeps looking at his watch in exasperation. A pair of teen girls with their joined hands swinging back and forth in between them. Marla. \"What?\" I need to get out of here. \"Here, specifically, or the city? Because, remember, you said –\" Here, as in the metro. Here, as in this can of sardine-people, packed in tight. Here, as in here , here. \"Jesus, I get it! C'mon, the escalator's that way.\" We stumble out into the rain. The wheels of the moving cars kick up a spray of water from the puddles. The sky hangs low, here, lower than back home. The clouds are stacked in layers. It is always grey. The pavement is always wet. The puddles stand still. So, where the hell are we? \"Want to find out?\" Marla extends a hand. Just like last time, and yet nothing like last time. I feel my breath hitch, look around, but there are no stars in the sky, no collapsing buildings. Tyler isn't here. My face is not being shredded by a bullet. There is only a scar, tight and uncomfortable, on my skin. Yeah, I say. Let's. Marla throws my umbrella at me, laughing as I fumble around with it. Thanks, Mar. \"Any time.\" It's August, but cold. The rain splatters on my face. It feels like snow. Marla and I wander along the street, pointing out souvenirs in the windows – we rarely buy things like that; we have nowhere to take them. The rain and wind are picking up, changing direction and trying to snap my umbrella. I allow Marla to drag me in to a sweets shop. The air smells of chocolate and cotton candy. We sit, order a coffee each. Marla twirls her hair in her fingers. I can tell she's dying for a cigarette from the way her hand jerks around. \"How are you?\" she asks. What? I've been talking to you all day, why are you –? \"No. I'm just… okay, you know what? Never mind.\" Ah. It's about what happened. About whether I'm coping. I'm fine, I say. \"You're sure?\" Marla's fingers hold a pen the way they would a cigarette. Yes, I'm sure. \"Completely sure? 'Cause, you know, if you're not –\" Marla. If I stop being fine, I'll tell you. \"I'm holding you to that,\" she says, just as someone brings out our coffees. I inhale deeply. Smells clean. Marla quirks an eyebrow, says, \"See, that's what I'm –\" I promise I'll tell you. Okay? I promise. \"That's three times you promised.\" The cup feels warm against my fingers, and I can't for the life of me remember where I heard those words before. X It's been a week, and I've hardly slept. Have you ever tried to move underwater? You know how your legs feel like lead, how, no matter how hard you try, you're moving in slow motion? You know that feeling, like when you open your eyes and it's all blurry and there's chlorine everywhere and you can see the bubbles of your breath? And your ears pop from the pressure of the water over your head? That, right there, is the feeling of insomnia. Yeah. Welcome to my life. I mean, sure, it could be worse. It's been worse, and I know that it will be worse. And that's my problem – it's the anticipation, the certainty of the coming deterioration, that keeps me up all night, thinking, am I asleep? Have I slept? If Marla notices the darkening bags under my eyes, she says nothing. We move around as much as we can in the city. Museum after museum, palace after palace. Marla jokes that we've practically moved into the cheaper ones. It rains and rains. We sometimes see patches of soft blue of sunrise orange or maybe a star or two at night between the heavy clouds. But never for long. X I've been out. Just walking, looking around. Getting drenched. Marla! I call. Marla, I'm back. There's no answer. I take my shoes off, leave them by the door next to hers. Both pairs are wet – she's been out. Marla? \"I'm in my room.\" She is. She's standing on tiptoe, elbows on the windowsill. The rain falls sideways. Her wet hair has plastered itself to her forehead. What's happened? \"Nothing,\" says Marla. Brushes it off. Nothing's happened, why on earth would you ask? Marla. \"I called my mother,\" she says. Her breath condenses on the wet glass of the half-opened window. \"Today. Found a public phone, and called her. And, you know what's really funny?\" she says. \"She asked me where we'd been, what cool, foreign-y stuff we'd seen, and you know what? I didn't know how to answer. 'Cause what the hell do you tell someone who's never been out of the mid-Atlantic? Who's never spoken another language, who's never gonna see… Who thinks foreign-y is a good description of every other country out there?\" I don't speak. Marla's lower lip is jerking, just a bit. \"And it's weird, 'cause that was me , just a few months ago. That was you , before… before everything,\" she says. I know, I say. If none of that had happened, where would we be? Without Tyler, we would have nothing. It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything . Those are not my words. What did you tell her? I ask. \"That we'd seen castles and forests and things she wouldn't believe, and she asked me if I was alright with it. Never settling down. Not having a home. And I said, sure. I'm happy.\" I look at Marla. I ask, And are you? \"I dunno. I'm not always sure, but… I'm okay. I'll be okay,\" she answers. Holds out her hand. Good, I say, and take it. X The owl-shaped clock on Lena's wall ticks loudly, accenting every fifth beat. The pendulum-slash-tail swings leisurely back and forth. We are drinking tea out of her old cups, their rims chipped and uneven like teeth. A piece of pink or blue gone, replaced by the default white. This is Lena's world. The aloe plant under the clock is too large for its small pot. The cactus on the kitchen counter is tilted to the side. The huge aquarium on the coffee table by the wall is teeming with goldfish and guppies that swim in circles. A few of the swim relentlessly against the current of the filter, moving, but going nowhere – like a hamster in a wheel. \"St. Petersburg, it is… city of lions,\" says Lena. \"I did photographs for souvenir book of them.\" The funny thing about Lena's English is that she sometimes leaves out the little words – 'the'-s and 'a'-s. Russian doesn't seem to have them. She pushes herself to her feet, leaning on the armrest of her chair, her bad leg sliding out a little bit, and picks the book out from her shelf. Every page has a photo of a lion statue in the rain, or against the backdrop of a cloudy St. Petersburg sky and a brief description of said lion's location in the city. \"This one,\" says Lena, indicating a pensive-looking lion's head on an elaborately decorated door, \"is in Hermitage Museum. Getting permission to take it…\" She laughs, plopping back onto her chair. Napoleon jumps into her lap and curls up, looking like an excessively furry blanket. \"My lion,\" she says. He purrs against her stomach. \"So,\" Lena says. \"Where are you from?\" America, I say. \"From which city? State?\" Lena's ankles have sharp, prominent bones on either side of the joints. I stiffen, trying to block out the images of the crumbling buildings of a city I was from, once. A city we – I – destroyed. I feel Marla's hand on my arm. \"Doesn't matter,\" she says. \"Not from there, not anymore. We left.\" No, I think to myself, gripping the cracked china a little too tightly. No. We didn't just leave. We ran, and refused to look back. I focus on the warmth of Marla's touch and drown myself in Lena's soft accent. X The wire is green. Jesus, why green? I could deal with blue, even maybe learn to deal with, say, red, but green. Paraffin and nitro, detonation in ten minutes, don't pull the green wire. Anything but green. Those are not my words. I'm underwater, the insomnia feeling, but it's not the same. It's not numb, it's like a scratched CD, playing on loop in my head. I'm drowning in memories I've tried to bleach from my brain. Get me out, Tyler. Give me your hand, with the scar of your puckered lips across the back. Why does the wire poking out from the ceiling light have to be green? I'm breathing through my mouth. There's not enough space in this crumbling apartment, not enough room for two and a ghost. Three minutes, gun in my mouth. Wrong city, wrong country, wrong side of the ocean. Tyler, honey, get out. Light fixture, green wire, mixing nitro and paraffin. Are those my words? Tyler, Tyler, I love you, get out. I might be breathing through my mouth. I might not be breathing at all. The scar on the side of my face is uncomfortably tight, pulling at the edges of my skin. I can hear someone calling my name; there's an element of fear in her voice. Marla. Marla, the one who loved the both of us. Poor, crazy Marla. Marla, it's green. \"Yes, it's green, you idiot,\" she says. \"You – You promised me.\" I'm fine. \"You're having a meltdown. You're not fine ! You are nowhere near fine!\" I'm drowning. I feel like, if I breathe, I'll end up with a mouthful of water. My cheek suddenly stings in the shape of Marla's hand. I gasp. No water. I'm not drowning. I touch the spot, zero in on the pain. I am not underwater. I am not on top of a building. I am standing in a kitchen, staring at a light fixture, and having a long-overdue breakdown. I look at Marla as I feel my breathing even out. Her huge doe eyes are round, scared. She looks close to tears, her chest rising and falling. I feel a pang of guilt. Marla. \"No. Please. Don't… just don't.\" She sucks in a breath. \"I… I don't know anything anymore.\" I know. I – \"I need to think. I need some air, preferably polluted with nicotine,\" Marla says, pulling on her shoes. Her voice is tight, overflowing. I think she's drowning, too. Okay, I say. I don't mean it. The door shuts behind her with a click. The refrigerator hums. The curtains swish in the breeze. I can hear a faint tango from under the floor. The room is screaming all around me. Get out, get out. Who am I to argue? The clouds race by overhead. The pavement is wet in patches. It rained last night. Who'd have thought? When I get back, Marla's at the kitchen counter, hacking away at a carrot viciously. Her mascara is streaked down over her cheeks. Her hands are shaking. \"I can't do this,\" she tells me. \"I can't share the rest of my life with a ghost. I – I won't – I –\" The knife slips, the tip nicking her finger. She drops it with a gasp. \" Damn it!\" Her hands flutter like butterflies; she can't get them to stop shaking. The water from the faucet runs red over her hand. Marla, I breathe. \"I – I –\" She's laughing, bubbly little giggles a little bit like tears. She turns the tap off. Turns around. \"God –\" She chokes out, and then her arms are around me, her face buried against my chest. I awkwardly rub circles onto her back. \"I'm fine,\" she says. \"I'm fine, yeah? We're both… fine.\" I breathe in the scent of her hair and think, no, of course we aren't, but we might be, someday. I can live with someday. Someday is good. Someday's just fine. X We're always fighting. On the surface, there's always a different reason. The coffee's too hot. Does a sphinx count as a lion. What station of the metro are we meant to get off at. Of course, we know it's not about that. If you scrape away the layers, you can always find the real reasons, and those never change. Why don't you let me love you. Why won't you forget. Why are you asking the impossible of me. Things we can't say out loud. Words too heavy to carry. We've got this pattern going. We fight. One, or both, of us walk away, wander the city. Drink in the air, the rain, the atmosphere. Come home, make up. Repeat as desired. We're going through variations on a theme, like the concertos our downstairs neighbors are so fond of. She's the one to walk out, this time. I sit at the dining table while our impossibly loud space laughs at me. There's only one pair of shoes by the door. Her jacket isn't on its hook. The gaps are painful to look at. It's moments like this that hurt the most. I can see Tyler smiling at me with his usual confidence, blue eyes twinkling. I can feel his lips on the back of my hand, and then on my lips, my shoulder, my neck. Or maybe they're Marla's. Jesus, listen to me. I get up. I'm not staying here, not while Marla's out. I'm not going out, either. And, somehow, I find myself knocking on Lena Volkova's door. She opens it, Napoleon in tow. \"Hello?\" Marla left. Not left , left – she'll be back. Just needed some space. Can I come in? \"Yes, of course. Tea?\" Napoleon turns tail and slinks away. Yeah, please. \"You and Marla – you are what? Lovers?\" Lena asks me. I get the blue cup, this time. We're… huh. Maybe. I don't know. We're two people who happen to be in love with the same ghost. I can tell that Lena understands. When I look at her grey eyes, her frizzy hair, her angles and lines, I know. Lena Volkova is in love with ghosts, but she's long given up trying to get away. She embraces them, clings to moments that have vanished, immortalized in her photographs. She surrounds herself with living things to feel less empty. It's kind of poetic, if you think about it. A few of her fish still struggle against the current, the light glinting off their scales. There's one, this little silvery-pink thing, which keep getting swept aside, and keeps on coming back. Dumb fish. Lena taps the glass with her finger, her thin lips curving into a smile. \"The wild fish, they swim… против течение – against current, to stay in place. If they stop swimming, current carries them to sea,\" says Lena. That's us, isn't it? Fish against the current. It takes so much energy to stay still. And that one, there? \"Too weak. He gets pulled back,\" Lena says. Those two, they're me and Marla, always fighting against the flow, and that little frail one there is Lena, struggling to keep up, embracing the ocean. How metaphorical. I look at Lena. At broken, tired Lena, with her limp and grey eyes and fluffy cat. I've got to go. \"Go.\" I set the cup down with a click and walk away, Napoleon meowing after me. X I'm sitting on the sofa, eyes closed, drifting in and out of the soft lull of sleep. The tide creeps up over my toes. I am a fish. The refrigerator hums like the waves. The crinkle of the curtains is the sea wind. The concerto downstairs – well, that's ignorable. And the really funny thing, all I can think about is this is where I met him. Huh. I swear I've said that before. The door opens with a creak. I look up, half-expecting to see him, but it's not him. It's Marla, and she's soaked and shaking. Marla, what happened? She clutches at the wall to support herself, doesn't answer. Marla? I can see her swallow; her breath comes in tiny gasps. I get up. Are you alright? \"Y-yeah.\" Her voice quivers. I reach out to touch her arm, and she flinches away. I look at her, closely. Her jeans are torn open on the knee, her forearm is red and raw and peppered with gravel. I can see a dark bruise spreading under the skin of her cheek. Marla, look at me. Tell me. What happened? \"A car. Just came out of… n-nowhere, and, um… I dove out of the way, it d-didn't hit me. I'm fine, I'm f-fine,\" she breathes. God, I can almost see it. Marla, caught in the current of moving cars, the stream of honking horns, the sea of metal. You know how they always say to swim sideways if you're caught in the rip tide? She slides her arms around me. I can feel her whole body shaking, her heart hammering inside her ribcage like a bird caught in a net. I hold her, gingerly. The water is up to our shins, now, and Tyler's nowhere in sight. He's my hallucination, not hers. My words , I think. Are they? Marla, I say. She clings to me. The water is above our knees. Marla, I say again. The rest of my words tie themselves in knots on my tongue. Sometimes, words are completely inadequate. I can feel her lips against my jaw, against my scar, on my neck. The water has to be up to our hips, by now. The tide creeps higher and higher. We only have a little while before it sweeps us away again. I breathe Marla's name against her lips. Her skin is warm under my fingertips. Maybe this is someday. I imagine that the water is already up to my shoulders. The tide pulls me with it. My feet slide sideways in the sand. And I realize, I don't want to go. I feel my fingers trace over her bruise. Damage assessment underway. Up to my neck. The spray tastes like sea salt and Marla. Marla's hand curls around the back of my neck. Salt water, climbing. Let me stay. Please, please, let me stay. Wait a while before you carry me to sea. I imagine the waves rising, rising, until I'm completely underwater, and there is only me and Marla and the clattering rain. X I lean my elbows on the bridge railing. The rising sun dances on the surface of the canal water from its place between the clouds. The railing is still wet from the night rain. I feel Marla's head drop onto my shoulder. \"I think it's time to go,\" she says. The reflection of the sun ripples. I can see fish swimming under the surface of the water, wonder which way the current is going. Running away, again? I ask. I thought we'd stopped. I can still smell her perfume on me, feel her kisses. \"Don't think of it as running,\" Marla says. \"Think of it as walking away after a long time in one place.\" Where to? \"Your call.\" Norway, then. We could give Bergen a go. \"Why Norway?\" she asks, laughing. Why anywhere? My hand finds hers. I'm not looking, but I know that she is smiling. We're fine , I think. We'll be fine . A flock of little sparrows swerves above our head, their reflections dancing across the canal. A single low-flying bird hovers just over the water, and, for a moment, it looks larger than the image of the sun.

Had I slept? I quickly sit up. I'm on a mattress on the floor in Tyler's mildew-infested guest room. I guess I can't really call the place Tyler's since he was probably squatting. It's been months since I first moved in with Tyler and by now I've really gotten used to this condemned shithole of a place. Materialism is just a distraction. The soft wood swelled up from water damage is soothing to me now. I don't miss my apartment. I don't miss my IKEA furniture. I don't even miss my clever yin and yang themed coffee table. I don't miss any part of my old life. I like what Tyler and I have going on now. I brush the plaster off my head that must've fallen from the ceiling last night during one of Tyler and Marla's deranged hump sessions and brush my teeth in the bathroom. Another one of my molars is loose. I think I remember when this one happened actually- probably from when I fought Bob last night. I pull it out and drop it down the sink. It wasn't the first tooth I've lost and it won't be the last. But like Tyler once told me, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart. I shuffle down the stairs in my boxers and slippers. My knees ache from being slammed onto the cement floor of the basement of Lou's Tavern so many times. I don't see Tyler anywhere. I call out for him. He says he is outside. Outside I see him and Angel Face, or at least that's what they used to call him before I pulverized his face into soup for trying to replace me at Tyler's side. I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection. He and Tyler are sizing up some of the new applicants outside on the doorstep. Tyler calls them space monkeys. One of these men's head is already shaved. He other's will be buzzed off when and if he passes the test and is allowed to begin his training for Project Mayhem. You may wonder what Project Mayhem is exactly, but the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions. Tyler looks the recruit with the buzz cut over- sizing him up. The recruit's eyes are red and glazed over, as are Tyler's. Neither of them has slept in three days. I know this, because Tyler knows this. Tyler finally breaks the silence and says, \"You have two pairs black shirts?\" The applicant automatically responds, \"Yes, sir.\" \"Two pairs black pants?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"One pair black boots?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Two pairs black socks?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"One black jacket?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"500 dollars personal burial money?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Tyler motions with his head for the man with the buzz cut to enter the house. The other man does not move a muscle. The man goes inside proceeds down to the basement. There are three more rows of bunk beds down there than yesterday. I want to ask Tyler how many more space monkeys are coming to live with us but I can't. The second rule is you do not ask questions. When the recruits first began arriving, Tyler told me that the applicant must stand at attention on the porch for three consecutive days without food, water, or encouragement. If he succeeds, he may then enter and begin his training. That must be why the other man was still waiting on the porch- his three days aren't up yet. I walk over to the kitchen where Angel Face has now beginning harvesting lye with Bob to create soap for the Paper Street Soap Company that Tyler Founded. The lips shaped scars on their right hands matched the one on my own. And Tyler's. The scar is a symbol. Tyler taught it to all of us- without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing. And in Tyler we trusted. Bob looks up at me and nods in greeting. That big moose of a man has known me even longer than Tyler. We used to go to support meetings together. And one night, I saw him on the street and we found out we were both members of Fight Club. He used to go Tuesdays and Thursdays. But I went on Saturdays so we didn't know for months that we both went. But now we match up about every other weekend. He almost always wins. But how couldn't he? He's got at least 80 pounds on me. My gaze shifts over to Angel Face. He looks like a wreck. His face is gnarled, swollen and pink like a rotten peach. But I don't feel bad about it. I hardly feel anything anymore. This is your life. And it's ending one minute at a time. ","Summary":" Was I asleep? Had I slept? I quickly sit up.

The skies are clear and cool and my hands are jammed in my pockets, curled and shaking and hungry for warmth, but the laugh is like a cool palm against my forehead. It's high and clear and cold, that laugh, and in it there is not one single shred of warmth or love or foregiveness. His eyes boring through me have the pale antifreeze emptiness of a flowing stream where all the fish have flopped up on the shore to die. I tell him, my parents love me. I gulp the chilled morning air and tell him, my mom doesn't understand. I say how they never ever meant to do this to us. Tyler's lip curls and he sucks in air like smoke, and he says, that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. Good parents, they'd notice if something like this happened to their kid. They'd notice if all of a sudden their kid was someone else. Of course, it was over almost as it began, but for that one frozen moment all the lights went out and I was nowhere. My name, my face, the precious inscape I've cobbled together, they slipped through a hole in the world and I just wasn't anymore. I blinked on and off like one of those buzzy flourescent lights.

Entonces llega un tipo despeinado y corpulento, se sienta tras de ti y te susurra al oído: \"¿Por qué cojones esa obsesión con estudiar? ¿Por qué debemos ocupar un puesto que nos aporte el suficiente dinero para pagar impuestos y tontos caprichos de los que tan sólo podremos disfrutar dos horas al día en un futuro?\" Entonces te giras y fijas tu mirada en sus ojos porcinos, diminutos y hundidos bien dentro de su cara. Por lo que te han enseñado, debe de tener problemas para dormir. Probablemente, a causa de la ansiedad. Por lo que has aprendido, esas ojeras demuestran que quizá sepa aprovechar su tiempo hasta el último segundo. No tienes ni puta idea de qué responderle, así que sueltas un productivo \"¿eh?\".

Al menos, tu burbuja de aislamiento continúa funcionando. \"Nacemos, pringamos y morimos\", te dice. \"Nos dan lo suficiente para comer y nos convencen de que somos felices por tener una televisión grande donde ver el fútbol los domingos\". Vuelves a parpadear, pero no funciona. Por lo que te han enseñado, la gente que habla como él tienen una percepción difusa, irreal y maniática del mundo. Por lo que has aprendido, está causando en ti toda una crisis de valores e identidad. Pues al fin y al cabo estás de acuerdo pero nunca te lo has cuestionado. \"¿Por qué la cosmovisión de trabajar el 90% de la población a favor del ocio del otro 10% de obesos y ricos hijos de puta a los que envidiamos es la correcta?\". Es tan feo que te quema desde la retina hasta más allá de la conciencia, y además pensar hace que te pique el alma cuando no tienes cerca polvos de talco para calmarla. \"¿Quizás porque los grandes mandamases tienen todo esto muy bien organizado?\" te atreves a responder, temblando porque sabes que digas lo que digas, es seguro que te has equivocado. Por lo que te han enseñado, intentar hablar de cambios en el sistema es un propósito condenado al fracaso pues ya vivimos en el máximo de bienestar. Porque ya somos felices. ¿No?

Voici un one shoot totalement différent de ce que je fais d'habitude. J'espère qu'il vous plaira, n'hésitez pas à critiquer et bonne lecture ! \"Where is my mind\" ~ Pixies Je conseille de ne pas lire si vous n'avez pas lu l'oeuvre/vu le film (évidemment). Brûlure chimique \"Dans le monde tel que je le vois, on chassera des élans dans les forets humides et rocailleuses qui entoureront les ruines du Rockfeller Center. On portera des vêtements de cuirs qui dureront la vie entière. On escaladera les immenses lianes qui envelopperont la tour sud. Et quand on baissera les yeux on verra de minuscules silhouettes entrain de piller du maïs ou de faire sécher de fines tranches de gibier sur l'air de repos déserte d'une superbe autoroute abandonnée.\" Ce mec était la plus grosse concentration d'autodestruction que la Terre eut et ne portera jamais. Il suffisait de plonger dans ses yeux pour y voir que chacun de ses actes aboutissaient à de l'anarchie, ou à de la douleur. Douleur qu'il préférait, la plus part du temps, mentale. Comme ce mec, derrière son épicerie miteuse, sur son parking humide et puant. Un des plus grands vétérinaires désormais. Grand bien en fasse à ces putains d'animaux. Dès le départ j'm'étais dit que cet ami à usage unique était différent des autres. Je lui ai fait remarquer d'ailleurs. Qui n'aurait pas remarqué cet homme de toute façon. Il était ce que j'avais toujours aspiré à être. Il représentait un peu le... le fantasme ultime en fait. Tyler Durden. Ouais, ouais c'était un mec. Et je crois que... ouais, je crois que justement, ça en renforçait le fantasme. Qui n'a jamais au moins une fois songé à baiser avec quelqu'un du même sexe ? Quand mon appart avait sauté, c'était pas Marla que je voulais voir. Alors ça, non. Déjà qu'elle m'avait pris mes clubs, j'allais pas en plus ramper vers elle pour demander de l'aide. Mais je crois que si je ne l'avais pas déjà rencontrée avant, avec toute la bizarrerie qui s'émane d'elle, comme un panneau au dessus de son crâne \"Je suis anormale\", j'aurais eu peur de Tyler. Sérieusement, moi, employé à faire mes petits quotas, à comptabiliser des morts, je m'aurais jamais imaginé dans ce taudis désastreux. Et pourtant, je m'y retrouvais, comme ça. Y a des choses qui arrivent, faut pas essayer de leur donner de sens, sinon elles en ont de moins en moins. Bref, je savais qu'à ce moment j'avais besoin de ce gars-là et de personne d'autres. C'est comme ça que tout à commencé. C'est ici que tout a débuté. Ce taudis. Notre maison. Je me suis vite habitué à... l'environnement. Je me suis adapté à Tyler. Lui, il vivait comme si j'avais toujours été là. Il travaille énormément ce gars-là, je sais pas comment c'est possible. En tout cas on arrivait tranquillement à vivre là-dedans, c'était plutôt plaisant. Et rapidement, je dirais même le jour même de notre rencontre, ou tout du moins l'idée en émanait de là, on a monté notre club à nous, que Marla ne pourra pas me prendre cette fois. Le Fight Club. Ladite idée nous est venue le soir où il m'avait demandé de le frapper derrière un bar, le soir où j'avais perdu mon appart, le soir où je l'avais rappelé. Je ne sais pas pourquoi je n'ai pas pensé à appeler mes collègues, ou ma famille ce jour-là. Peut-être que quelque part, il me fascinait déjà beaucoup plus que ce que je ne voulais bien m'avouer. Et j'avais son numéro. Très franchement des numéros j'en récolte pas souvent, hors travail. Alors voilà, il y avait cette suite de chiffres sur ce bout de papier cartonné, décoré selon des spécialistes de la pub ayant analysé la psychologie humaine pour établir cet amas d'atomes censé vous donner envie de rappeler. Ce n'est pas le bout de carton qui m'a donné envie de le rappeler. Et puis on s'était retrouvés dans ce bar. Je crois que c'était là que la base de toute notre relation s'est établie. Franchement on m'aurait dit que ça se passerait un jour, j'aurais fuis la personne en courant et hurlant que je la poursuivrais en justice pour folie. Mais pourtant le fait était là. On venait de sortir du bar, on avait bu trois pichets de bière à nous deux. L'alcool aussi est à compter dans l'équation. Il avait sentis que j'avais besoin d'un toit, d'un lieux. Mais j'étais comme ça, trop fier, trop emplis de cette volonté de montrer que je pouvais me débrouiller pour lui demander. Alors moi la première chose qui m'est venue à l'esprit c'est un hôtel. \"Un hôtel ?\" Ouais. \"T'as qu'à demander, mec.\" Je savais de quoi il voulait parler, hein. Mais franchement c'était pas mon genre de me lancer dans l'acide sans maillot de bain. Enfin, j'ai fait celui qui refuse même si j'avais la très présente envie de connaître plus ce mec, de le connaître dans son intimité. Dans son quoi ? Pardon ? \"-Quoi ? -Nom de dieu j'en reviens pas... trois pichets de bière et tu demandes toujours pas. -Quoi ?! -Tu m'as appelé parce que tu savais pas où loger.\" C'est en effet une des raisons. Je vous ai pas dit que Tyler était un mec vachement perspicace ? Débrouillard, solitaire, intelligent... Par contre le fantasme absolu, ça, j'vous en ai parlé. Et quand votre fantasme s'approche lentement de vous avec un regard qui jongle entre la violence et le sexe... me dites pas que je suis le seul à reculer jusqu'au mur ? \"-Ha non, non, non, non, non ! -Hé si. -J'en avais pas l'intention, hein, mais/ -Ecoute... Demande. Arrête les préliminaires, et demande.\" Les... les quoi ? Les putains de quoi ? \"-Je... je vois pas... de... -Je sais que tu en as envie.\" Il pose son bras à côté de ma tête. Putain je sais pas de quoi il parle, mais oui. Oui j'en ai envie. \"Demande...\" Ses lèvres frôlent les miennes. Son corps se colle au mien. Putain, non, pas déjà ! Oh la honte. En plus il sourit. Quel con. Ho mon dieu de bordel, sa main... sa main, sur mon torse, sous mon t-shirt, et puis... plus loin... plus bas... \"-Haaaaa ! -Demande...\" Oh putain ouais. Juste là. Continue, putain. Même si il faut que je bouge mes hanches dans ta main pour que ça te fasse aller plus vite, je le ferais volontiers. Non, NON PUTAIN ! Ne ralentis pas, n'arrête pas... t'arrête pas... \"-T'arrêtes pas, putain... Haaa... -Demande... -Hnn... Tyler... Baise-moi, je t'en supplie.\" Et voilà c'était comme ça que notre relation avait commencé. Je sais, début sur les chapeaux de roues, tout ça tout ça... C'est aussi là où j'ai pu goûter une parcelle de l'étendue gigantesque d'autodestruction qui l'animait. Non seulement il me baisait sans retenue contre ce mur à m'en déchirer le dos, à la sortie de ce bar, dans cette nuit froide, mais quand je lui griffais le dos, lui mordais la gorge, il en redemandait, et me faisait subir la même chose. On baisait, on se mutilait, et on a atteint l'orgasme. Et là on s'est tapé dessus. Va savoir pourquoi, il me l'a demandé à peine rhabillé. Et on a passé une heure à se battre, des mecs ont débarqué pour demander si ça allait. Grave, que ça allait. Je venais de tirer le meilleur coup du monde, là. J'étais l'orgasme de Jack. Et Tyler était tout ce qui restait au monde, pour moi. Il était devenu mon monde, petit à petit. \"On devrait remettre ça, un jour\" Il avait sourit. Mon père s'était barré fonder une autre famille quand j'avais 6 ans. Paraît qu'il fait ça régulièrement. Ma mère a pas tenu, elle s'est suicidé quand j'étais à la fac. J'ai toujours vécu seul, avec rien d'autre comme rattache que ces meubles que je collectionnais dans mon appartement de luxe. Ouais j'avais de la thune, ouais. Mais Tyler c'est pas ce qui l'intéressait. J'aurais pu nous racheter une maison bien mieux que celle-là, où on est forcés d'éteindre le courant quand il pleut, où ladite pluie goûte par tout les pores. Mais c'était une forme de confort comme un autre. Comme avec mes meubles IKEA, je m'étais attaché sentimentalement à cette maison. Et à son habitant. Quand il faisait froid, quand il pleuvait, en général je rejoignais Tyler dans son lit. Il avait toujours chaud ce gars-là, et j'avais besoin de chaleur. Et très rapidement il me donnait une autre forme de chaleur. J'avais besoin de le sentir en moi, de me faire baiser par lui et hurler à m'en décrocher la mâchoire. Comme à mes meubles, comme à la maison, je m'étais attaché à ça. Ça me faisait vivre. Encore le problème était son boulot, et le mien. Je travaillais le jour, il travaillait la nuit. Je sais pas comment on faisait, on a jamais vraiment fait gaffe à ce qu'on faisait en fait, mais on parvenait toujours à se croiser. Surtout pour coucher. En définitive, à part le Fight Club, et la baise, on faisait pas grand chose d'autre. Ah si. On s'embrassait. Je lui mets son nœud papillon droit. Il est 19h je suis rentré depuis 15min, et il part au boulot. Là il faisait serveur. Il instaurait l'anarchie dans les plats, c'était sa manière à lui d'exister. Instaurer l'anarchie dans tout ce qu'il atteignait. Mon être le premier. Bientôt, il sera poursuivit en justice pour ça. Je ne savais pas s'il était amoureux de moi. On menait une parfaite vie de couple quoi qu'il en était, pendant la semaine. Mais tout les samedis soirs, on découvrait de plus en plus, à chaque sortie, qu'on n'était pas les seuls à avoir besoin de se taper dessus, de se faire mal. Et pas seulement pour le côté sexuel. Bien que les seules choses que l'on pouvait entendre parfois par dessus les cris, ces chocs violents de la chair sur la chair, n'avaient de cesse de me ramener à l'esprit notre relation. Nos actes. Nos nuits. Dans ces moments là je regardais Tyler, et je bandais. Le projet Fight Club se développait progressivement de lui-même. Le lundi matin, tout ce à quoi je pensais, c'était le prochain weekend end. Pour le Club, évidemment. Et puis pour Tyler. Ouais, lui non plus ne travaillait pas le week end; c'était bien là nos seuls moments à nous qui n'étaient pas empruntés à la volée entre nos travail. Après, un barman nous a passer sa cave pour nos combats. Vu le nombre qu'on commençait à être... C'était plus discret qu'à l'extérieur. Car la règle numéro 1 était : Il est interdit de parler du Fight Club. La second règle du Fight Club était : Il est interdit de parler du Fight Club. Alors ce serait gravement stupide de ne pas en parler, mais de s'exhiber aux yeux de la police qui se serait donné à coeur joie pour nous arrêter et nous foutre en garde à vue pour avoir organisé des combats de rues, fait du tapage nocturne ou... que sais-je. Ce club a changé énormément de choses dans la vie de tout ses adhérents. On a tous commencé à voir la vie différemment. L'autodestruction de Tyler prenait peu à peu de l'étendue sur... à peu près tout le monde. Il leur demandait de déclencher des bagarres dans la rue, ils le faisaient. Il leur demandait de poser une bombe, ils le faisaient. Ça a commencé à me faire peur, de voir tout l'emprise que Tyler pouvait posséder sur les autres. Mais c'était pas tellement les dégâts, les blessures ou la douleur qui résultaient de ce contrôle qui m'effrayaient. C'était de me rendre compte à quel point il était entrain de faire la même chose avec moi. Ouais, je tombais amoureux et dépendant de Tyler Durden. Quand c'était à lui de se battre, je ne regardais pas son adversaire, je ne regardais pas les coups qu'il lui infligeait. Seulement son corps. Son putain de bandant de corps. J'ai vite compris que mourir de peur tout en se tapant une trique d'enfer, c'était assez malsain. Totalement malsain. C'était Tyler quoi. Le pire c'est qu'il le savait. Il était parfaitement conscient de ça, et il en jouait. Il adorait ça, pouvoir me posséder quand il voulait, se glisser dans ma chambre quand il rentrait du travail pour venir m'extirper de mon sommeil par le moyen le plus brutal qui soit. Soit en me frappant, soit en me baisant. C'était selon son humeur. Et puis là, tout a explosé. Tout était parti en couilles. Marla. Cette sale petite pute sans aucun doute atteinte du syndrome de Münchhausen qui m'avait volé mes clubs et maintenant qui me volait mon Tyler. Ouais, le mien. Ce vile serpent hérissé de pics est venu étaler son syndrome au téléphone, aux oreilles de Tyler. Et Tyler... putain jamais j'aurais pensé qu'il ferait ça, ce sale con. Cette petite enflure est parti retrouver l'autre conasse; et pour quoi faire ? POUR LA BAISER EVIDEMMENT ! J'en pouvais plus. Mes nerfs allaient lâcher. Les entendre baiser tout les jours, à faire tomber le plâtre, à péter les vitres à cause des cris de Marla. J'étais horriblement jaloux, et profondément furieux. Alors dès que j'en avais l'occasion, je la jertais cette... cette... cette gourgandine. Ha, vous pouvez rire, allez-y ! Mais moi ça me faisait pas rire. Il fallait que j'en parle à Tyler, sinon j'allais faire exploser la maison. Il était entrain de faire du savon après qu'on ait volé de la graisse humaine. Oh mon dieu y avait pas plus dégoûtant Bref, on faisait du savon, il m'apprenait. Il se collait à mon dos, prenait mon poignet dans le sien et me montrait comment tourner sa bouillasse. Il m'embrassait le cou, il se frottait à moi. J'en avais terriblement envie, et ma bite aussi. Mais d'après ma raison, ça m'allait pas. Alors je me suis retourné, et je l'ai poussé. Il a cogné la table derrière, et m'a regardé comme si un troisième -pardon, un quatrième- bras me poussait au milieu du front. Mais moi je le regardais juste tremblant de haine. \"-Euh... c'est quoi le délire, là ? -C'est quoi le délire ? Haha, tu demandes juste, hein. C'est quoi le délire ?! Je vais te retourner la question moi : C'EST QUOI CE PUTAIN DE DELIRE AVEC MARLA, LA ?!\" J'aurais dû m'y attendre, mais il a rit. Il s'est allumé une clope. \"-Quoi ? Me dis pas que t'es jaloux ? -Putain Tyler je croyais que... qu'entre nous... putain, tu comprends pas que ça me fasse mal ?! -Que ça te fasse mal... ?\" Il a sourit, et puis il a tiré sa deuxième taffe sur sa cigarette avant de la jeter. Il a fait le tour de la table, il a enfilé des gants et des lunettes, et il a commencé à me baratiner sur les explosifs, les éléments chimiques tout ça... En d'autres circonstance je l'aurais admiré. Là j'étais juste vénère. Il m'a demandé d'approcher. Et puis il me l'a ordonné. J'ai obéis. Il m'a prit la main avec cette délicatesse dont il sait faire preuve parfois. Je me suis immédiatement adouci, faible comme je suis. Il s'est assis, et m'a embrassé la main. Rien que ça, rien que ce putain de contact-là, m'exaltait. Il m'avait pas touché depuis si longtemps... depuis l'arrivée de Marla. J'avais besoin de ce contact. J'avais besoin de ce baiser. MAIS NOM DE DIEU DE BORDEL A CUL DE MERDE JAVAIS PAS BESOIN QU'IL RAJOUTE DE LA SOUDE PAR DESSUS ! \"Ca, c'est une brûlure chimique.\" Ca m'avait embrasé tout le corps plus rapidement qu'une flamme déclare un incendie dans une forêt baignée de carburant. Ça m'avait déchiré l'âme et le corps. C'était comme une lame chaude que l'on plantait dans ma main jusqu'à la garde et qu'on retirait à l'instant même pour la replanter de nouveau. \"Elle te fera plus mal que n'importe quelle autre brûlure. N'importe quelle autre douleur.\" J'avais l'impression que mes organes étaient passés à la passoire et comprimés contre du métal bouillant pour en faire de la charpie qu'on me réinjecterait dans la main après. \"As-tu déjà entendu les râles de l'agonie ?\" m'avait un jour demandé Marla. C'était à peu près ça à ce moment même. Si seulement j'avais pris quelques minutes pour aller voir mourir Maria Singer, rien de tout ça ne serait jamais arrivé. \"Marla, elle au-moins, essayait de toucher le fond.\" Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. . Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Marla. Tout aura toujours été de sa faute de toute manière. D'abord mes clubs d'entre aide. Puis Tyler. Et quoi ensuite ? Mon identité ? \"Et t'auras une cicatrice.\" J'aurais tout donné pour avoir cette salope sous mon autre main en ce moment pour lui faire goûter à mon supplice. Je lui aurais enfoncé les yeux dans ses globes, pour lui faire boire tout le sang qui s'en écoulerait. Puis je lui aurais arraché chacun de ses ongles, même ceux des pieds, pour les enfoncer dans ses oreilles. Ensuite je lui aurais tranché tous ses doigts, même ceux des pieds, pour les enfoncer profondément dans sa gorge. Et enfin, j'aurais découpé sa poitrine pour lui arracher le cœur. \"La voilà ta souffrance.\" Je ne sais combien de temps ça avait duré. Mon cœur souffrait et mon corps mourrait. Je tentais de me concentrer sur les tortures que je pourrais faire subir à Marla, mais la douleur avait totalement embaumé mon esprit, ma raison et ma conscience pour la jeter dans le feu des enfers. Et j'avais mal, tellement mal... \"Lâche-moi je t'en prie...\" Je ne pensais jamais le supplier un jour d'une autre manière que sexuellement. Je souffrais. J'aurais voulu m'embrocher sur un pieu pour mettre fin à tout ça. Mon âme était happée par l'air, à la manière de la faucheuse avec celles des défunt,s à travers le trou dans ma main. Toute la douleur que l'ont aurait pu ressentir en se brisant tout les os à la fois était concentrée dans ce petit carré de peau. Ma mort, par la main de Tyler Durden. \"Il n'y a que lorsqu'on a tout perdu qu'on est réellement libre\" La douleur m'embuait les sens et m'engourdissait le cerveau. Mes convulsions se calmaient. Je mourrais. Il me lâcha, et mon corps s'effondra au sol. \"Tu vas bientôt toucher le fond, c'est bien.\" Ma souffrance l'excitait. Il bandait. Il m'a baisé. Je ne pouvais que subir tant mon corps mourrait. Tant Tyler me tuait. À partir de ce jour tout dérapait de plus en plus. Il prenait l'entier contrôle de ma vie. Les mots de Tyler sortaient de ma bouche lorsque je menaçais mon boss. Le Fight Club m'échappait. Mon existence m'échappait. \"Tu connais le gars qui a créé ce club ? On dit qu'il est né dans un hôpital psychiatrique et qu'il dort à peine une heure par nuit. Tu connais ce Tyler Durden ?\" avait dit Bob Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. Ma vie était soumise à son existence. Ma volonté était soumise à sa voix. Mon corps était soumis à ses mains. \"La télé nous fait croire qu'un jour on deviendra des millionnaires\" Tyler m'avait fait croire à une illusion qui s'était transformée en véritable parasite, résultat psychotique engendrée par l'accélération du rythme sanguin, mêlée à un peu de douleur et un peu d'orgasmes. Ce jour-là le proprio du bar qu'on squattait avait osé touché à ce corps qui malgré toute la démence et la douleur qu'il faisait subir à tout ce qu'il atteignait, avait trouvé le moyen de remixer le film 28 jours plus tard pour nous permettre de garder cet endroit. Mais là ça a déraillé encore plus. Je ne sais pas si des connexion neuronales se sont fait la malle pendant que ce mec le tabassait -parce qu'il fallait l'avouer, je n'avais jamais vu son visage baigné d'autant de sang- mais Tyler leur avait tous ordonné de provoquer une bagarre dans la rue. C'était l'annonce d'un plan encore plus énorme. Avec le canon d'un flingue entre les dents, on n'articulait que des voyelles. Et je l'avais écouté. Comme tout les autres, je m'étais plié à ses plans. J'étais l'absence total d'initiative de Jack. J'avais cherché le moyen de ne pas simplement provoqué une bagarre stupide dans la rue, mais de me démarquer par rapport à tout les autres. Être supérieur à eux aux yeux de Tyler. Et c'était le bureau de mon patron qui en avait fait les frais. Et mon crâne aussi. Je suis la vengeance narquoise de Jack. Et tout comme Tyler, quelque part. Encore une fois j'avais pensé à lui, à ce moment. Comme toujours. Et puis je m'étais rappelé notre premier combat. Notre première baise. Tout ce qui avait attrait à la douleur, me rappelait ces moments. J'avais perdu mon travail. Je suis la vie gâchée de Jack. J'avais obtenu des subventions. Tyler avait été viré, après qu'ils aient découvert de l'urine dans de la sauce pour homard. Alors ses demandes avaient commencéees à prendre de plus en plus d'ampleur. Je suppose qu'il n'avait plus rien d'autre pour s'occuper l'esprit, quelque chose dans le genre, alors il inventait des stratégies de plus en plus... démentielles. Il nous donnait d'abord nos instructions dans des enveloppes. On découvrait à ce moment de plus en plus de Fight Club naissant spontanément à travers tout le pays, sans que Tyler ou moi n'ait à intervenir. Ses plans anarchiques scellés entre du papier et une fine couche de colle étaient rendus possibles car tout les membres n'hésiteraient pas à arrêter un train à main nues si il leur demandait. Et car lesdits membres accumulaient toute les professions connues à ce jour à eux seuls. L'anarchie, la marque de fabrique, la signature de Tyler, se répandait progressivement dans le pays. Il agissait sans peur, sans affolement et armé de sa faculté à ignorer totalement ce qui avait de l'importance. Moi y compris.. \"Vous êtes la merde de ce monde prêt à servir à tout.\" Marla était encore là ce matin. Je lui avais dit qu'elle pouvait rester. Chloé était morte d'après elle. Sa faculté d'ignorer totalement ce qui avait de l'importance. Marla en était la preuve vivante. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi quelqu'un de faible devait s'accrocher à quelqu'un de plus fort. Au lieu de me répondre simplement à ça, cette phrase stupide sortie spontanément juste parce que, une fois de plus, je repensais à Tyler, Marla m'avait encore une fois pris la tête. Tyler avait encore prit les rennes de la conversation, de la dispute. Je l'ai une fois de plus agressée, insultée. Et elle était partie. Puis arrivèrent les postulants. Tyler ne m'en avait pas parlé avant que le premier débarque. Je ne m'étonnais même plus. Tôt ou tard, on devenait tous ce que Tyler attendait de nous. Il les manipulait, testait leur mental. Et systématiquement ils faisaient tous ce qu'il leur demandait. J'avais l'impression de me voir en chacun d'eux. J'étais témoins de ce que Tyler me faisait, à travers ces gars. \"Un singe de l'espace prêt à se sacrifier.\" Il décrivait ça drôlement bien. Tyler montait une armée. Et je ne savais toujours pas pourquoi. J'aurais dû m'en foutre, j'aurais dû être indifférent. Mais le fait est que je ne l'étais pas. Le fait est que j'étais amoureux de lui et que je ne pouvais tout simplement pas faire comme si ça ne me blessait pas. Car voir tout ces gars, dans quelques manières que ce soit informés plus ou moins bien sur le projet \"Chaos\", et moi pas, ET MOI PAS, ça me faisait mal. Première règle du projet \"Chaos\", on ne pose pas de question. Tyler souriait quand ses petits singes de l'espace répétaient cette phrase à mes questions restées en suspend pendant nos parties de jambes en l'air; et puis il s'en allait marcher ailleurs. Dans ces moments là, quand il faisait ça, j'avais envie de le frapper et de le baiser. Et ça me faisait mal. Envie de le frapper pour déverser ma haine. Envie de le baiser parce que ça faisait bien trop longtemps qu'il ne me touchait plus. Il en arrivait presque à m'ignorer dans la maison, depuis que les autres l'avait investie. Tyler avait menacé je ne sais quelle autre personne haut placée de lui trancher les couilles aujourd'hui. Il n'avait coupé que l'élastique en vérité. C'était un peu ce qui m'était arrivé. Il m'avait attaché les couilles et me maintenait par l'élastique et me menait par le boue de la queue. En sortant il avait attraper le visage de Gueule d'Ange et l'avait regardé, avec ce regard qu'il me réservait. Avant. Alors c'était ça ? Après Marla, c'était Gueule d'Ange ? Ça me faisait mal. J'avais envie de loger une balle entre les deux yeux de ce petit con pas capable de baiser ailleurs pour sauver son espèce. Le samedi suivant, au Club, je l'avais frappé au point que son visage baignait dans son sang et aurait très bien pu se détacher par morceaux. Tyler m'avait interpellé. \"J'avais envie de détruire quelque chose de beau\" avais-je répondu. Il avait haussait les sourcils. \"Ne te mets pas à agir comme moi je l'ai fait avec toi.\" On avait pris la voiture. Et cette fois je n'en pouvais plus. Il fallait que ça sorte, il fallait que je me défoule. Anéantir la gueule d'ange de Gueule d'Ange ne m'avait pas suffit. \"-Pourquoi on ne m'avait rien dit du projet \"Chaos\" ?! -La première règle du projet Chaos est, on ne parle pas du projet Chaos !\" J'allais finir par me défouler sur eux si ça continuait. Je ne voulais même pas regarder Tyler au cas où il sourirait encore, et je m'étais tourné vers eux pour leur ordonner de fermer leur gueule. Ma rage emplissait tant mon être qu'elle aurait pu éclater sur un chaton s'il avait osé faire l'affront de me miauler dessus. Douleur et plaisir étaient la base de notre relation. Il y a un adage qui dit qu'on fait toujours du mal à ceux qu'on aime. Mais il oublie de dire qu'on aime ceux qui nous font du mal. \"Ah parce que ça se passe entre toi et moi maintenant ?\" Et le plaisir s'était depuis longtemps évaporé. Seul la douleur était désormais reine de mon corps et de mon âme. Comme si tout sentiment positif s'étaient évanouis pour ne laisser place qu'à... Tyler. \"-Tu devrais oublier tout ce qui concerne toi et moi. -Je comprends pas... qu'est ce que tu veux dire par là ? -Qu'est ce que t'aurais voulu faire avant de mourir ?\" J'aurais voulu réussir à te faire m'aimer. \"A ton avis pourquoi j'ai fait sauter ton appart ?\" Je ne me préoccupais tout à coup plus de ses questions, de l'incompréhension qu'elles faisaient naître en moi, mais plutôt de nous sauver la peau, à nous deux et aux deux singes assis à l'arrière. Il lâchait le volant, et manquait de nous faire crever d'une collision avec une quelconque voiture arrivant en face de nous. Je lui hurlais d'arrêter ses conneries, de reprendre la voiture en main, puisqu'il n'était pas capable de le faire avec nous. Avec moi. J'avais si mal. \"Arrête de vouloir tout contrôler.\" Parfait. La mort, c'était bien aussi. J'avais relâché le volant, libre désormais. Et la voiture dérivait. Il y avait le ravin un peu plus loin. Une bonne alternative. Plus de Gueule d'Ange, plus de Marla. Seulement Tyler et moi. Seulement... moi. J'étais infiniment seul, en fin de compte. Je suis le sentiment de rejet exacerbé de Jack. ","Summary":" ~Rolling Stones Bien.

I do not own the cover image. Invasion… That's all my life has been about- invasion. Consumerism invaded your life. Marla invaded my only methods of sleep therapy. Women invaded our lives. And now Tyler is beginning to invade your mind. I look him in the eye and, as much as I admire him, God , do I envy him to the point where it sometimes angers me. I am Jack's boiling blood. At a first glance, there's nothing anyone could want of his. It's not his derelict excuse for a house, let alone a home, or his minimalist lifestyle, of course. He may not own many things that I desire, but he does own one thing-one thing even more desirable than anything from a catalogue- You don't mean that . It's that I own the freedom you could only dream of. You're caged in by all your IKEA crap, and it's all your fault. And you're gonna have a hard time freeing yourself. Look at me- I can throw out my arms and embrace this freedom. You could do the same- if it didn't risk you knocking over those precious little vases of artificial plants taking up a ton of unnecessary space . Everything about you is unnecessary space. I pictured my condo- all of those little pieces of furniture and that wonderful yin-yang table and the dishes that felt like they defined me perfectly- Hell, it all defined me perfectly- and then I realised that I was right; I'd created my own cage. I'd thrown myself into an unending vicious circle of purchase after purchase after purchase after pur chase after purchase after purchase after purchase after purchase… You see where you're going wrong here? And now I'd figured out that we were invading the entire town. Project Mayhem was everywhere now, invading the city, and I could almost hear the ticking bombs resonating in my mind. Or maybe you are that ticking time bomb. Tick…Tick…Tick…It's almost over now, isn't it? It's almost over now, isn't it? I fondly remembered my first fight with him. Your first fight with Tyler Durden. I remembered when all of my troubles burst out with the blood that poured from his face. My beautiful catharsis. Fight Club proved to be more remedial than any support group could ever be, without the interference of that little bitch Marla. And yet my only chance to escape the invasions of my life only led to another. Marla invades my cave. Our own personal space in your mind and she's taking over. And now I am seconds away from the end of my life. But, even in the end of my life, it seems I am not free from invasion. And now the cold metal of my gun invades your mouth, and I have finally invaded your mind. And all your death will be about is invasion. Author Note: Thank you for reading! This was actually hard to write, constantly switching POVs and even coming up with something to write.

Fight Club is the property of Chuck Palahniuk. The unnamed narrator may be the closest I've ever come to a self-insertion character. Day 18 (cookies) of the 25 Days of Fic Challenge. The first rule of cookie exchange is \"we don't talk about cookie exchange.\" My faux-granite formica counter was spread with the weapons of the day. Sticks of butter in rows of military precision, softening in the sun. Measuring cups and spoons: full cup for the flour bag, half cup for the sugar bag, teaspoon for the baking powder, quarter-teaspoon for the salt. Eggs. Always use room-temperature eggs. The eggs go at the top of the sticks of butter—heads to a pale yellow army. Either the butter or the sun was an incitement: I'd had to dump the cat off the counter three times now. \"How many do you have to make?\" my roommate Tori asked. She was an ambulatory yawn, a pair of raccoon eyes peering through a purple-streaked fringe above flowered flannel pajamas. \"Twelve dozen.\" I sliced the first two sticks of soft butter into the mixer bowl, measured level scoops of sugar, and set the mixer to cream the two together. In the beginning, there were just four of us, making four dozen each of a single cookie. Over time, cookie exchange had become a movement. \"Has anybody told you about bakeries? They have machines for that.\" \"Bakeries don't use the high-quality ingredients that are essential to a great cookie.\" My butter cost nine dollars a pound and offered the highest butterfat percentage available. Once you go European butter, you don't go back. Tori snatched one of my parchment-paper-lined pans from the counter before I could protest. When I turned back from adding eggs (free-range) and vanilla (from Mexico, for a more robust and complex flavor profile than ordinary Madagascar), she'd pulled a package of Pillsbury cookie dough from the refrigerator. \"Bet your friends can't tell the difference,\" she said. \"Bet they can.\" Self-rising flour is for the lazy: you want control of how much leavening you get. My flour was already sifted, so I stirred in the baking powder (always Rumford, though next year I might make my own) and then added the dry ingredients to the mixing bowl. Tori laid disks of chocolate-chip cookie dough haphazardly on her pan, then smacked them flat with the palm of her hand. I used an ice-cream scoop to set walnut-sized balls of dough two inches apart on a parchment-lined pan. Four minutes in the oven, turn the pan to make sure the cookies get even heat, then another four minutes. Five minutes firming on the pan, then the cookies went onto their rack. At three pans per batch of dough, I could just about put together the next batch in the time it took the prior one to cycle through. On top of the flattened dough, Tori laid an Oreo. \"I thought you were anti-consumerist,\" I said. \"I'm also anti-drudgery. Are you even having fun?\" \"Of course I am.\" I wiped my forehead with my apron and poured myself another cup of coffee. The repetition of cookie-making had a Zen quality to it. I was one with the dough, over and over, creaming and mixing and scooping and sliding finished cookies off the pan. The best part, of course, was getting my exchange basket. For the first day of nibbling, there were cookies to mock as inadequate, cookies to ooh and awe over with a tingle of competitive envy, cookies to taste skeptically, and cookies to finish in privacy and in the dark while vowing to scour Pinterest for the recipe. Then the planning began again. \"You'll eat them when they show up,\" I pointed out to Tori. \"I devour the flesh of my consumption-obsessed overlords.\" She smashed a second disk of chocolate-chip cookie dough on top of the Oreos. \"I need to put this in the oven.\" \"Not right now.\" I set two pots of water on the stove, each with a mixing bowl balanced on its rim. One for white chocolate (the real stuff, not the candy coating) and one for dark chocolate (93 percent cocoa, thankyouverymuch). Half was for dipping, half for drizzling. I was bending into the oven heat for the last pan when I heard a familiar horking noise. \"The cat's throwing up,\" Tori announced unnecessarily. I set the pan on the stove top and ran for the noise, in the grip of every cat owner's futile hope that it'd be possible to move the cat before something disgusting landed on pale upholstery. In the living room, the cat looked up from gagging over the palest part of the rug's pattern to glance with proud significance at a much-gnawed and saliva-coated roll of Scotch tape, left out for wrapping presents. \"Don't eat tape!\" I said. The cat horked. Three hours later, when I hauled the cat carrier back up the stairs and into the apartment—having made the eight-hundred-dollar determination that the cat had merely gummed the tape and wasn't going to die—I was startled by the realization that I smelled sugar and butter and chocolate, but absolutely nothing burning. \"I finished your cookies,\" Tori said from the kitchen door. \"Do you want a glass of wine? There's a good kitty. What indignities did the pharmo-industrial society inflict on you, kitty?\" \"Thank you.\" The cat, once released, dashed under the sofa to think over the events of the day. \"Yes, I'd love a glass of wine.\" I followed Tori into the kitchen, where the cooling racks were now lined with puffy chocolate-chip lumps. My own cookies had been set neatly on pans after they'd been dipped and drizzled. \"You did great,\" I said. The wine was wine, sweet, cheap, and welcome. Tori handed me one of her cookies, and I couldn't say no, though the thought of mass-produced dough and Oreos appalled me. \"I hoped you'd think so.\" The cookie was so hot that the chemical abstraction of cream filling had turned to liquid sweetness. I'd finished a third one before my brain processed what was right in front of my eyes. Tori had decorated every one of my cookies with slogans. I see squandering was white chocolate drizzled on dark. What owns you? was dark chocolate drizzled on white. By-products of a lifestyle obsession was. . . difficult to squeeze onto a cookie, but she'd managed it. Her handwriting was quirky but surprisingly legible. \"That's not—\" I rejected right, appropriate, and sane on the grounds that Tori was trying to help. \"That's not what I'd intended.\" \"Bet your friends will never know the difference.\" I held out my wine glass for a refill as I took another of her cookies. The floor looked like a nice place, so I let my knees collapse until I was sitting on it, with my back to a cabinet. The cat came winding into the room and marked my glass with his chin. \"They'll think it's ironic,\" I said. \"It'll be the hit of the exchange.\" A/N: Tori's Oreo-stuffed chocolate-chip cookies are a thing and can be found in many places on the internet.

Chapter 1: Hello 'I am so screwed.' Tallahassee thought as he lie on the floor of an abandoned shopping center. No ammo, no weapons, and no goddamn Twinkie. He'd been in such a hurry to run away from a huge herd of zombies that he'd accidentally released from another store, that he'd tripped and possibly broken his goddamn ankle. He lie on his side in front of the SAFEWAY's customer service counter, clutching his left ankle in pure agony. He'd gotten pretty far before the herd caught up with him, and he was forced to hide out in this stupid place. 'SAFEWAY. Not so safe, are you?' he cursed, glancing at the door through the crack in the aisles before him. Luckily, the door was on the other side of the store, which meant he had a little time before the zombies could get to him. He'd thought about running for it again, but when he tried to get up, his ankle just hurt one hell of a lot more and forced him to sit back down. He couldn't possibly get up on his own, at this point. He'd thought he had time to rest, to recover a little at least, but just a few minutes after he'd sat down, he'd heard the moans. Dragging himself behind the counter on hands and knees, he leaned himself against a massive tower of boxes, causing the stack to wobble a little. 'Don't fall. Don't you fucking dare fall on-' he thought before the boxes toppled over onto him. They weren't super heavy, but the contents were of something he despised: Snowballs. The pink, sticky, marshmallow balls that tasted like crap (to him), covered in pink sprinkles….buried him almost whole. He thought of screaming his head off then and there, but the sound of a moan stopped him. He looked up to see a zombie just feet from him, staring back with cold, blank eyes. Here he was: sitting in a pile of Snowballs, staring up at one of the creatures that killed his son, and with no weapons available. He would so not die like this. That zombie would get what's coming to it once it attacks him….when it attacks? He waited another minute, staring at the creature with his blue eyes twinkling in anticipation. 'Any moment now….' he thought, eyes wandering over its body. It appeared as a young man, maybe twenty when he was alive, wearing a torn and bloody collared sweater and a pair of blue jeans. It was the middle of Summer anyway, why would anyone want to wear hot clothes? Two years into the zombie apocalypse, and Tallahassee already had partners. Wichita and Little Rock, sisters as sly as sirens, had joined him on his Twinkie quest. As usual, he'd run off looking for the box of objects he desired, leaving the two of them to snipe at zombies from the car. He'd headed to \"what seemed like an abandoned\" TARGET, ignoring the huge padlock on the door and the bloody handprints on the windows. Yeah, all he'd wanted was his damn Twinkies. So, he'd smashed the lock off, only to almost get mowed over by a herd of about thirty or so zombies that had been locked inside. He'd booked it back to the car, only to find Wichita driving like a madwoman trying to avoid the herd he'd unleashed in the moment. So, not a good day. He glanced at the zombie again, smirking. It should be glad it still had all its limbs. He jerked as it stepped closer, footstep almost noiseless compared to his heartbeat. \"Don't you fucking dare….\" he hissed, glaring at it. It was strange that it still hadn't attacked, yet. The zombie's eyes were bright blue on the brink of turning white, and still showed signs of life in them. As soon as the words left his mouth, the zombie froze, a flash of curiosity sparking in its eyes. 'A zombie being curious? Shoot me here and now. And why hasn't it started chewing my damn face off, yet?' Tally questioned internally, watching as it crouched and crawled closer to him. He flinched, scooting back into the mountain of Snowballs. \"What do you want from me?\" he asked aloud. He watched as it lunged forward, grabbing a handful of Snowballs before jerking backwards with a blank expression aimed at him. It ripped open the first package, gulping down the first two Snowballs quickly before tearing open a second and third. Tally could only watch in awe as it ignored him, eyes wide in shock. After the fifth package, Tally started to shift aside, intent on heading for the door to find his partners. The zombie whipped around and grabbed him by the collar, pushing him to the floor. \"What the hell!\" the Flordan snapped, flailing uselessly against the zombie's weight on his chest. It let out a low hiss, Tally instantly going quiet in response. He stared it in the eye, staying silent as it began to bury him in Snowballs. His ears finally registered the sounds of groans and clicking not far from his hiding place, his fear almost becoming overwhelming as he lie still. Through the holes in the Snowball pile atop him, he watched the zombie stand up and turn away, meeting two other zombies at the counter's corner. He listened as they clicked and he gurgled back, watching them look carefully around the room before stumbling away. He listened to their footsteps as they left, feeling the zombie begin to weakly unbury him. Shoving through the pile of sweets, he was met with the zombie's armful of his weapons. He reached out and gently took them, looking confused. It turned and swiftly stumbled away, making a choking noise in another aisle. 'Dammit! He's calling his friends!' Tally thought, hiding behind the counter as his skin began to sweat. Waiting a full thirty minutes, he was startled by the sound of gunshots and shouting outside the store, not zombies. \"Tallahassee, you idiot! Where are you, you son of a bit-\" Wichita's voice cried out from the front of the store. \"Here!\" he shouted back, waving his gun in the air. Racing for the counter, the woman hauled him to his feet and forced him to stumbled for the door. \"Next time you do this, I'm blowing your goddamn face off!\" she snapped, making him smirk proudly. \"I didn't know you cared, sweetheart.\" he chuckled back as she threw him into the backseat of the yellow Cadillac. Little Rock was taking care of the approaching zombies with a shotgun, shooting from beside the car. \"Asses in the car?\" she asked, sliding in beside her sister in the front seat. \"Yes! Going now!\" Wichita cried, slamming the gas pedal. As the car did a donut and knocked several zombies down, Little Rock handed Tally another shotgun. \"Wanna shoot some of these jerks?\" she asked with a smile. He nodded, taking the gun from her. Sticking the barrel out the window, he began blasting head after head as the car twirled around in the dirt. \"Tallahassee is taking a break from shooting, right now! You'll sit there quietly while I try to figure out what to do!\" Wichita shouted from the front seat, attempting to drive over another zombie. Little Rock smirked at Tally and began shooting again anyway. One less zombie to deal with in the future, right? That was the case, until Tally saw the one in the collar. \"No! Not that one!\" he shouted, Little Rock jerking in surprise. The bullet launched from her gun and into a zombie, but it was the zombie standing beside the collared one that was hit. Together, they tumbled to the ground. She popped her head back into the window and ground her teeth. \"What's up with you? Tally, the man who wouldn't let a zombie walk on this earth for a second, suddenly wants them to walk around and keep me from shooting them?\" she snapped. \"I-uh-just wanted to shoot that one myself. Sorry, I got a little competitive there.\" Tally lied, cracking an awkward smile for backup. Little Rock leaned forward and stared into his eyes for a moment, smiling brightly. \"Liar.\" she said. \"It ain't a lie!\" he snapped back, a little pissed at her sight of him. \"Liar, liar, pants on fire, hanging from a telly wire!\" she chanted back. \"Fine, I lied. Happy now?\" he asked back, admitting defeat. \"You've been off since you got out of that shop. Tell us about it. What happened in there?\" she asked. \"I didn't want you to shoot that one because it didn't attack me. Back when I was in the SAFEWAY, it just stood there and stared at me. It didn't attack me at all. I was sitting there for twenty minutes, just hiding, and it didn't even try to harm me.\" he admitted. \"What?\" Wichita exclaimed from the front seat, her voice high and squeaky in surprise. \"It didn't attack you. How is that even possible? These things run around eating people, Tally, they don't just stand there and stare at you.\" Little Rock replied, slipping casually into the seat next to him. \"Yeah, you got proof?\" Wichita asked, peeking into the back mirror at him. Tally dug through his bag, yanking out a rather large box of Snowballs. \"It was after these, not me. It even traded me my guns and knives back to get more of them.\" he stated, pushing the box back into the bag. \"Whatever, man. Sucks that we had to leave it behind, then.\" Little Rock said, looking out the window.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Friend After a four hour drive in the countryside, Wichita parked the car beside a massive barn on the side of the road, scanning the area with Little Rock just to be sure it was safe. It was safe, by god, and had no zombies, lots of food and several easily and well protected floors. Wichita supported the Flordan as he exited the car, hauling him up the stairs to the second floor and settling him down beside a window. After settling themselves in for a while stay, they girls could no longer hold in their amusement. They began to laugh as loud as their lungs could possibly allow. \"What? It's true! Dammit, if I didn't know better, I'd say that zombie was protecting me!\" Tally growled, clearly pissed. \"Sorry, but when I hear \"a zombie spared my ass and I'm the most dangerous killer alive\", I would laugh too!\" Little Rock howled. Together, the three amigos settled in for the night, bunking down in the heavily fortified second floor. FIVE DAYS LATER: \"Why can't we move on? We've been here for days!\" Tally groaned as he sat on his blanket. \"Well, how about you ask your damn leg? Mister \"I have to have that one goddamn Twinkie out there left\", even if it kills me!\" Wichita snapped back. \"Hey, I'm still capable of travel!\" Tally exclaimed back, throwing his hands into the air. \"Then, drive the car.\" Wichita hissed back, smirking devilishly at him. \"Dammit!\" Tally cried, plopping backwards onto the rest of his blanket in a huff of annoyance. Little Rock smiled at him, egging him to snipe zombies from the other farms in the area. \"Alright, just don't shoot unless I say, got it?\" he asked, the girl nodding back to him. Two hours later, the girls had gone to bed, Wichita on her small cot and Little Rock curled into her side. Tallahassee was bored. The girls were sleeping and he was cleaning his weapons, again. He jumped at the sound of distant moaning from downstairs, when it finally grabbed his attention. \"Damn.\" he whispered, making it to the window. Peeking outside, a larger group of about twenty or so bloody dead people were passing by, as expected. \"And I have to be fucking invalid right now.\" he whispered, cursing himself. He could damn well just sit here and kill them all…..To his horror, the group stopped. They moaned and made choking sounds, followed by a short gurgle. Two zombies moved towards the house first, followed by the rest. 'Shit!' he thought, racing to the top of the stairs. And before he could warn the girls, two intruders were at the bottom of the wooden planks, shambling their way up. And guess who left the door unlocked? Cocking his shotgun, and with two clean headshots, both bodies hit the floor. He peeked over the railing, seeing at least a dozen heads peering up at him. Well, he had their attention now. Little Rock came running up beside him, gunning down the zombies that came for her with a rifle. Wichita was up, too, taking them out with a plain knife and machete. A few minutes of shooting later, and the few alive zombies left were shambling away into the night. Tally and Little Rock were gunning them down, in case they tried to get more to follow them for another attack. Before Tally knew what was happening, he watched the collared one get shot down. Somehow, it hurt to watch this one fall. It was quiet for awhile before Wichita got up and began dragging the bloody bodies out the door and into the cornfield, setting them on fire. Just as the last few bodies were dragged out the door, it began to rain. While the girls finished their job, Tally stood out in the door frame, letting the rain dribble off his hat and shoulders. He put buckets out so they could have clean water to drink, pausing when he heard a groan behind him. Carefully stalking forward, he found the collared one buried under a pile of burnt bodies, weakly struggling to escape. \"You again?\" he asked, gaining its attention. He chuckled as it clumsily pushed against the pile, letting out another groan. \"Look at ya. Is playing dead your favorite game?\" he laughed, dangling his shotgun barrel over its forehead. The creature was pinned on its back, weakly thrashing its arms as he shoved the barrel in its face. It squeaked and shoved a little harder against the pile, Tally watching it for a quiet moment. \"Tallahassee? What's taking so long?\" Wichita's voice called from the barn. Stowing his shotgun, Tally dipped his hat to the zombie, walking away. \"Nothing! I'm coming!\" he called back, walking back into the barn. He sat with the girls around a fire, eating some food to fuel up for the night to come. Each person froze when they heard the loud crashing of metal outside. \"Another one?\" Little Rock whispered, moving to pick up her rifle. \"I think I know what it is. Let me handle it.\" Tally smiled, heading to the window to peek out. He grinned wider when he spotted his prey, moving to the top of the stairs. \"I knew it.\" he said, dashing down the wooden planks as quickly as he could. The girls followed, curious of the situation. As expected, he walked to the front door, unlocked and yanked it open, only to see the zombie kneeling on the ground over the bucket. It was drinking hastily, as if trying to down everything in one shot. \"And? What is it?\" Little Rock asked, peeking outside from Tally's armpit. Wichita poked her head outside through the hole left by Tally's hip, a strange expression crossing her face. \"Is that even a zombie? Is that the one you were telling us about?\" she asked, Tally nodding. \"We should bring him in with us.\" he said, Wichita giving him a threatening stare. \"Are you insane? We don't want a mutated zombie sitting with us!\" Little Rock cried, her shrill voice startling the zombie. Tally watched as it sucked in too much water, coughing excessively to rid itself of pain in being startled. \"You take care of the buckets, I'll take care of him.\" he said, reaching into his pocket for his secret weapon. Slowly walking up, he held out the package to the zombie. \"Hey, remember me?\" he asked, gaining the zombie's attention. It slowly turned around, humming at him in recognition. He held out the package to it, watching as the other's eyes began to shine. Reaching out, it tried to take its prize. Tally drew slightly away, hoping to lure it into following him. \"Want to eat it?\" he asked, taking a step back. The zombie stood up, letting a tiny click echo from its teeth. Backing slowly away, Tally drew the zombie into the house, keeping the Snowball in its sights just in case. It followed him soundlessly, eyes locked on the food. The girls paused in their job, watching him force the creature to sit on the ground beside him. \"Here you go.\" he finally said, handing the prize to the zombie's eager hands. \"What are you going to do with it?\" Little Rock asked, sitting beside him. \"Maybe, train it like a dog?\" Wichita asked, causing the both of them to chuckle. \"There's only one way to find out if it's actually a zombie. You two get a washbin ready. Our friend here is getting a bath today.\" Tally smiled, glancing at the zombie as it munched on the Snowballs. The first part of the plan went smoothly: the girls got the water into an old tub while Tally tried to undress the newcomer. At least, he tried to. The zombie flailed and cried as he peeled off the old clothing, barely managing to hold onto him. \"Stop it, ya damn baby! Be a man and take your fucking bath!\" Tally shouted, slamming the newcomer into the bathtub water. Once the zombie was fully situated in the warm fluid, Tally turned to the girls. \"Okay, now get me some soap and help me wash him!\" he shouted, holding the zombie in the water. \"Ew, no! I'll get you the soap, but you're washing him!\" Wichita exclaimed, throwing some towels and several bars of soap into the room. Little Rock walked in a little while later with a toothbrush and toothpaste, placing it on a stool next to the tub. While Tally was washing the kid's hair and backside, the kid picked up the toothbrush and paste, brushing his teeth. When he finished, they were pearly white and perfectly straight. When all the gunk was out of the kid's hair, Tally finally noticed some fresh blood gently oozing out of the side of the kid's head. He gently touched it, jerking backwards when the zombie turned and snapped at him with pearly teeth. Not long later, the girls were sitting in the living room around the fire when Tallahassee entered the room, followed by the newcomer. The boy was very clean now, his skin nearly all white while he wore too large sweatpants and a too large long sleeve. The old, bloody, ripped clothing was thrown away. \"Let me introduce to you, Snowball, healthy unbitten human.\" Tally smiled, giving a bow in the direction of the teen. Said teen growled slightly in annoyance at his name. \"Why \"Snowball\" anyway?\" Little Rock asked once Tally sat down. \"He likes them.\" he smiled back, holding up a small package of the treat. The zombie grabbed them and literally swallowed one whole. Wichita looked the newcomer up and down, eyeing his body. \"A zombie is okay with being skinny, but a human shouldn't look like this. With clothes on, he looks like there's no flesh on him at all.\" she whispered to Tally, who nodded in agreement. Together, they sat by the fire, the zombie staring intensely at the flames, humming monotone notes. After a little while, Little Rock hummed the notes back to him, turning to him. The corners of his lips flicked upwards in a small smile, humming louder. With his monotone notes mixed with Little Rock's, they sounded like a pretty good song. The three partners eventually fell asleep to the zombie's humming, leaving Tallahassee to drift off last.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Trouble When Tally woke again, the boy wasn't sitting there like he'd expected. He got up and walked around the extent of the building, trying to find their newcomer, in vain. \"Where did he go?\" he asked aloud, his eyes catching on the flash of a hand behind a door. Gently pulling it back, he kept the squeaking to a minimum to take a quieter closer look. The boy was standing there, eyes closed. \"Holy shit. That's adorable.\" he whispered to himself, watching the boy sway a little on his feet. 'Wait….is he sleeping? Is this how he sleeps?' Tally suddenly thought, waving a hand in front of the boy's face. Nothing moved. Thinking rapidly, Tally snuck up to Little Rock's backpack and pulled out her Polaroid Camera. Checking the shots left, he crept back to the boy and raising the camera to his eye. Snapping a quick photo, he stowed the shot in his pocket before returning the camera to its rightful owner. Lying back down to watch the boy, he waited for the others to begin to rise. Slowly, each one took notice of his position, bringing it into the conversation. \"That's so cool! I tried to do that one time, and I faceplanted when I fell asleep.\" Little Rock whispered excitedly. Everyone watched the boy intensely as he slept, though he didn't appear happy whilst standing during his slumber. He looked rather tenser than ever in doing so. When he finally did open his eyes and wake up, he turned to look at the trio staring at him from the campfire. A faint blush came to his cheeks as he walked to them, accepting his breakfast with a tiny smile. While Tally and Wichita planned their new route, Little Rock attempted getting Snowball to speak english. \"Say \"Hello!\", Snowball! Hello!\" she said. Snowball opened his mouth and replied with a gurgle in his throat. \"No, Snowball. Say, Hello. Hell-oh.\" she restated, offering her hand to him. Tally turned to her and shook her hand. \"Hello, my name is Tallahassee. Now, you try.\" he said, offering his hand to Snowball. \"Hello, my name is Snowball.\" Tally said, watching as Snowball tentatively took his hand and gave it a weak shake. Snowball opened his mouth, forcing Little Rock and Tally to wait for his speech. He only gurgled again, slightly louder this time. \"No, say hello, Snowball. Hell-oh.\" Tally repeated, giving a small smile. \"H-hell-ill-o-oh.\" a weak voice replied. \"Good boy!\" Tally said, bringing the boy into a hug. When he released him, he took his hand again. \"Alright, now put it all together.\" he said. \"H-hell-o. M-my name is-is….\" Snowball began, trailing off with a blank look on his face. \"Snowball? What's wrong?\" Little Rock asked, sensing the distress from the boy. \"Wha-what is-is my name?\" he asked, gripping his head in his hands. His eyes turned blank and dark, lacking all emotion. He appeared to be trying to remember something, something important to him. \"What's your name, Snowball?\" Tally asked, restating the question. \"M-my an-name is-is…..?\" Snowball tried again, scratching furiously at his neck and face. Tally lunged forward and grabbed his wrists, pinning them to his own chest. He tugged the boy against him, holding him tightly to himself. Using a free hand, he rubbed his finger pads gently over Snowball's spinal cord, allowing the boy to breathe deeply into his neck. \"Now, what's your name?\" he asked again. \"My-my name is Snowball.\" Snowball finally said, leaning forward into the Flordan's chest as a couple tears spilled down his pale cheeks. From her position on the far side of the group, Wichita raised her head, eager to change the subject. \"I say we head east towards Tennessee, then north towards Virginia. Anyone object to that plan?\" she asked, looking at the group expectantly. Tally looked up from holding Snowball, turning to her with slightly sad eyes. \"No, we're good to go.\" he replied quickly, Snowball refusing to remove himself from the Flordan's chest. Tally and Wichita packed the car for the next trip, making sure to double pack the Snowball box for Snowball's huge appetite, while Little Rock tried to play Patty-Cakes with him in the barn. After a couple of minutes, Tally's ears pricked up at the sound of Little Rock crying out. Grabbing his shotgun, Wichita followed suit behind him as they booked it into the massive structure of the barn. They searched around a bit, calling Little Rock's name in panic. \"Little Rock, get your ass out here before I kick it!\" Wichita snapped loudly as she neared the animal stables. To her shock, her little sister came bolting around the side of a horse stable, panic in her features. She raced up to Tally, grabbing his shirt. \"I didn't know what to do!\" she cried, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"Calm down. What happened?\" Tally asked, taking her calmly into his arms. \"We were playing in the barn and we found a secret basement door and we opened it and zombies came pouring out and Snowball fell down the stairs into them to save me!\" she cried, taking his hand and leading him in the direction she'd come. \"Shit!\" he cursed, racing to keep up with her as they ran to the basement door. Zombies had come pouring out of it, only because they had been people locked down there by raiders, and forgotten in the passage of time. The blood spatters and signs told them that. Tally glanced down the stairs, running while shooting at the same time, and spotted Snowball lying in a pile of bones. He wasn't moving, but he didn't seem dead, either. Wichita raced up to the Flordan, blasting a zombie's head off next to him while kicking another to the ground and stabbing it in the eye. \"Go get him!\" she cried, aiming her shotgun down the stairs and shooting to give him cover. He booked it down the wooden planks, scooping up the boy and bolting back up in record time. They threw the door shut, racing for the car. Throwing Tally and Snowball into the backseat, Wichita and Little Rock jumped into the front, the elder starting the car and pounding the gas. The car tires screeched as they zoomed out of the building, smashing into several zombies on the way out. Wichita didn't slow down for another twenty minutes, the car lurching forward painfully hard every time she hit the gas again. When everyone had finally calmed down, Tally turned to Snowball and felt the boy gently curl into his chest. \"You alright, spitfuck?\" he asked, hearing a tiny whimper leak from the boy's mouth. Carefully raising his hand to cradle the boy's head, he pulled him closer, taking a deep breath. \"I wouldn't let them hurt you, you know? You're too…...special to me. I won't let anything happen to ya, got it?\" the Flordan asked, Snowball nervously nodding against him. Tally hadn't taken the time to actually look at the boy: pale, skinny as all hell, black and short curly hair, bright blue eyes, a thin face, pretty tall, long legged, kinda girly in all looks. Tally refused to stop holding Snowball through the next four hours, the group traveling easily through the countryside.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Contact The next four days passed quick and quietly enough, the group packing almost constantly and traveling along the interstates. If not for his current state, Tally could say Snowball ate constantly, or tried to. They were moseying along a Tennessee interstate when Wichita hit the brake…. hard . Tallahassee's face slammed into the dashboard, startling him from his sleep. \"Fucking hell! I'm up!\" he shouted, rubbing his pained nose as he re-adjusted himself in his seat. \"What's up?\" Little Rock asked from the backseat, watching her sister point at the large fence strewn across the road, bordered by several armed guards. Armed military men were standing in front of the huge gate, spanning almost twenty feet across, while each carried something similar to an assault rifle. One stepped out from inside the gate, raising a megaphone to his mouth. \"Identify yourselves! Who are you?\" he demanded, the soldiers raising their guns to the car and taking a few steps closer. Wichita stuck her head out the window and waved. \"Hey, good to see some people are still alive around here! We're just traveling around and possibly looking for a place to stay!\" she shouted back. The commander lifted a hand, the soldiers lowering their guns as he stepped up to her window. \"Evening, miss. Sorry about that. Just some formal test to ensure no mutations of the plague have happened.\" the commander apologized. \"Not a problem, sir.\" Wichita replied quickly, sensing his authority. \"Great. Alright, how many have you got with you?\" he asked, lifting a clipboard to his eyes. \"I've got my little sister, and my two friends. So, four.\" she said. The man wrote the number down and nodded politely to her. \"Alright, miss. We'll let you all through. So, when you get inside the gate, I want you to follow the signs to the Front Desk. There, you should be able to park your car and sign up for a Housing Unit for all of you. Everything is shared here, miss, but we've got plenty of space for people who want their own houses.\" the soldier said. \"Thanks.\" Wichita replied, watching the man step back from the car and signal to the other soldiers at the gate to open it. Two massive metallic doors quickly flipped open, allowing them to drive the car inside. Once inside, a beautiful community of homes and military installments greeted them. Even a CDC Lab stood within its walls. Snowball was looking around nervously, unable to sit still and rather fidgeting with his hands and knees. \"Alright, we've got ourselves a place to stay! How about that?\" Wichita asked, Tally nodding happily to her. They drove to the Front Desk, which happened to be a building at the front of all the installments. While everyone popped out of the car, guns flew to Snowball once he exited. \"What the hell?\" Little Rock asked, throwing her hands into the air as the others did, except Snowball. One soldier raised his radio to his mouth, pressing a button. \"Civilian Transport 12 contained an Infected. I repeated: CT 12 had an Infected with them.\" the soldier said, speaking to someone on the other end of the line. \"Copy that. Commander is en route now.\" a voice crackled back through the radio. The soldier who spoke on the radio nodded to the others, who closed in on the group. \"On the ground, now! Knees, on your knees, hands in the air!\" they began shouting, aiming their weapons at critical parts of the group's body. Tally and Wichita dropped to their knees, folding their hands behind their heads. Little Rock copied them, looking to Snowball as he simply stood there, attempting to get his hands above his head. \"On the ground!\" a soldier said, walking up to Snowball and pushing him roughly to the asphalt. The boy's body landed sideways with a soft thud, Snowball refusing to move after that. He stared fearfully at Tally, who looked back to him in panic. \"Hey, be careful man! He's human, not a zombie!\" he cried, watching the soldiers turn towards him. The soldier standing over Snowball aimed the barrel of his AK over the back of his head, bending his arms behind his back and cuffing them together. \"We've told people like you not to bring Infected in here. Why do you keep doing it?\" another soldier asked, casually walking up to Wichita. \"We told you: he's not infected. He's human, still. Just a little hungry, that's all.\" she snapped back. \"That's enough!\" a voice called out from behind them. Turning his head, Tally spotted a woman getting out of a buggy, walking up to them. She wore military garbs, and carried an AK herself. \"Commander!\" one of the soldiers exclaimed, saluting her. \"Forget the rank, soldier, focus on the situation.\" she said, stepping in front of Tallahassee. \"Sir, it seems you have someone who might be carrying the Virus with you. For security reasons, we will need to have you all transported to the CDC Lab for testing. Nothing bad should come of it, I assure you.\" the woman said. One of the soldiers helped Tally to stand up, now that his hands had been cuffed. \"What's with the cuffs, then, lady? Not to be offensive or anything, but why the force?\" he asked back. \"Force is needed when we have so many breaches in our security. We've lost twenty six civilians before you arrived. It would be best if they were on the only ones we lose in the next few months.\" the woman replied. Wichita walked over to stand beside him, glancing nervously at Snowball. \"And what's going to happen to Snowball?\" she asked, gesturing to the boy lying on his stomach on the ground. The woman glanced at him, turning to give her a stern look. \"I don't know what his results will show and I can't guarantee that he will return with you.\" she stated honestly. \"You mean, he might not come back with us?\" Little Rock asked, tears pricking in her eyes. \"Yes.\" the woman replied. She nodded to the soldier standing over Snowball, Tally watching the man haul the boy unsteadily to his feet. They were lead slowly down a few empty streets towards a massive building, wide rather than tall, labeled: \"CDC: Disease Research and Containment Center, Tennessee. The first soldier in the group paused, swiping a keycard at the door. With a small click, the two metallic doors slid open wide enough to be measures five feet across. The entire group marched inside into the lobby, where a military dressed receptionist was waiting. \"Civilians, new, awaiting virus testing. They possibly have an Infected with them.\" a second soldier stated. \"Down the hall, second door on the left.\" she said, pointing to her right. The first group, containing Tally, Little Rock and Wichita, began to march down the said hallway, leaving Snowball standing at the desk with the second group of soldiers and the commander. As soon as Little Rock took notice of the situation change, she whipped around and began to struggle against her captors. \"Snowball! Snowball! Where are you taking him? Why isn't he going with us? Snowball! We're coming back for you!\" she cried, tears streaming down her face. The soldiers began to drag her by her shoulders as she shouted, ignoring her pleas to be released to her friend. \"Sis, you need to listen to me. They're taking him somewhere else, yeah, and we don't know where that is. They could be taking him somewhere bad, yeah, but we don't know that, do we? So, how about we drill the asshole who's doing this and get our answers then?\" Wichita asked, Little Rock nodding in agreement. \"Don't cry, sweetheart. We'll be fine, he'll be fine, too. Trust me.\" Tally said, knowing well he may have made a promise he couldn't keep. They turned their attention back to the hall they were being marched down, being turned to the left and shoved through a door before having it lock behind them. Dim blue lights turned on above them, illuminating Tally's white shirt and Little Rock's shoes. A red beam shot down from the ceiling, scanning across them before snapping out of view. \"What was that?\" Little Rock asked, turning confusedly to her sister. \"I don't know.\" Wichita replied before they heard a speaker switch on. \"UV SCAN COMPLETE. SCANS ONE OF SEVEN COMPLETE. RESULT: NEGATIVE.\" a monotone voice replied. \"Great, this is going to take awhile.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Testing About twenty minutes later, when the scans were complete, a massive door on the other side of the room slid open. The trio walked through it, finding themselves surrounded by a massive lab. Four soldiers stood on either side of them, blocking their escape. The woman from before stood in front of both rows of soldiers, holding a clipboard. \"Welcome to society.\" she said, cracking a tiny smile. \"Where's Snowball?\" Little Rock exclaimed, stepping forward to stand squarely in front of the woman. \"He's undergoing some more testing. Ours scans don't get everything, kiddo. There's still more for you three to do, too.\" she replied casually. \"But, he's not dead, right?\" Wichita asked, the woman nodding. \"Correct. Anyway, let's get off with the introductions. I'm Commander Dawn, leader of this base. The base is called B12 and is formed in Tennessee, I'm not going to tell you where. Anyhow, your preliminary scans came up negative, yay, it means you don't carry the virus, so far. However, you need to get bloodwork done and some basic physical and mental testing done just in case. I have three different doctors prepared for each of you. And yes, you do need to be seperated. Questions?\" Dawn asked. \"What kind of virus is it?\" Wichita asked. \"It's an evolved form of Ebola, and so far it's been untreatable. We've been looking for Patient Zero since our first reports started coming in, but we've had nothing so far.\" Dawn replied swiftly. \"What do you do with the Infected you find?\" Little Rock asked. \"We kill them on strict orders to prevent the virus from spreading.\" Dawn replied, Little Rock looking nervously at the medical tents set up in the room. \"Anything else?\" Dawn asked, everyone shaking their heads. \"Good. Follow me.\" she said, leading them to the first tent. A male scientist stood in front of it, holding a clipboard. \"Mickey Knox?\" the man asked, Tally stepping forward. He followed the man into the tent, watching Wichita and Little Rock walk past it with nervous glances aimed at him. The doctor told him to sit in the medical chair in the back of the tent, Tally nervously glancing at the man as he strapped him in. \"I am going to take some blood, ask you some questions, and have you perform a few physical exercises for me. Is that alright with you?\" the man asked. Tally nodded, wincing as the needle entered his arm. He watched the scientist fill several vials with blood before removing the needle and placing a bandaid over it. He was given a page from a book to read aloud, trying his best to sound literate even with his low education. \"Thank you. That's enough.\" the doctor said, taking the page from him. \"How was it? I didn't get the best education open to me, so I'm a little nervous that I might've missed some words.\" Tally asked, the doctor giving him a strange look. \"Your score was perfectly fine. A few errors, nothing more that would mark you as infected.\" the doctor replied, gesturing for him to stand up. The doctor had him touch his toes and twist this way and that, displaying his mobility and physical capability. \"Perfect score! We haven't seen that for a long time.\" the doctor said, gesturing for him to sit back in the chair. The doctor didn't strap him back in, however, and chose to stand off to the side, messing with the blood vials. Tally looked up to see Dawn walking to the front of his tent, standing with a radio in her hand. \"Can you all hear me?\" she asked, Tally nodding in response. \"Good. As you know, I am Commander Dawn of the Eighth Military Division stationed here at the CDC in Tennessee. Since the outbreak, we've been given strict orders to kill all infected until the cure is found. So, we're testing your blood for the possibility that your cells contain the antidote agent. However, there are consequences if one of you carries that agent in your bloodstream, as you should know. As far as our orders go, whoever has that antibody within their system will not be allowed to leave this facility. That antibody will need to be isolated and distributed across the planet before that happens. To my great delight, all of you are clear of the virus and do not carry the antibody. Your friend, however, is another story. I will have you transported to the Observation Room so I can speak with you privately.\" Dawn explained, turning off the radio. Several soldiers escorted Tally to another room, dark but illuminated with UV lights. Dawn sat behind a desk, a stack of papers in her hands. \"Where's Snowball?\" Little Rock asked, stepping up to the desk. \"You are a very brazen young lady. \"Snowball\" is in the next room, currently being restrained while we speak.\" Dawn replied. \"Show me.\" Little Rock demanded. Dawn turned to a light switch on the wall, flicking it upwards. The lights in the room next door flicked on, displaying Snowball lying on the floor trying to protect himself from the sterile blinding lights. The group could see him through a tinted glass wall, of which made up one of the walls of Snowball's room. \"Snowball!\" Little Rock cried, slamming her hands against the glass. \"He can't hear you. He's been drugged since he was uncooperative with our testing.\" Dawn explained, tears welling in Little Rock's eyes. \"You drugged him? How could you do that to him? You could have just explained it to him!\" Wichita snapped, waving her fist at the woman. \"It was a mild sedative. We're surprised it worked so well. Usually it's only effective on rabbits or dogs.\" Dawn replied. Tally noticed the three chairs in front of Dawn's desk, choosing to sit in one and face the woman. \"What have ya got to tell us?\" he asked. \"What can you tell me about your friend?\" she asked back, avoiding the question. \"He's nothing more than a friend. A little spitfuck that survives when he should be dead by now.\" Tally replied. \"He's my best friend, and a damn good one at that!\" Little Rock cried as Wichita held her close. \"He came to us while we were traveling on an interstate. Tally met him in a store, when he had no weapons. The kid traded him weapons for food, as a zombie. When we realized he wasn't a zombie, we cleaned him up and added him to the crew.\" Wichita explained. Tally turned his attention back to the glass, where Snowball was desperately trying to cover his eyes by lying on his stomach and curling his arms around his head. He lie there panting, unmoving, his bright blue eyes half lidded and pricking with tears. Dawn held up the papers now, flipping through their contents. \"This is a file we printed from a cell tower in Columbus, Ohio. This is the information on your friend here, before the outbreak happened.\" Dawn explained, handing the papers to Tallahassee. NAME: COLUMBUS EISENBERG TOWER LOCATION: COLUMBUS, OHIO BLOOD TYPE: O- AGE: 20 GENDER: MALE EYE COLOR: BLUE MEDICAL STATUS: OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER, ANXIETY DISORDER, SOCIAL ANXIETY, ASPERGERS LAST KNOWN LOCATION: FORT CLEVELAND, OHIO FIELD OF STUDY: ADVANCED SCIENCES VIRUS TEST: NEGATIVE PHYSICAL MOBILITY TEST: NEGATIVE VERBIAGE TEST: NEGATIVE \"I figured as much.\" Wichita said, reading over Tally's shoulder. Most of the document was a profile on the kid, being pages long and listing dozens of areas he'd lived or worked in before and since the outbreak. \"Columbus, as the community called him, was born with a rare form of Autism known as Aspergers. This made him extremely intelligent in whatever field he chose to study. Since the outbreak, he lived in a protected community known as Cleveland until he vanished suddenly on a mission while out with a Scavenging crew.\" Dawn explained. \"Many people disappeared during the outbreak. Why should we be concerned about his vanishing?\" Tally asked. \"The doctors manning the outbreak center in Cleveland isolated a sample of his blood. He vanished on the day they got the results.\" Dawn added. \"What does that mean?\" Little Rock asked, turning to the commander. \"It means it wasn't a coincidence. Someone forced him to leave or he was running from something.\" Wichita explained. \"Yes, read the last line.\" Dawn finished, pointing to the final page in the paper. Tally glanced over the pages to the final one, eyes scanning over the final few words: VIRUS TEST: NEGATIVE AGENT TEST: POSITIVE \"He's got the cure.\" Tally said slowly, letting each syllable roll off his tongue. \"What?\" Wichita cried, snatching the papers from him and scanning them herself. \"Correct. Before he vanished from Fort Cleveland, he gave blood for the test. The results came back on the day he vanished and they are positive for the cure agent we've been looking for. We're retesting him now to make sure that is the case.\" Dawn explained. \"So, you're saying that Snowball carries the cure to the zombies?\" Little Rock asked, Dawn nodding. \"We can save them. We can save the people we lost.\" Tally whispered, Wichita pulling him into a hug. \"Don't worry. After this, we can go look for your little boy. Okay?\" she asked, Tally nodding against her. To their surprise, a soldier entered the room and held a piece of paper out to the commander. \"The results, commander.\" he stated, handing it to her and quickly leaving the room. Dawn took a moment to read over the paper, eyes scanning at a rapid pace over the small print. She looked up at the trio, cracking a wide smile. \"It seems he carries a version of the virus, as well as the antibody. Somewhere along the line, it appears he was bitten and turned into what we called a \"Pseudo-Zombie\".\" she explained. \"What's a \"Pseudo-Zombie?\"\" Little Rock asked, Dawn also earning a curious glance from Wichita. \"A PZ, or Pseudo-Zombie, is the name given to a human in the process of mutating into a zombie, or given the influence to act as one.\" the commander explained. \"So, he was bitten at some point after vanished from Cleveland, Ohio, traveled all the way to Arkansas with a group of zombies, and somehow managed to become one of them.\" Wichita said, piecing all the information together. \"But, something doesn't make sense. Why did he leave the old compound in Cleveland?\" Little Rock asked aloud, scratching her head. \"We got reports that Cleveland had been overrun in just a few days after he vanished. We have reason to believe that one of the head honchos there was trying to kill a lot of people and take over the rest of the fort with a small group of Ravagers.\" Dawn stated. Tally paused, glancing at Snowball, or rather, Columbus, in the next room. He looked so scared, so frightened that someone or something was going to hurt him. The look he had on his face made Tally's heart break. \"So, what're you going to do with him? Simple blood draws or what?\" Wichita asked, taking the words from the Flordan's mouth. \"Lots of testing will need to be done to isolate his antibody. As you know, he won't be able to leave here. However, I do need one thing from you, since he doesn't appear to be able to give it to me.\" Dawn said, sliding a document across the desk into Tally's view. \"What's that?\" Little Rock asked, pointing at the finely printed document. Dawn handed Tally a pen and marked where to sign. \"This is a document used to prevent ill intent on our facility. No harm has ever come to our patients, but just in case, we have our parently figures sign it to prevent claims of damage and death.\" Dawn replied. Tally carefully read over the document, trying to process everything in his brain. Several minutes later, when he was satisfied with his comprehension, he turned to the girls. \"This is a group choice. We make it together. Yes or no?\" he asked. \"What choice? There isn't a choice to make!\" Wichita exclaimed, crossing her arms defiantly. \"There is, young lady. Columbus holds the key to humanity's survival at this point in time. You either give us permission or not. Your species is on the line.\" Dawn added. \"Do it.\" Little Rock said. After a brief look of surprise on the commander's face, the woman recomposed herself and watched Tally sign the document. Folding it neatly and placing it into an envelope, she sealed it with a pin and smiled at them. \"The world thanks you in advance.\" she said, standing up and leaving the room. The second the woman was gone, Wichita wheeled on Tallahassee. \"You don't know what they could do to him! Why give them permission? They could kill him or worse!\" she snapped. \"Would you rather have more hell breaking loose and all of us losing? We risk everyone for the sake of a tiny risk to him. You don't have enough to lose, girls! I do! And, I'm not willing to risk that my little boy can still be saved and he's still out there waiting for me!\" Tally snapped back, standing up to his full towering height. The two children went silent after his outburst, sitting on the floor with their heads bowed. To their shock, loud thumps gained their attention at the window. Turning around, Tally spotted Columbus standing against the glass, bumping his head uselessly against it. Lifting a hand to the glass, the Flordan rested his palm in the impression of the boy's head, feeling his heart slow a little. \"I can-an he-hell-help yo-you. I-It's no-not safe he-here. Will-will yo-you help me-me?\" his weak voice asked through the glass. Tally grinned wickedly wide. \"Hell yeah, spitfuck.\" he replied.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Hellfire \"First course of action: getting out of here.\" Wichita said, eyes scanning about the room. Together, the moved about the small space, intent on finding an escape route. Peeking through the keyhole in the door, Tally looked about outside for anyone approaching or leaving. \"Seven to the left, four to the right. Dawn's at some kind of command post. We could just walk out and ask to find our house?\" Tally suggested. \"Good idea.\" Wichita said, turning to Little Rock. \"Tell him we're coming back for him. We've got to go, now, so be quick about it.\" she whispered to the child. Little Rock turned to the glass and ran up to it, smacking her hands against it. Feeling the vibration of the material, Columbus' eyes rose dipped to her height, the boy appearing to be looking her in the eyes. \"We're coming back, okay? We're not going to leave you here, I promise.\" she said, stepping away and heading back to stand beside her sister. Columbus let out an agonizing moan, bumping his head against the glass once more as the trio slipped out of the room and into the next. Tally was the first to approach the commander, giving her a wistful smile to begin the conversation. \"Ah, Mickey. I presume you've said your goodbyes for now?\" she asked, Tally giving a nod. \"Yeah. Listen, the girls and I were wondering when we were supposed to see that house assigned to us.\" he said, getting to business right off the bat. Dawn nodded, picking up a nearby clipboard. \"It looks like you were assigned to H5. One of my men can lead you there.\" she said, a soldier stepping forward to assist them. The man led the group out of the building and to a smaller house resembling something you'd see in the suburbs: old woodwork, newly repainted, clean and habitable. They had just walked in the front door when they were alerted to the sounds of screams from outside. A wall of human traffic was massing on the streets, swaying different directions as people rushed to avoid an incoming attack. Tally saw a soldier standing in the street with a megaphone, shouting orders to people around him. \"Get to your assigned house and get to the basement! You will be protected there!\" he cried. Tally grabbed his shoulder and turned the man to face him. \"What's going on?\" he shouted above the noise of the gathering crowd. \"Ravagers, sir! They're invading from another camp! We had a leak of information and they've come looking for us and our supplies!\" the man shouted back, before being swept away in a sea of bodies. Tally froze, the noise around him fading into distant roars. His eyes swelled with flames, his chest becoming tight in anger. \"She kept this from us. She thought not telling us about the Ravagers coming after Columbus was a good idea.\" he whispered to himself, mind a tangle of distant thoughts and newfound ones. To his fright, he looked up to see Little Rock running in the direction of the lab, of which was suddenly blown up on one side due to a rocket impact. \"Sis, come back! It's not safe!\" Wichita cried, running after her. The cries of the teen were enough to push him back into combat mode, the man quickly bending to scoop up an AK-47 before rushing after the duo. After losing them in the blasts of smoke and gunfire, he paused to locate them by sound. Hearing their shouting voices, he discovered them crouching by several damaged tractors. \"I can't find him anywhere!\" Little Rock cried, her tears trailing loose down her cheeks. Cries to their south gained the trio's attention, causing Tally to turn towards it. \"Let's go this way.\" he said, the girls following him close behind as he ran for the next section of cover. They followed the cries to the front of the camp, finding the entire border wall blocked by tanks and other heavy military machines occupied by the Ravagers. \"We can't get out and they'll eventually kill enough people that this camp will be swarming with infected!\" he heard a soldier shout to some civilians. Tally paused, going over the facts: shooting live people, letting said people turn into zombies, zombies eat live people, kill zombies and take over camp….\"That's their plan! Shoot them, not the zombies!\" Tally cried, bolting from his cover and shooting wildly at the Ravager blockade. Several mad-men went down before they turned their attention to him, returning his fire. He dove behind some cover, ducking crazily to avoid being struck with bullets. He got up on one knee, raising his gun to fire before he felt the stinging pain of a bullet piercing his arm. 'Damn, that was my shooting arm!' he cursed, clapping a hand over the bleeding wound in hopes to prevent himself from bleeding out. \"Tallahassee!\" Wichita cried, making a move like she was going to run for him. He lifted a hand, gritting his teeth in a crazy smile. \"You crazy son of a bitch!\" she cried, picking up a fallen soldier's AR-12 and cocking it. While she and Little Rock were returning fire, he crawled his way back towards their cover and leaned his back against it. He puffed in pain, Little Rock working quickly to wrap his wound to stop the bleeding. At the sound of more screams coming from behind him, he turned his head to see a massive wave of infected stumbling their way to the front of the camp. He recognised Columbus' face towards the center of it, the young man turning to stumble towards him. None of the other zombies followed, instead making their slow pace towards their new prey. The pseudo-zombie knelt in front of the Flordan, eyes full of sorrow. \"I ain't going to die yet, kiddo. Good plan, mind if we join in?\" he asked, Columbus nodding joyfully. Wichita handed Tally his gun and they returned fire on the Ravagers, occupying them to let the zombies get close enough to attack. Slow but surely, the Ravagers went down one by one, their screams of agony music to Tally's ears. The soldiers from the fort raised their weapons and began to fire at the infected now leaving the camp, shooting them down in spurts of loud bangs. Columbus stood beside the girls, watching the soldiers shoot down his old family. Once all of them were down, the soldiers cheered in victory, letting out loud laughs and cries of anguish. Hearing a click behind him, Tally turned to see Dawn raising her gun, the bullet firing into Columbus' back. The young man let out a strained cry, falling to the ground with a loud thump. Tallahassee moved to intercept Dawn's weapon, instead looking down the barrel of her pistol himself. \"What are you doing?\" he snapped, eyes narrowed in anger. Dawn cracked a mischievous smile, tilting the gun to the side. \"I told you he's the only one who has the antibody for the virus. Now, he's the only one here with the virus in his system. So much as a scratch could infect hundreds, if not thousands, more people.\" Dawn explained. \"That doesn't give you the right to shoot him! He's still human, just as much as you are!\" Little Rock cried. \"He protected us from the horde. He sent them away, instead of having them come after us. That means something, whether or not you're willing to believe it.\" Wichita added, frowning as deep as it could go. \"Ju-just go. Eve-everything will be okay.\" Columbus' weak voice said. \"We're not leaving you. You don't deserve that, after everything you've been through.\" Wichita snapped, silencing the pseudo-zombie. \"What about your promise, man?\" Tallahassee asked, glancing wistfully at the young man. \"My-my promise….\" Columbus repeated slowly, steadily pushing himself off the ground. \"That's our Snowball.\" Little Rock said, praising the teen's resilience. \"That's not Snowball, anymore, kid. That's a man-eating, killing machine that will manipulate anything it has around it to get what it wants.\" Dawn said, taking the safety off her gun. \"Don't you fucking dare.\" Wichita hissed, taking the safety off her own gun. \"I-I will no-not let yo-you hurt my-my friends!\" Columbus cried, lunging forward and taking hold of Dawn's gun. The woman cried out, falling backwards onto the ground in shock. Columbus landed on top of her, hands wrapped firmly around the gun and fighting to prevent it from blowing his own face off. \"Get off me!\" Dawn snapped, punching him clean in the face. The boy recoiled, still unwilling to let go as she slammed a knee into his gut. His hands dropped from the weapon, his body slamming hard into the dirt as she rolled on top of him, pointing the gun directly between his eyes. When a loud bang cut through the air, Columbus' eyes jerked shut, his body spasming awkwardly on the ground. He felt the full weight of the woman fall dead against his chest, opening his eyes to see a hole blown through her head. Tally was grinning like an idiot, a shotgun in his hands smoking at the barrel. He bent down and hauled the body off the boy, jerking the kid to his feet and into a tight hug. \"Don't ever do that again, ya hear?\" he asked, arms wrapping tight around the boy's chest and back. Columbus nodded against the man's chest, raising his hands to give a weak squeeze back. \"Alright, should we get out of here before someone finds out we did this?\" Little Rock asked, everyone nodding in response. They booked it to the car, Tallahassee and Columbus sliding into the backseat together. \"I guess we're never going to see that cure made.\" Tally said as Wichita drove out of the fort and back out onto the interstate. Columbus made a face, digging into his pocket before pulling out a small package of vials. He handed them to the Flordan, who's jaw dropped on the label: VIRUS 11670 ANTIBODY AGENT: TWELVE PACK + 12 SYRINGES (INCLUDED) \"Son of a bitch.\" Tallahassee said, looking to the pseudo-zombie with wide eyes. \"What's that?\" Little Rock asked, eyeing the package. \"Our new mission.\" he replied. ~END ","Summary":" Pseudo-Zombie (Zombieland AU) (inspired by mk94 ( ) \"Pseudo-Zombie\", all credit to mk94!) Chapter"},{"Movie":"Fight Club","Title":"Project Mayhem","Author":"This Is WP","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11818627","Passage":"[Chapter 1] 1. CHAPTER I - WHERE IS MY MIND? 'Trust me... Everything's gonna' be fine'. An empty promise for sure. Who was I kidding? Bleeding from my cheek, I looked Marla in the eyes. Marla. The woman I love. The woman who I think loves me. At that brief moment, everything seemed okay. Then the explosions went off. Earth-shattering explosions that would rock the world to its very foundations. The credit card buildings fell, just as 'he' had planned. He is Tyler Durden. He is me. I'm Tyler Durden, at least to the rest of Project Mayhem and Marla. How was I ever going to explain this? There wasn't much time. I grabbed Marla at the shoulders, so my eyes met hers. There was only going to be one chance to explain everything, and I had to do so in a convincing manner; otherwise, Project Mayhem were going to tear her apart. Why? That's simple; because Tyler saw her as a threat. And if Tyler saw her as a threat, Project Mayhem saw her as a threat. I could try and overule them, but Tyler has specifically instructed them to ignore any major changes to the plans he'd created. And one of those plans was eliminating Marla. My Marla. The one who had always stood by me through this whole psychotic episode. 'Marla, you have to listen to me', I started, as nervous as I'd ever been. Even more nervous than the first time I'd stepped into a support group, knowing full well I was lying to every single person in that room. Even Bob. Poor Bob. A casualty of all of this mess, a good life wasted. 'Marla, I'm not Tyler Durden', I said forcefully, hoping that Marla wouldn't abandon me at our most desperate hour. I could see the colour drain from her face, as if I'd been tipped over the edge, and I was having a mental breakdown. Then, a second passed, and I saw her anger and confusion subside, and in its place was a willingness to listen. To listen. To understand. To forgive. 'Go on...', she said, compassion and caring in her voice. She hadn't abandoned me. At least not yet. 'Tyler is another side of my personality; when I sleep, he takes control. I'm sure there is a medical term for all of this, but for the moment, your going to have to just trust me on this. Right now, your in danger, and if I'm not careful, I'll be in danger also. You just have to put your faith in me.' I held my breath, waiting. Please understand. The benefit of the doubt. Just one last chance. 'Okay...' came her reply, a slight hesitation in her voice. But I could tell, she did trust me, and she did have faith in me. I am Jack's sense of relief. - As we made our way down the stairwell, I could tell Marla felt uncomfortable. Deeply uncomfortable. Can't say I blamed her. My mind was racing. So much had gone on, so much damage caused. All because of me. No, not me. Because of Tyler. Tyler Durden; once my saviour, but in the end, he was almost my destruction. It all happened at once; Tyler refused to leave me alone, was talking about taking Project Mayhem up yet another level. I couldn't let that happen. But he had a gun, he had the upper hand. Then I realised, I had the gun. Because I'm Tyler, and Tyler is me. Drastic times call for drastic measures as they say. So I shot myself. I wasn't sure what I was doing. Did I want to die? Was I going to kill myself? If so, I didn't do a very good job. My cheek was blown half off. Still hurts now. Blood is dripping everywhere. After that, Tyler disappeared. With a bullet hole in his head. Was that my doing? Did I kill Tyler? So many questions were going through my head; before, it was Tyler driving me insane, his voice always in my head. Now he was gone, all I was left with was my own questions, all of which I didn't want to answer? Who would be held accountable for Project Mayhem? What about Marla? What about Bob's death? Would we even make it out of this building alive? Too many questions. I didn't have an answer for any of them. Just as it seemed all hope was lost, Marla took me by the hand, and squeezed every so gently. I looked at her, and a smile slowly appeared on her face. A reassuring smile. A loving smile. I am Jack's mended heart. I didn't need Tyler. I had Marla. And we were going to get through this ordeal, one way or another. Together. We reached the bottom of the stairwell, and I was dragged straight back into reality by the members of Project Mayhem. Kicking and screaming the entire time.[Chapter 2] 1. CHAPTER 2 - KICKING AND SCREAMING 'He' was not happy. 'He' is Angel Face. Angel Face is the second-in-command in Project Mayhem, behind Tyler. Behind me. The plan wasn't going according to what had been agreed he said. He told me that I wasn't following what had been specifically laid out, and if I didn't calm down, measures would be taken to ensure I followed the rules. I'd heard this threat before. They would take my balls. I soon quietened down. 'This wasn't the plan, sir', Angel Face whispered, hoping Marla wouldn't overhear. He didn't look best pleased, though it was hard to read his face. Recently, Angel Face had become incredibly bitter. Having your face smashed into oblivion could do that to you. But no matter what, he always followed Tyler. Perhaps he would follow me. After all, all of these guys still saw me as 'Mr Durden'. 'We are aborting this mission...' I stammered, trying not to let my face give me away; I was a nervous wreck. 'From now on, there will be no more homework assignments'. I wanted to tell them that Project Mayhem had officially been closed down there and then, but felt that the vast majority of the members would have a hard time dealing with such an announcement. It was better to slowly wean them off. Like a drug user wanting to get off the cocaine; slow and steady. Angel Face wasn't convinced; nor we the others. They soon began to surround me. 'Sir, you told us that if anyone tried to stop us, we'd have to take measures to ensure our plans go ahead... Even if that meant opposing you'. I began to sweat and stammer. I couldn't find the words to come back with an argument. To be honest, I don't think anything I could've said would've sounded convincing. It was at that point that Marla spoke up. And their attention and wrath turned to her. I am Jack's cold sweat. - 'Tyler is the one in the charge, right?', Marla yelled, attracting the attention of my fellow Project Mayhem 'members'. 'In Project Mayhem, we are all equal', came one reply. 'In Project Mayhem, we have no names', replied another. 'The plan MUST be carried through,' shouted Angel Face, forcefully. 'Marla Singer must be eliminated'. 'Why?' I blurted out, as I noticed one of the Project Mayhem members reaching into his pants. Either he had a gun or he was really pleased to see Marla and myself. Neither would have surprised me. 'She knows too much!' argued Angel Face, his face now beginning to turn scarlet. He was losing his composure, and fast. The member with the gun stepped forward, in a quick attempt to grab Marla. He should have known better. In one swift action, Marla managed to kick him in the stomach with her high heels, forcing him to double over. She pried the gun from his fingers and took aim. Angel Face shot her a quick grin. 'In Project Mayhem, we have no names. If one of us dies, it's for the greater good'. In Tyler they trusted; that's what he preached. 'You wanna' make an omelette, you gotta' break some eggs'. My mind raced back to Bob. Poor Bob; he just didn't know any better. Easily led. I felt like taking the gun in Marla's hand and shooting myself again. This was all becoming just too much. Just as I fantasized about blowing off my other cheek, a gun-shot went off. Marla had shot the Project Mayhem member right in the kneecap. He was screaming his head off, trying to kick her with his good leg. Faithful and resilient until the end. Tyler had picked them well. I used the ever so brief split-second distraction to elbow Angel Face in the mid-section and shoving him into the crowd of members, sending them to the floor. As if we knew what the other was thinking, Marla and myself charged down the hall, storming through the corridors and leaving the building. We headed out the back way; leaving through the entrance would attract far too much attention. The police had arrived, as had the ambulance and fire crews. Not to mention the news reporters, hot the scene of the crime. As far as I was concerned, Project Mayhem would be caught red-handed and prosecuted. Who was I kidding? That would be too good to be true. Of course they'd be back; and I didn't have the luxury of knowing when or where either. I am Jack's anxiety attack. Marla told me there was no way we could return to the Paper Street Soap house, and chances are there would be some members waiting at her home also. So there was only one place left to seek refuge. It was time to go back to the Support Groups. However this time, we could use all the help and support we could get. God knows, we were going to need it. ","Summary":" 1.

Charlotte and Amy stopped near the crash of a van Amy thought was full of Twinkies but instead it was full of snowballs. \"I am so disappointed I thought it would have been full of Twinkies.\" Amy whispered. \"I am so sorry it's not now come on we need to get away.\" Charlotte said in her way which meant there's no point in arguing. \"Okay I get it lets go to the shop and check for them Twinkies.\" Amy said before running again \"at least get a car next time.\" Charlotte sighed as she caught up with her sister and they soon arrived at the super market Amy ran in and so did Charlotte as soon as they walked through the doors and got to the back they heard someone enter after them two males one voice deeper than the other. \"We should steal their car and weapons.\" Amy said \"No we shou-.\" Charlotte started speaking when she was interrupted \"BANG BANG.\" \"there should be Twinkies out there Charlotte lets go see.\" Amy whispered and then she dragged Charlotte out of the back and then they bumped into two others \"Charlotte we might be screwed and are those fat zombies over there.\" Amy shouted. \"Shut up.\" A deep voice answered to the girls shouting. \"Y…yes those are fat zombies.\" A highish pitched voice answered Amy's question. \"M…my name is Columbus Ohio and this man is Tallahassee and you two are?\" Columbus said to the girl who bumped into him. \"My name is Amy and the shy one who bumped into your buddy there is my sister Charlotte and as you can see she is shy but can be deadly.\" Amy replied to Columbus. Charlotte looked up she had to crane her neck a little to look up to who she heard was Tallahassee and whispered \"Hi.\" And he whispered back \"Hello, your sister sure is annoying.\" \"I know.\" Charlotte said back. \"Charlotte let us find those Twinkies before I die of hunger.\" Amy said as she tried to drag her sister again but Tallahassee kept a firm hold on Charlotte as he looked into her bright blue/green eyes and she stared into his beautiful eyes and they shared a connection. Tallahassee finally said \"why don't you come join us we are going to Ohio for Columbus here.\" \"Okay we will but give us your guns.\" Amy said. \"No we can't Amy just shut up we will get you some Twinkies if you shut up and I love you please don't hurt me.\" Charlotte yelled and then whispered and hid behind Tallahassee for protection from her sister as they went outside and ran into zombies before they could touch their guns Charlotte took out her sword and cut the zombies head in half. \"wow that was amazing.\" Amy said as Charlotte turned around blood splattered on her face \"I didn't know you had it in you.\" Tallahassee said to Charlotte in awe.[Chapter 2] Twinkies obsession Previously \"No we can't Amy just shut up we will get you some Twinkies if you shut up and I love you please don't hurt me.\" Charlotte yelled and then whispered and hid behind Tallahassee for protection from her sister as they went outside and ran into zombies before they could touch their guns Charlotte took out her sword and cut the zombies head in half. \"Wow that was amazing.\" Amy said as Charlotte turned around blood splattered on her face \"I didn't know you had it in you.\" Tallahassee said to Charlotte in awe. Chapter 2 \"Well I do and this is who I am.\" Charlotte's words echoed in his Tallahassee's mind over and over as they travelled towards the nearest shop. Charlotte and Amy got out the car first and ran to the door it was locked so Charlotte threw a bin at the glass window. \"Wasn't that a bit too loud?\" Columbus mumbled as he and Tallahassee walked to the broken window. \"Nice work Charlotte.\" Tallahassee whispered in her ear before Amy dropped some glass. \"Oops sorry, Charlotte why don't you smash some things as well.\" Amy said so Charlotte joined in as did Columbus and Tallahassee. Charlotte and Amy smashed most of the items in the shop before Charlotte started coughing. \"Charlotte are you okay?\" Amy asked as she rushed up to her sister and patted her back. Tallahassee and Columbus rushed over as Charlotte stopped coughing then she grabbed a hammer as 50 zombies came into view. Amy, Columbus and Tallahassee grabbed their guns and shot one each Charlotte used the hammer to smash their heads as she dodged the bullets and put zombies in front of them. After the zombies were finished Charlotte was covered in blood so she and the others got back in the car to go to go to the shopping centre. When they got there Columbus said \"I still need to get to Ohio can we go there next?\" Charlotte looked at him and replied \"Sure I just need to get some clothes that won't get ruined, then we can okay?\" Charlotte found some clothes and something to hold her sword at her waist then she got rid of the stuff she didn't need and then she put on the Turquoise high waisted skirt and a turquoise tank top and comfortable shoes. \"Okay now lets go.\" Charlotte ordered as she strapped her sword to her waist and ran out the door towards their car. \"Come on.\" Tallahassee said as he ran towards the car and Charlotte. He helped her get into the passenger seat in the front. Amy and Columbus sat in the back and talked about random things. \"Charlotte your crazy.\" Amy said \"I know I'm crazy but people who don't know they're crazy are crazy and people who do know they're crazy aren't crazy isn't that crazy.\" Charlottes replied. \"you confuse me.\" Amy said. \"I know it is my job after all.\" Charlotte said back as she rubbed her eyes. \"Me and Amy will take over the driving Tallahassee you and Charlotte sit in the back she looks tired.\" Columbus said so Tallahassee parked and placed Charlotte in the back and he sat next to her with her resting her head on his lap she fell into a deep sleep. \"so why is she so tired all of a sudden?\" Tallahassee questioned Amy as he checked to see if she was sleeping soundly. \"Well sometimes she gets like this when she does too much and she remembers something so she pushes herself past her limits.\" Amy replied as Columbus stopped to let her take over driving. \"Okay.\" Tallahassee replied and after that they drove on in silence.[Chapter 3] Twinkies obsession Chapter 3 As they drove on in silence Charlotte woke up as they drove over a few bumps \"Where are we going now?\" Charlotte asked Tallahassee while Amy had made them park the car. Amy dragged Charlotte, Columbus and Tallahassee to the coffee shop and made Charlotte a hot Chocolate. \"Thanks Amy now lets go to Ohio so Columbus can see if they are still alive.\" Charlotte said then she walked towards the car and got in the drivers seat. \"Come on then.\" Charlotte yelled. The three walked back to the car as Amy sat in the front and Tallahassee sat behind Charlotte and Columbus next to Tallahassee. \"Charlotte lets go and get rings and make it look like we are married?\" Amy said as Tallahassee and Columbus just listened while they sat in the back. \"Why did you say that about you two getting married.\" Columbus and Tallahassee questioned the girls at the same time. \"Because we said we were before and all we needed were rings and Amy's the husband and I'm her wife.\" Charlotte explained as she drove down the long road to Columbus. When they arrived in Ohio Amy and Charlotte swapped places. Charlotte and Tallahassee looked at Columbus. Charlotte nudged Amy and nodded towards Columbus while she drove through the empty streets of the place he once called home. Columbus told Amy where his parents house is and she parked outside. They all got out and Amy went to knock on the door when Charlotte's hand grabbed her hand. \"Don't knock just open.\" Charlotte whispered to her friend. Amy stepped back and let Columbus try to open the door. \"I...it's l...locked.\" he stuttered Columbus's hand shook. \"Is the lock a pin lock?\" Charlotte asked. \"Yes it is.\" Columbus replied. \"Amy hair grips.\" Charlotte ordered her friend. Amy gave Charlotte the hair pins as she knelt in front of the door she put the hair grips in the lock and turned them until she heard the clicks. She took the pins out and stood up she brushed the dirt of her knees and turned the door handle and opened the door. As Charlotte opened the door Tallahassee and Columbus stood in front of the girls and walked into Columbus's parents home cautiously they checked their lounge and the kitchen they were clear Amy put the kettle on to make them drinks. As they seated themselves at the table Charlotte announced \"I am going to check upstairs to see if they are there or not.\" she walked to the hallway to and disappeared up the steps. \"Aaaagh.\" Charlotte screamed. Charlotte's scream made Tallahassee jump out of his seat and ran up the stairs with Amy and Columbus right behind him. They ran into the room where they saw Charlotte moving the dead bodies of Columbus's family into the middle of the room. \"Hey don't stare at me like that, they were zombies when I came up to see if anyone was home and they made me jump and I had to kill them, sorry Ohio im really sorry.\" Charlotte said concerned giving Amy the look that said she was going to leave the room. \"Tallahassee come with me lets go make a drink.\" Charlotte whispered to Tallahassee while dragging him out the room and down the stairs.[Chapter 4] Twinkies obsession chapter 4 After Charlotte dragged Tallahassee down the stairs she finished making the drinks and found some food that was still in date and cooked and brang it up the stairs Tallahassee trailing behind her with their drinks. Amy was comforting Columbus as Charlotte and Tallahassee walked in carrying food and drinks Amy sat Columbus up, while Charlotte set their plates down and gave them cutlery to eat with and Tallahassee put their drinks down next to them and then he and Charlotte left the room and went down stairs to leave the other two to do whatever they wanted. Tallahassee was the only one who ate food in the kitchen while Charlotte just stared into space and only snapped out of it when Tallahassee asked her what really went on before they came up. \"Nothing other then the fact one was a zombie and the others already dead and zombie like after I saw them get bitten they asked me to kill them before they turned and I didn't so when they turned I screamed they backed of and then I killed them that's all honestly.\" Charlotte replied while rubbing her left ankle. \"Are you really okay and why do you keep rubbing your ankle like that?\" Tallahassee looked at her ankle in concern and then he continued \"you can tell me what happened to make yo scream in pain did one bite your leg before you killed them tell me Charlotte.\" he begged her to tell him and made cute puppy dog eyes at her. \"Fine, but just don't tell the others, I was bitten on my left ankle that is what made me scream and why I hurried to kill them. But I just don't understand why I haven't turned yet.\" Charlotte gave in and told Tallahassee then she continued. \"Lets get Amy and Columbus give his family a little send off and leave.\" Charlotte said making her way up the stairs. Tallahassee quickly helped her when she started to fall over and continued helping her up the stairs. \"Amy, Columbus come on lets get everything cleared up and where is the medicine and bandages in this house.\" Tallahassee questioned Columbus who said in a hushed voice \"The bathroom I will show you.\" and he stood up and Tallahassee followed him. \"Amy is he okay and are you okay its not normal for there to be no sound from you for a few hours?\" Charlotte asked her friend and \"I was asking if he was okay and obviously he wasn't but he realised that we all are a family though not the usual family, he is sad but he isn't.\" Amy replied to her friend and sister before Tallahassee picked Charlotte up and went back down into the kitchen. \"Did you have to pick me up I can walk.\" Charlotte tried to sound cross but it didn't work as he started to clean her wounded left ankle trying not to hurt her. \"I know but you told me not to tell those two so I won't but I get to do whatever.\" Tallahassee replied to her then he finished cleaning the bite and he put the bandage around her ankle \"just wear socks over it for a while or tights and do not go anywhere on your own.\" Tallahassee said to her and he helped Charlotte stand up when he heard Columbus and Amy walking down the steps and heading towards the kitchen. \"Amy, Columbus have you finished the send off?\" Charlotte asked them. \"Yes and we are ready to leave now.\" Columbus said and then they all walked out of the house and to their car Charlotte in the passenger seat and Tallahassee driving and Amy and Columbus in the back looking confused as Charlotte and Tallahassee were talking in whispers and laughing at jokes they couldn't hear. \"What's going on between you two\" Amy and Columbus said in sync. \"Nothing its normal isn't it?\" Charlotte asked her friend between her giggles and Tallahassee's low chuckle. \"Yeah it is I suppose but what are you two laughing about?\" Amy sighed. \"Nothing.\" Tallahassee said back Amy and Columbus looked surprised that Tallahassee was laughing and smiling in a light and happy manor.[Chapter 5] Twinkies obsession chapter 5 Charlotte and Tallahassee's laughing really irritated Amy and Columbus not knowing what they were laughing about so they started whispering about how weird the two had been since they left Columbus parents house. \"They are acting strange Columbus I don't like it, Char normally tells me just about everything, so I'm curious now.\" Amy whispered back to Columbus. He laughed awkwardly and uncomfortably as Tallahassee stopped the car and asked Amy and Columbus to swap with him and Charlotte. Amy and Columbus sat in the front and Amy being the first one to drive said to her best friend/sister \"you have to tell me what happened later you can not escape me.\" \"Okay I will later.\" Charlotte replied then whispered to Tallahassee \"not all of it I will leave out the fact I got bitten but I'm fine so no need to worry her.\" Tallahassee just smiled gently when he saw Charlotte started getting sleepy and she fell asleep. Suddenly the car slammed to a shut and Charlotte bolted awake \"What is happened?\" She asked Amy when she started to open the door. \"Nothing we cant handle just rest okay.\" Amy replied \"Okay.\" Charlotte replied wiping her eyes and yawning started to fall asleep again. Amy, Columbus and Tallahassee got out of the car and started shooting all the zombies the reason Amy had stopped the car as soon as they got rid of the zombies bodies and burned them they got back into the car wiping blood off of their faces and hands. \"Lets go to Hollywood.\" Amy and Tallahassee said at the same time and glared at each other. \"hmm where are we going?\" Charlotte asked sleepily. \"We are going to Hollywood to and we are going to visit the house of Bill Murray.\" Tallahassee told her \"Bill Murray as in ghost busters Bill Murray?\" Charlotte questioned. \"Yes that Bill Murray.\" Tallahassee chuckled at her realisation. \"Yay, Amy did you hear that visiting the home of a star.\" Charlotte bounced. They all found her antics amusing so they let her bounce and they then decided to calm her down when they were outside Bill Murray's house. Charlotte had calmed down and she grabbed Tallahassee's and Amy's hands and Amy took the hand of Columbus just before Charlotte dragged them all to the door. After walking into Bill Murray's mansion they went and looked for any sign of life Charlotte and Tallahassee went wondering around the house and then Amy and Columbus went to find some ghost busters movies. \"grhhhhhh.\" Tallahassee and Charlotte heard a groan then Charlotte turned around and screamed. \"Sorry i'm not a zombie and I have never been a good practical joker.\" it was Bill Murray. \"Bill Murray oh my god its Bill F***** Murray, I know that's not your middle name.\" Tallahassee said and he continued \"But you're Bill Murray i'm so happy to get to meet you.\" Tallahassee said and he hugged Bill. They all talked and they started to play scenes from Ghost busters then Charlotte got them both to take a picture with all three of them together. After they took the picture they went to search for Amy and Columbus. They found the two in a room like a cinema and decided to scare them. \"Aaaghhhhh grhhhhhh.\" Bill Murray limped slowly into the cinema like room. \"Don't worry I've got this.\" Columbus said and then he shot Bill Murray and he fell backwards. \"you just shot Bill Murray he was still human.\" Tallahassee said \"its okay r I never was a great practical joker.\" he said in between breaths he then started to breath out. \"Aaaaaahhhhhhhh, uuuhh Aaaaaahhhhhhhh.\" and as Bill Murray took his final breath he closed his eyes. \"Lets give him a little funeral and get some supplies stay for the night and leave for Pacific play land together tomorrow.\" Charlotte said as Amy left the room to get some blankets and pillows and a quilt to wrap Bill Murray's body in. They went out the front and chucked his body over the wall and they went back inside where they played a game of monopoly. Where Tallahassee told them he was grieving for his young son. Charlotte gave Tallahassee a hug and Amy and Columbus went upstairs to find anything else to play. When Amy and Columbus found another game Tallahassee and Charlotte had fallen asleep next to each other. Amy pulled the blankets over her sister and Tallahassee and she then just played cards with Columbus after they finished the card game they decided to go to sleep as well.[Chapter 6] Twinkies obsession chapter 6 After Amy, Tallahassee, Charlotte and Columbus woke the next day they set about getting things ready for their journeys. Amy and Charlotte were headed towards pacific play-land before they become serious and travel somewhere else to find Columbus and Tallahassee to force them to travel with the girls. Columbus and Amy went off on their own to talk while Tallahassee and Charlotte stayed where they \"Tallahassee, why don't you come with us? Charlotte whispered. \"I can't i'm going to go to Mexico.\" Tallahassee's replied at that Charlotte's face fell with sadness. \"But we will see each other again i'm sure of it.\" Tallahassee continued he then kissed Charlotte on the cheek. Amy and Columbus came back after that. Amy grabbed Charlotte's hand before dragging her to the car. Amy returned to the boys and said \"Me and my sister, we are crazy and we will meet again, just remember we are going to pacific play-land.\" then continued saying \"it might be dangerous, might be full of zombies that will come out if we turn the everything on there anyway later.\" then she walked back to the car got in the drivers seat and drove away. \"Tallahassee i'm worried, I think we should go after them instead of going our separate ways.\" Columbus said. \"I agree, trouble always finds them, lets go follow them then.\" Tallahassee replied to Columbus. Then they got on the motorbikes and drove the same direction the girls were heading in. \"Do you think they will follow us?\" Charlotte said to her best friend/sister. \"Sure they will I just told them there might be flesh and brain eating zombies out there that might attack us if we turn on the rides, lights and music at pacific play-land that's all.\" Amy whispered feigning innocence. \"Alright then I trust that is all you wouldn't say anything other then that you love the cat and mouse game.\" Charlotte mumbled while poking her friend. They drove on in silence Charlotte looking at the scenery passing them by. They pulled up in the parking lot, got out the car, waiting for the boys to catch up. \"They are finally here look.\" Amy whisper yelled as she saw two motorbikes in the distance. Tallahassee was the first to park then Columbus followed. The boys got off their motorbikes and walked over to the girls. Tallahassee looked furious at Charlotte and he dragged her away from Amy and Columbus to where they were out of sight and hearing distance. \"What were you thinking?\" He whispered, before hugging Charlotte. \"Hey at least we waited for you before making this as dangerous as possible plus there might be some Twinkies here at pacific play-land.\" She said just louder then a whisper. After Charlotte replied to him, he pushed her back a little then kissed her on the lips. They felt like the kiss had lasted for hours, when they finally broke it Tallahassee put his forehead against Charlotte's. Tallahassee said breathlessly \"I was actually worried about you, and with that about Twinkies you just made my day.\" He laughed afterwards. Tallahassee grabbed Charlotte's hand and brang her back to the Amy and Columbus. \"Lets go in pairs.\"Charlotte raised her voice so Amy would listen to her. \"Amy, you and Columbus go switch everything on, Me and Tallahassee will go find Zombies and take them out before they're aware that we are here.\" she continued then looked at Columbus whose face was bright red, probably because after the girls had parked the car they had gotten changed. Then she looked at Tallahassee's face as he starred at her in surprise for the plan and he just realised what she and her friend were wearing. Then both of the pairs went off to do the jobs they now had to do.[Chapter 7] Twinkies obsession Chapter 7 After they went their separate ways Charlotte and Tallahassee went to check for any zombies killing the few that were in sight, and heading to the shops at pacific play-land. Amy and Columbus flicked all the switches for the lights, music and rides on, drawing zombies within miles around pacific play-land, Columbus and Amy went on one of the rides before noticing the Zombies heading their way Amy and Columbus went towards the ride that gets them out of reach from the Zombies. Tallahassee and Charlotte went towards the massive lot of Zombies that were heading in the direction Amy and Columbus were. \"We have to get over there quickly they wont have enough bullets, see this is why I prefer swords to guns because I don't run out of anything.\" Charlotte whispered to Tallahassee \"Lets go then.\" he replied to her as they rushed off towards the zombies Charlotte slicing their heads of, Tallahassee shooting their brains. Amy and Columbus saw Charlotte and Tallahassee running through the crowd of Zombies cutting each and every zombie down Charlotte went to the switch box and Tallahassee got to the pair quickly, successfully after the ride was switched off Tallahassee shot zombies while Amy and Columbus got off the ride. The three started killing zombies that were going towards them. After a few hours of fighting and most of the zombies dead. Amy, Columbus, Tallahassee and Charlotte went to the shop. Charlotte went into the storage room and got Amy and Tallahassee a box of Twinkies for the both of them. Columbus, Tallahassee and Amy heard a strange noise from the storage room where Charlotte was. Columbus got really freaked out and shot through the door hitting Charlotte's right leg. \"AH would you be kind enough to take Columbus's gun away from him so I don't get shot again.\" Charlotte yelled as she opened the door and carried two Twinkies boxes out to the others limping towards her friend Amy and Tallahassee and handing them each one of the two boxes. \"I will gladly take his gun away now lets head back and get our stuff and leave in the car.\" Tallahassee said after he snatched the gun away handing it over to Amy and then grabbing Charlotte by her hand and dragging her towards the car and motorbikes. \"We need to get that shot wound cleaned out quickly.\" I might have something for that.\" Tallahassee said and when they got to the car Charlotte sat on the hood of the car and wrapped the bandage around her leg. She slid of the car and went to open the door to the car when Amy and Columbus joined them grabbed their things and chucked them in the boot of the car. \"so where to now?\" Amy and Charlotte asked at the same time. Tallahassee and Columbus had confused looks on their faces. \"well now we need some adventure lets travel to other parts of the country then other countries we will go on an adventure.\" Charlotte replied to them then she kissed Tallahassee on the lips and hugged him. Amy gave Columbus a kiss on the cheek. \"Well then lets go.\" Amy finished as she started the car. \"This will be fun now wont it?\" Amy spoke a little louder then she normally did just to taunt her friend who almost fell asleep from the silence in the car. \"Well if you would keep your voice down I wont have a head ache.\" Charlotte snapped back to Amy. \"Just let me take a little bit of sleep.\" she continued then closed her eyes Leaning on Tallahassee's shoulder. Amy just stared at the two in the back seats of the car then started to talk to Columbus. \"You will enjoy travelling with us its fun.\" Amy whispered with a little giggle at the end as they drove off in a random direction no destination in mind. The end, for now. ","Summary":" Twinkies obsession I don't own zombie land or the characters just my oc's Charlotte and Amy. Chapte"},{"Movie":"Hellraiser","Title":"Countdown","Author":"InkWorthy","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13011981","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is another for-funsies piece, because I had an idea and had to run with it. Hope you enjoy! \"See those pretty numbers, Kirsty?\" Frank was smiling, but it didn't look like a fun smile. \"Those tell you how long you're going to live. Isn't that something?\" Kirsty rubbed her arm, trying not to look Frank in the eye. The numbers were so small, barely an inch wide along her wrist, and she didn't like that he'd seen them. Your mark was supposed to be secret, something you only shared with the people you trusted the most. Not even her dad had seen it, and Frank had only noticed because she'd forgotten her watch. \"It's something,\" she answered, pulling on her watch. It was a cheap thing, but it did its job. \"I have plenty of time left, then.\" Thousands upon thousands of hours, the seconds ticking away before her eyes. Sometimes she watched them, mesmerized, in the middle of the night. \"You're lucky, Kirsty.\" She didn't like Frank, didn't like the little chuckle he made as he sucked in on his cigarette that he wasn't supposed to have. Kirsty hated his visits. She pulled her backpack on. \"I need to go to school, Uncle,\" she said, and left the kitchen without waiting for him to say anything else. She'd never really done the math; Kirsty didn't want to know how far away she was until she got there. It was the last day of high school and she was watching the seconds fall away under her watch, not listening to the teacher because the teacher had never really listened to her. Some students had shown off their marks. Not everyone had numbers; some had shapes, distinct or not, or they had phrases or words or a scramble of letters. One person had a name; one girl had asked Kirsty, because Kirsty didn't tell secrets, if it was normal for two names to appear. Kirsty had admitted she didn't know, but she didn't know if any of the marks were normal anyway, and that seemed to reassure that girl enough. Kirsty hoped she'd turn out okay, she was nice. She certainly wasn't going to mention one of the names had been a girl's, too. Steve asked about her mark, but he backed off when she told him no, she wanted to keep that to herself. He'd seemed disappointed, but how was she supposed to explain that she had a clock counting the hours of her life, and counting down, not up? Kirsty was going to die young. She'd never done the math, but she had watched the clock long enough to know that it was almost up. Kirsty's father had a mark shaped like a strange blob, almost a flower, and sometimes it changed shape. \"It gets a new petal every time I fall in love,\" he'd said when he showed it to her - there were a few, some small and faded, some new. Three were the darkest against his skin - \"your mother, she's that one, and that's Julia.\" \"What about the third one?\" She asked, fidgeting with her watch just a little. \"That one's you, Kirsty, the moment I first held you in my arms.\" He kissed her forehead, and she smiled a little. Kirsty's watch was confiscated when she was admitted to the hospital, so she'd tied a bandage around it. That bastard knew, she thought of Frank, he knew it was going to be him. She had barely glimpsed the number of hours when they took the watch, and hadn't looked at it again, but it made her stomach flip. It was less than 48. She shook, not wanting to see the number, not wanting to think about it. She'd known - she'd almost always known - that she was going to die young; but now she could feel Death's sweet kiss on her cheek, waiting for her, and she cried. She wasn't ready. The box opened and they appeared. Kirsty had pleaded, narrowly escaping with her skin intact, and she found herself on her hands and knees in the cold and empty hospital room. She struggled to breathe, struggled to stop crying, when she looked at her wrist almost out of habit. 00:00:00. Six unblinking eyes staring back at her. She was alive, and she suddenly felt extremely guilty; had she cheated, somehow? Was she supposed to die, or be taken away? Her eyes watered as she stared at the number, trying to think about what had happened, trying to understand. She squeezed her eyes shut, took in a breath, and opened them. No change. The number didn't budge. Not when she confronted Frank; not when the Cenobites confronted her; not when the house burned down and Steve abandoned her at the hospital. Maybe I was supposed to die, she thought as she sat in her hospital room. Maybe she should have gone with them; maybe she'd made a mistake. Was I supposed to die? She forgot the number, but she couldn't really forget. Even as she searched the labyrinth, even as she searched for Tiffany, she couldn't wash it from her mind. Channard was at her heels. It felt like her whole world was coming down, an avalanche an inch behind her, and she had run out of time days before. She pushed on only because she didn't know what else she could do, because she hadn't planned past the minutes running out. Those six zeroes waited patiently - waited for what? This is it, Kirsty thought as the doctor approached, this is really the end. She urged Tiffany to run, to safety, and run she did; Kirsty was left behind, and she accepted that. Her father was not here, she had no answers, only the baffled look of the Cenobite prince whose world she'd just torn down. She saw those black eyes on her, and closed her own; there was nowhere to run, no loving arms to protect her now. She heard a cry and opened her eyes; chains in the doctor's skin and the felled Cenobites, but the one remaining - the leader - stood. Kirsty knelt before the man on the ground, the blood on her face dripping onto his pale cheek. Salt stung her eyes as she touched his face - once adorned with such perfectly-gridded pins, now bare. She lowered herself to sit beside him, fighting back a sob even as the tears spilled. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered, \"it shouldn't have been you.\" She sobbed and covered her face; her tears smudged the blood and washed it away at her wrist. She looked at him again through her fingers, so cold and so still. Weakly, almost ashamed, she reached forward and took the hand at his side, kissed it. The leather gripping his thumb had come loose, and slipped off. \"Please,\" she whispered to no one, to Leviathan, to anyone who would listen, \"please let him live. Please.\" She brought his hand to her cheek and kissed it again, opening her eyes. On his wrist, once hidden by the leather, was his mark smudged in blood. She felt a pang of guilt for seeing something so private - and then it moved. Kirsty frowned, swallowing, and wiped the blood from his wrist to see it more clearly. 00:00:01. He drew in a breath. I know, I know, I already did a soulmate AU story. I couldn't resist, I just really like the concept and I REALLY have a lot of feelings about the end of Hellbound. Going to work on the next chapter of TPatC soon. Have a great week, everybody![Chapter 2] Elliot James Spencer wasn't sure he believed in the marks being all that special, and he hadn't believed it for a long time. After all, his was absolute rubbish. Were absolute rubbish. The first set of numbers had appeared as most marks did - slowly, fading in from left to right, like it was emerging from beneath his skin. It took him a shameful amount of time to work out the numbers - he'd never been too good with maths - and he'd concluded it would run out when he was 33. He was an impatient boy, but as he grew older he came to like the number. 33 was a respectable age, he thought, by 33 he'd probably have some sort of career and a home, something to offer the person meant to be in his life. He was seventeen when he decided that yes, he was excited to meet his soulmate, and he was willing to wait for her. The second set of numbers appeared the next day. He almost missed his alarm, staring at them in disbelief; a brand new clock, right under the old one, the same dark blue and holding still as if that was perfectly normal of them. The number of hours was massive, more than twice that of his first set, and they just did not move. He wiped at his wrist - nothing. Elliot turned his hand, but it didn't change - the new numbers were no trick of his eye, none he could pick apart, anyway. \"Elliot, you'll be late!\" His mother's voice pulled him from his disbelief, and he reluctantly stood up to begin his day. He kept it to himself. He wasn't sure why. Elliot had never been one to show off his mark, but it was new for him to consider it private - but he did. He wasn't comfortable with anyone knowing about his strange new mystery number, especially since they still hadn't budged, still stayed the same. He had less trouble with the math this time - the hours added up to about 67 years. 67 was an old age. Was he going to die then? He rubbed his wrist and frowned. He'd try not to think about it - if it was there, he reasoned, it meant something, but he'd never know what until he got there. Elliot tucked his wrist under his sleeve and tried to forget about it. He would not live to 67. He didn't want to live to tomorrow. In the trenches of war Captain Spencer grew to resent his numbers. In the dark and the quiet, where there was nothing but the frightened breathing of his fellow soldiers and the rotted smells of gunpowder and the dead, he would sit and stare at them in anger, insulted by their ticking. How could they continue on into the future, when there was no future to be had? How could they promise something precious when surely the war had destroyed any good that was left in this wretched world? He rubbed at them with a rag and one drop of the sparse, precious alcohol. It did nothing. It never did. Elliot covered his wrist with his sleeve. A gunshot cut through the silence and he forgot the numbers and everything else but the war. Elliot Spencer had stopped looking at his numbers, and half-swore on a bottle that he never would again. He swore a lot on bottles. Bottles, pills, once a needle and too many times on his fragile and fragmented sobriety. He did not want to know when the moment came for him to meet his soulmate. Whoever she was, he thought miserably as he finished his drink and let it fall to the floor, she deserved better than the wreck that he'd become. Not that the thought made him want to be better; if anything it drove him further into his own hedonism, because at least if he was wholly ruined, she'd see it immediately, wouldn't try to save him when there was nothing left to save. It wasn't until he had hit the bottom, when even the high of heroin did nothing to help him escape the horrors in the back of his mind, that he saw them again tonight. 72 hours, almost 71, in the middle of the night. No, he thought with renewed horror, images playing through his mind of a woman looking at her wrist with hope in her eyes, seeing him and the hope dying in an instant. He couldn't do that to her. He had done things he was ashamed of; he had killed in the war, left people to die, he had fallen to this darkness and who knew how his family must have worried that he never came home to them and disappeared with only a letter of apology. He would not hurt her, whoever she was. Some wistful part of him loved her, a stranger he'd never seen, whose name he couldn't begin to dream up. A missed opportunity would be less painful, he thought, and he stood up to leave his tent. He had come here seeking a door to another world, and if it meant sparing his soulmate from a lifetime with what was left of him, then he would find it. It was the night he was supposed to meet her, and he was hiding in his tent with a gilded box. He's rolled his sleeves up for no good reason, and was looking at the number now and then as he worked with it. 1 hour. 59 minutes. 58. The time whittled away as he picked at the box, pushing and twisting, sliding his nails against the grooves. 50 minutes. She was probably waiting somewhere for him. Elliot shook his head and kept working. In his mind he saw her face - no concrete features beyond kind eyes, and he'd always had a soft spot for brown eyes, but this shifting image of a woman who knew nothing about him but the mark on her wrist that called him to her. Perhaps she was Indian, or English, or somewhere else entirely and he wasn't supposed to be here at all. 45 minutes. Something clicked. Despite the hollow sense in his chest, it excited him. He twisted something else, listening for that same sound, finding nothing. Frustrated, he set it back down and stared at it. He could hear mechanisms turning, little cranks and groans, and he wondered to himself. Was it resetting? The noises stopped. 30 minutes. He picked it up again. It took a few tries to make sense of it. He was slowly working out the pattern; like learning a maze, he retraced the same steps over and over, adding a new one to the last few every time a reaction occurred. He felt himself getting close to the end, to solving it properly. It was the closest thing to pride he'd felt in a long time. 15 minutes. What if it's nothing? The thought came like the bullet that had clipped his shoulder years before, the exit scar still present on his back. It was sudden and painful and overwhelming. I'll have wasted this moment for nothing. No, not for nothing. He closed his eyes, tried to get a clear picture of her again. Still no use. She'll be safe from me. He opened his eyes and soldiered on, working his way through the steps he'd already memorized and finally - finally - finding the last one. The box whirred in approval, and there was a second of silence more deafening than gunfire. He stared at it, sitting silently in his hands, and for a fleeting second he looked down to his wrist as he turned the box over. Six zeroes on his wrist, and the first one was slowly starting to disappear. Disappear? He looked down at the box, and the chains that lashed out to dig into his face blocked him from seeing the second clock. He screamed and grabbed at them, and then there was a horrible pulling and white-hot pain that swallowed him whole. Elliot James Spencer was gone. He did not know where he was, or who he was. he had no name, or sense of direction in the dark; only the pain under his skin, new and exhilarating agony, and the leather cassock clinging to his waist. The newly-formed Cenobite looked around him into the dark, then to his hands, and a mark on his paper-white wrist. A strange and pale blur that could have been a bruise, and under it were six numbers, dark blue, perfectly still. They started to count down. I just needed a little something to wind down after finishing TPatC, but I'm definitely adding a third part to this soon. Thanks for reading![Chapter 3] When the timer started - and it started within moments of his awakening - the timer marked sixty-six years, eight months, two weeks, a day and some-odd hours to seconds. The Cenobite Prince was always acutely aware of the seconds ticking away, and he never forgot what time it listed. It was his secret; something he shared with nobody but his gods, who in turn kept the secret of what it meant from him. It is part of your soul, Leviathan had told him on the first day - that first day with so many questions, so much fear and hunger and confusion, before he came into himself. He had never encountered a child Cenobite, but he would always consider those the days when he was young and new, new to this realm and to existence. He had been wrong about that. Perhaps it was vanity that led him to being disappointed when he found another clock. This was not his first student trembling before him, but he was still a student himself - peering at their wrist, ticking away days and hours and minutes instead of years as his did. His first impulse was to destroy it, but he remembered his lessons and quelled the urge before he could act on it. Instead he wrapped the wrists in leather cord and bound them against the chair, stepping back to study the young man who looked at him with wide, terrified eyes. \"What are you going to do to me?\" He asked in a whisper, and the Prince focused on the question to distract himself from his own. \"Nothing yet,\" he said, and the man wept. The Prince conjured a kerchief and brought it to his face - tears were such a waste to him, but he could understand the strangeness of it all. It was the least he could do to be a proper teacher. Fifty years and three months exactly: that was what his clock read when he encountered yet another, all zeroes. All zeroes. It was on the wrist of a woman in her 20's who was fighting tears as she accepted their offer and had taken his hand. In her touch he heard the despair of a family that did not accept her, that denied her identity, that had her lover killed. He could see another girl's face behind her tears, the fallen beloved, and another set of zeroes on her wrist as the two embraced with joyful smiles - a bittersweet memory. \"The numbers,\" he asked gently as he led her to her new home, \"what do they mean?\" \"It's different for everyone,\" she said, forcing down a sob, \"but that was when I met the love of my life. Now I'm never going to see her again.\" Something within him ached, and at the moment he was unsure why. There was no point in counting the seconds for fifty years, but he couldn't help checking once every now and then to see how much time was left. He had encountered more clocks - not everyone had one, but the ones that did had colorful and varied stories. Some were still running their watches, waiting for what it promised. Some ran out when they opened the box, or met their true love, or when a terrible catastrophe befell them. Some ran out when they discovered something that changed them. One story he'd heard was a summoner's sibling - the timer ran out at sixteen, and that moment was when she realized that she was meant to be a woman. A timer had appeared on her other wrist and started counting up, measuring the seconds of her new life as herself. He was unsure if he believed that one - he had seen few timers count upwards at all - but there was a charm to the thought. He contemplated his own clock as he thought of this, and as he looked at the numbers he realized something he had only been aware of on the surface, a realization that seized his chest and made him grow still. There was only one week left. He had lost count. In his anticipation and his effort to contain it he had lost count - the Prince was so concentrated on preparing for the day that when it came the impossible occurred, the one thing he'd never imagined in all the possibilities laid before him. He'd been caught off-guard. She was pretty, that was to be certain - but many women were pretty. He'd encountered so many souls that one more barely felt like anything. What captured his attention was that she was brave, that she was clever, able to find a way to slip out of their grasp even for a precious few minutes. When he and his Gash returned to the Labyrinth to wait and to listen, he found himself mulling over the encounter, and out of habit he pulled the thumb from his garment and peered under. A row of zeroes stared up at him, and he stared back. He had missed it. For the next two weeks nothing happened and his mask of calm tightened to keep him from screaming in frustration. What had it been? When had the second that he'd been waiting for passed by? Not Frank, what a horrible thought, Frank escaping was a humiliating culmination of his patience. He briefly mused on the girl, on her restoring their lost quarry, but something about that felt... incomplete. Like that wasn't the point. But what was it? Then the door was opened again, and he was forced to cover his thumb again. The leather was worn out from his habitual checking; he would have to have it repaired soon, or it would fall off completely. He'd been wrong. He remembered everything and he'd been wrong. Looking at Kirsty and the photo in his hand, he remembered - The Prince remembered himself, the man who used to be Elliot James Spencer. He remembered the war and the drugs and his vows on bottles and his body. He remembered escaping his despair chasing the high of a moment and hours of regret, the shame, the hunger. He remembered the first clock, now nothing more than a discolored patch on his wrist, what he'd considered the damnation of a beloved stranger. He looked at his covered wrist, then at Kirsty's - he couldn't see if she had a clock, but even if she didn't, that really wasn't the point. It was you, he thought, looking at her as his world came crashing down. You were the catalyst. You were what I was waiting for. There was a guttural growl and he looked up at Channard, feeling an old fire spark within himself. It had burned within him decades ago as a soldier, long before the war snuffed it out. He readied himself for battle as his Gash did the same. He would not let her die. He wasn't dead. He wasn't the Prince, he wasn't Elliot, and he wasn't dead. He swam somewhere between them as the world came back to him, the past and present merging into something else as he opened his eyes and took in the world once more. He was bleeding - he was bleeding, not anymore, now he felt no pain in his throat. There was only wet warmth and something squeezing his hand. Already he could feel himself changing, the human mask cast on him melting away. His fingers lost their color as he sat up - and finally he realized he only had one hand free. He looked to his left, to her, holding his hand and staring at it. \"Oh my god,\" she whispered, and he started to correct her when she turned his wrist for him to see, alongside her own. Two clocks, identical in color, size, and location. And time. They were both counting upwards. I'm not sure it was clear in the last chapter, but Elliot's two timers add up to around 100 years, the second one starting immediately after the first one finishes. Originally I was going to spell this out, but it felt a little too close to my other story First, since that's all about the 100-year motif. Either way, hope this clears things up! ... and I'm probably going to end up doing a part four. I intended for this to be the chapter where they both get a perspective in, but clearly that didn't happen. Oops.[Chapter 4] \"I'm sorry.\" Kirsty stared at the man in front of her; his face was still human, and blue eyes looked up at her in what she could only see as despair. \"I'm so sorry, I didn't want this...\" That strange echo from before was there, but far away and faint. The clocks had no nerve endings but she felt them just the same, the synchronized upward tick of their numbers, measuring the seconds of their shared future. \"You're... sorry?\" She whispered, furrowing her brow. This man had died for her, revived by some mercy she couldn't explain; she had been counting down the seconds of her life, and now this strange mark had all but promised her she'd never have to. Her mind was reeling with the strange understanding that she was not going to die young, might not die at all in this strange and inexplicable place. She had never expected this; certainly she had never expected him, but here he was, looking at her with mourning as the color drained from him, an upward crawl of paper-white easing across his skin. \"Sorry for what?\" \"For what I...\" he looked down at his hand. It had lost its color already; the hair was starting to thin at his head and his eyes were darkening. \"For what I was. The man in the photo is not the man I am now.\" As he spoke his voice grew deeper, his expression calmer. He could not hide the guilt in his eyes, though. \"I suppose that is truer now than ever before.\" \"I'm not sure I understand.\" She looked down at her wrist again, at the ticking numbers. \"When I first got this... I didn't think it meant I was supposed to meet someone.\" \"I did.\" He turned his wrist to her with a sad smile, and now the pale blue blur was easier to spot against his flesh than it had been on pink. \"I had two, once upon a time. The first one counted to about thirty-three years, and I was so sure...\" A great shifting sound cut him off, and Kirsty looked over her shoulder towards it. She felt a hand grip hers, and turned back to him, to see that stern expression she remembered from their first meeting. \"That's the door, Kirsty,\" he said, \"and when it closes, I can't open it for you again. You'll have to decide now what you want to do.\" She looked back again, her soul somehow knowing the way; but something else in her knew that on the other side just lay more hospitals, more boxes, more Franks and Julias and doctors who didn't want to help. Her father wasn't here, but he wouldn't be out there, either. She got to her feet, and turned back to the man who'd once been Elliot Spencer, offering her hands. After a moment of staring - of true and affected shock - he reached up with one hand, the other moving to push him off the floor properly. She heard another groan and knew the door was closing, and that she wouldn't be on the other side. The man - the Prince - looked at her with polite concern, his unnatural calm restored. \"You're never going to have your old life back,\" he said, the last traces of his human voice fading with each word. She tried to smile with a shrug, but both were half-hearted and not as carefree as she wanted. \"I wasn't going to anyway,\" she said, and with one last sound the door closed her into the Labyrinth. The Prince, of course, had to explain what had happened. His Gash were still in their death-slumber, not quite ready to awaken; he had visited their sleeping forms and though he had not wept, his soul ached to see them motionless and beyond his reach. Even their minds, so rich and open to each other, were quiet. He remembered mourning during the war, and now he mourned again. Knowing they would return did nothing to soothe him, and the only thing he could truly do was distract himself. It seemed there was much to distract him. He couldn't argue with his god, because he wasn't a heretic and he wasn't an idiot. He did, however, have questions; and he'd offered his questions with humility and with as much grace as he could muster, and to his own credit, he'd managed to get answers without losing patience or breaking his deference to Leviathan. That was remarkably difficult with the creeping ghosts of what he now wondered might be post-traumatic stress, a term he'd never heard in his human lifetime but now seemed to ring a sort of truth to the quiet humanity in his soul. His humanity had been deliberately silenced; not washed away but quieted, shaped into the foundation of who he was now. Looking at his wrist, the Prince thought about the first missing timer; no longer present but not truly gone, the dim background of the future that ticked away as patiently as it had before he had known why it was counting. He was not a lie, and that did ease some troubled thoughts. This, the Cenobite, was who he was now; not a replacement for the mind of Elliot Spencer, but a different phase, a transformation. He could accept that. The true question that weighed on him, however, did not have an answer that lay at his god's disposal. It was with the woman who Leviathan had allowed to stay as she was, a resident of the Labyrinth who would remain untouched by it until she said otherwise. He walked down the long halls of his home and down the stairs to the layer just beneath the first one, where his chambers awaited behind a dark and gilded door. The candlelight that danced across the stone walls was a soft blue; he found it less garish than the yellow of Earth's sun, and perhaps he could compare it to the ethereal glow of moonlight. The flames brightened at his approach, lighting the way to her. Soulmate, he thought in the last fading whispers of Elliot's voice, a pang of human guilt striking his heart as he approached the door. He was not the man who had wanted so desperately to save himself from her. There was no drug, no drink, no desire that could divert him now, no substance that could drag him down to the place he'd been when the minutes of his human lifetime had run out. Knowing that didn't quell the guilt, the small apology in his human mind that she was bound to him forever. The Cenobite that he was did not feel the same guilt for that. The only thing the Prince felt, now especially as he approached the door and heard her soft voice weeping on the other side, was concern. Lightly, delicately, he knocked on the door. \"Kirsty?\" he asked, and the sobbing stopped. \"May I come in?\" He heard her clear her throat. \"Yes.\" There's one more part I was going to upload tonight with this one, but I can't keep my eyes open to finish editing it. It'll be up by morning![Chapter 5] Kirsty couldn't imagine what she looked like now; she wasn't even certain how long she'd been crying, or when she'd started. He had led her here what must have been hours ago; through the halls of the Labyrinth, which felt only slightly less threatening and more inviting by his side even in its strangeness, to his chambers tucked away from any peering eyes or curious whispers. This room was hers, and he had given her permission to wander as she pleased while he took care of what he had to. When he disappeared, however, she found exploring didn't interest her; instead her mind turned inward to the numbers and to Frank and Tiffany and her father, and somehow all of these things had come together and descended on her in an avalanche. Sitting here on these soft sheets and holding the steel blue quilt around herself, Kirsty felt the first overwhelmed sob rise to the top of her throat, and when it spilled out all of her agonies followed it. She cried, loud and unheard, mourning her father and her innocence and any certainty she might have had about the future. She was bound to somebody in this strange new world, but without the Earth she knew or the strange serenity that had come with believing she knew her future, she felt overwhelmingly lost and alone. There was nothing she could do but cry. That had been some time ago. She had tired herself out now, and as the Cenobite opened the door and looked at her she imagined her eyes must have been swollen pink. She half-expected him to admonish her for crying, as he had the first time they met, but instead he walked to the side of her bed and sat on its edge, one or two feet away from where she was hugging her knees to her chest. She swallowed and slid herself a little closer, not wanting to feel so far away from the man who was apparently more important than she could have ever imagined. He reached towards her after a moment's consideration, and when she didn't pull away he brushed the back of his finger against her cheek, wiping away a tear. \"I thought they were a waste,\" she said, her eyes meeting his. The slightest crease in his brow was the only indication of any emotion behind that calm expression. He pushed the stripe of dampness from her cheek, the leather on his thumb worn from age and unexpectedly soft on her skin. \"In most cases, yes,\" he said, his hand moving to her other cheek to repeat the action, \"but I suppose... there are exceptions to every rule.\" His voice still wasn't completely restored, but it was more Cenobite than human. His face and form were completely restored; how his pins had returned, she wasn't sure she should ask. Instead she cleared her throat again, trying to put words to her thoughts, to fill the strange silence between them. \"You need not speak if you do not want to, Kirsty,\" he said, and the way he said her name was comforting in a way she couldn't explain. It was as if she had waited her whole life for somebody to say her name with the softness he did, the way he made it sound in her ears. \"I do want to,\" she said, letting him push a curl of hair from her face, \"I'm just uncertain what I should say.\" Was he touching her for her sake or for his? She found she didn't mind either option. Finally something coherent rose above her clouded, muddy thoughts. \"You... apologized earlier. Why?\" He exhaled, and she only knew it was a sigh because it couldn't have been anything else; he tucked two strands he'd curled around his fingers behind her ear and pulled his hand away. She found herself disappointed by that, just a little. \"... The photo that you found,\" he started to say, \"was taken before the end of the war. The man in that photo was...\" he hesitated, eyes moving oh-so-slightly to each side as he searched for words, \"...a different man from the one who opened the box. The man that I used to be,\" and the emphasis on \"I\" seemed to be more for himself than for her, \"was not someone with much reason to be proud. I had been immersed in vices.\" He paused again, and she saw a flash of deep, shameful blue in his eyes even as his lips only frowned the slightest bit. \"I was addicted to opium,\" he said, \"and alcohol, and women. I knew that it was not a place worth staying in, but I could not bring myself to leave. That was the man who apologized to you.\" Kirsty nodded, absorbing everything he said, but she still felt she was missing a piece. \"But apologized for what?\" She asked, and he closed his eyes. \"Perhaps I should start from the beginning. It might be helpful for both of us.\" The Prince was not a man who particularly liked to share parts of himself, but Elliot wanted to tell her everything. Slowly the two sides of himself had merged into one, and he found himself thinking of them not of individuals but as perspectives, two facets of himself that would work in tandem with each other from now on. The first decision he made from this new perspective was surprisingly simple, and that was to be honest with the young woman sitting just inches from him on this modest blue-sheeted bed. He told her about the first timer - she wanted to see the blur again, and when he showed her his wrist she ran soft fingertips over it with quiet curiosity. He told her about how it counted down to thirty-three years and he'd expected, had thought he'd known, that it was counting down to meet the one he was always meant to meet, and how he'd been wrong. He told her about the second timer with sixty-seven years on it, which just sat and waited without moving until his transformation, and how he'd never been sure what it meant until it finished counting. He explained - in short sentences and minimal details, finding it hard to revisit that place, a pain he couldn't savor - how the war left him scarred and frightened and unable to relax. He did not mention his family, shame blanketing the memories as he remembered their letters and faces, and instead simply told her that he left England for India when his vices stopped working, chasing down anything to make him feel something again. He told her about running away. \"I spent the years after the war despising what I'd become,\" he said, looking at his wrist, \"and thinking that the timer was a damnation.\" \"For what?\" As he'd spoken Kirsty had taken to asking more questions, making more remarks, and he found that didn't feel like a problem. Watching her slowly unfold from the frightened ball she'd been when he first entered was almost relieving, and now she was sitting on the side of the bed with him, eyes no longer swollen and her expression one of quiet interest. \"For you,\" he said, and her eyebrows knit together. \"I still believed that it was counting down to meeting... my soulmate, I suppose, and I couldn't imagine anyone at all being happy while bound to me. Not when I was addicted and miserable.\" She frowned and looked down at her own wrist, and he could hear the suggestions of emotion coming off of her - doubt, indecision. He almost reached for her cheek again, tempted to peek into her mind and hear just what she was thinking about, but he found her voice, how she chose to speak those thoughts, to be much more interesting than the unfiltered source of them. \"Does that trouble you?\" He asked, and she shook her head. \"It's... not that.\" She held up her own wrist, looking at the little blue numbers. Twelve hours, had it really been twelve hours? It felt like eternity and an instant all at once to him. \"When... this showed up, I didn't think it was...\" She took a breath and started again. \"I wasn't waiting for anybody. I didn't really know... there was more than one thing it could be.\" \"What did you think it was?\" Now he was curious, because these numbers told him so much about the people who bore them, and he found himself utterly intrigued in the life and mind of Kirsty Cotton. She closed her hand into a loose fist and smiled sadly. \"You know, maybe I should have questioned it more... it was Frank that told me.\" A quiet fury sparked in his chest, but he silenced it to keep his attention on her. He would save his wrath towards Frank for later. \"I thought... this was counting down all the minutes in my life. Completely.\" For the first time she laughed, but it was small and sad. \"I thought... I really thought I was going to die in that hospital room. But I didn't. And I didn't really... plan for anything after that.\" She gave another small laugh, pushing her bangs from her face. \"I didn't really... think I'd get any further than that. I don't... know what to do with myself.\" \"Perhaps rest would be a good place to start.\" She looked up at him and nodded, exhaustion settling in her gaze. \"I imagine we could both use some time to recover from today.\" He started to stand again. \"If you need to find me, simply ask. The corridors will show you the way. Rest well, Kirsty.\" \"Wait.\" He had already started to turn, to retreat from such a strange and vulnerable exchange, when Kirsty's hand reached out for his own. She stood up, swallowing a little. \"...Thank you. For saving my life.\" \"You are certainly welcome, Kirsty,\" he said, and after a moment's consideration (and a moment of human sentiment), he lifted her hand and gently kissed the back of it. Another moment's thought and he turned his grip, pressing another kiss to the numbers on her wrist. She turned a soft shade of pink in her cheeks at that, and he allowed himself to smile. \"Rest well.\" \"...You too,\" she said, but before he could pull away she took her hand back with his. He watched with interest as she studied his own numbers, and then she leaned forward, brushing her lips against his skin. He felt like a foolish schoolboy with how that made his pulse pick up, but then she smiled, a shy smile just for him, and he banished the thought of being ashamed of it. He had waited one hundred years for her, and if she was going to make his heart race, then so be it. She let go of his hand, and he nodded at her, resisting the urge to lean forward and kiss her lips. He desperately wanted to, but there was only so much emotion he could handle in one night. Instead he brushed the side of her face one more time before pulling away. \"Good night, Kirsty,\" he said, and he left her in her room. The last sight he caught as he closed the door was her sitting back down on the bed, reaching for one of the pillows and pressing her hand into it. The door shut with a faint click, and he stared at it for a moment. He finally forced himself away from the door and toward his study, determined to immerse himself in his work until he felt something close to normal again. The Prince delved into his writings; for all of the chaos of this last day, he had learned a considerable amount from studying Channard that he intended to record. He lost himself in writing, dark ink on old and thickened parchment, until finally he found himself at the end of the day's observations. There was much more to learn, to examine, but the Prince was absolutely exhausted. Perhaps he needed rest after all. As he rose from his desk, he reached across its polished black surface to lift a small glass sphere from a clawed and bladed pedestal, an ornate little thing he'd been given decades before. He turned the ball in his hand, watching the mirrored disk inside slowly turn on its sideways axis. \"Show her to me,\" he said, and the mirror spun into a blur that melted into an image of blue. Kirsty lay on the bed in a simple nightgown, eyes closed, a mask of serenity on her tired face. Content, he set the sphere back down and watched the image fade. With one last thoughtful glance, he walked away from his desk and made his way towards his bedchamber, where rest and time for contemplation awaited him. There was a strange future that lay before him - he was no longer just himself, his understanding of this world had changed, and he now had a companion in the form of a truly remarkable young woman. As he thought about her sleeping form, the peace on her face, he let exhaustion settle into his own shoulders. The Prince took one glance at the numbers - sixteen hours - before covering it once more. Kirsty needed the rest, and so did he. The future could wait until tomorrow. So this is a blast to write, but I think I'm going to put a pin in it for the time being so I can focus on my other projects.

Zombieland: Light the Dawn Columbus POV Columbus watched as the shoulder flew by as they drove down the road. Wichita, actually Krista was just watching out for anything that might come in handy. Tallahassee was still savoring his Twinkie and Little Rock was passed out and leaning against the window. Columbus was pretty happy with himself that was shocking seeing as his family is either dead or mindless zombies and they could be attacked any minute by zombies. He looked and at a sign; they were less than an hour away from San Diego. \"Hey look San Diego, I bet we could find something to eat there, maybe even more Twinkies\". Tallahassee nodded and it was decided they floored it on the open road and made it there in no time. They pulled in at a Denny's and climbed out. Tallahassee let off a round and they waited. No sound were heard, \"Girls, why don't you go whip up some grub while me, and snow white hear go see if we can't find a gun or outdoor sports store for some ammo\". Wichita smiled at him and they were off. They looked around and saw a Dunham's and headed for it. Columbus looked around the town was eerily quiet and quite deserted. Columbus followed Rule #18 Limber UP before they blew a hole into the glass door and walked inside, suddenly a snarl rang out and a burly zombie in a football gear came running out of nowhere. \"That just ain't fair\" groaned Tallahassee as he unloaded a few round in the guy but he kept coming. \"Split Up\" he yelled and they took off in opposite directions. Columbus ducked through racks of sporting attire and saw another zombie pop out from the back he let loose both barrels and its head ceased to be on its shoulders. He could still hear the armored tank chasing behind him. He was really glad that he had limbered up and was fit. He looked ahead and hanging from the ceiling was a sign, some balls and a big kayak. He aimed and hope to hell this didn't back fire. He shot the brackets and the kayak tipped and started to swing forward and pulled the other brackets out and hurtled towards him. He dived and it flew over him barely missing him and smashed into the zombie and landed it on its ass and it wasn't able to get up. He walked over and delivered two bullets in between the faceguard and it stop moving. \"Keeyah\" yelled Tallahassee as he barreled out of nowhere with a big axe. He stared at the zombie and looked at Columbus, \"Dammit that was going to be my zombie kill of the week\". They cleared the place and broke into the gun case and Col had to give Tallahassee a little firing spree before they grabbed a few duffels and stuffed all the guns and ammo inside and marched outside happily. Little Rock was standing outside waving towards them. They dropped the guns in the entrance and sat down to have some breakfast and they dug into stacks of French toast, pancakes, sausage, manly bacon and more. After they finished they loaded back up and drove through town looking for any survivors and were pretty sure there weren't any when a red flare went up around the corner. They sped towards it and came around to find a bunch of people behind a barricade of cars in front of a movie theatre. A large horde of zombies were trying to get at the people, and were close to getting through. Columbus rolled down his window and opened fired and plugged one straight in the chest. Little Rock popped out the moon-roof and fires her gun while Wichita ran them over. They stopped in front of the barricade and everyone opened fire and soon had killed most of the zombies. \"Put your hands up and guns down\" yelled a lady's voice. \"No until every last zombie is dead and I can see you\" yelled Tallahassee. A shot blasted the car's hood and smoke hissed from the engine. \"GOD Dammit, you don't fuck with a man's Cadillac\" scream Tallahassee. He fired his rifle at the barricade and a tire fell off. Everyone was quiet and then a car tumbled out of place and they found a young woman, 2 teenage guys and a girl and a big husky. \"Hi\" said Little Rock, after everyone calmed down and they introduced each other. The woman was Jamie, the guys were Drew and Max and the girl was Lisa. They all piled in and steered towards somewhere to stay for the night. They found a Courtyard Marriot and pulled in. They pulled the gates shut and found the hotel deserted yet thankfully zombie free. They found both running water and electricity. They grabbed a couple of penthouses and headed upstairs. Columbus relished in the fact of a shower to get all the grime off of him from the many zombie guts. He searched through some peoples stuff and found a pair of jeans and a shirt and hoodie to toss on. He went over next door and was greeted by a scream as Little Rock and Wichita naked fresh from the shower. He rushed out and ran into Tallahassee who had a big ole' grin on his face. \"Pretty sneaky Columbo\", he laughed and walked away to his room. \"He's right, you could've asked\" said a voice behind him. He turned to find a now dressed Krista. \"Let's go somewhere\" she said and grabbed his hand and pulled him off. Little Rock stood there just staring after them and rolled her eyes. Krista led him to the balcony and they stared off over the sea and watched the sun go down. She leaned her head against his chest and sighed \"I feel safe when you're around. Like the world is just a little bit less zombie-ridden\". He looked down and they kissed. Little Rock's POV So stupid Cupid comes along and barges in while they were naked and doesn't even apologize. Then Krista has to go run off with him to do stuff she had the displeasure of knowing\" She watched as they strolled off like two giddy newlyweds. She walked back inside. She pulled on a pair of pants, a shirt and a hoodie and her lucky boots and strolled out the door. She wandered around in search of entertainment when she hit the jackpot. The hotel arcade, it was huge, she found the circuit breaker and flipped the switch and the place lit up like a Christmas tree. She walked through the arcade until she came across a zombie game. It sent shivers down her spine how she used to play all those games and laugh when the heads blew up yet she was living it now. She swiped her room card and the game came alive. Zombie slowly shuffled towards the screen. She fired the gun and it just disappeared. She fired over and over again. It felt so well, a way to finally relieve the stress of everything. She left the game and kept moving She played pinball for a while racking up the high score. \"Hey\" said a voice behind her. She twisted around and came face to face to one of the new people. \"Hi, um what's your name again?\" she asked. The guy was about 5'6 and was about 12 or 13; he had messy black hair and brown eyes. \"The name's Drew, what's yours\", she just stared at him for a second \"Umm, Little Rock is what my sister came up with. It helps prevent getting attached. But I'm Katie\". He smiled \"wanna go have some target practice on the roof.\" She just nodded and he grabbed her hand and led the way. They took the elevator up and then had to climb a couple of flights of stairs before they came up on the roof. Leaned against the wall were a Barrett Sniper Rifle and some binoculars. Drew picked up the rifle and Little Rock grabbed the binoculars and found they had night vision. She scanned the town and found zombies out in a mass just aimlessly walking. \"Ok, the fat guy in front of Subway\". She scanned and found the guy Drew was talking about. Then crack and he fell to the ground as the sniper round pierced his head. \"Nice One' she said. She grabbed the rifle and scanned for a better target. She found three zombies moving in a line. \"Triple kill\" she fired and they fell down dead. He just stared at her with a grin. \"You're a natural, hope I never end on the wrong end of that barrel. ' She smiled as the continued to thin the zombie population, after a couple of clips they decided to go grab a snack. They broke into a vending machine and snacked on some candy bars. \"So how did you end up in that theatre with those people\" He looked down for a little, \"I lived in Illinois before the virus hit. My family got bitten and I ended up having to put them down. I hitched along with a bunch of people but we slowly began to get divided and killed off so I left and just wandered about. I learned to drive and just kept moving. Jamie and her kids were just living in their old house when I found them, and I met Zeke when he saved me from a zombie who snuck up on me\" Little Rock patted his shoulder. \"That's amazing for what a 12 or 13 year old?\" Actually I'm 14 was just about to start high school\". A hunk and older, Little Rock hit a gold mine. \"Drew, you don't happen to have a girlfriend do you\". He looked at her and smiled and leaned in and pressed his lips against hers. She leaned into it and they parted \"That was a great answer\" she finally confided. He wrapped his arm around her and they just sat there. Eventually Columbus and Krista walked by beaming like the sun from the activities. Wichita smiled when she saw her with Drew. \"Don't you two look cute, nice catch Ka... Little Rock\" Katie smiled at her sister and nodded. She yawned and realized that it was pretty late. \"See you in the morning goodnight\" she kissed him on the lips goodnight and strolled back to her room. She got undressed and just hopped in bed in her underwear. She fell asleep as soon as she hit the soft bed. The first bed she'd slept in peace in a long long time. Katie dreamt that she was on the tunnel of love ride at Pacific Playland. She looked across and Drew was sitting there with his handsome face that made her heart flip. He leaned in and kissed her and she just melted like butter. She would be happy except for a stupid squeaking noise. She figured it was the ride but it just got louder and louder until she popped awake and was greeted to a terrifying sight. Columbus and Wichita were in the other bed going twelve toes. \"OMG, why, why, why with me here\" she shouted as she ran out into the hall. She slammed the door. She was pissed that her sister was doing that but from what she saw had kinda gotten her turned on, especially how she also had dreamt about Drew. She walked down the hall and knocked on Tallahassee's room and he opened the door a smidge and looked at her and she got the picture. She kept walking. \"Was she the only one who wasn't getting laid\" She finally gave up and knocked on the door she hadn't planned on. The door opened and there was Drew, in his boxers. He was surprised, \"Um, is there a reason you're knocking on my door at 2 in the morning in just your underwear\". She blushed and got really self-concious for a second, \"My sister is having a guest in her room and long story I can't sleep there\". He nodded and motioned for her to come in. He plopped on one of the beds and he pointed to the other one. \"Oh, I thought… um never mind\". She crawled into bed and tried to get back to sleep. After a good night's sleep everyone got dressed and met in one of the rooms. Jamie and her kids, Drew, Katie and Krista and Columbus and Tallahassee, everyone just looked around until Columbus finally started. \"We've been traveling pretty much looking for a peaceful place to settle and rebuild. We could always use more people. So do you wish to stay or do we part paths\"? Jamie stepped forward, \"It would be a great help in protecting my kids so I think we will stay with you guys. I believe that we should head north as cold makes the zombie weaker as they are similar to cold blooded animals\". It seemed to make sense from Katie and everyone else. They ate a quick breakfast and prepared to leave. \"Now that we are all chummy, we got a lot of people and a dog and I prefer not to have my knees to my face. There's a mall and dealerships up that street. I say we go up there, get some supplies and some new rides and then get the hell out of here\". Everyone nodded so they loaded up in the Caddy and rolled towards the mall. They smashed through the glass doors and climbed out. They handed out guns and everyone went on their way. Overview POV The girls went on a shopping spree hitting the GAP, JCPenny's and all the designer clothing stores. While the guys were on supply duty; they grabbed food and first aid stuff. They got more ammo and some clips so they could reload the rifles they found quickly. After everyone had gotten everything they looked around for some rides. They found a large RV, a Camaro and to Tallahassee delight a nice Cadillac Escalade. Columbus and Wichita got into the Camaro, Tallahassee drove his caddy and everyone else piled into the RV and they drove out of town and began to head towards the north.[Chapter 2] Well its be awhile, been super busy with school, so here's one before the new year. C.C Chapter 2:Crimson Tide Little Rock's POV Katie lay on a bunk in the back of the RV as they sped down the highway towards the north. She wondered what might await them on the road. She could hear the roar of the engine of the Camaro that stupid Columbus and Wichita were driving. She swore the next time they stopped she was gonna get Drew to pick up a ride of his own cause this wasn't her dream having to ride with Jamie, Zeke, Liza and Max. She closed her eyes and drifted off for a quick nap. She dreamt of Drew of course. They were back at the hotel. She turned and came face to face with and he leaned in and planted a soft kiss on her nose. She squinted and laughed. Then he kissed her on the lips and she melted like butter. She grabbed him and pulled him closer and deepened the kiss. She pushed him over and climbed on top and pressed up against him. She snaked her tongue into his mouth and hers intertwined with his and they let go. They broke apart and he smiled at her and then boom, she woke up on the floor. She groaned as she picked herself off the ground after rolling out of bed. She changed her clothes and she got up and grabbed a gun and climbed up on top of the RV and just watched the scenery and picked off a few zombies that she saw along the road Overview POV They made a good time and were almost out of California. They ended up pulling in at a state park and unloaded some gear and decided to have a cookout Columbus POV Why he and the men were the only ones helping out had him confused. The girl mostly sat at the picnic tables just talking. He asked the others and they all grinned, \"Why not ask them for some help\" said Tallahassee. He puffed out his chest, \"Well maybe I will\". He turned to the girls and yelled \"You girls wanna come maybe help out with some of this work\". He received a 4 finger salute and the guys laughed at him and they continued to set up to cook some food. He and Drew decided to collect firewood and they got to talking. \"So you and that Wichita chick huh Columbus\" inquired Drew. Columbus blushed a little, he had gotten a little drunk last night and he and Krista had put Percy in the playpen, knocked boots or whatever euphemisms Tallahassee used and it was well needed. It was a little embarrassing when Little Rock woke up but they decided it was ok and kept going. \"Yeah, I kinda saved her life so she's obsessed with me\". Drew laughed \"Would she agree with that statement. Columbus almost had a heart attack at the thought \"You wouldn't dare\". Drew laughed at him as they moved along, they were almost done when the stumbled upon a site with embers still slightly red. They ran back to their site and explained what they saw. Tallahassee just blew off saying someone probably was there but left when they showed up. They got a fire roaring and were soon cooking hot dogs and making smores. Everyone chatted and got to know each other. Eventually everyone went to sleep and the guys took up a watch around the RV and took turns sleeping. They decided to spend the next day there as they weren't in too much of a hurry. Everyone switched into swimwear and took a dip into the nearby lake. Wichita had on a sexy blue bikini, she came strutting by and just plopped down in his lap. \"Hey Columbus, want to go exploring \", she grabbed his hand and they took a walk around the lake. Drew POV Drew was playing with Zeke, tossing a Frisbee and watching the dog gleefully jump up and grab it with his teeth, Drew owed his life to that dog. Zeke came trotting up wagging his tail and gave a excited bark. He heard someone call his name and he turned and saw Little Rock in a bikini top and short shorts. He waved and she ran over. \"So…. you want to go swimming with me\" asked L.R. He nodded and he pulled off his shirt and they ran into the lake. Everyone spent the day enjoying some rest and relaxation without a care in the world. That Night Drew couldn't sleep so he grabbed his gear and went for a walk. There was no moon out tonight so Drew pulled out a flashlight and walked into the woods, he pulled out his night vision goggles so he could see and moved through the woods. He went on for a while when he tripped over something. He turned and saw a zombie that had been multiple times. It was still oozing black blood. It was fresh. He listened and heard a loud engine drive away and he knew it was an ambush. He ran back to camp as fast as he could but he was too late. A black jeep was parked at the campsite. Two men had dragged everyone outside and threw them on the ground. Drew zoomed in and saw Tallahassee, Columbus and Max knocked out and zip-tied to a tree while the girls were huddled together. The guys were going over their supplies and firearms. Drew managed to get to the tree line and pulled out his rifle. Little Rock POV Little Rock was asleep when a loud crash woke her up, a bright light blinded her and someone punched her hard across the face and steered her to the door and threw her on the ground. She saw Krista and crawled over to her. She looked around and saw Tallahassee, Columbus and that Max guy knocked out but she didn't see Drew. \"Hey Mickey, take a look at these guns, we hit the mother lode, and take a look at these pretty faces\". \"You can just go fuck yourself buddy, It isn't going to happen\" yelled Krista. The guy walked over and pulled a knife. He pressed it up against her sister's throat. \"I'd watch that tongue, unless you don't have any use for it anymore\". He looked her dead in the eye and then he looked at me and grabbed me and pulled me from my sister's grasp. \"I bet you'd think again if we started hurting your sister I'm guessing\". \"NO, don't hurt her\" Krista yelled. She felt the cold blade pressed against my cheek. \"I'm sure she could entertain me and my friend\" he laughed, She tried to struggle against the man's grip but he was too strong, he squeezed her arm and she cried out in pain. He twisted her around and she came face to face with him. She could see evil in his eyes. She knew she was in danger. He threw her to the ground and he advanced on her. She tried to crawl backwards but he grabbed her ankle. She closed her eyes and tried to kick when she felt something warm and wet land on her face. She screamed, but when the man cried out she opened her eyes, she realized it was blood from a hole where his kneecap used to be. Mickey came running over and was soon shot and was on the ground. A rustle came from the brush and Drew appeared rifle held high trained on the two men. \"Everyone get going. I'll catch up with you\". He flick opened a combat knife and freed the men and woke them up. Little Rock hugged Drew and ran into her sister's arms. They piled into the vehicles and drove off. Drew POV Drew watched the rear lights dim into the distance. \"So, you guys just thought it would be a good idea to attack a group of innocent people FOR WHAT\" he yelled. He pulled out his pistol, \"I saw you manhandle that girl, MY GIRL\". One of the guys spoke up \"I think we got off on the wrong foot, I'm Simon and this here is Mickey, we're just scavengers, we weren't planning on killing anyone\". Drew pistol whipped him across the face. Blood trickled down his nose and mouth. \"You were trying to get your rocks off I saw you, you're a goddamn liar and I hate liars\", he put a bullet into Simon's foot. He screamed but Drew wasn't finish with him. \"Shut up\" he yelled then hit him again. Simon immediately shut his mouth, \"And you, think it's great to steal\", Mickey shook his head. Drew put a bullet into his side. \"Remember I hate liars\" Mickey cried out and begged for mercy. Drew kicked him in the balls and he fell over. \"I'm gonna teach you a permanent lesson. He hit them both with his pistol and walked to their jeep, he found some rope and tied them back to back. \"Please, don't do this\" cried Simon. Drew put a slug in his arm. Drew searched around and found something interesting, some grenades they probably stole from some military supply or something. He got some duct tape and taped them to Mickey's chest and Simon's crotch. \"A little special treatment for your actions\" he explained. He tied string to the pins and tied it to the bumper of their Jeep. \"Well maybe next time you'll think… ah who am I kidding what next time? Have fun in hell you fucking assholes\". He started the jeep and revved the engine. The two men yelled but the engine drowned out their pleas. He shifted into drive and sped off. He kept an eye in rearview and after a few seconds. A big explosion covered the entire view. He drove for half an hour and found everyone on the side of the road. Thanks for reading always appreciate reviews, it often makes me want to put up chapters faster.[Chapter 3] Now that school is over I hope to get a more active in some of my stories. C.C Chapter 3: Setting Sun Katie was laying in the back of Drew's jeep as they drove up the highway. They were moving past dense forest and she would see the occasional car on the side of the road that was burned out or destroyed. \"Hey, how long until we stop for breakfast\" she asked. He shrugged his shoulders and picked up a walkie-talkie and clicked the call button. \"Hey I think there's a town up ahead I think we should stop for a little while and eat\". She couldn't hear the response but figured they were gonna stop. After 25 mins they pulled into a town called Cedar Springs. They found a roadside diner and after a disagreement with the unfriendly staff they cooked some food and sat down and ate. Afterwards they split up, and searched the town. Katie walked with Drew as they searched a few side street businesses. \"So, what happened, after we left\", Drew stopped for a second and stiffened. \"Forget about it\", Drew kept walking. Katie stood there shocked, she ran and grabbed his wrist and made him face her. \"What do you mean don't worry about it. I was almost attacked and then suddenly you appear and shoot one guy through the knee and then the other guy. I still remember that guy's blood splattering on my face\". He looked into her eyes and pulled her into hug, \"Don't worry, I'll protect you\". He let go and kept walking, Katie just stared at him. Somewhere Else Columbus, Krista and Tallahassee were walking through the town not seeing much but the past night hanging on their mind. \"So how in the world did two guys managed to sneak up and take down the three of you and not have a single scratch on them\" questioned Krista. \"Well, I was having a doctor's appointment and had left Colombo and that Max kid to guard the camp but I should've known that they weren't going to be any protection\" defended Talla. \"We'll sorry if I wasn't expecting someone to be racing out of the forest and knock me the fuck out\" Columbus rebutted. \"There still is one thing that bothers me, even though he did save us from them, why was Drew away from the camp and he came from the same direction as the scavengers. I just don't like the fact that he was the only one missing and is the only one who no one knew before three days ago\" remarked Krista \"I think you guys should take a have a chat with that Drew kid especially if he's gonna be hanging out with my sister\". They nodded and kept making their way through the town.' Few hours later They had found a few supplies in Cedar Springs but they decided to pack it up and keep moving and get somewhere more secluded before stopping for the night. Katie was cuddling in the bed with Drew as they watched a movie they had found at a Best Buy at Cedar Springs when Columbus and Tallahassee walked into the RV and came over to them, \"Hey Katie, can we have a talk with Drew for a bit\" asked Talla. She slowly nodded, Drew followed them out the door and they walked into the woods. Katie wondered what this was all about. Columbus and Tallahassee led Drew a little ways from camp and sat him down. \"Drew, we need to ask you a few questions just to get to know you and to truly figure out if we can trust you. Drew nodded, \"Where did you come from before you met Jamie and her kids. Drew sighed, \"I was part of the Storm Slaughters, we were kind of like a mercenary/scavenger group but we had a code to protect innocent people from those who mercilessly kill people and before that all I don't remember. The guys just nodded, \"Ok, so why was it that you weren't at camp when those two guys attacked camp, I know you shot them but still it's slightly suspicious\". Drew breathed, \"This probably sounds stupid but I just went for a walk, then I found dead zombie heard the Jeep and, I came running back I swear. Tallahassee stared into his eyes then nodded, accepting his answer. \"One last thing, I see you've got your eyes set on the little munchkin back there now seeing as her father isn't here, I believe I have the right to do this. Tallahassee pulled his pistol and shoved it into Drew's crotch, \"You do anything to hurt her or to break her heart, and there'll be one less male and one more female in our group, Comprende\". Drew slowly nodded and let out a sigh of relief. \"Also, here's something just in case you guys think you're grown up for a night\" Tallahassee slid a square package into his hand. They all stood up and walked back to camp. The next morning they got back on the road and kept moving north and by nightfall had gotten to Oregon. They came up on a town and thought it would be ok to stop on for the night, they drove down the highway and turned off onto an exit, they cruised through the streets when a pack of zombies started charging from the sides of the underpass and chased after them. Drew swerved to dodge one that lunge at them while Katie used her rifle to shot any that got to close. They group would've been fine if It wasn't for the burnt out car in the road. Drew's Jeep clipped the side and jackknife and rolled. The others swerved and slammed into the side of a building. Katie's vision was fuzzy as she pulled herself out of the wreckage. She heard growling. She groped for her gun and felt a rod object and yanked but it was stuck. She shakily stood up and stumbled around. She rubbed her eyes and her vision cleared a little. She looked around and found a pistol, \"Drew, Drew, where are you\" she yelled. A guttural snarl responded. Five zombies were crawling over the Jeep. She fired and hit two in the head, they crumpled and fell head first. The other three dropped and charged at her. She let loose and fired and took out two more but as she took aim for the last the gun clicked empty. She turned and ran as fast as she could. She ran left into a warehouse. All she could hear was her heart pounding in her ear and the zombies cries get closer and closer. She knew she wasn't going to get away. She was going to be food for a hungry zombie. She made the mistake of looking back to see the zombie just several feet behind her, her mistake was not looking ahead. Katie tripped over some debris and fell. She scrambled and tried to find something to protect herself with. She found an old sheet of metal and grabbed it and pulled it over just as it pounced on her. She was crushed by its weight. She used all her strength to keep a grip on the metal as the creature tried to claw through the metal. It kept at it until she couldn't hold it anymore and it knocked it away. She scooted back and saw a tall muscular zombie with a black sewage leaking from holes in its body and the remains of its hand. She breathed in her final breath. Her life flashed before her. The zombie lunged at her. Enjoy Chapter 3, Read and Review. I'm want see 3 more reviews before the next chapter posts.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Sudden Death Pain. Excruciating Pain. That's all that Katie felt as the Zombie raked her arm with its mangled hands. She felt a warm sensation on her arm and she knew she was bleeding. She knew it was like being in the water with a shark. She was going to die, but she wasn't going to lie there feeling sorry for herself. She leaned back and drove her feet into its chest. It collapsed with a disturbing crunch. She flipped over and tried to run but it grabbed her foot and started dragging it towards its open mouth. She kicked and kicked but its steel grasp had her. She was mere inches from its mouth and either becoming lunch or a zombie herself. She pictured her trying to eat her sister, Drew; tears came to her eyes. She closed her eyes and waited for the inevitable when with a resounding thud a large engine block landed on the zombie crushing it. The edge of the block barely missed her legs; if her foot had been extended it would have been directly under that hunk of metal. \"I hope you weren't too scared\" said a voice from the shadows. Soon a grizzly man came stumbling over the fallen corpse. He held a large sledgehammer and crushed its skull with a resounding crack. Katie looked up and took him in. He was a tall man, dark skinned with a hefty amount of both fat and muscle on his body. He wore a black button-up shirt and jeans. He had two guns in hip holsters that were attacked to his belt. He had a black leather jacket that fit him nicely but the thing that stuck out was his eyes. His eyes were warm yet hid bitter sadness from life's past. He lent her a hand and pulled her up. He gave her a quick once over to make sure the zombie hadn't managed to infect her. When he was soundly sure that she was safe he started to walk away. Katie hesitated but followed him to see where he was going. He led her to a lift and they got in. He pressed the top button and the carriage squeaked to life as it rose from the ground. \"So where did you come from\" asked the man. \"I was traveling with my sister and some other people when a bunch of shit happened and I ended up getting thrown from our vehicle and chased by the zombie\". He nodded, they came to a stop and the doors opened up to a studio apartment. I had windows on all sides and you could see clear across most of the surrounding area. The guy got off and walked over to living room area and sat down. \"The name's Leon, I've been living here for a couple years, trying to stay alive in this god forsaken world.\" Katie just nodded. \"Guessing from how your day has been going you could use a shower, umm… I might be able to find some clean clothes for you to change into\". Katie blushed; the zombie attack had regrettably scared her so much she had an accident. She nodded and head off towards the bathroom. She slipped out of her clothes and stepped into a nice shower. She let the warm water pour over her and wash the zombie's guts off of her. She took a long deserved shower and toweled off and wrapped the towel around her body and dried her hair and walked out of the bathroom. Leon pointed to a spare bedroom, \"there are some spare clothes in that room\", and he walked out to the patio as she walked to the room. She walked to the closet and found a nice graphic tee and some cargo pants. She looked around and found a dresser. She pulled open a drawer and found a range of underwear that rated from E to M. She found a pair she thought Drew would like and then a bra that roughly fit her and got dressed. She walked out to the balcony and found Leon scanning the surrounding area. He looked up from his binoculars, \"I think I found your friends they're over by the old exchange, I'll set off a flare to attract them over here and we'll talk. He shot off a set of red flares and soon they could see Krista and them driving towards them. Soon, they pulled into the warehouse below and took the lift up. As soon as the lift opened up Krista ran and hugged her and smothered her saying how worried she was. Katie assured her that she was ok and that she really missed her. Katie looked around but she didn't see Drew. \"Where's Drew\" she asked. Everyone looked down, \"We found his Jeep and a bunch of zombies shot but no Drew\", explained Tallahassee. \"Well we need to go out there and find him\". \"Bad Idea\" said Leon, \"it's almost sunset and the zombies become great hunters when in the dark\". \"I don't care, if it was me in the same situation Drew would risk everything to find me and I'm doing the same\". She grabbed her pack and her rifle and was in the elevator. She saw a flash of black and white fur and saw Zeke sitting at her knees. She patted his head and hit the down button. As the door opened up she saw the Drew's Jeep, one of the guys must'ave driven it here. She let Zeke in and then hopped inside and grabbed the spare keys in the glove box. She sped out of the warehouse and swerved onto a road. She raced back to where she remembered where the Jeep had crashed. The sun was swiftly setting, and she had to find Drew quickly. She hit the flood lights and the entire block was lit up. Suddenly zombies came swarming she ran over the first few but the just keep chasing after her. She took a turn to fast and went up on two wheels. She slammed back down and killed the lights. The horde ran past her. Katie should have thought that through better. That was stupid she thought. She felt sadness overcome her. She was sitting in the middle of a dead town and the one person that could make it better was lost somewhere in this jungle. She started to turn around when a red light lit up the entire sky. Someone had shot a flare off. She sped towards the light and came to an open lot, laying in the lot was an unconscious Drew. She hopped out the Jeep and ran to him. She tried to rouse him but he was out cold. She felt his head and found a large bump. Before she realized the danger she was in someone smashed a board over her head and she landed on top of Drew. Suddenly he shifted and got up, \"She really didn't expect anything did she\" said a mysterious voice. \"Nope\" said Drew, the last thing she saw was a smirk on his face. Uh-oh looks like Drew isn't as innocent as Katie thought. Sry it took so long college is a bitch. I'll try to update my other stories as well so stay tune. Please Read and review i love pointers[Chapter 5] I Know it's be awhile since I've updated but now that I got some time here we go Chapter 5: Secret Past Katie awoke to find herself arms and legs bound and she was in some dark room. She started yelling and someone banged on the door and yelled for her to shut up. She thought it best if she quieted down, she took a look around there was an air grate that was big enough she might be able to get thorough if she could get free of her restraints. She was just about to try and work off the restraints when her door unlocked and a big man came in and threw her over his shoulder and carried her away. She started struggling and fighting but he whacked her over the head and she was left in a daze. She started picturing where he might be taking her and most of the destinations were unpleasant. They finally came to a door and she was tossed inside. Inside was a desk with a computer on it, there was a dresser and a big bed. Attached to the room was a bathroom and someone was currently in there. She crawled over to the computer and tried to see if she could get a message out someway when someone grabbed her hair and threw her back on the ground. \"Don't ever touch that computer\" commanded a familiar voice. She looked up to see the firm face of Drew staring at her. She instantly lunged at him but he easily dodged and watched her land on her chest. \"Nice try Katie but let's try to be civilized shall we\". Drew picked her up and dropped her on the bed. \"Now before we go any further, I going to give you an ultimatum to choose from. I brought you here so you wouldn't be at the mercy of the other men. Now we can both stay here and play nice, or I can let you go back and let the men watch you; your choice\". Katie bowed her head, as much as she hated Drew right now he was the lesser of two evils, \"I'll play nice\" uttered Katie. Drew nodded his head. He walked over to his desk and grabbed some kind of device and then walked around the room after he had walked around the bedroom and bathroom he locked the door and turned to Katie. She scooted back a little, Drew walked over and grabbed her ankles, she tried to kick him but with her feet bound she couldn't. \"Geez if that's what I wanted do you think I would've spent that time talking\". He unbound her wrists and legs. \"Go take a shower and I'll leave out a change of clothes and then we can talk about some things. Katie got up and walked over to the bathroom and took a long shower, she didn't even know how long she was out or if her sister and the group were still around. She was at the mercy of some guy she doesn't even really know. So many emotions overcame her that all she could do was squat and have a good cry. After she pulled herself together and stepped out of the shower and dried off and stepped outside and found Drew sitting on the bed and a change of clothes sitting on the dresser. \"Are you going to step out\", Drew shook his head and went back to what he was doing. Kati sighed and tried to get dressed as privately possible then climbed onto the bed. \"So what is it that you wanted to talk about\" Katie asked. \"First off I want to say I'm sorry this wasn't my plan it was much improvised in a short period of time\" confessed Drew. \"Remember that group I said I was with when people first started to become zombies but said broke up because of poor planning, well it seems that after a few bloody mutiny's they stabilized into a fairly good function gang and have since set up base near the city we were just in. When I got separated I ended up getting picked up by some scouts and brought back here. Katie was in shock with all the new info Drew had just divulged. \"So we're at your gang's hideout and you're what\" asked Katie. \"Well, were less of a gang and more of an organized syndicate aiming for survival though we've become corrupt\", Drew turned and pulled off his shirt and on his back was a tattoo of a red scorpion with three black orbs between its claws. \"We were the Desert Stingers and at one time controlled a lot of resources that kept us alive in the aftermath but people began to get greedy and wanted to protect themselves above others and the disagreement led to assassinations which led to full scale war that left the scorpions on the brink of collapse that's when I left them and started traveling on my own. \"So why did you bring me here\" she questioned. \"Actually that red flare was the sign for our transport but when you showed up the guy pistol whipped me and I had to go along with him, you just had the bad luck of falling into that trap\". Katie processed everything she was just told. Was Drew a good guy in a bad situation or a bad guy with a good mask on? She couldn't be sure but what she was sure of was that she needed to get out of here. \"So what now\" she demanded. Drew leaned back and sighed, \"I'm going to try to talk to the leader and see if I can't at least get you released back with the others and see which path the Scorpions are going down. But for now I think we should get some rest\". He slid under the covers and got comfortable. Katie did as well. Drew pulled her in close, \"Stay by me and I'll protect you no matter what\". Katie closed her eyes and started to drift to sleep when a thought came up in her mind, \"So how can you just suddenly talk to the boss of the Scorpions when you've been gone for so long\" Katie whispered. She felt Drew's grip tighten around her \"The New Leader of the Scorpions is my brother\". Kind of short but I'm trying to catch up on all my stories, I'll try to post another chapter soon. Leave comments on how you feel the story is going I love reviews.[Chapter 6] I know it's been awhile since I updated anything so I'm going to try to put out new chapters starting with fan favorite Light the Dawn. So here we go. Chapter 6 – A Family Reunion Katie POV I woke up still cradled in Drew's arms, I nudged him a little and he woke up, he sighed and rolled over. I got out of bed and walked to the bathroom and let some water pool in the sink and splashed it in my face. I was trapped here along with Drew who was just as much of a captive as I was. Drew didn't tell me much about his brother but I was sure there was some bitter history between the two. I showered and got dressed in a change of clothes and went back into the room. Drew was still sleeping; he looked cute with a little drool on his chin. I walked over and woke him up, \"What time is it\" he asked, I looked over and saw a clock it read 10 in the morning. \"It's 10, you should probably get up\"; he groaned by finally got out of bed. He did his morning routine, when he was ready he went over to his desk and opened a drawer. He pulled out three guns, he put two in holsters on his belt and then held one out to me, \"Here take this in case something happens, which is a likely\" said Drew. I nodded and put the gun on my belt World POV The two left the room and walked down the hall towards the mess hall. They grabbed some food and Drew led Katie to a secluded spot and they ate their breakfast and talked, \"So I'm going to go meet with my brother, his name is Caleb, we used to live with our parents in Michigan. When the outbreak started we headed west because we heard the army was creating safe zones but it was a lie and we only found a wasteland full of zombies and thieves. Our parents were killed by some bandits and they were about to kill us to when a girl who was with the bandits stepped up and protected us; her name was Sasha. She helped us become part of the gang\" explained Drew, \"Sasha grew very close to Caleb and eventually they started dating, they grew to be inseparable. \"So I'm guessing something happened for your brother to hate you so much\" asked Katie. Drew nodded; \"We were guarding an outpost a few miles out from camp when some rival bandits attacked and we had to fight them off it began to grow dark so we set off some flairs around the outpost and we were able to repel the bandits but in doing so we made a huge beacon for some zombies that were nearby. We were quickly surrounded. We sent out an distress signal to the base but by the time they had arrived it was only a few of us left. We had barricades ourselves at the top of the outpost when Drew and a few men pulled up. They cleared the zombies on the ground and we fashioned a zip-line and started evacuating people down to the ground but the zombies were really trying to break down the barricade. It was just me and Sasha holding off the zombies, when the last of the other guys evacuated. It was just me and Sasha holding off the remaining zombies. We got into an argument on who should go down first. I wanted Sasha to go first but she refused to go; it got heated and she got distracted and a zombie smashed through the barricade and slammed into her. It scratched her arm before I was able to blow its head off. We both just looked at her arm. It normally takes a minute to start to make sure if someone is going to turn. I took my gun and planted it against her head and started counting, I'll never forget the sorrow and dread in her eyes as I slowly counted to 60. She was crying and pleading for me not to kill her, saying she did not want to die. I was at 40 and she still hadn't changed. I was getting optimistic that she was safe. I heard gunfire down the hall. The evacuees must've told them we were still up here. I kept counting and she stayed normal. Finally I got to 60 and she was OK. I lowered my gun and headed towards the barricade and yelled for help.\" Drew continued \"But as soon as I turned around she was charging at me, I rolled out of the way I tried to reach her but she was too far gone. My brother rounded the corner as I put two bullets into her skull. He instantly charged at me and started hitting me. Some of the guys pulled him off of me and they just left me; sitting alone at the outpost as if I was already dead\". Drew finished. Katie just stared at him then wrapped her arms around his neck and held him. After they had finished their breakfast, somebody came to get Drew; he kissed her goodbye and sent her back to his quarters. Drew POV The guard showed the way to the meeting room. I entered the room as the other people were finishing up some kind of discussion and standing at the head of the table was Caleb, he had grown taller and muscular in our time apart. Caleb instantly caught his eye, I couldn't get a good read on his emotion, and he always was the one to have the calm head normally. Caleb dismissed the people present and emptied the room. It was just me and my brother. I walked up to him and looked him dead in the eyes. Caleb caught me in a firm bear hug, \"I thought I would never see you again\" exclaimed Caleb. \"Umm the last time we were together you were punching me unmercifully\" I retorted. Caleb took a step back and looked away, \"I didn't think when I did that, I came around the corner and just saw you shoot Sasha, I didn't know what happened I just snapped. I'm sorry\". I was shocked at Caleb's reaction to me returning, I thought he might've tried to kill me or something. \"So how did you end up becoming the leader of the Scorpions?\" I asked. Caleb sighed \"A little while after we left you, Old Man Regis started acting odd and taking unnecessary chances and we all agreed to remove him from the leadership but then when we were figuring out who should be the new leader things turned a little….bloody. In the end all the candidates ended up dead so I became the new leader and after a few months we setup base in this old base.\" explained Caleb. \"But enough about the past I want you to know that I would love it if you would come back and join the scorpions, that cute girl can even join as well\". I was mute; I couldn't believe what I was hearing. \"Can I have a little while to think about it\" I asked Caleb nodded and I took my leave. \"You can give me your answer to me later at a feast I'm having in celebration of your return\" he added. Katie POV It seemed like hours before the door to Drew's room creaked open, I was ready for anything but I have to say I was pretty shocked when Drew walked in completely ok. \"Wow, either you have internal bleeding or your meeting with your brother went better than you expected\" I joked. Drew had the most puzzled look on his face. \"So apparently my brother is ok and he completely missed while I was gone. He even apologized for punching me\". I was just as shocked as he was; from the story he told me I thought his brother might have tried to kill him on the spot. \"So what's gonna happen to you and me\"? \"For the mean time we're allowed to stay here, he's actually throwing a party for me later so we should get ready\". A Few Hours Later Drew and I had mingled at the party, there were a few people our age but they didn't seem that into talking with me, so I walked off to get some food. I sat in a secluded corner and nibbled on some chips. I wasn't alone for long as Caleb walked up and introduced himself. He reminded me of Drew but there were slight differences. \"So Drew told me about your guy's history, I don't think I would've survived through all of that. \", Caleb laughed \"It was hard but it made us stronger. \" Caleb shifted a little \"So you must be important to Drew if he keeps such a good eye on you\". I noticed his voiced changed a little, he drifted a little closer and looked me in the eyes, \"Hopefully you don't share the same fate as the last girl he was supposed to protect\" and as Caleb said that I locked eyes and saw the truth. Hope you enjoyed that and dont forget to review.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: Storm Front Katie sat on Drew's bed with her legs pulled to her chest. She had seen some disturbing things in her lifetime. She had just recently came much too close to a zombie and even that hadn't rattled her as much as looking into Caleb's soulless eyes. She knew he had a plan for her and she didn't like what the outcome was going to be. She was snapped out of her slump as Drew walked into the room and said goodbye to some guys he was talking to. \"Hey, did you enjoy the party\" he asked. Katie just shrugged. \"Hey, I need to tell you something. I'm not sure you're going to believe me but you have too\" she explained. \"You're pregnant\" he exclaimed while making a shocked face the laughed. Katie got a whiff of his breath and he stunk off booze. \"Great, you're drunk\" she groaned. \"Hey, no MIPS in Zombieland woooooo, but I digress. Seriously tell me what you wanted to tell me\" he said finally looking serious. \"So I had a chat with your brother at the party. He told me what happened to Sasha and I think he plans to get his revenge using me to get to you. I think...\" Drew held up his hand and she stop talking. \"I know already\". Katie was a little shocked when he said that. \"If you know why you didn't tell me\" she asked, \"I need you to act normal around here for the next couple of days so that I can blend in. I got a read on the men today at the party. It seems there is still an open wound between the few who helped in Caleb's coup and those who were forced into going along. He's given his followers special privileges and I'm sure that I can convince some men to help take him down.\" Katie nodded \"I can keep my head down for a little while but try to let me stay by your side.\" He smiled at her \"Always\". She grabbed some shorts and a top and walked into the bathroom to get changed. The Next Day Drew's POV I got out of bed and got dressed. I and the men were going scouting to the north. I kissed Katie's sleeping head and left a gun under her pillow. I would be gone only for a few hours but knowing this place better safe than sorry. I pulled on my favorite hoodie and was out the door. We walked down to the vehicle bay and grabbed his jeep which had be mounted with a machine gun and a stolen Humvee and headed out through the front gates. I was riding with Sherman and Douglas. Douglas was navigating while Sherman manned the gun. We drove through the wooded hills until we came to a split in the trail, \"Take the left trail, it makes a loop through our northern territory and then makes its way back to the right side. I sped up and took the left. \"So how's it feel to be back Drew. Sure you missed your brother\". I laughed a little \"Like a gazelle misses the lion.\" They both started laughing. \"Yea, well some of us missed you. We know it wasn't your fault. It's the rule of this world. You turn, you die.\" Chimed in Sherman. I just nodded. \"So how do you guys like my brother's leadership\". \"What leadership\" commented Douglas \"We go on these stupid scouting trips and practice shooting but there isn't anyone out here except for us and the zombies and most of them are either dead, frozen or moved along to warmer areas\". I took a deep breath. \"So would you guys be interesting in a change in leadership. Maybe a little more democratic.\" Douglas shifted in his seat \"Hey now, we were just talking shit you know. You think we'd actually kill Caleb.\" Drew slammed on the breaks. \"Yes, yes I do. I see Caleb having about 10 men truly loyal to him that keep the rest of you guys in line. They gather at night to have meetings. That's when we could strike and take them down.\". \"I don't want to return to those bloody days of the past. I lost too much already to them.\" Responded Douglas. \"I lost my wife and father in those horrible days\" added Sherman. \"Well, I'm going to hold a meeting later tonight while they have their meeting. If you could let people know discreetly that's all I'm asking. They nodded and Drew kept driving. Later that night Katie POV Drew kept pacing as he waited for people to see if anyone was going to show up. Slowly about 50 men walked in to the room and sat down. Drew began to speak after everyone had quieted down, \"I'm glad that this many of you turned out. I know I've been gone for a while but I've been a member probably longer than some of you. I know after Old Man Regis was taken out you've lost loved ones in the conflicts but we need to stop fighting and start to rebuild society. I want take down my brother and his faction and start a new one from that gives everyone equal say and set up permanent habitation. We can focus on bringing this world back under our control\". The men clapped as he finished. \"Well said, well said\" called a voice from the back of the room. Everyone gasped as Caleb and his men stood at the back with assault rifles pointed at them. Caleb strolled up to Drew with a devilish look in his eye. Drew just stared him right in the eye. \"You know you're a horrible leader when I can gain the trust of 50 men in just a few days right\". Caleb laughed, \"You think I care about these zombie fodder. I only accept strength, these men our weak and should've been culled the minute they joined up. Caleb turned and locked eyes with me. \"Love, love makes you soft. I think you need to harden up a little\" Before Drew could react Caleb had a Beretta M9 to my head. Caleb squatted to eye level with me. He started laughing a little, \"You know what is ironic, that I'm going to kill you, exactly as Drew killed Sasha, with the same…exact…gun\" he emphasized the last few words by butting the gun into my skull. He placed his other hand on my mine and creepily stroked it, \"Now don't be mad because I'm gonna kill you. Drew will be with you very shortly and you can cry about it in hell together\". Caleb stood up and pulled back the hammer. I closed my eyes and waited for the end. \"Caleb Chester Hartwell, I, Drew Hartwell challenge you to a paired Death Stinger for control of the Red Scorpions\" shouted Drew. Everyone gasped and Caleb's face grew red with anger. He lowered his gun. He walked up nose to nose with Drew. \"Two things, One, I accept your request and we will fight two days from now at dawn. Two, if you ever use my middle name again I will kill you and give that girl you care so much for a fate worse than a thousand deaths.\" He kicked Drew in the stomach and he and his man walked away. I ran over to him and helped him stand. Drew looked around and waved everyone to leave. I helped him back to his room and helped him lay down. \"So now that we're alone, what does a Death Stinger entail exactly?\" Drew closed his eyes and laid back on his pillow. It's a death match between to contesting bosses. We use smaller caliber bullets coated in scorpion venom and the entire compound will be the field. Last boss standing is the winner though that doesn't necessarily mean he'll survive. Also I asked for a paired Death Stinger so you'll be fighting with me\". I literally pissed myself from fear. Sorry about the wait. I should have another chapter uploaded Friday so stay tuned. CC[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Death Stinger Katie POV Sorry I figuratively pissed myself in fear (archer jokeJ). I literally jumped on Drew and started punching him and punching him and punching him. \"How, How could you drag me into something like this. Only stupid boys would think settling a dispute with scorpion venom was a smart idea.\" I yelled at him. Drew tried covering his face but I just kept nailing him wherever his arms weren't. \"I'm sorry, I thought this was the best solution to the problem at hand\". \"How is me getting shot with venom bullets the best solution\" I growled. \"Well if I went into this alone then if I lost or I won yet still died then you would be here all alone with no way to get back to everyone and I don't really trust all the men in this compound if you know what I mean\". It sucked when he was right. I rolled off him and sighed. \"So what's your plan to get through this?\" He looked at me and shrugged. \"We're Doomed\". Next Day Drew POV I woke up around 3 in the morning with Katie cradled in my arms. I really wished I didn't have to involve Katie in all this mess but it was the only way to protect her. Ironic I guess. I slid out of bed and started to get dressed. \"Where you going\" mumbled a sleepy Katie. \"I'm going to get some insurance, sleep tight\". I snuck out the door and headed down the hallway. I went down to the vehicle bay and hopped in my Jeep and took off. Day after That Katie POV Drew and I were sitting in our usual spot eating some grits and toast. \"You know this just might be our last meal\" I said. \"Yea, well at least I get to spend it with you\" Drew answered. I rolled my eyes. \"Well the sun is cresting, mind as well get this started. We walked to the command center of the compound and found Caleb waiting for us. \"Ahhh time to start the hunt\" said Caleb. \"First, we have to choose our partners. As rules dictate the current leader choses first\" He looked at me. \"You realize that Drew could choose one of his supporters then we all could kill you and we'd get this over with quite quickly\" I retorted. Caleb quickly looked away \"Well then I choose my second in command Charles\". \"Well I choose Katie as my partner\" responded Drew. Caleb nodded and motioned with his hand. 4 men came in with two weapon cases. They opened them up and there was an array of weapons and magazines in them. \"We will be using 9mm hollow point rounds capped with scorpion venom in them. A single bullet will cause intense burning\". We grabbed our weapons and loaded them. \"Move to the vehicle bay and we'll move to the cafeteria. A Judge will come over the intercom to start the match and then you die\". Me and Caleb grabbed some spare magazines and ran off. We could hear Caleb laughing behind us. We reached the motor pool and I pulled a bullet into the chamber. \"Are you ready\" i asked. Drew nodded then grabbed me close \"Hey Katie, I just want you to know. I love you, after this I'll never let anything bad happen to you\". He leaned in and kissed me. I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him back. \"Sorry to break up the romantic moment but it's time to start\". We broke apart blushing. \"On Your Mark….Get set….Fight\". We moved through the hallways. Checking around each corner and watching each other's backs. We moved into the cafeteria, \"Wait\" yelled Drew and he grabbed my hand when bullets hit the wall where I was just about to move. We flipped a table and fired back at Caleb and his partner. I took a breath and rolled out on the floor. I saw Charlie and fired some shots and hit him in the arm. He fell backwards and I crawled back behind the cover and reloaded. We moved out of the cafeteria and moved out into the open area between the buildings. We moved towards the command center. \"I hit Charlie back there but he's still probably in the game. I didn't see Caleb anywhere in there\" Drew was busy scanning when bullets rang out and we took off. We ran for the nearest building. We were almost there when pain spread up the leg. Drew grabbed me and pulled me into cover. All I could feel was a burning in my right leg. Drew grabbed a blade out and pulled the bullet out. He pulled out a box he had in his pocket and patched up my wound. \"You Ok\" he asked. I stood up and put pressure on my leg. It hurt a lot. I shook my head. He looked around and came up with a plan. Drew POV I walked through the halls looking for Caleb. I turned a corner and found Caleb and Charlie talking. I fired three slugs and put Charlie on the ground. He twitched in pain. Caleb came chasing after me firing over my head. I ran back the way I came. \"Stop moving so fast, it's going to be hard to shoot you\" yelled Caleb. I slid under a railing and cut a corner. A bullet ricocheted off the wall and glanced my shoulder. I kept moving through the compound I was so close. Caleb rounded the corner and fired and hit me in my shoulder. I fell forward and hit the floor and my gun slid away from me. I crawled a little ways towards it before Caleb shot just in front of me. He pressed his foot on my bad shoulder, intentionally applying pressure. He fired another in my leg. I felt the venom burning through my leg. It was twitching and burning. \"You know I never wanted a sibling. I actually asked for a puppy but lo and behold I get a little twerp that I got to look after in Hell on Earth\" he said. I laughed a little \"I found a nice dog and named him Zeke you know\". He kicked my side in anger \"You knew that's what I wanted to name MY dog.\" I rolled over and leaned against the wall. \"You know this is quite the idiotic way to determine a leader. Shooting each other with venom bullets until we manage to kill one another. Why not have a vote instead. We are Americans\". Caleb squatted eye level with me \"But it's so much fun watching someone slowly weaken with each bullet that hits them. You already have 2 bullets in you. Should be having some problems moving aren't you\". I had to admit I wasn't doing much but stalling at this point. I thought I was dead when I finally saw the signal. I pushed Caleb with my good leg and he fell backwards. Two shots hit him square in the chest. I reached for my gun and fired one last one point blank between the eyes. He fell over and the light left his eyes. Katie walked out from behind some crates limping but ok. \"Woohoo, we won\" I shouted. \"Not even close\" came a voice. Charlie was standing in the hall with half of him bandaged up. He pulled two guns and had us both in his sights. \"Thanks for killing the prick now I get to be in charge. Now stand up and walk outside. I want everyone see you die\". Katie helped me up and we were marched outside. Charlie grabbed Caleb and brought him with him. He walked us to the front gates where all the members were waiting. \"Kneel\" he commanded. \"Caleb is died, as he second in command when I kill these two pest I will be the new leader of the red scorpions. All shall obey or their fate will be the same as these little shits.\" He placed a gun to my temple. I said a silent prayer and a gunshot cracked. I blinked my eyes and I was still alive. Charlie on the other hand was dead on the ground. \"Oh thank god Hallelujah\" I exclaimed. I stood up and whistled. A Black Escalade came rolling into sight. Tallahassee, Columbus and Krista were all waving. I waved back. Katie ran up and hugged me crying. \"We did it\" she said. I grabbed her and pulled her into a long kiss. \"I guess you're my good luck charm. I'm never letting you\". \"Actually I'm pretty sure we need to be treated for venom poisoning and the adrenaline is going to be wearing off soon so this is gonna hurt for a while\" Katie responded. I laughed then felt pain all over and collapsed to the ground in pain. \"Told ya\". Later Katie POV Drew had snuck away the day before and found everyone and had set up everyone inside the base and they would've at least gotten me out if he had died. Leon had been sitting on a hill with a sniper rifle and had shot Charlie before he could kill Drew. Drew being the surviving contender became leader. I would like to say that this was the end of our problems but life is never easy in Zombieland. So this is Little Rock signing off. Good Night. So this ends Light the Dawn. I may do a sequel with a few years' time skip never know. Hope you enjoyed Good Night CC. ","Summary":" This is a continuation of the Zombieland crew after the left Pacific Playland. The POV will sometim"},{"Movie":"Zombieland","Title":"Rochester","Author":"ericaj318","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709016","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Are we ever going to tell each other our names?\" Rochester asked Tallahassee as they rode up Route 89 in a black Cadillac Escalde. Tallahassee didn't answer, he just frowned in her general direction. \"Somebody's cranky today. I'm hopping in the backseat to take a nap. Wake me when you want me to drive,\" Rochester stated as she leaned over, kissed him on the cheek and moved herself to the backseat. Before she had fallen completely asleep, she felt the truck stop, \"What is Tallahassee?\" she asked. \"A boy,\" he replied gruffly as he got out of the truck, looking very intimidating with his leather jacket, cowboy hat and sunglasses. Rochester watched through the window as a young boy, maybe early 20's, got up from behind an motorcycle and held his thumb in the air. She couldn't help but smile, glad to see another person. She loved Tallahassee and they had really grown to be an almost functioning couple but she did miss people. Tallahassee must have agreed because the boy came running around to the passenger side while Tallahassee kicked down the motorcycle. The boy climbed in and immediately looked in the back seat to find Rochester there, she smiled. \"What are you checking for?\" Tallahassee asked. \"I just have these rules for surviving and one is to always check the backseat,\" the boy explained. \"There ain't nothin back there but my girl and my duffle bag,\" Tallahassee responded, his tone short, as he went to put his knife back in the console. \"Watch out. You almost knocked over your alcohol with your knife,\" the boy said causing Rochester to laugh from the back seat. \"So, what are your names?\" the boy asked. Rochester was about to tell him her real name when Tallahassee jumped in, \"Nope. We're not gonna do that thing where we get all familiar with each other. We just go by the names of our hometowns. I'm Tallahassee and the girl is Rochester,\" he finished sending a playful wink at Rochester because he'd stopped her. The kid smiled awkwardly, \"Well, then I'm Columbus. Where are you two headed?\" Rochester answered this time, \"North East. We heard there's a refugee center up near Maine. We'll get you as close to Columbus as we can,\" she explained with a smile. Tallahassee grumbled as he stepped on the gas and they continued up the road. A/N: Just getting started :) Please R&R;[Chapter 2] After three hours on the road and one stop at an abandoned Hostess truck, Rochester started to get antsy, \"I'm hungry, babe. Can we stop at a grocery store if you see one?\" Columbus nodded, \"I could go for a break too. And a snack. And look, your alcohol is almost gone so you probably need a refill,\" he added causing Rochester to grin again. Tallahassee rolled his eyes, \"Yes, I'll stop. Rochester, don't egg him on. He's not going to be with us forever,\" he stated, still acting like a grump. The group pulled up to an abandoned Kroger and loaded up on weapons before entering the store. Tallahassee strummed a few chords on his banjo to attract on zombies in the store before he and Rochester did like they'd always done and divided up to take out the threat while Columbus watched in amazement. Rochester held her knife at the ready as an extremely overweight zombie came running at her but he didn't stand a chance as she plunged the knife straight into his brain and began to move on. \"Don't forget to double tap,\" Columbus yelled to her. Rochester turned back to see what he was talking about and the zombie had begun to get up so she ran at him and swung her baseball bat directly into its head, \"Thanks kid!\" she yelled back to Columbus. \"Hey babe, I'm gonna get myself some things. Meet you in the cakes aisle in a minute.\" Rochester went through the aisles and grabbed various food items and wound up in the feminine product aisle where she had a shocking revelation, she was late. She grabbed four pregnancy tests and stuffed them in her purse and headed back to the men. Tallahassee saw her coming and ran to meet her and help her with the food, \"Did you get everything we need?\" he asked as he leaned down and kissed her forehead, feeling badly for being so grumpy that day. Rochester nodded, \"Yeah, we should be good for awhile. I just wish we could find a hotel or house that was safe for the night because I'd really like a shower and a good nights rest,\" she finished regretfully, admitting to a huge downfall of living in Zombieland. Tallahassee nodded in response then leaned down to whisper in her ear, \"I can think of one more thing I'd really like to do if we had the proper set up,\" before kissing her passionately on the lips. Rochester almost dropped the food she was carrying because she wanted to run her hands up his chest so badly. Columbus was about to interrupt when a young, very attractive girl showed up from what looked like the stock room. \"Come quick,\" the girl pleaded as she turned and went back in the direction she'd come from. A/N: If you've seen the movie you know what comes next but it felt like a good stopping point and a little bit of a cliffhanger. From this point the story will vary from the movie slightly but just to accommodate the OC and the subplot there. Thanks for reading... please review :)[Chapter 3] Rochester stepped forward to speak with the new girl, \"Can we help you?\" she asked, not rushing like the girl wanted. \"We don't have time to sit here and chat,\" the girl spoke quickly, the tears flowing freely from her well mascaraed eyes now. Tallahassee wasn't ready to budge but their new friend Columbus spoke up, \"We'll do anything to help. Lead the way,\" he announced, basically running to the girl. Rochester and Tallahassee sighed as they followed behind. \"What?\" Tallahassee asked. \"It's my sister,\" the girl began, pointing to yet another new female, \"She's been bitten and I don't have a weapon to use on her. We want to make it quick,\" she said between sobs. Columbus was ready to pass his gun over before Rochester stopped him, \"Wait, I want to see the bite,\" she challenged. Tallahassee frowned down at her, \"Don't you think that's a bit much after the traumatic event they've already been through?\" Columbus nodded, \"Yeah, you're kind of being a well...a b-i-t-c-h.\" Rochester rolled her eyes, \"You can't just trust every person you meet when the world's gone to Hell boys. I'll be in the car,\" she finished, her tone exasperated. She walked out and hopped in the passenger seat waiting on them to come out as she opened a bag of Doritos. When she finally heard the door open she said, \"Finally,\" then saw that it was the two girls with the guys guns and the keys, \"Seriously?\" \"Out,\" the older girl ordered, \"And leave the food.\" Rochester huffed loudly as she climbed down from her seat and got out of the car to watch these girls drive away. She waited patiently for the guys to make their way to her so she could tear them apart for being so gullible and dumb.[Chapter 4] \"Let's help the girls,\" Rochester mocked in a whiny tone, \"Nothing bad could happen. For future decision making, I will be in charge because you two are soft,\" she finished, her tone now venomous as she stormed off in the direction of the town nearby to get a new vehicle. Tallahassee followed quickly behind, \"I'm sorry, babe. You were right to think they were a couple of liars. You're in charge from now on,\" he apologized catching up. Columbus was right behind them, \"We can find a new car. We should all remember to limber up. We were in the car for a good stretch.\" \"I dare a zombie to come at me right now,\" Rochester said, below her breath, turning onto a street filled with banged up cars. \"Hold on a second, hun,\" Tallahassee began, \"I have some steam to let off,\" he announced as he pulled out a baseball bat and began to beat up a minivan. \"He has a lot of pent up aggression,\" Columbus observed, watching and waiting for Tallahassee to get it all out of his system. Once he was done, he rejoined the two and they walked further on into the neighborhood. \"Oh my, look at that,\" Tallahassee grinned, pointing to a bright yellow H3 in the distance, \"We don't need our beat up vehicle anymore.\" They ran over to inspect the truck. Columbus opened the door to see a shitload of weapons in the back seat, \"Well, we're armed again.\" Rochester smiled for the first time that day, \"Thank goodness because we had a good stash before but it might be better now.\" Tallahassee grabbed a machine gun and began shooting aimlessly into the air, \"Thank God for rednecks!\" Once he was again done acting out, they piled into the truck and began their journey. \"We're gonna go teach those two girls a lesson,\" Tallahassee announced. Rochester groaned loudly, \"No, we are not! What did I say?\" Columbus, a little frightened of her, spoke, \"She makes the calls now,\" She smiled back at him but Tallahassee wasn't hearing any of it. He had an axe to grind.[Chapter 5] They drove down the road continuing East when they saw the Escalade on the side of the road, hood raised and no one in sight. \"Please don't fall for any tricks this time,\" Rochester urged as Tallahassee pulled up behind the vehicle. \"Wait in here,\" he said as he got out with an AR-15 in hand. Rochester rolled her eyes as she sat there with Columbus in the back seat. \"How badly is this going to go?\" he asked. Rochester shrugged her shoulders, \"Who knows? They might each take a car this time and ride off into the sunset while we get devoured. Wouldn't that be fun?\" she asked sarcastically as she turned back to face him. The backdoor to the Hummer opened and the younger girl was standing with a gun pointing at Columbus. \"Get out of the car,\" she instructed. Rochester pointed a hand gun she kept up front in the girls direction, \"No, you put the gun down and get in the car. Maybe we can all just go together and stop this nonsense,\" she ordered as the girl obeyed and hopped in by Columbus. Moments later, Tallahassee showed back up with a gun to the back of his head held by Witchita. \"Get out folks,\" she said. Rochester laughed, \"We're done with this game. Get in the car with your sister...whats her city?\" The younger girl spoke up, \"Little Rock. Witchita, we're going with them. Just climb in.\" Witchita huffed as she put the gun down and got in on the other side of Columbus. Rochester noticed he instantly started sweating. \"Which direction are you boneheads heading?\" Witchita questioned, her tone agressive. \"No need to act tough. We are now a zombie fighting family and there's no room for attitudes in this car. We're headed East,\" she responded. Witchita laughed, \"Who's bright idea was that? We came from the East and its all demolished worse than out here. We are going to Pacific Playland where its Zombie free,\" she announced. Columbus' face soured at her statement, \"Did you see Columbus?\" Witchita nodded, \"It's all burned down. Practically a ghost town.\" Rochester frowned at Witchita, \"I'm sure that's just what Columbus needed to hear, thanks,\" she finished her tone sharp. Witchita instantly felt awful and sat back in her seat. \"What do you think, babe?\" Tallahassee began, \"You want me to turn this around and head west?\" Rochester nodded silently feeling badly for Columbus but also for herself because now she knew her family was gone. She grabbed Tallahasse's hand with a firm grip, \"You're all I have now.\"[Chapter 6] \"Can we find somewhere to stay?\" Rochester asked after hours of driving. \"I second that,\" Little Rock said from the back, \"Let's find somewhere fun to stay like a celebrity's house.\" \"We can stop and get a map of the stars,\" Columbus said intrigued. Wichita smiled, \"Can we go to Bill Murray's house?\" Tallahassee was about to shut down the entire plan until Wichita made that suggestion, \"Why yes, I think we can do that.\" They drove to downtown Hollywood and grabbed a map of the stars to see where they needed to go. Tallahassee drove through the hills as Rochester directed him, \"That's it ahead. Think there are a bunch of Zombies in there? I really just want a hot shower,\" she stated, looking in awe at the large mansion. \"We'll kill whatever stands in our way of a hot shower,\" Wichita said from the back with a bright smile. Rochester noticed Columbus' cheeks turn red at the sight of Wichita's smile. They got out of the truck and entered the house to see what might be lurking. Everyone took a section and quickly discovered the house was clear. \"I saw a home movie theater so I'm headed there,\" Columbus announced causing Little Rock to follow behind him. Wichita and Rochester left Tallahassee to play with old movie props while they both grabbed showers. Rochester locked the door to the bathroom she'd chosen and pulled out the test she'd grabbed earlier. She did as the instructions said and jumped in the shower while it worked on the results. Rochester didn't take a long shower, in attempt to conserve water, but she enjoyed every moment as the hot water cascaded down her body. As she was finishing, there was a knock on the door, \"Just a minute,\" she shouted. \"It's me, babe,\" she heard Tallahassee's voice sat back softly. Rochester forgot about the test sitting on the counter as she leaned out of the shower to unlock the door. \"Care if I join you?\" he asked on the other side of the curtain as he came in. Rochester smiled to herself as she stood there, \"Of course not.\" She heard him shuffling about and then he spoke, \"What's this?\" he asked, noticing the test. \"What's what?\" she asked as she peeked out of the curtain to see him holding the pregnancy test. He didn't speak as he just held it up for her to see. \"It's nothing. I'm just late but I'm sure its just stress and not anything to worry about. What's it say? Negative right?\" she questioned Tallahassee shook his head as he passed the positive test to her.[Chapter 7] Rochester stared blankly at the test, \"I really didn't think it would be positive. What should we do?\" she asked, feeling her knees buckle in the shower. Tallahassee shook his head, \"I don't know, babe. We certainly can't raise a kid in this world unless we find somewhere that's safe. This is so tough cuz I wanna be happy about it,\" he revealed. Rochester stepped out of the shower and wrapped up in a towel so she could sit down on the edge of the tub, \"You do?\" He nodded in response, \"Of course I do. I mean, babe, I love you and there's nothing more that I want in the world than to expand our little zombie fighting family but I just can't wrap my head around it. Let's just keep it between us for now, deal?\" \"Deal,\" she agreed as she took a deep breath, \"If we could stock up on enough food and find somewhere we could secure, I think we'd be safe,\" she admitted. Tallahassee shook his head, \"I'm not worried about it now. I'm gonna shower. Do you think you can figure out dinner for us? No one's had a good meal in days.\" Rochester simply nodded, as she threw her dirty clothes back on and left the bathroom without another word. She made her way into the kitchen and found some dried pasta and an some ingredients for sauce. \"I'm making spaghetti,\" she shouted to the group who was now gathered in the living room. Rochester was calmed by cooking as she used a match to light the stove and threw together her little meal. \"Dinner ready?\" Tallahassee asked as he entered the kitchen, wrapping his arms around her from behind. Rochester nodded, \"Just a few more minutes. You know we could just stay here. There's lots of food,\" she suggested. He shook his head, \"I told you we weren't gonna talk about that anymore tonight,\" he said quietly placing a gentle kiss on the side of her neck. She pulled away from him, \"Careful, that's how we got into this mess. Dinner time!\" she shouted to avoid anymore talk.[Chapter 8] The group ate until they were full for the first time in days and went to sleep. Rochester ignored Tallahassee for the rest of the night because she just couldn't deal with the stress. The next morning, she was rudely awakened by Columbus in a panic. \"They're gone!\" he shouted through the house. Rochester hopped up and met Tallahassee in the main room where Columbus was, \"What are you shouting about?\" she asked. \"Wichita and Little Rock left,\" he announced distressed, \"We need to go to Pacific Playland and get them. Why would they leave?\" Tallahassee spoke before Rochester could even process the situation, \"Absolutely not. We're safe here and there's no way I'm taking her back out into that danger.\" Rochester looked at him with a death glare, \"Excuse me but I think we should go. We can't leave any of our family members behind even if they're stubborn as hell,\" she said seriously, \"C'mon, Columbus let's go,\" she said to Columbus as she walked with him to the garage to take a vehicle. Rochester drove and they had such a late start, it was dark before they reached their destination, \"It looks quiet. Let's just go in and grab them,\" she said as she put the car in park. Columbus nodded, getting out of the passenger seat. They walked slowly into the theme park and quickly realized how wrong they were as they saw the girls trapped on a ride surrounded by zombies. \"We don't have enough ammo for this,\" Rochester said worried. Columbus nodded, \"What should we do?\" Before they could decide, they heard a car drive up behind them. \"You two should've listened to me. Look at this,\" they heard Tallahassee's voice as they turned to see him get out of the car. Rochester was so relieved to see him, she ran and wrapped her arms tightly around him, \"I'm so sorry. I don't care what we end up doing but I never want to be mad at you again,\" she said. He leaned down and kissed the top of her head, \"We're gonna find a safe place and be a family. But first we have to save those two.\" The three disbursed and took on the army of zombies, somehow coming out on top. Wichita kissed Columbus as she safely got off the ride. Little Rock ran up and hugged Rochester and Tallahassee. \"Let's get back in the damn car,\" Tallahassee said, his tone playfully annoyed. Everyone nodded and climbed into the Hummer which the girls had stolen. \"Where are we headed now?\" Rochester asked, barely containing the smile from their victory. Tallahassee was about to answer when the CB radio went off, \"Is anyone there?\" they heard a male voice say. Tallahassee looked at the group for approval to answer. They all nodded silently. \"What can we do for you?\" The voice spoke again, \"We have a refuge set up in Alabama and we're looking for all survivors to come join. Will you come to?\" Tallahassee looked around for approval once more. \"Can we trust this guy?\" Columbus asked. \"There's only one way to find out,\" Rochester said, \"I think we should give it a try.\" Wichita and Little Rock answered at the same time, \"We agree with Rochester.\" Tallahassee spoke again, \"We're on our way.\" A/N: Thank you so much for reading my little ZL fic :) This is the end of the road for our zombie fighting family for now but its definitely open for a sequel.

I have some Opinions™ about the ending of Judgement, but instead of focusing on those, I'm grabbing the one good idea I got out of it and running with it. This is sort of AU-ish, because that's all I apparently know how to do, but I hope you enjoy it anyway. More coming soon! The digital clock on her microwave read 3:02. As Kirsty looked at the accusing red numbers, a dim glow in a near-unlit kitchen, she tried to rationalize what she was doing awake. She glanced down at the two mugs in her hands, piping hot, and then to her sofa where a salt lamp gave off a soft glow from the coffee table. The light cradled his soft features, saddened and tired, and he just stared at it in silence. There was no rationalization for this. There was no good reason for any of this. Kirsty approached the table in silence and set the darker mug on a coaster in front of him. His pitch-black eyes, now a smoky gray-blue, looked towards her with no other movement. He was clutching the comforter she'd wrapped over his shoulders, knuckles white and taut, and he smelled faintly of soap and drugstore shampoo. The shower had washed away the filth that had worked into his remaining wounds and his black leather jacket. It didn't really help anything. The man who was and wasn't the Cenobite Prince looked at her for a few seconds that lasted far too long before looking down at the drink. He released the comforter, which rested on a white t-shirt and cotton pants while the clothes she'd found him in tumbled in the wash. He touched the sides of the mug, and for a second flinched back before picking it up again. She wondered, for a brief moment, if his humans hands were more sensitive, if he was unused to the heat. He brought it up to his lips and let out a sigh, his breath casting the steam away from his face, before he took a drink. She felt a touch voyeuristic watching something so simple that he'd perhaps not experienced since before she was born, so Kirsty turned to her own mug and drank from it. Chamomile and honey warmed her throat and her lungs, and she let herself savor the taste before she heard the faint clink of his mug settling on the coaster again. He sat there, motionless once more, until Kirsty finished and set her own drink next to is. Finally he turned to her in full, and she looked up at those eyes that were caught in-between two beings, two halves of the same soul, not allowed to be one thing and unable to be the other. \"Thank you.\" It was a whisper, heavy and sad in its sincerity. Kirsty reached forward, slowly, and brushed her hand against his. He took it and squeezed, his thumb drawing a circle over her skin. It felt so strange without the leather. \"Of course,\" she answered, not really smiling, not sure if she was upset. Certainly she was hurting for him - for this was not Elliot Spencer, he hadn't been Elliot Spencer for almost a century, but here was Elliot Spencer with the eyes of a fallen Prince. She ached for him, in a way she didn't quite understand; for as much as she feared being as he had been, feared leather and steel and the thought of losing herself, this felt like a loss that was somehow greater. Having him here, though? Knowing he was safe with her, even if he was in a pain like nothing either of them could ever imagine? She wasn't sure she was saddened by that. It soothed her to see him here, if only because it meant she knew he wasn't alone. They looked at each other for another long moment. He reached forward, hand shaking a little, and his fingers brushed her cheek. Kirsty leaned into it, then brought her own hand up to do the same. He closed his eyes as her palm cradled the side of his jaw; and it occurred to her, however briefly, that in all of their encounters she had never been able to touch him like this. He closed his eyes and leaned into it, the knot in his brow easing the slightest bit. She pulled him forward with a gentle urge of her hand, and he followed, until their foreheads rested together. When Kirsty opened her eyes, he was already looking at her. Perhaps this, whatever it was, had stripped his defenses away with the rest of him, because he looked at her with something full of mourning, full of adoration and awe. He didn't need to speak for her to understand, but he leaned a little closer. \"I love you, Kirsty,\" he said, and Kirsty smiled her small, tired smile at him. \"I love you too.\" His lip quirked a little at that, but the true change was in his eyes; though the sadness did not leave, she could see a glimmer of hope that had not been there since she'd found him that morning, alone and lost and abandoned to his fate. He brushed his nose against hers and she kissed him, softly, gently. He returned it only for a moment before pulling away and looking back at the salt lamp. \"...I do not know what I am going to do,\" he said, looking at the light, \"or where I will go.\" She squeezed his hand again, and he looked back at her. \"I don't know what to do either,\" she said, \"but you don't have to go anywhere. You can stay here.\" \"With you?\" It wasn't disbelief - she heard that in the softness, in that note of hope again. It was a request for permission. \"With me,\" she answered, bringing his hand up to her lips and kissing the knuckles. \"We'll figure this out together. Whatever that means.\" For the first time today he seemed at ease; his shoulders relaxed, and he leaned forward to kiss her cheek before finding her lips again. When they pulled away neither one spoke; he simply lifted his arm to wrap the comforter around her, and she leaned into him, closing her eyes as he did. The faint glow of the salt lamp framed their tired, peaceful faces.[Chapter 2] I had another idea. He wasn't Elliot, but that was who looked back at him anyway. Kirsty's coffee table was reflective glass; the first thing he saw when he woke might have been himself, or the accursed body he'd been trapped in, if it hadn't been Kirsty herself. She slept with her head on his shoulder, half-draped in the comforter she'd leant him, hair a tangle of curls pressed up to his shirt. He looked from her to the table to the salt lamp, still glowing; remembering what he'd seen her do before, he leaned forward and pulled the tiny switch towards him. The light went out. Such a small thing didn't matter, but the slightest bit of control eased him, comforted him. At least, he thought with a biting sourness, some things went the way they were intended. He slipped the comforter off of himself. The softness of it, of the clothes and the couch and of Kirsty's cheek felt somehow too much and not enough; he longed for the security of his robes, his pins and his belt; but even as he ached he knew this body would not have recognized them, would have responded to the pain and the security with fear and claustrophobia and everything that kept humans from understanding. Will I forget? The thought was like ice water in his veins. Would he forget, if he spent too long in this body, what he had been? Would he forget his purpose? He looked back at the face in the glass, the face creased with lines of aging too fast, of trauma, the combed hair that replaced his crown of scars and pins. He knew this face, but it was not him; he had left this man behind, that man had left this face behind to become him. Who was he, without his Labyrinth? Without his duty, his diligence, his faith? A soft sigh next to him. He looked; Kirsty was still asleep, the smallest smile on her face. He loved her, he knew that; but love was not an identity, only an emotion, a decision. He chose her a long time ago, before he even knew he could lose everything. She'd chosen him, as well. That soothed him some; perhaps it was his human sentiment speaking, but the thought that she would choose him even when he was barely anyone, stripped of himself... perhaps that was not so true. It did not take the sting off of his pain, nor make him any happier about being human, but it was something. And what a choice to make, he thought. He had been wandering; like a man in a trance, the shock of being stripped of himself and cut off from his own realm had left him lost in his own thoughts, trying to make sense of his fate. He'd wandered, half-dreaming, from the wretched dump he'd been left in to wherever his body deemed was correct in that moment. The only true moments of clarity were late at night, when the horror of his condition and his isolation dragged him out of his dream-state and forced him to stillness with the crushing knowledge that this was his reality, that he was hungry and lost and alone. He hadn't even tracked down Kirsty; truth be told he'd prayed (to Leviathan, to fate, to anything ) that she would not see him like this, that he would find a way home before finding her again. Perhaps there was poetry in that being how she found him; on his knees with his head bowed, hands over his face, shaking in an alleyway and praying for some sort of merciful guidance. He hadn't even realized he was praying out loud until he felt a hand on her shoulder, and when he looked up she was there, kneeling in front of him, confusion and disbelief in her eyes. \"What happened to you?\" She'd whispered, and perhaps he'd been praying for her all along. Kirsty had brought him to her home, no conditions, no deals. It was a strange thing, not to be caught in a game with his dearest adversary; but the way she looked at him and his own agony made him acquiescent, rendered him defenseless. He didn't want games. He just wanted to go home, or wherever else she might have led him. The rest of the day went by in a blur; he let her get him inside, take his clothes (and he must have changed because she left him in a room with spare clothes and he was wearing them when she came back, but had no active recollection of putting them on) and trying to bring him back to reality, to lucidity, out of his shock and into her world. And somehow, despite that he wanted to be away from this world and what he'd become, he'd come back to her. She'd stayed by his side until he slept; and it seemed she had slept beside him, unwilling to leave his side even when he was safe within dreams. He leaned forward and kissed her forehead, inhaling her soft scent as he did. She had a faint musk he couldn't place, feminine and earthy, imprecise and perfect. She hummed a little and he reached his hand around her head, tilting it forward to kiss her scalp, her hair, savoring the closeness of her. If there was one gift he found in losing himself, this was it; not even he could get in his way in being as close to her as possible. He kissed her again. Outside, rain started to spatter against the window; first a drizzle that melted into a downpour, the silence growing thick with the pelting of raindrops. That seemed to stir her, because she hummed again and sat up, looking at him with those tired, beautiful brown eyes. \"Good morning,\" Kirsty whispered, half-dreamy. Despite himself, the Prince smiled at her. \"Perhaps it is,\" he said, and leaned forward to kiss her lips again. So I wrote the first one and pretty much immediately needed to follow up on it, because hurt-comfort is the butter to my horror/romance bread. I do think I need to clarify what kind of AU this is - it is, in fact, the 1980's Elliot here, not the one in Judgement. That movie threw the canon out with the bathwater, so if it gets to take good ideas and erase the context that led up to it, then I'm doing the same damn thing. Tbh I don't even consider the Labyrinth to be connected to heaven or hell, but that's a discussion for a future fic. That being said, the concept of a Cenobite in a suit is goddamn hilarious to me and also 100% my aesthetic, so I'm totally stealing the Auditor and sticking him in my own AUs. Sorry Judgement, my world now. ANYWAY, that's all I've got for this lil fic. Chapter 15's coming soon! - Inky[Chapter 3] I have things to do and I'm almost done with TPatC and the only thing I actually want to do right now is keep adding onto this ficlet I thought I was done with. Apparently I just really, really like the Prince being human and sad in Kirsty's apartment. That being said, I've put a new poll on my profile page, so if you have any input, take a look! Oh well, let's see how many times I say I'm done before I'm actually done. Be kind, stay spooky, you know the drill. -Inky \"They took my name.\" The words cut through the comfortable silence like a knife; it surprised Kirsty so much that it actually took her a moment to react. \"What?\" She asked, looking up from her side of the board. He had asked for a distraction, and it had somehow turned into a quiet game of draughts, which neither one was entirely losing. He'd sat in relative silence, serene and still when he didn't move a piece or take a drink from his mug, and Kirsty had been alright with that. If he needed to talk, he'd talk. Apparently that was now. \"They took...\" he sighed, closed his eyes. He didn't quite look like Elliot in the daylight; he was too pale, his hair lighter than the picture, the lines in his face slightly too straight to be natural. \"We are given names, along with our titles, to keep to ourselves. They are similar to our markings and modifications; we are meant to keep them as our gifts from Leviathan, or the Labyrinth, to be shared only with those we consider as precious as those gifts.\" He moved to take his mug again, but as he opened his eyes he looked at the coffee with disinterest before setting it back down. \"When this... I did not realize it at first. I don't know how long I spent in this state before you found me. It must have been days.\" Kirsty reached forward, her fingers brushing the hand on his knee. He looked up at her with those exhausted, beautiful eyes. \"...When I was ripped from the Labyrinth,\" he said, \"my name was taken with my Cenobitic form. I do not remember it.\" She didn't know what to say to that, so she simply squeezed his hand. He sighed again and took it in his, just holding it with a tenderness she'd have described as uncharacteristic if she didn't know better. \"...What do you remember?\" She finally asked, running her thumb over his knuckles. it wasn't quite the same as his circling, but he seemed to recognize it all the same with how his gaze softened a little. He looked out to the window, watching the downpour that hadn't stopped since that morning. \"I remember my titles,\" he said, \"and my chambers, and my tools. I remember the paths of the Labyrinth, and peering over the sides to see how they spiraled down towards the heart of the Labyrinth, guarded by Leviathan's lighting and its own darkness. I remember...\" he looked down at the board. \"I remember how beautiful it was, the walls, the patterns the maze made, how I knew them as well as my own flesh.\" He closed his eyes again, and there was a tremor that he was fighting against and losing. \"It is... it was my home.\" Kirsty let go of his hand to touch his cheek again. He moved towards it, forehead creasing in a frown, and Kirsty swiped her thumb just below his eye. \"I am not crying,\" he said. \"I know you aren't.\" Kirsty repeated the motion, slowly and gently, cradling his skin. \"But... I've found this helps a little, sometimes.\" He didn't answer her. \"Should I stop?\" \"...No,\" he said after a moment, soft and unsure. He looked at her, and she tried to smile at him, and he tried to smile back. \"Thank you, Kirsty, for all that you have done.\" \"You're welcome,\" she said, and leaned forward. Her lips brushed his, and she started to prop her other hand on the table so she could lean in further. The pieces scattered under her hand, and she pulled back. They were all over the board. \"Shit!\" \"It does not matter,\" he said, placing the pieces back to their starting positions, \"we can start from the beginning.\" Kirsty felt a touch sheepish, but it passed as soon as it came. He was right - she had nowhere to be today, and neither did he. They had nothing but time. She replaced her pieces and let him make the first move. The silence that came over them was like a warm blanket; comforting and light, easy to shrug off if they needed to. She played a few turns before finally speaking again. \"...What should I call you?\" \"I'm sorry?\" He had relaxed some, and looked up at her with curiosity - which was, to her, a great leap past despair. \"While you're here. You're not...\" She took a breath, pushing back her hair. \"If you don't want to be called Elliot, I can get that, but... I don't know. I feel like there should be something. You say my name all the time. More than most people, actually.\" \"Does it bother you?\" She met his eyes, and saw that intrigued little flicker that, despite his human face, was all Cenobite. \"No,\" she said a little too quickly, then added, \"no, I... I like the way you say it.\" She closed her eyes, knowing that wasn't how she'd meant to say that, and also that her cheeks were probably pink. \"Oh?\" There was that hand on her cheek, and she bit her lip a little as she felt him lean closer. \"Do you now, Kirsty?\" \"Stop it.\" She turned away from his hand even as the smile crept on her face. \"Stop what, Kirsty?\" She heard him stand up and his hand pulled away. She was in trouble. \"I'm not answering that.\" She sat back in her chair, but felt a hand on hers, and the smile widened. His hand caught her chin and gently guided her face to one side, and she opened her eyes to find him standing over her with that warm, affectionate smile he saved just for her. \"You still haven't answered my question.\" \"What question?\" She pulled herself up so her knees were on the chair, and lifted her chin to meet his eye again. \"What should I call you?\" He leaned down and his nose brushed against hers, just for a moment, before he kissed her. \"I will need to think on that, Kirsty, before I can give you an answer. I truly do not know.\" She leaned forward and kissed him again, and he smiled against her lips. \"Perhaps your lover?\" \"That's not what I meant!\" Now she was laughing, and though he didn't join in, he was still smiling as he kissed her forehead. \"And that's a little intense to use in public, don't you think?\" \"Perhaps.\" He let go of her chin, and Kirsty watched him return to the sofa before sitting down in her chair properly. \"... I will tell you as soon as I can, Kirsty, but I am not sure any name on Earth will ever feel truly mine. Perhaps Elliot would be most convenient, but it is not who I am.\" \"I understand,\" she said, her smile softening. \"We can just test it for now before trying anything else. I know it's not your name... maybe we can consider it a title on its own.\" \"That might work.\" He looked up from the board at her, his face serious again, but his eyes soft. She smiled at him. \"I love you... Elliot.\" It took a moment, but that little smile appeared on his face as he returned his attention to the board. \"And I love you, Kirsty.\" He tapped his finger on the table. \"And it is your move.\" She smiled and moved her token, and they soon fell back into the comfortable silence, soothed by the downpour of the afternoon rain. ... didn't expect that to turn into fluff, but I guess that's how it goes sometimes. Ah well. Onwards![Chapter 4] The only light in the room leaked in from beneath the closed door and crept up to the foot of the bed, but Kirsty didn't entirely need it. Her eyes had adjusted as much as they could do the dark, and she was wholly focused on the man lying in front of her. She was supposed to call him Elliot, but even though it was her idea Kirsty couldn't quite make it fit in her head. She said the name easily, and he had managed to get somewhat used to responding to it. Here in the dark though, when there was nobody to pretend to that he just was Elliot and that's all there was to it... She'd never had a name for him, but he'd never needed one. From the beginning, even when he had frightened her, he had been imprinted into her mind. There was a him-shaped space that she never needed a name to fill - she used the Cenobite Prince or whatever title was needed when trying to explain to somebody else, which was almost never, but to herself he was simply him and that was all she needed. Even his Gash - The Chatterer, Nikoletta, Butterball (his title couldn't really be that) - hadn't had the same effect on her. \"You're not sleeping, Kirsty.\" She started a little as she realized he was looking back at her. She couldn't see the blue of his eyes in the dark, but she could tell he was looking at her, only partially asleep himself. \"Neither are you.\" He reached forward and pushed a strand of hair from her cheek; she closed her eyes and leaned into the touch before opening them again. \"...I can't stop thinking,\" she said after a moment, glancing at the sheets beneath them. \"I don't know what to do.\" He'd initially offered to stay on the couch, then she had offered to and let him use her bed, and then they'd realized neither one really wanted to sleep on the couch or the bed without the other one. She didn't have a full bed, just an old queen, but she was thankful for the closeness of it, for the way she could just reach forward and find him at an arm's length. \"Neither do I,\" he said after a moment, and she pulled herself a little closer to him. \"I have been trying not to let it disturb me.\" Elliot was lying on his back, his head turned towards her, and she'd noticed he'd propped his head up with a couple of pillows from the couch alongside the two on the bed. She was content with her two, but he was halfway to sitting upright. \"Are you comfortable like that?\" She asked, and he let out a breath that could have been a laugh. \"I am unused to sleeping with such soft, easily-torn materials,\" he said, and Kirsty bit her lip as the image of his pinned head getting caught in a feather pillow flashed across her mind, \"but... yes, I suppose that for the time being I am comfortable. This is not how I used to sleep, but... I suppose it is a manageable middle.\" \"How did you used to sleep?\" She asked, watching Elliot's hand as he started idly playing with her hair. These were such small things - lying next to each other, little touches, talking in the middle of the night - but Kirsty hadn't realized how much she'd ached for them, ached for these experience with him, until she had them. If only the circumstances were happier, this might have been pure bliss. \"Not with such a thick blanket,\" he said, tugging at the comforter a little. \"Nor with such noises as those of the city.\" He gestured to the balcony window, where the bustle of cars could be heard from floors before. He paused, before looking at Kirsty again. \"Nor with a beautiful woman beside me.\" Kirsty smiled and pulled herself up so she could kiss him. Elliot's hands settled on her waist; they stayed that way as they kissed, and Kirsty pulled away what felt like far too soon to tap his nose with one finger. \"Flatterer.\" \"Only because it is true, Kirsty.\" She settled onto his chest and closed her eyes, which he accepted with a kiss to her forehead. \"I am fortunate to be with you.\" \"Yeah?\" She smiled a little. \"I'm glad you're here.\" She felt his hand on her back, slowly slipping down to the curve of her spine, her cotton shirt shifting under his fingers. He settled it there and seemed to relax. \"... I am not happy I am here,\" he said after a moment, voice quiet, \"but I am happy that it somehow led me to you.\" She hummed a little against his chest. \"Love you.\" \"I love you, Kirsty.\" His other hand settled on her back, and Kirsty felt him let out a deep, slow breath. \"I shall see you when we wake.\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"you will.\" She still didn't know what to do, or what he was going to do while she was at work tomorrow, but he would be there when she woke up. That comfort was enough to let her relax, and soon the sounds of the city faded to the rise and fall of his chest, then nothing at all. Chapter 4! Probably going to have a little more action next chapter, but I really wanted to get this one down first. Chapter 17's up next![Chapter 5] The mortal world was so much more lively and colorful and loud than he remembered. Walking down the street was a spectacle all its own - the lights, the sounds, the chorus of a hundred footsteps not entirely in time as the signal switched from a hand to a walking figure were all strange and familiar to him, somehow at the same time. He walked with the crowd, small and flimsy (plastic) bag in his hand, feeling invisible among the humans who paid him no mind. For some reason he was grateful for that. He was a proud man, and had reason to be, but even he knew when to admit he needed help. Kirsty had downloaded a map from the internet (two new words he thought he understood) and helped him plan a route for the day, starting at her apartment building and ending at her workplace just as it was time for her to go home. Now his small purchases of the day sat patiently in a plastic bag at his side as he approached the tall, monotonous building where he knew Kirsty to be. The former Cenobite (who could not truly think of himself as Elliot) stepped in, and after a moment of mental rehearsal, approached the front desk. \"Excuse me,\" he said - the woman was young and blonde and looked up from her book at him wide-eyed and started - \"I'm looking for Ms. Kirsty Cotton's office. I believe she's expecting me.\" The woman - Carrie was what her nametag said - nodded and reached for a phone on her desk. \"I'll call her,\" she said, and he nodded as she dialed. The sounds were older and buzzed more than the ones from Kirsty's small, sleek phone. \"Hello, Ms. Cotton? There's somebody here, a Mr...\" she looked up at him, waiting. \"Elliot Singer,\" he offered, and she nodded. It was a name they'd come up with together - not quite Spencer, because he wasn't, but close enough that he'd recognize it easily. \"Mr. Singer?\" She didn't say anything for a moment, but nodded. \"Uh-huh... uh-huh. Okay, thank you.\" She set the device down and turned to him. \"She'll be ready in a minute, in the meantime you can take the elevator up. She's on the fourth floor.\" \"Thank you,\" he said, and started for the elevator doors. \"Um, actually,\" she started, and he stopped to look over his shoulder at her, \"You're not... her boyfriend, are you? The one from England?\" From England? That was technically true, but how would she have known? He nodded nonetheless, a slow one as he wondered what Kirsty had said to her. \"I am,\" he said, and she smiled. \"Well,\" she said, \"Kirsty's mentioned you before, but I never saw a picture or anything. It's nice to meet you.\" She nodded at him, and he nodded back because that seemed to be appropriate, and she sat back down. Content the exchange was over and slightly baffled, he went to the elevator and was grateful he could at least intuit what to do without help. The elevator was slow, and it gave him a moment to reflect. The former Prince looked down at himself - dark gray pants (not jeans) and nice shoes, a gray scarf, a black double-breasted coat and matching gloves. It was hardly his robes, but he was thankful to at least be covered in something heavy and dark. It was as close to familiar as he was going to get if he wanted to blend in. (He didn't want to blend in, he wanted his body and his duty restored, he wanted to serve his gods and his dimension. It did not look like that would happen overnight, though.) The elevator stopped at the seventh with an overly-cheery ding! He stepped out, politely peering from one side to the other, feeling a touch lost amongst the cubicles and sound of office noises. He couldn't even sense the scandal coming off of anyone; all he felt were curious eyes from passing strangers, and the number of them multiplied as someone approached the corner of his vision. He turned, and allowed his more restrained smile to show as Kirsty reached him. \"Perfect timing,\" she said, smiling up at him, \"did you have any trouble getting here?\" \"None at all, Kirsty,\" he said, and a couple eyebrows raised behind her. He heard a murmur of 'he is English', but paid it no mind. \"You were quite helpful. Shall we be on our way?\" \"We shall,\" she said, even as he noticed a couple of her apparent coworkers attempting to flag her attention. She called the elevator back, and he started to tell her about his day's adventures when two more pairs of heels stepped in. He felt a pang of human annoyance, and it looked as if Kirsty did as well, but both women had already started talking. Perhaps interrogating was a better word, he'd think later on. \"So,\" one of them, a woman with red hair swept up and a white blouse pressed down said, \"are you going to introduce us to your friend, Kirsty?\" The other woman smiled with her, red lipstick forming a half-moon on her face as she looked from him to Kirsty. Kirsty smiled, an apologetic look directed at him before she spoke, \"Yes, my... boyfriend came in to visit,\" she said, \"Katie, Judith, this is Elliot. Elliot, this is Katie and Judith.\" Katie was the quiet smiling one Judith the curious interloper. \"It's his first time in the city and he wanted to see it with me. Right, Elliot?\" \"Indeed,\" he said, grateful for her quick thinking, \"it is quite different from home, I am still learning everything about it. Thankfully Kirsty has been an excellent teacher.\" She beamed at that, just for a moment, and both women seemed delighted or at least quite entertained by the polite flirtation. \"You never told us he was so eloquent, Kirsty,\" Katie said, glancing up at him for a moment, \"or anything, really.\" \"I thought she'd made you up to get guys to stop talking to her.\" Judith laughed even as he arched a brow. \"Sometimes it didn't even work!\" \"Is that so?\" He asked, looking to Kirsty. Before she could answer the same ding! sounded, and the doors parted on the first floor. Judith and Katie walked out first, and he couldn't resist the opportunity to take Kirsty's hand again. Carrie smiled and gave a small wave as they both walked out, and he nodded back, a restrained and practiced gesture. \"So,\" she asked as they approached the car, \"how was your first day as Elliot Singer?\" \"Productive,\" he said, holding up his bag, \"and educational. Masquerading as a human is exhausting.\" \"I think everyone feels that way.\" Kirsty unlocked the car and slipped in, and he took his seat a moment later. \"You want to tell me now or when we get home?\" \"Let us wait until we are home. There is much to be discussed.\" \"Indeed,\" Kirsty said with a smile, and he gave her a look before she pulled out of the parking lot and onto the open road.[Chapter 6] \"You don't have to hold onto that.\" Was it some trace memory of riding a train in the 1910's, or was he just not used to being in a car? Kirsty wasn't sure, but either way Elliott had a white-knuckle grip on the grab handle even as they sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic. That was rush hour - old news to her, but even with his straight face she could catch the way Elliott's eyes flitted about. He clearly wasn't thrilled by the concept of highways. \"I promise we won't fall off.\" \"You're teasing me, Kirsty.\" He sounded fine, but he still squeezed the handle before finally letting it go. \"I cannot imagine committing to this twice each day for the sake of sitting at a desk.\" \"Don't you walk across bridges over lightning-charged boundless depths?\" She looked back towards the road but heard a small exhale. \"They are not boundless, Kirsty, they lead to the heart and hands of the Labyrinth. It is as essential to us as the surface and those who live in Leviathan's gaze.\" He said Leviathan with a reverence she hadn't heard in years; not since she'd last been in a church, which was a long, long time ago. Elliott looked out the window, and his blue-gray eyes seemed clouded. \"Hands?\" She briefly imagined giant hands like the dark beams of Leviathan - she kept wanting to call it \"dark light\" even though that was utter nonsense. But what else was it? It was all-consuming and blinding, and she hadn't been able to look at it directly. A sun in its own right. \"Is that literal or metaphorical?\" \"That depends on how they favor you.\" That didn't help at all, but now cars were moving. Kirsty stepped on the gas and saw Elliott grab at the handle again. She drove carefully, or as carefully as she could while going 60, and made for an exit as soon as she could. He seemed to let go of a breath he'd been holding for too long. \"Are you sure you're alright?\" \"Yes.\" The response was short and he wasn't looking at her - was it pride? Fear? Was he overwhelmed? In any case, it was probably time to change the subject. \"You didn't tell me what you bought.\" There was a moment's pause before he reacted, but he turned to the bag in his lap and pulled out a book. \"Thesis of Penance,\" he said, \"an obscure tome, but I recognized the title. I believe it was written by a scholar of the Lament Configuration and the Labyrinth, and what influence has leaked from them into your world. I hoped to find some answers, or at least a name.\" \"A name?\" Kirsty didn't need to question where she was going; she knew this route the way she knew to breathe. \"Are you looking for somebody who can reverse this?\" \"Not entirely - this was not power that just one individual can reverse, unless that individual was Leviathan.\" \"Or the Labyrinth.\" Tangential late-night conversations were hard to remember, but she'd grasped a few details. \"Correct. While I have lost my connection with Leviathan...\" and he stopped there, looking at the book, eyes growing dark again. Kirsty reached a stop sign, and put a hand on his. \"Elliott.\" He looked at her. \"You're looking for somebody.\" \"...I am hoping to find somebody whose connection might be intact.\" He turned back to the book. \"Opening the Lament Configuration presents too much risk, as I do not know if my Gash will recognize me. I could hardly believe you did.\" \"It's easier than you think.\" He gave her a quizzical look, and Kirsty just smiled a bit before driving again. \"So you're hoping this book will have some names of Labyrinth-dwellers who are on this side of the door. How do you know any of them are still here?\" \"I don't,\" he said, \"but it is a beginning.\" She pulled into the parking lot behind her apartment and wound her way up to her assigned spot. \"I intend to focus on this tonight and tomorrow.\" \"Sounds like a plan.\" The car turned off with a faint hum, and she looked back to Elliott. \"...do you have something else in the bag?\" \"Ah, yes.\" He pulled out the other dark shape she saw through the thin plastic - an anatomy book. \"This is more for-\" \"I don't want to know,\" Kirsty said, \"I don't want to think about your weird Cenobite stuff, please don't tell me. Nope.\" She got out of the car and closed the door behind her, but still heard the faintest sound of bemused laughter. You can't prove he'd be comfortable in a car, that's all I'm saying. In any case, new Penance chapter, whoo! I'm sort of finding the plot as I write, so this one might be a bit messier. But I hope you're all enjoying it! -Inky ","Summary":" So...

Before he could recover, his partner punched him hard in the face, grabbed him, and threw him bodily across the room. The American agent shakily got to his feet and used his sleeve to wipe the blood dripping from his nose. I know I said that it had to look convincing but damn, Peril! Illya rapidly closed the distance between them and threw another punch. This time, Napoleon managed to dodge the blow and countered with a kick but his move lacked power and Illya easily blocked his foot and swept his other leg from under him. Napoleon crashed to the floor and immediately tried to roll away, to no avail. The Russian was already upon him, he seized Napoleon by the throat one handed and drove him into the nearest wall. The American raised his hands to break his partner's grip, leaving his torso unprotected. A mistake he instantly regretted as Illya used his free hand to punch him viciously in the ribs. Napoleon heard something crack and felt a sharp pain in his side. He gasped and fell to his knees as Illya let go of his throat. Definitely a nice touch of authenticity, Peril… This time he didn't attempt to get up, the blow had winded him and he was having a hard time catching his breath, the pain in his ribs wasn't helping. Illya was putting on a good show but Napoleon was hoping that his next attack wouldn't be as vigorous as this one and that he would let him land a few punches for a change. Suddenly, a speaker attached to the wall crackled and a taunting voice filled the room. \"So it looks like you're the one who's going to die, Solo…That's quite a punch you pack, Kuryakin, I could almost hear the sound of poor Solo's ribs breaking, truly entertaining. But I still feel that you're holding back. May I make a suggestion? Punches and kicks can do a lot of damage but it gets repetitive after a while. How about you start spilling more of your partner's blood by using the tools I provided you with?\" Napoleon could hear the cruel smile in the man's voice. He was still down on his hands and knees, recovering. Illya's legs were in his field of vision. The Russian wasn't moving. Another crackling sound. \"I really think you should follow my advice, Kuryakin. You know what will happen if you don't. It would be a shame if someone had to suffer the consequences of your stubbornness…\" A second passed, another. Napoleon could feel his heart hammering painfully against his ribs. Then Illya started heading toward a table at the far end of the room. The American closed his eyes and sighed heavily. He knew what was on the table, and he knew that their situation was about to get worse. His eyes shot open as he heard something metallic hit the floor in front of him. Napoleon hesitated for a second, then he picked up the knife that Illya had just tossed him. \"A noble gesture, Kuryakin. And Solo is accepting the challenge. I knew good old Solo still had some fight left in him. This is going to be interesting.\" Interesting is an understatement… Napoleon pushed himself up, wincing at the pain in his side. His gaze fell on the giant bowie knife in his partner's hand and he felt his pulse quicken. He knew how skilled the Russian was with knives. As Illya stepped closer, Napoleon looked into his eyes, trying to read his expression, he saw nothing but cold determination. We are still only pretending, right?.. The gleeful voice filled the room once again. \"Enjoy yourselves boys, try not to make it end too soon, but don't take too much time either. Remember, the clock is ticking. One of you has to be dead before the deadline or else…Well, we've already been over this.\" At these words, Napoleon saw Illya's gaze shift almost imperceptibly to the timer on the wall. When his eyes shifted back to the American, they were filled with murderous rage. Napoleon adjusted his grip on the knife and adopted a fighting stance. Let's see how much worse this day can get… End of chapter 1. Let me know what you think :)[Chapter 2] Sorry for the (very) long absence, life is keeping me super busy and I had no time for writing for a while. Here is chapter 2. Chapter 3 and 4 are coming very soon. Let me know if you're still enjoying the story Unknown location, the day before, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby opened her eyes. She blinked a few times, waiting for her eyes to get used to the light. Her head hurt and something was covering her mouth. She tried to raise her hands to her face, but they felt really heavy and wouldn't move. Looking down she understood why. She was sitting on a chair, tied up, her arms strapped to the arms of the chair. Then she realized that her mouth had been taped shut. How...? Gradually she started remembering. She had been walking down the street on the way to her apartment to call Waverly. She had been in a hurry and absorbed in her thoughts. She had bumped into a man coming the other way. She remembered feeling a sharp stinging sensation, as if something had pricked her arm, but her mind had been focused on apologizing. And then her mind couldn't focus anymore. She had suddenly felt extremely dizzy and the man had caught her before she collapsed. She had heard him say something like: \"Are you feeling all right? Here let me help. Don't worry I'll take good care of you, Miss Teller \" And that was all she could remember before everything went dark. And it was enough to make her shudder. The man had known her name. What did that mean? Why had she been taken and by whom? Gaby looked around her. The room she was in was spacious and brightly lit. Right in front of her she could see a large screen on the wall, under it was a control panel, it looked like a video surveillance system. There was also a camera in the room, pointed right at her. Before Gaby could continue scanning her surroundings, a door opened behind her, startling her. \"Oh, it looks like you are finally awake, Miss Teller.\" A man's voice. Not the one who had drugged her on the street. \"I hope we didn't keep you waiting too long. Don't worry, with the delightful show I have prepared for you, I guarantee that you will soon be entertained\" The voice grew closer until two men finally came into her field of vision. She had been right, the man who was now standing in front of her was older than the one who had drugged her. And his face. She would have remembered that face. It was covered with burn scars. The man was almost bald except for a few patches of hair on his scarred skull. The scars went all the way down his neck and as her gaze fell on his right hand, she noticed that it had also been burnt. Gaby repressed a shudder. She had no idea who the man was but his appearance and the cruel smile playing on his lips were enough to make her pulse race. Her eyes shifted to the other man's face. He wasn't the one she had bumped into on the street either. He was taller and looked younger, he had one of those faces that you easily forget but his eyes had a hard glint that made her uneasy. The older man sat down on a chair opposite her while the younger one moved out of her field of vision. \"Just relax, Miss Teller, you have no reason to be concerned, well, almost no reason. If everything goes as planned, you'll leave this place unharmed. But first, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I think it's important that we get better acquainted. It will help you understand why I'm keeping you here. Let me start by saying that I didn't always look like this.\" Gaby's eyes lingered on the man's burns. \"These I owe to your partners. Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin.\" Her surprise seemed to amuse him. \"Two years ago I was a brilliant scientist, working for an important criminal organization. Things were going well until your partners showed up to shut us down. See the people I worked for were determined that our research be kept secret and rather then let the MI6 get their hands on it, they gave the order to activate the lab's self destruct system. I tried to save my life's work but failed and was gravely burnt. So your partners caused the destruction of everything I cared about and left me for dead.\" Even though the man was creeping her out, Gaby had to resist the urge to roll her eyes. Was he seriously expecting compassion from her? Engrossed in his own story, the man went on. \"I kept a low profile during the last two years. My recovery was a long and painful process but it wasn't a waste of time, on the contrary. It gave me time to plan my revenge. After a year I felt strong enough to get back into the business. Thanks to my reputation, it wasn't long before I was hired by another criminal organization and my new, privileged position meant that I had access to all sorts of interesting information. And so I spent the last year gathering all the information available about the two agents who had caused my downfall. I was looking for something that would allow me to exact the perfect revenge on them, the best way to make them suffer, destroy them as they had almost destroyed me. And I found it. Gaby felt a chill run down her spine as he gave her a lopsided smile, one corner of his mouth weighed down by thick scar tissue. So this is what happens when Illya and Napoleon are sent on an assignment without me… End of chapter 2.[Chapter 3] I told you that chapter 3 was coming soon Unknown location, the next day, Napoleon's p.o.v. Napoleon groaned as he was roused from sleep by two hands shaking him none too gently. His eyes opened and focused on the owner of those hands. Why am I not surprised… Illya was kneeling next to him, staring at him. As was the case most of the time, the Russian had that look on his face of someone who has just tasted something really bitter but is too polite to spit it out and has to put up with the bad taste. \"Ah, Peril.\", Napoleon said, pushing himself up to a sitting position. \"It's nice to see a familiar face when waking up in a strange place.\" He looked around him. They were in a large room with blank, white walls and an uncharacteristically high ceiling. The only piece of furniture was a table at the far end of the room. He had woken up with a headache and the light reflecting on the white walls wasn't helping. \"I assume you are as confused as I am as to why we're here?\", he said, glancing at his partner. Illya shrugged. \"Your guess is as good as mine, Cowboy.\" Napoleon struggled to remember what had happened before he had passed out. He had been drugged, no doubt about that. He had received a message from Waverly. Their boss had not heard from Gaby in a while, she was on an assignment and hadn't reported back, all attempts to contact her had failed. Illya and him were supposed to meet with Waverly so that they could be briefed on the situation. Napoleon remembered finding it convenient that a taxi had been driving down his street just as he was leaving his apartment. The driver had insisted on shaking his hand and he remembered feeling a sting on the inside of his palm. Then, the world had started to blur. A bit too convenient indeed… \"So you were drugged too?\", Napoleon asked Illya. The Russian had gotten to his feet and was pacing. \"Yes.\" \"How long have you been conscious?\" \"A while. You remain unconscious longer because you are weak.\" Napoleon sighed and pushed himself to his feet. Peril's definitely in a good mood. He took a few steps, he was still a bit groggy but he was also intrigued by the table and wanted to have a look at what was on it. \"Weapons.\", Illya said, as he saw Solo heading for the table. \"Mostly knives and clubs. No guns.\" At that moment, the sound of someone clearing their throat filled the room. A startled Solo spun around to locate the origin of the sound. His eyes settled on a speaker on the wall, close to the high ceiling. \"I'm glad to see that you are both awake. At last.\", the voice went on. \"You look so peaceful when you're asleep, Solo.\" Napoleon frowned, the voice clearly belonged to a man and had a taunting quality, but more importantly it sounded vaguely familiar to him. It was hard to be sure, as the voice coming out of the speaker was slightly distorted, but he had a feeling that he had heard it before, he just couldn't place it. He turned to Illya, hoping to see his thoughts mirrored in his partner's gaze, but the only thing he could read in the Russian's eyes was that he was particularly annoyed. It was clear from what the man had said that he was watching them. Napoleon looked up and spotted the cameras, he also spotted a screen, embedded in the wall, which he had not noticed before, next to one of the cameras at the far end of the room. The screen was blank. This inspection had taken him no more than ten seconds. He decided to speak before the voice could go on. \"So you can see us but we can't see you. It hardly seems fair.\" He saw Illya roll his eyes but he knew his partner understood what he was doing. The speaker crackled as the disembodied voice sounded again. \"Let's just say I'm not much of a public person these days, Solo.\" So he could hear them too. This meant that he and Illya would not be able to communicate freely. \"What's the screen for then?\" \"Patience, Solo, I'm going to tell you everything you need to know. I've waited so long for this, I want to savor this moment, so be a dear and shut your damn mouth.\" Napoleon was tempted to counter with one of his trademark witty lines but a frown from Illya made him think better of it. \"I know you're probably wondering why you're here and who I am.\", the man gave a curt laugh. \"For now, let's just say that I am an old friend.\" \"You'll have to forgive us\", Napoleon cut in, ignoring the \"Shut up, Cowboy!\" vibe radiating from his partner. \"We tend to meet a lot of nutcases in our line of work.\" \"Oh, you've probably forgotten about me Solo, but I haven't forgotten about you both. It has been a long, long time, and I thought a reunion was in order. Now let me explain why you're here. Like I said you might not remember me but some years ago you completely destroyed what mattered the most to me; my life's work. And you almost managed to kill me too. But I survived and here I am, ready to return the favor.\" Well that narrows it down… It sounds like about 90% of our missions. Napoleon wondered why their captor was intentionally remaining vague about his identity. Maybe he thought that it gave him more power over them, or maybe he was saving the big reveal for later, the man seemed to have a taste for the theatrical. \"But enough about me, I'm sure you're eager to know what I brought you here for. Well it's very simple actually, you are going to fight each other until one of you dies. Now, you're probably asking yourselves what could possibly motivate you to try and kill each other.\" Oh I can think of one or two reasons… \"Which is why I'm going to provide you with a little incentive. If I may direct your attention to the screen…\" As the man uttered these words, the screen came to life and Napoleon had a sudden sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. The screen showed the remaining member of their trio, Gaby. She appeared to be tied to a chair and had a large piece of duct tape covering her mouth. She was conscious and was glaring at the camera, probably the same type of camera that their captor was using to watch them. Napoleon tore his gaze away from Gaby to glance at Illya. The Russian looked furious but he remained silent, probably aware that voicing his anger was pointless and might have bad consequences for Gaby. \"Very pretty, isn't she? Don't you worry, she's completely unharmed. Luckily for her, I don't have anything against her since she wasn't working with you on the mission that ruined my life. I'm only using her to hurt you. But I won't hesitate to kill her if you refuse to play along. And believe me I've had time to prepare for this, I know how to make her death extremely painful.\" A sudden loud noise made Napoleon start. Illya had just slammed his fist down on the table – and on one of the sharp instruments lying there, judging by the blood that was dripping from his hand. \"Easy now, Kuryakin, you'll have plenty of time to spill blood while you're here, but for now let me finish. Here are the rules of the game.\" The image on the screen changed and Gaby disappeared, replaced by a timer. The voice went on. \"See that timer, boys? It shows the time you have left to decide who is going to die. Since you already have a time constraint, I'm leaving it up to you to choose the method. As you can see on the table, I've provided a set of tools. Feel free to use them. As long as one of you dies before the end of the imparted time, I will let Miss Teller go free and unharmed. If you're both still alive after the deadline, I will kill Miss Teller. Now if you both die, I will also kill Miss Teller, there has to be a winner for her to survive. The winner will take her place and die a painful death after being submitted to horrible torture. So the one who dies in this room really doesn't get the short end of the stick. Think of it as mercy killing. But bear in mind that the one who gets out of this room will suffer horribly before they die. And don't waste your time trying to escape. The only way out of this room can only be opened from the outside. I know that Solo is quite the escape artist but I'm afraid there are no locks to pick this time. Now that you've been briefed, I'll leave you two alone to think about it and decide which role each of you is going to play.\" I was right, our friend is definitely into theatrics… As silence filled the room again, Napoleon became aware of the blood pulsing in his temples. He and Illya exchanged a glance. What are we going to do now? Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Of course Gaby had heard everything the man had said to Illya and Napoleon. She kept turning the words in her mind, trying to find a loophole, one glimpse of a solution. But this time it seemed that their situation was indeed hopeless. Her heart constricted as she imagined Illya and Napoleon fighting each other to save her. She didn't want to die but the thought of Napoleon being forced to kill Illya – or Illya to kill Napoleon, of course – to prevent her own death was unbearable. The boys had managed to communicate a little bit in Russian before the man had stopped them, threatening to hurt her if they talked again. He obviously didn't understand Russian. And neither did she so she had no idea what Napoleon and Illya had said to each other. Then the man had left the room for a short while, leaving his henchman to monitor her partners' actions. Instead of sitting at the control panel, the henchman had walked up to her chair and bent down until his mouth was close to her face. She had been saved by the sound of the scientist's footsteps in the corridor. The henchman had swiftly walked back to the control panel before her captor entered the room. She shot the younger man a worried glance. As if she didn't have enough on her plate. \"It seems that your partners are having some trouble getting started.\", the scientist said, winking at her. \"Let's give them a little nudge, shall we?\" End of chapter 3. (sorry for the long chapter)[Chapter 4] And here is chapter 4. Hopefully chapter 5 is coming soon. Let me know what you think :) Unknown location, a few hours later, Napoleon's p.o.v. Napoleon kept replaying the events of the last few hours in his mind, trying to decide when it had gone from bad to worse, and from worse to even worse. They had had no choice but to start fighting as their captor had threatened to hurt Gaby. He and Illya had managed to exchange a few words in Russian before the man had stopped them. And although he hadn't let it show, what Illya had told him then had surprised him, to say the least. Napoleon had asked the obvious question: what are we going to do? The Russian had simply answered that maybe he had a plan and that they needed to buy some time by pretending to fight. Napoleon had been about to express his doubts but he knew that they didn't have much time so he had decided to trust Illya and agreed to put on a believable show. Then their captor had cut him off and forbidden further communication between them. They had fought hand-to-hand for a while and Napoleon had discovered, much to his dismay, that Illya's version of a fake fight was extremely close to the real thing. He had naively thought that the Russian would pull his punches and had ended up with a bloody nose and a cracked rib. But the moment he was strongly tempted to consider as the shift from worse to even worse was when, thanks to the advice of their ever-helpful captor, the fight had turned into a knife fight. Facing Illya with a knife was like facing a bull in the ring with no knowledge of bullfighting whatsoever, and with bright red targets over all your vital organs. The instant he had seen the steely resolve in his partner's eyes as he adopted a fighting stance, knife in hand, Napoleon had felt the seeds of doubt beginning to sprout in his mind. Had it been a ruse? Could it be that Illya had told him they were pretending so that he could have the upper hand more easily when the time came to kill him? These thoughts were flashing through his mind as he tried his best to hold his partner at bay. Getting close for an attack, even a fake one, would be foolish. He wouldn't stand a chance. Thankfully he could tell that Illya was still holding back a little, using slashing motions when he could have easily stabbed something vital. Still, Napoleon was already bleeding from various cuts on his arms and he was getting tired, continuously dodging Illya's attacks was getting harder and harder. Suddenly, Illya feinted and a surprised Napoleon lost his balance, holding his arms out to steady himself, leaving his upper body unguarded. Illya seized the opportunity and slashed him across the chest. The American winced and staggered back, instinctively raising his free hand to his chest. He caught his partner's gaze and thought he read some trace of apology in his eyes. Is that your way of telling me to focus, Peril? Then Illya did something he was not expecting. He lunged straight at him, knife first, without feinting. Napoleon easily side stepped him and kicked the knife out of his hand. He almost took a moment to congratulate himself on this small victory but at the same time he realized that his partner was now unarmed. What was he supposed to do, fight an unarmed Illya with a knife? Even if it was a small knife, it didn't seem right. This hesitation proved fatal to him as the Russian barreled into him at full speed. What had he been thinking? Illya didn't need his knife to be dangerous. He fell backwards, bumping his head on one of the walls as he went down. Illya fell on top of him knocking the wind out of him. The pressure on his broken rib made his eyes water as he struggled to breathe. \"Back to hand-to-hand fighting I see, Kuryakin. I must admit I am very curious to see how you're going to finish him off.\" Napoleon had almost forgotten about their captor. Dammit, Illya doesn't need a cheerleader! He had miraculously managed to keep his grip on the knife and started bringing it up in hope that Illya would back off. Another mistake as his partner delivered a forceful open hand chop to his arm, rendering it temporarily numb and useless. Napoleon cursed as the knife clattered to the floor. His partner's attacks were getting more and more violent. Again he began to wonder if the Russian was still acting or if he had been too trusting and had let his guard down one time too many. He didn't have much time to ponder the question though as Illya punched him in the gut. Before he could recover Illya punched him again. And again. He couldn't use his numb arm to protect himself and the Russian had his other arm and his legs pinned down. He screwed his eyes shut, waiting for the fourth blow. And wasn't disappointed as Illya's fist slammed full force into his temple this time. Pain exploded in his head. He was dazed from the force of the blow, yet still conscious but it felt as if all his strength had been drained from his body. He let Illya grab him by the front of his shirt and prop him up against the wall. He heard the blade scrape against the floor as his partner picked up the knife. Illya' gestures were more gentle now, almost precise. Whatever he was about to do, Napoleon didn't have the strength to fight back. The only thing that was holding him upright was the Russian's hand. Nothing happened for a second and Napoleon closed his eyes, hoping that it meant Illya was allowing him some time to recover. Then he felt the blade slide into his flesh. His eyes shot open and he gasped, the pain and shock momentarily clearing his thoughts. Illya had stabbed him. As he tried to wrap his head around this fact he suddenly became aware of the silence and stillness around him. He looked down at the knife protruding from his body. Then looked up again and met Illya's eyes. He saw pain, and guilt, and remorse, but also the same determination that had been there before. Then suddenly the peaceful silence that had surrounded him was troubled by several overlapping sounds. The sound of his blood beating in his temples, raging in his ears. The sound of his breathing, coming in short gasps. The sound of his voice, a pitiful groan which he hadn't realized had been coming out of his mouth. Napoleon tried to move but Illya was still holding him firmly against the wall. Slowly, the Russian lifted his hand to Napoleon's face and covered his mouth as if to stifle his groans of pain. \"Shhh,\" Illya said, softly. \"It's over Napoleon.\" Napoleon frowned at the mention of his first name and as he felt something being pressed insistently against his mouth. Illya's p.o.v. Illya kept his hand pressed against his partner's mouth a bit longer. Then he saw a flash of understanding in Solo's eyes. Removing his hand, he gently pulled the American's body from against the wall and positioned himself behind him. As Solo began to struggle weakly, Illya swiftly slipped the hollow of his elbow under his partner's chin and pulled him close, cutting the blood flow to his brain. After a few seconds, Solo began convulsing and then stopped moving completely. Forgive me, Cowboy. But this had to be done. End of chapter 4.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 is here. It's time to have a look at Illya's side of the story :) Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby felt tears run down her face. She couldn't believe what she was seeing on the screen. Illya had stabbed Napoleon. She didn't want to believe it. Illya would never kill Napoleon, he wouldn't. Except perhaps to save my life… She choked back a sob. The scientist was sitting in front of the screen, leaning close, as if he was enjoying a particularly captivating show. \"Kuryakin really did a number on Solo, didn't he, Miss Teller?\", he said, without turning around. Gaby could see the back of his head and the tufts of hair on his burnt scalp. She wished she could set them on fire just by glaring at them. Suddenly she felt something against her back. She tensed and strained her neck to look over her shoulder. The scientist's henchman was standing behind her, insistently poking her back with his finger. What was the creep doing? Gaby shuddered as she remembered how he had tried to kiss her neck earlier. She tried to lean forward, away from his touch, but her movements were limited. The scientist hadn't noticed anything. He was too busy taunting Illya. The tapping on her back stopped and the man's hand settled on her shoulder. He squeezed it in what resembled a reassuring gesture. Gaby frowned. Then the poking resumed. He let his touch linger, then a rapid poke, then a slow, lingering one and a rapid one again. What…? And it dawned on her. It was Morse code. Becoming familiar with coded systems of communication had been part of her training when she had become an agent. I'm tied to a chair, at the mercy of a madman, I just watched one of my partners kill the other and one of my captors is tapping Morse code on my back… She concentrated on the alternation of long and short nudges. The man was tapping the same message over and over. Mobilizing her rudimentary knowledge, she managed to decode it. C-I-A? And that's the code for \"undercover\"…? Is this a joke? The man was CIA undercover? That was something she hadn't been expecting. Although, absurd as it might have seemed in her current situation, it made sense in a way. The scientist had said he was part of a large international criminal organization, the kind that was more than likely to attract the attention of intelligence agencies. Her pulse started to race as she tried to wrap her head around the message and its implications. She nodded once, to signify that she had understood and the message changed. SOS/MI6. He had contacted the MI6, probably through his superiors. But Napoleon is dead... She knew the CIA agent had probably received the order not to compromise his cover. But Napoleon is dead. Her thoughts were interrupted by a sudden, deafening noise. The scientist had turned around and had a gun in his hand. She registered the sound of someone falling behind her but her eyes remained fixed on the gun. The scientist walked up to her chair, stepped around it and she heard another gunshot. He stepped back into her field of vision and shrugged apologetically. \"Sorry about that, Miss Teller. I can't stand perverts. He won't bother you anymore.\" He sat back down in front of the screen. \"Now where were we?\" Gaby stared at the tufts of hair, completely stunned. Unknown location, Illya's p.o.v As he felt Solo twitch and lose consciousness, Illya counted the seconds mentally and imperceptibly loosened his chokehold to relieve the pressure on the unconscious agent's carotid arteries. He prayed silently that the fast-acting drug had been fast-acting enough. Please, Cowboy, just stay dead… Solo didn't come around. Reassured that the drug was working, Illya remained in the same position for a couple of minutes, without applying pressure, to make it look like he had choked his partner to death. Then he let go and carefully laid the American's limp body down on the floor. He almost sighed in relief. That part was done. Now he was hoping that the mysterious someone who had provided the pill would send some help soon. Several hours earlier he had woken up in this room next to an unconscious Solo. He had immediately felt an unusual weight in his pocket and had found his watch there. A tiny piece of paper had been taped to the back of it, along with an even tinier white pill with a series of numbers on it. He had recognized the pill instantly. Although at the time he had not understood what use it could be to him. It was a drug that was sometimes issued to agents for particular assignments. Its main purpose was to make the subject appear dead by drastically slowing their heart rate. It had been discontinued as it was considered too unreliable. The words \"Help is on the way.\" had been scribbled on the paper at the back of the watch. Though he had been perplexed at first, the opening speech of their deranged captor had soon made it clear that both the pill and help of any sort would come in handy. He had briefly wondered who their mysterious ally could be. But he had quickly realized that speculating was pointless. Besides, what mattered was that they had a mysterious ally. He felt some measure of guilt for keeping Cowboy in the dark, but it had been necessary. He knew Solo would have argued about who was going to take the pill. Besides, the success of the plan depended on Solo's \"death\" looking convincing. Cowboy's reactions would be more authentic if he thought Illya was actually going to kill him. This plan had the double advantage of ensuring Gaby's safety and giving Solo a small chance. If help was on the way, as the note suggested, he hoped it would show up in time. If not, he would face whatever their captor's deranged mind had concocted for them. It was a risky plan, which depended on many things that he had no control over, but their situation was desperate and it was all he had. His original idea had been to beat up his partner, somehow make him swallow the pill, and \"finish him off\" with the blood choke. But as the man had insisted that he make Solo bleed, he had realized that it wouldn't be enough. Their captor wanted a real show. That's when he had decided to use the knife. Giving the pill to Solo had been easy enough. Stabbing him, not so much. Of course Illya had done it before, to incapacitate or inflict pain on an enemy while keeping them alive. The trick was to find the right spot and leave the knife in. With some practice he had become skilled at it…but doing it to his partner was a different story. This time he had been painfully aware that he had no margin for error. While the primary purpose of the knife fight had been to keep their captor entertained, his relentless attacks had also been designed to tire Solo out. After a while, he had let the American kick his Bowie knife out of his hand. He had had no further use for it. He had planned to use Solo's own, much smaller knife to stab him. But first he had had to beat him to a pulp to make sure that he would be in no condition to fight back or move around too much. Thankfully, in his weakened state, keeping Solo still had been easy and he had been able to stab him in the right spot – at least he hoped it had been the right spot. The blade had slid into his partner's body with sickening ease. Poor Cowboy had looked so surprised. Even after Illya had slashed him repeatedly with his knife and kicked the crap out of him, Solo had still trusted him. Although Illya had known that he hadn't really been betraying his partner he had felt overwhelmed with guilt when he had seen the shock and incredulity in Solo's eyes. He had considered slightly moving the knife in the wound to make Solo yelp and make the performance even more convincing and satisfying for their sadistic captor, but he just hadn't had the heart to do it. Cowboy had suffered enough. Several minutes passed in silence as he replayed the events in his mind, down on his knees, next to Solo's inanimate body. After a while, the now familiar crackling sound snapped him out of his thoughts. \"Well done, Kuryakin, and with time to spare. By the way, sorry about my delayed reaction, a small matter needed to be taken care of. One of my guards was being a little too friendly with Miss Teller and I had to chastise him. But my, oh, my, what a satisfying sequence that was. I must admit finishing with a choke was a bit too gentle for my liking but very efficient.\" Illya felt his blood boil at the mention of Gaby but he didn't acknowledge the man and kept his gaze on Solo. \"Admiring your handy work? I particularly enjoyed the stabbing part. How did it feel when the knife went in? I'm sure it can't have been easy to inflict all that pain on your own partner.\" Illya gritted his teeth. The man had a knack for rubbing salt into the wound. He wanted nothing more than to get his hands on their captor and make him regret the day he'd been born. But now was not the time for threats. Now came the dicey part of the plan. He had no way of influencing what would happen next. He hung his head down. At least, he felt so bad for hurting and stabbing Solo that he didn't even need to rely on his acting skills this time. \"He's dead. You got what you wanted. Now you let my other partner go.\" \"Yes of course, don't worry. I'm a man of my word, Kuryakin. There's just one last formality to take care of before I let Miss Teller go. Nothing really, call it a simple precaution.\" There was a brief pause – during which Illya became acutely aware of his hammering pulse – then the voice went on. \"Cut out his heart.\" Illya looked up at the speaker, hoping he had misheard. What?.. End of chapter 5 (oops I did it again… (cliffhanger))[Chapter 6] Thank you for the reviews! Here is chapter 6, and things haven't improved (yet?) sorry :) Unknown location Illya's p.o.v. Cut out his heart… Illya repeated the man's words in his mind, trying to find a different meaning he could attach to them. \"What's the matter, Kuryakin? It's not like he's going to need it anyway.\" As he listened to the cruel, taunting voice Illya couldn't help but wonder if their captor had seen through his ruse. He tried his best to maintain a calm facade. \"You said one of us had to die. I killed him. He's dead, you can come see for yourself. You got what you wanted now you let her go.\" Illya hoped that he had sounded less desperate than he felt. \"Come on, Kuryakin, don't be stubborn. I know you're capable of doing it. You've done such a good job so far. One last effort and Miss Teller will be on her way.\" Illya didn't dare move. His gaze fell on Solo's face. A bump was visible where he had hit him and there was a smear of dried blood under his left nostril. He looked convincingly dead. \"What are you waiting for?\", the man went on. \"Oh…I think I understand. Maybe you're trying to buy a little more time, in case the help you've been expecting finally arrives.\" Illya's head whipped up towards the speaker as realization dawned on him. He knows… A few seconds passed in silence then the man let out an amused sigh. \"Ah, Kuryakin. Did you really think it was going to be that easy? Who do you think put the drug and the message in your pocket?\" There was another pause as the man let what he had just said sink in. \"I wanted to give you hope. Just so that I could snuff it out. I must say that it was all very entertaining, especially when you stabbed Solo. I didn't think you would go that far.\" The man gave a soft chuckle. \"I did warn you that the winner of this little game would be the one to suffer the most. And what better way to start than with a little session of psychological torture? So here is the new deal: you cut out Solo's heart and Miss Teller leaves this place in one piece. It's really not such a bad bargain. I mean, look at him, he is completely defenseless, how hard can it be? That drug you gave him should keep him unconscious. Then again, it may not, it was never that reliable… \" Illya felt his heart sink. In retrospect, his plan seemed so stupid. How uncharacteristically foolish he had been. The man was right. He had been clinging to that hope. He had wanted to believe that there was a way out. He understood now that he had underestimated just how much of a sadist their captor was. \"Ah, now I have you cornered. Tell me, how does it feel? Are you hurting yet, Kuryakin? Don't worry, it's about to get even better. Now you know what you have to do if you want to keep Miss Teller safe.\" Illya had to resist the urge to yell. He wanted to kill that man so bad, he wanted to destroy him. But instead, he was kneeling in front of the unconscious, soon-to-be corpse of his partner. The feeling of powerlessness was almost too much to bear. A couple of minutes passed before he realized that the man had stopped talking. Then the familiar crackle of the speaker sounded again. \"I'm waiting, Kuryakin. There is no use in trying to buy time, now that you know no one is coming to rescue you. Or perhaps you're not taking my threats seriously enough. Let's give you a little incentive.\" Another pause and suddenly an image appeared on the screen embedded in the wall. It still showed Gaby tied to the chair but she was no longer alone. Their captor was standing behind her. His face was out of the frame and only his hands were visible. One hand was holding Gaby's head up, in the other – which appeared to be covered with burn scars – was a scalpel. The voice of their captor sounded again, more distant but Illya could make out every chilling word. \"I think I'm going to start with the right eye. Then, if you're still indecisive, I'll remove the other one.\" The scalpel hand suddenly moved closer to Gaby's face, the point of the blade almost touching her eye. \"Stop! I'll do it.\" The hand froze. A few seconds dragged by then finally the hands moved away from Gaby's face and disappeared as the man moved out of the frame completely. Illya just had the time to see the tears in Gaby's eyes before the screen went black again. \"Finally you're being reasonable, Kuryakin. Now get to work, you've stretched my patience far enough.\" Illya felt sick as he went to pick up the Bowie knife he had used to fight Solo earlier. He knelt down again beside his partner and started unbuttoning the unconscious American's shirt. His own hammering heart kept reminding him that, despite appearances, Cowboy's heart was still beating too. His friend was still alive and he was going to butcher him. Although he knew it was futile, considering what he was about to do, he took care not to dislodge the small knife embedded into Solo's body as he spread his shirt open. His eyes fell on the angry red slash wound on Solo's chest and he paused. Was he really going to cut his friend open and remove his heart? His gut twisted at the thought. But he didn't have any other options. He couldn't let the man torture Gaby, he had to save at least one partner if he could, and, although he hated himself for thinking that, there was a chance that Cowboy wouldn't feel anything. The knife felt heavy in his hand as he brought it close to his friend's body. Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby watched helplessly as Illya got up to pick up the knife. She didn't want to believe what she was seeing. Of course she had been terrified when the scientist had threatened to carve out her eyes, she still was. But the thought of what Illya was about to do to Solo to save her was unbearable. There had to be a way out of this nightmare. Her gaze shifted to the discarded scalpel on a table close to her. If it had been in her hand she could have used it to cut her bonds and stab her captor. But it wasn't in her hand, it was on that table, so close, but still out of reach. The tiny sliver of hope she had felt when she had realized that Napoleon was still alive had disappeared. She knew that even if the MI6 sent someone, they would never arrive in time to save Napoleon. And Illya would probably be dead too. And then, what would happen to her? Her gaze shifted back to the screen as she felt fresh tears forming in her eyes. End of chapter 6. The end is near :)[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: last time we left Illya, Napoleon and Gaby in an uncomfortable situation, hopefully things will get better in this chapter… (warning: there might be some minor angst involved…again) ;) Edit: make that 2 more chapters and the story will be complete ;) Unknown location, CIA agent's p.o.v. Things were moving too fast and he wasn't moving fast enough. The necessity for absolute silence and the pain in his chest and back were slowing him down as he crawled behind the chair and towards the table. At least he had the element of surprise on his side. The scientist wouldn't expect one of his henchmen to have been wearing a ballistic vest. Not that he ever took it off when he was on that type of assignment. He might have managed to infiltrate the organization and get close to the scientist but it hardly meant anything in this type of circles. If you weren't the boss, you were expendable to a more or less high degree. He had been lucky that the scientist wasn't a good shot. The man had aimed for the largest target both times, his chest, then his back. A more experienced shooter would probably have aimed for the head – at least for the second shot – and although the agent prided himself on his thick hair, he doubted that it would have been enough to prevent his brain from decorating the floor. The vest had saved his life, at least temporarily. He had no way of precisely assessing the damage; all he knew was that both shots had hurt like hell. The first bullet had caught him dead center in the chest and he had fallen down, completely winded by the impact. The second bullet had been fired at close range and had hit him in the back. The pain had been so intense that he had blacked out. Of course there would be some damage – a couple of broken ribs at the very least – but he couldn't concentrate on that now. He had a job to do. He needed to rescue the MI6 agents because it was what a good guy would do, and he mostly considered himself a good guy. But also because it was the only chance he had of getting out of there alive. From what he had gathered after he regained consciousness, all three agents were alive, even Solo who had been fed one of those damn make-you-look-dead pills. He had never understood how anyone could rely on those. Sure they made you appear dead – and it was pretty convincing – but they also made you unconscious and completely vulnerable. And then what if your enemy decided to shoot you in the face? Or forced your partner to carve your ticker out of your chest? Damn, I wouldn't want to be in Kuryakin's shoes right now… Not that he was particularly glad to be in his own shoes either. He had briefly considered trying to take the scientist down when he had stepped behind the chair to threaten Miss Teller with the scalpel. But in his condition, he wasn't sure that he would have had the upper hand in a fight. Hell, he wasn't even sure he could stand up. So he had decided to focus his efforts on freeing the girl instead. And for that he needed the shiny little piece of surgical steel on that bloody Mount Everest of a table. He shot a glance at the screen. Kuryakin had picked up a large knife and was back at Solo's side. He didn't have much time left to make his move. Dammit, I'm not paid enough for this bullshit… He resumed his painful, silent crawling and finally reached the table. He bit back a groan of pain as he pushed himself up onto his hands and knees. He risked a glance at the scientist. The man was completely absorbed with what was going on on the screen. The agent felt a small measure of relief as he closed his hand around the scalpel. Now he needed to cut Miss Teller's bonds. Please don't scream… He glanced at the scientist again. A cry, even muffled by the tape might attract the man's attention and he wasn't exactly eager to take a third bullet. Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Unable to bear the situation any longer, Gaby suddenly decided to act. She had to get her hands on that scalpel on the table. She kept her eyes on the scientist's back a while longer. He was enjoying his sick revenge and wasn't paying attention to her at all. He hadn't lied when he had said that he wasn't particularly interested in her and she was going to use that to her advantage. An embryo of a plan started to form in her mind. Her ankles were bound but she might still be able to rock her body and use her feet to move the chair closer to the table, little by little. It was a terrible plan and she knew it. But she needed to do something, anything. And even if she failed, it might at least attract the scientist's attention and stop what was happening on the screen. Ready to make her move, she let her gaze shift to her target and her heart missed a beat. The scalpel was gone. Then she felt something tug at her ankles from behind the chair and she barely suppressed a cry of surprise. She strained her neck to identify the source of the tugging and there was the late Mr. CIA agent, definitely not as dead as before but not looking extremely alive either. He put a finger to his lips and showed her the scalpel. Only then did Gaby realize that her ankles were no longer bound. Unknown location, Illya's p.o.v. Knife in hand, bent over the body of his partner, Illya hesitated. He was tempted to kill Solo by driving the knife through his heart, or breaking his neck, or anything relatively quick that wouldn't involve slicing him open and rummaging around in his chest to remove his heart. Their captor would probably still want him to butcher his friend's corpse but at least Solo would already be dead. He realized his attitude must have given his thoughts away as the voice sounded again. \"I know what you're thinking, Kuryakin! No cheating or you know what will happen to Miss Teller's pretty eyes. Besides, it won't be as much fun if Solo is already dead when you cut him open. No, no, I want him to be alive. Perhaps if you're dexterous enough you will be able to feel his still beating heart inside your hand. Wouldn't that be exciting, Kuryakin?\" Illya winced. He knew that the sole purpose of the man's words was to torment him and that he shouldn't react, still the thought made his stomach churn. He hoped that the drug would be strong enough to keep Solo unconscious. He kept his free hand firmly on the American's upper chest, in case he regained consciousness and Illya needed to hold him down. He could hardly feel Solo's heartbeat under his palm but the fact that he was still able to detect something was probably a sign that the effects of the drug were beginning to wear off. He needed to hurry. Unknown location, CIA agent's p.o.v. The second phase of the agent's plan was going smoothly enough – no scream, and no third bullet. He had already cut the bonds around Miss Teller's ankles and was now slicing through the ones around her right forearm. While he worked he kept glancing at the scientist to make sure that he was still too busy to pay attention to them. The freak was torturing Kuryakin with the gruesome notion that he might be able to hold his partner's beating heart in his hand. That scientist guy really was one seriously sick bastard. Okay, the man blamed Solo and Kuryakin for the loss of his life's work and sure, he understood how being turned into a piece of well-done steak could piss someone off, but this was pure sadism. Once he had freed the girl's right arm, he handed her the scalpel; she would work faster and he didn't want to move more than was necessary. He felt guilty that he couldn't do more to help her but, after all, she was a trained agent, so presumably she could take care of herself. He let out an inward sigh of relief as the surgical steel easily cut through the last bonds. Well done, now go ahead and take this bastard down…wait…what is she doing? Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Finally freed from her bonds, Gaby felt renewed hope bloom within her but she also knew that there was no time to waste if she wanted to save Napoleon. She was now in full agent mode and a mental checklist spontaneously popped up in her mind. One: find an efficient weapon. True, she had the scalpel and her original idea had been to try and stab the scientist, but she wasn't as skilled as Illya when it came to knives and the blade was rather small so it would require more skill to do serious damage. She needed something bigger, something heavy that she could hit him with. She thought for a second then she got up, and, as silently as she could, grabbed the chair she had been tied to – all the while ignoring the disbelieving look on the CIA agent's face. Two: sneak up on her captor. Thankfully, the man was still busy tormenting Illya and his loud, taunting voice would cover her approach. Three: smash the chair down on that freak's head. Four: he's down but still moving, hit him again. Five: and hit him a third time, for good measure. Unknown location, Illya's p.o.v. Illya tried to focus on keeping his hand steady as he brought the knife down. He placed the blade against his partner's skin and tentatively drove the tip into his flesh. Solo didn't stir. Illya pushed the blade slightly deeper and made a small, hesitant incision. Still no reaction from his partner. He suddenly became aware that his free hand had been pressing down on the American chest much harder than he had intended. Not that it really mattered now. Still he forced himself to relieve the pressure as he glanced guiltily at Solo's face. He let his eyes linger on his partner's lifeless features for a second. I'm sorry, Cowboy… Then he quickly looked away and took a deep breath as he prepared to push the knife in deeper and lengthen the incision. Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Satisfied that the scientist was no longer moving, Gaby dropped the chair and looked up at the screen, hoping she wasn't too late. What she saw filled her with dread. No…please, no… She tripped over the scientist's body as she hurriedly stepped closer to the control panel. She fumbled with the switch, finally managed to activate the microphone and started shouting. Much to her dismay, only a muffled, incomprehensible sound came out of her mouth. Cursing inwardly, she ripped off the piece of tape still covering her mouth and resumed her shouting. Unknown location, Illya's p.o.v. \"Illya no! Stop!\" Illya had frozen mid-gesture as soon as he had heard the weird muffled sound come out of the speaker. Now he recognized Gaby's voice. What was going on? Was it another of his captor's tricks designed to torture him? Uncertain what to do, he didn't dare move. The tip of his knife was still embedded in Solo's body and he could see it shake inside the small wound, in unison with his hand. Gaby's voice sounded again, more composed this time. \"Illya it's over, I'm safe now. Please trust me and just drop the knife.\" It didn't make any sense. He didn't understand how she could be safe. But he wanted to trust her. He carefully pulled the blade out of Solo's body, sat back, opened his trembling hand and let the knife clatter to the floor. He suddenly felt drained and had to fight back a rising wave of nausea. He had been so close to doing it. He forced himself to look at the incision. The wound was small and not very deep, but of course it was bleeding. Illya retrieved the knife and cut a piece of his partner's shirt which he balled up and pressed against the wound. That simple task, the feeling under his palm of Solo's heartbeat progressively returning to normal, and Gaby's soothing voice helped him relax slightly and he allowed himself to feel some measure of relief. He would deal with the guilt later. End of chapter 7. One more chapter left and the story is complete :) (oh, and I forgot to say thanks for the reviews)[Chapter 8] Chapter 8. This one's a long one. I hope you'll enjoy it :) Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby watched as Illya used Napoleon's belt to secure the balled up piece of shirt tightly against the wound. Illya didn't seem too worried about the bleeding. Thankfully, the cut he had made wasn't too deep. The first stab wound was still plugged by the knife and the bleeding was minimal. Still Illya had also taken the time to dress it as best as he could. The fact that Napoleon was still unconscious didn't seem to worry Illya too much either; he had told her that the effects of the drug could last longer depending on the individual. Apparently Napoleon's pulse was back to normal and Illya had added that Solo was still unconscious because he was a fragile American. Gaby felt as if her every breath was a sigh of relief, it had been a close call. Of course, Napoleon would need medical attention soon but at least he wasn't in immediate danger. Still she was anxious for him to regain consciousness, his impression of a corpse was a little too convincing. A few minutes earlier Illya and her had discussed what they should do next. Their unexpected ally from the CIA had used a portable radio communication device to contact his superiors who had, in turn, contacted the MI6. Hopefully help was coming but they had agreed that contacting Waverly themselves might speed things up. The plan was to find a way to free Illya and use the radio transmitter to contact their boss. After a quick inspection of the control panel, Gaby had found the switch which controlled the opening and closing of the only way out of the room Illya and Napoleon were in. Illya had insisted that he wanted her to stay in the control room. According to him, the chances of them being spotted by guards would be doubled if they were both roaming the building. Gaby had almost protested but she knew he would have used any pretext he could find to keep her away from danger. Besides, mister CIA-guy looked like he wasn't in the best shape and she wanted to have a look at where he had been shot and see if there was anything she could do to help him. The man deserved it. If it hadn't been for him, her partners would have died and who knows what would have happened to her. Thanks to his knowledge of the building, the agent had even been able to provide Illya with directions to find the radio transmitter and reach the control room as well as information on the number of guards and how to avoid them. The other reason that had convinced her to stay put was that Napoleon would be left alone and she wanted to be able to keep an eye on him and talk to him if he woke up. She would lock the door again once Illya was out; that way she would be sure that no one could get in and harm Napoleon. Once he was done dressing Solo's wounds, Illya got to his feet. Gaby saw him pick up the knife and he turned towards the camera. He was ready. She stared at his black and white image on the screen. His blond hair was damp with sweat and sticking to his forehead, he had a smear of Napoleon's blood on his face, where he had absentmindedly scratched his cheek. He looked tired. Her eyes shifted to the knife in his hand and she thought about the guns the guards would certainly be carrying. \"Please don't get yourself killed.\" Gaby cringed inwardly, she had definitely sounded more emotional than she had intended. She almost welcomed Illya's frown and irritated tone. \"I know my job.\" \"Just be careful, okay?\" His frown lessened slightly. He looked straight into the camera and nodded. A few seconds later, he had disappeared through the opening at the back of the room. Gaby sighed as she engaged the locking mechanism of the door. She could tell Illya was shaken. She had noticed the way he avoided looking at Napoleon's face when he was taking care of his wounds. She could tell he was angry too, and it worried her. She knew how unpredictable and impulsive Illya could be when he was angry. The CIA agent's voice snapped her out of her thoughts. \"Sorry I can't be more helpful, but I think your Russian friend has a better chance than me of reaching the radio room quickly and without attracting the guards' attention.\" She turned to look at him. He was sitting up against the wall to the left of the control panel. It struck her how different he seemed now from her first impression of him. Then again, he did undercover work, deceiving appearances were part of his job. Stripped of his cover he seemed to be a rather nice guy. \"You've been extremely helpful already, you deserve to rest for a while. I'm sure my partner will be fine.\", she answered with a comforting smile. He'd better be… The agent tried to adjust his position and hissed in pain as his back rubbed against one of the pipes running along the wall. Gaby sighed again, she should really be having a look at the man's injuries. Her eyes fell on the scientist's gun which she had set down on the control panel earlier. Or maybe I should go find Illya. He doesn't have a gun and he might need one… The agent's voice jerked her out of her thoughts again, but this time it was considerably louder and more urgent. Unfortunately, the warning came too late. She cried out in surprise as she felt something grab her legs and pull violently. Just as she was losing her balance and going down, she understood what was happening. I didn't hit hard enough… Gaby fell hard, banging her elbow against the floor. Before she could get up, a hand grabbed her by the hair, pulled her to her feet and roughly pushed her toward the center of the room. She immediately spun around and found herself face to face with the scientist. He was still bleeding from a gash on his scalp and a couple of bumps had sprouted on his head, including a particularly spectacular one with a tuft of hair on top which looked like a palm tree on a desert island. He had the gun in his hand. \"Surprised, Miss Teller? Don't beat yourself up, you did hit me pretty hard, even managed to knock me out. Good thing I have a hard head.\" She was surprised indeed, and he definitely had an incredibly hard head. She had been sure that she had hit him with enough force to crack his skull. He motioned for her to move closer to the wall against which the CIA agent was sitting up. \"That way I'll be able to keep an eye on you both. I don't want anyone sneaking up on me, this time.\" Without turning around, the scientist stepped backwards until he reached the control panel, He flicked a switch and Gaby heard the distant wail of an alarm. Then he pressed a button, activated the microphone and spoke calmly, his eyes never leaving Gaby's face. \"Kuryakin has escaped, find him and bring him to me. You may rough him up a little but I want him alive. He still has some unfinished business he needs to attend to.\" He switched off the microphone, glanced at the screen and smiled. \"I see Kuryakin took the time to dress his partner's wounds. Good thing Solo hasn't bled out, we'll be able to pick up where we left off once my men find Kuryakin. And once that's taken care of, I will kill you, Miss Teller. Right in front of Kuryakin. What? You didn't think I was going to let you go free after your little stunt, did you?\" Gaby glared at him. What had she been thinking. She should have slit the man's throat with the scalpel while he was unconscious. She had been too preoccupied with Napoleon's fate, then too busy talking to Illya. Still aiming the gun at them, the scientist walked over to a small cabinet, opened a drawer and pulled out two pairs of handcuffs which he tossed toward Gaby. \"Since we don't want any more hmm…accidents, I'll let you cuff your new friend to that pipe above his head, then you will cuff yourself to that other pipe right here.\" With no other choice but to comply, Gaby picked up the handcuffs and walked over to the CIA agent. He couldn't suppress a gasp of pain as she raised his arms above his head to wrap the cuffs around the pipe and clip the second cuff around his wrist. Then she cuffed herself to a length of pipe to the right of the agent. The scientist stepped closer to her, dragging the chair behind him. He checked her cuffs, making sure they were tight enough and pushed the chair against the back of her legs, forcing her to sit down. \"Make yourself comfortable, Miss Teller. You won't be going anywhere.\" He went to check the CIA agent's handcuffs. Then, he stepped back, apparently satisfied, and gave an exaggerated sigh. \"Now\", he said, looking down at the CIA agent. \"I think there are some things we need to discuss, young man.\" Unknown location, Illya's p.o.v. Illya was lost, and very much pissed off. Everything had been going relatively well until he had reached the stairs leading to the room where the radio transmitter was hidden. Thanks to the information provided by the American, he had managed to move quickly without encountering any guards. Then all hell had broken loose. The sudden, deafening blare of an alarm had almost made him jump out of his skin. A few seconds later he had heard shouts and footsteps coming his way and had had no choice but to turn back and try to get as far as he could from the guards. After several minutes of half-crouched running and silent cursing, he had stopped to assess the situation. Someone had activated the alarm, which meant that someone knew he had escaped. And if that someone knew he had escaped, it meant that they had been or still were in the control room. Precisely where he had told Gaby to stay because he had thought she would be safer there. Good thinking, Illya… He needed to get to the control room, and fast. The problem was that he had no idea how to get there. The convoluted detour he had made to escape the guards had caused him to lose his bearings. He had tried to trace his steps back but couldn't seem to find the damn stairs from which he had started. He had been wandering for a few minutes when he started hearing footsteps again. Running footsteps. Someone knew he was there. As silently as he could he turned the corner of the corridor and flattened himself against the wall. He waited, willing his hammering heart to quiet down. The footsteps stopped abruptly and he heard the sound of a door opening and slamming shut almost immediately after. Hesitantly, Illya left his hiding spot. Judging by the footsteps he had heard, it had been just one man. Maybe he could overpower him and get his hands on a gun. He stepped back into the corridor and carefully approached the only door. Slowly, he pressed down on the handle and cracked the door open. He risked a glance inside and almost smiled. He was looking at a restroom. That explained the running footsteps. He could hear the man relieving himself at the back of the room. Getting his hands on that gun was going to be easier than he had expected. Illya took one last glance over his shoulder to check that no one was coming from the other side of the corridor…and found himself looking at the butt of a handgun. He didn't even have time to see his opponent before the butt of the gun smashed into the side of his head. The blow wasn't strong enough to crack his skull but still enough to stun him. Staggering away from the door, he didn't even see the second blow coming. This time he fell to his knees, awkwardly raising his hands to protect his head. He felt a knee driven into his back and he toppled forward. His attacker used his weight to pin him down and pulled his arms behind his back, first the right arm, then the left one. Illya's hazy thoughts suddenly cleared as he heard the distinctive clicking sound and felt the metal around his wrists. Handcuffs. The pressure on his back disappeared and he was able to roll to a sitting position. The guard, who looked almost as tall as him and slightly bigger, had his gun pointed at Illya's face. \"Get up, Kuryakin, someone's expecting you.\" As Illya awkwardly got to his feet, the meaning of the guard's words sunk in. Their captor was still alive. He was the one who had activated the alarm. And Gaby was with him. The guard grabbed him by the elbow and shoved him forward. As Illya started walking, he contemplated the irony of the situation. The man was probably taking him to the very room he had been looking for. The only problem was that his hands were cuffed behind his back and he had a gun pointed at the back of his head. All that because he had been too distracted by the sound of someone emptying their bladder. He could think of more glorious ways of getting caught. Barely managing to bottle up his frustration and anger, he started thinking of a way to get rid of his close escort once the man had guided him where he wanted to be. His head was throbbing where he had been hit and he had to make an extra effort to concentrate. At least the alarm had stopped blaring. Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. \"Sorry, will you excuse me one second?\" Gaby watched as the scientist walked over to the control panel and switched off the alarm. \"It gets on my nerves after a while.\", he said, winking at her. Then he returned his attention to the CIA agent. \"So, tell me. Who are you? Actually no, no don't tell me, let me guess. It's more fun that way and it will pass the time until Kuryakin gets here.\" Gaby felt her pulse speed up. She didn't like the cruel smile on the man's face and the way he was looking at the agent. \"Since you're helping them I assume you must be one of them, but Miss Teller didn't recognize you so you don't work with her, and you're clearly American. Maybe CIA then. I know they've always been interested in my work. And to think I would never have suspected you if you hadn't decided to get involved and spoil my fun. But tell me, am I on the right track so far?\" The agent stared at him defiantly and remained silent. It didn't seem to bother the scientist who went on. \"And since you're still alive after taking a bullet in the chest that had to be close to your heart and another bullet at close range in the back, my guess is that you're wearing a bulletproof vest. Am I right?\" Again, the agent remained silent. \" You're not very talkative. Too bad, I'm just going to have to test my theory then.\" As he uttered these words, the scientist took a couple of steps back. Then he brought the gun up and shot the CIA agent in the chest. Gaby flinched as the gun went off. The agent let out a weird strangled sound as the bullet hit him, then he started gasping for breath. \"I heard it feels like getting punched by a heavyweight boxing champion or being hit with a baseball bat. What do you think?\" Still getting no answer from the gasping agent, the scientist turned to Gaby and smiled. \"I suppose he hasn't made up his mind yet.\" Then he shifted his aim slightly to the right of the agent's chest and shot him again. This time he was rewarded with a cry of pain. \"Ooo, that really hurt, didn't it? Are you sure you still don't want to answer me? It would be a shame if I had to shoot you again in the exact same spot\", the scientist said as he brought the gun up a third time. \"Yes…it hurts…\", the agent answered between gasps. As she heard the pain in the agent's voice, Gaby couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt. She felt partly responsible for what was happening to him and she desperately wanted to help him but she new nothing she could say would stop the sadistic monster. \"I bet it hurts\", the scientist went on. \"You probably have a couple of broken ribs and possible internal bleeding. But I think we can do even better than that. Let's see what happens if I shoot you where you're not wearing any bulletproof clothing.\" Gaby saw the CIA agent's eyes widen in fear and follow the barrel of the gun as it shifted toward his right leg. \"No!\" Just as she shouted, the gun went off. The agent let out a sharp scream and his face contorted in a grimace of pain. Gaby noticed his cuffed hands were balled up so tight that his knuckles were white. Her eyes shifted to his leg where a small bloodstain was slowly growing larger. Please Illya, get us out of here… Unknown location, Illya's p.o.v. They had only been walking for a few minutes when Illya spotted the staircase he had been looking for. The guard pushed him up the steps and down a corridor. Thanks to the CIA guy's directions, Illya knew where he was, getting to the control room from there would be easy. But first he needed to get rid of the guard. Halfway across the corridor he abruptly stopped walking. He felt the gun bump slightly against the back of his head as the surprised guard failed to stop in time. Perfect. Now he knew exactly where the gun was and he could deduce the position of the guard and the distance that separated them. He ducked and moved his head to the side so that the hand holding the gun would rest on his shoulder and at the same time he thrust his heel as hard as he could into what he estimated to be the guard's groin. His foot connected with something and Illya heard a strangled gasp. Good. The gun clattered to the floor. Even better. Illya spun around. The man was still standing but he was too busy making sure that everything was still intact to pay attention to him. Illya closed the distance between them and headbutted the guard in the nose. The man's hands flew to his face and Illya seized the opportunity to ram a knee into his gut. This time the big guard fell to his hands and knees, gasping for breath. Illya didn't waste any time, he knelt down in front of the man, pushed his knee against the guard's left shoulder and slid his opposite heel behind the guard's right armpit until his knee and heel connected. Then he let himself fall forward, putting all his weight on the guard, until the man lay flat on his belly. At the same time he slipped his right foot into the hollow of his left knee, trapping the guard's right arm and neck between his legs. It definitely wasn't his favorite version of this choke but with his hands cuffed behind his back it was the best he could do. He tightened the choke, compressing the guard's carotid arteries and waited. It didn't take long before the man lost consciousness. Illya didn't let go. He wasn't taking any chances. After a couple of minutes, he finally let go of the guard's limp body. He quickly searched the man's pockets – as quickly as his cuffed hands allowed him to – and found the key to open the handcuffs. Unfortunately the guard had cuffed him in such a way that the locks were facing up. Even Cowboy couldn't have picked those open. Illya cursed softly. How was he supposed to use a gun or a knife with his hands cuffed behind his back? He knew he wasn't flexible enough to slide his hands under his butt and bring the handcuffs to the front. He tried it anyway but only managed to lose his balance and hurt his shoulder. He stood up, extremely annoyed and slightly embarassed, thankfully, no one had been there to witness his ridiculous acrobatics. He took the handcuffs key with him; Gaby might be able to free him if he got to her in time. Thinking about Gaby reminded him that he had no time to waste. As he hurried toward the control room he heard what sounded like a gunshot. He finally reached the short corridor leading to the room, and heard another gunshot. And a loud scream of pain. A man's voice. At least it's not Gaby… He quickly walked to the door and, straining his shoulders, managed to use his hands to press down on the handle. Thankfully the door didn't make any noise as he cracked it open. He let go of the handle and took a look inside. A man was standing with his back to him and had a gun in his hand. Judging by the burn scars, he was looking at their captor. Gaby was sitting on a chair. She was cuffed to a length of pipe but looked unharmed. A man was slumped against the wall with his hands also cuffed to a pipe above his head. Probably the CIA agent. He looked like he had been tortured and he was bleeding from a hole in his leg. \"I bet you're really starting to regret helping your fellow agents. Tell me, was it worth it?\" Illya recognized the cruel, taunting voice instantly. He felt his blood boil as he watched the man with the gun move closer to the CIA agent and viciously step on the gunshot wound in his leg. Sadistic bastard… Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby averted her gaze, unable to watch as the scientist started crushing the agent's wounded leg with his foot. The poor man's screams were enough to make her feel sick. She desperately wanted to get out of this room. Her eyes shifted to the door and her heart missed a beat. Illya..? Her partner was standing silently behind the slightly ajar door and was looking straight at her. A wave of relief washed over her. Illya was alive. Illya had managed to escape the guards. Illya would get them out of this nightmare. He motioned with his head toward the scientist who was taking a break from his torture session to taunt the CIA agent. Gaby understood immediately what her partner had in mind. Of course, he would need a diversion. She took a deep breath and started sobbing. Her plan was to make as much noise as possible and monopolize the scientist's attention to allow Illya to sneak up on him. As her sobbing grew in intensity, she decided to add a touch of authenticity by loudly imploring her captor to stop torturing the agent. The scientist turned his attention to her. It was working. He smiled. His hideous, cruel, lopsided smile. \"You know what, I think you're right, Miss Teller. The poor young man is in terrible pain. Maybe it's time to end his suffering. After all, I don't really need him when I have you and you partners to play with.\" He winked at her and placed the barrel of the gun against the agent's forehead. End of chapter 8. (as always thanks for the reviews :) )[Chapter 9] Chapter 9. Thanks for the reviews on chapter 8! The story is not complete yet, there will be one more chapter. This one was fun to write (I sometimes act out some of the action/fight scenes to make sure it works :) ). I hope you like it. Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby felt her heart sink. It wasn't exactly the kind of diversion she had been hoping for. Still determined to cover Illya's approach, she let out a particularly high-pitched sob that surprised even her. The scientist laughed. \"Now, now, no need to get hysterical, Miss Teller. He'll hardly feel a thing.\" Gaby risked a furtive glance at Illya. He was now inside the room and slowly closing the distance between him and the scientist. Something was odd, though. Why was he keeping his hands behind his back? It looked like he was about to surprise the scientist with a bouquet of flowers. Her captor gave a theatrical sigh and went on. \"Would it make you feel better if I asked him for his opinion?\" He put the barrel of the gun under the agent's chin and used it to tip his head up. \"So, tell me, young man, would you rather end it now, or experience more of this?\" As he uttered those last words, he stomped on the poor man's wounded leg, causing him to yelp loudly. \"Hmm, you're going to have to be a little more articulate than that.\" His only answer was the sound of the agent's jerky breathing. \"I see. You're leaving it up to me. That's settled, then.\", the scientist said, bringing the gun back up against the agent's forehead. Come on Illya, now!.. The gun went off. Unknown location, Illya's p.o.v. Illya cursed inwardly. He had thought he would have more time to plan his move. Sneaking up behind an armed man without attracting his attention was already tricky, and now he had to do it fast enough to make sure the American agent didn't repaint the wall with his American brains. Their captor's sick little game of \"would you rather\" had bought him some time but he had only covered half the distance and the bastard was about to open the agent's third eye with a bullet. Illya hesitated for a fraction of a second. He would only have one shot at this. He needed to take the man down in one move. He stepped slightly to the left so that he would hit the man diagonally and throw off his aim to the right – away from Gaby. Then he started running. He barreled into the man shoulder first just as the gun was going off. The bullet hit the wall to the right of the agent's head. The poor man's life had probably flashed before his eyes, but at least it hadn't ended. The tricky part of the plan had gone relatively well, now came the much trickier part: fighting an armed opponent with his hands cuffed behind his back. As Illya landed awkwardly, he felt something dig into his stomach. The knife. He remembered he had slipped it into his waistband when he had been escaping the guards. Unfortunately it didn't make much difference. With his hands cuffed there was no way he could reach it. Thankfully, the man had gone down and dropped the gun when he had crashed into him but when Illya tried to pin him down, his opponent escaped him with surprising agility and kicked him in the face. Without his hands to protect himself, Illya took the full force of the kick and pain blinded him for a second. The man seized the opportunity to get up and retrieve the gun. Aware of the danger, Illya got to his feet as quickly as he could. But not quickly enough. Just as he was standing up, ready to lunge at his opponent, he saw the gun trained on his chest. Too late… He heard Gaby scream and flinched as the man pulled the trigger, expecting to feel the bullet rip through his flesh. But the gun clicked empty. Their captor had probably used up his last rounds torturing the CIA agent. Illya noisily released the breath he'd been holding, his heart hammering madly, as if applauding this happy turn of events. His relief was short lived though as the man ejected the empty magazine and started reaching into an inside pocket. I don't think so… Illya delivered a brutal kick which sent the gun flying. Then he charged straight at his opponent. The man fell backwards and Illya attempted to pin him down with his body, fully intending to head-butt him to death. But the man let out a howl of rage and immediately tried to claw at his eyes. Once again unable to protect his face, Illya leaned back to escape the man's clawing hands. The bottom of his shirt lifted slightly, revealing the handle of the knife, right in front of his opponent's eyes. With disconcerting speed, the man pulled the knife free and slashed sideways. Illya barely had the time to throw himself backwards and the blade grazed his chin instead of slashing his throat. He tried to spread his arms out to restore his balance but of course, the handcuffs wouldn't let him. He rolled uselessly onto his back and gasped as his opponent pounced on him, driving both knees into his gut. The man really was surprisingly faster and stronger than he looked. And now he had a knife. As Illya attempted to wiggle free, his opponent placed a firm hand on his chest, painfully digging his fingers into his sternum, transferring his weight onto Illya's upper body to limit his movements. Illya gritted his teeth as he felt his cuffed hands being crushed under him. \"It's a shame I didn't get to watch you cut out Solo's heart… But I'll take great pleasure in ripping yours out.\", the man said, slowly raising the knife. Not good… Illya let out an involuntary wheezing sound; it was becoming hard to breathe with the man's weight pushing down on his chest. Fortunately, because the man was applying most of his weight on Illya's torso, he was neglecting his legs. It was all Illya had left and he was going to use them. He managed to pull his left leg free and used it to push against his opponent's knee, breaking his balance and causing him to fall forward – thankfully, the man held his right hand out to catch himself, dropping the knife as he went down. Illya trapped the man's other leg with his own, then he bridged up, pushing hard on his left leg, rotating his opponent over and away from the knife. Wary of the man's fast reflexes, Illya wasted no time and head-butted him hard, thinking at the same time that he would be lucky if he didn't end up with a concussion. Then he sprang to his feet, just as the dazed man was attempting to sit up. He hurriedly stepped around his recovering opponent and, standing with his back to him, he squatted down and quickly slipped his cuffed hands over the man's head, bringing the short chain under his chin, around his throat like a garrote. Then he straightened his legs, dragging the man up with him and pulling hard with his arms to compress his opponent's trachea. The man started making loud choking noises and clawed brutally at Illya's hands, trying at the same time to relieve the pressure on his windpipe by pushing himself up with his feet. Cursing, Illya took a few steps to keep his opponent off balance and pulled even harder, bending forward. The muscles of his shoulders were screaming and his wrists were starting to feel numb. This bastard just won't die... Finally, the choking noises stopped and Illya felt the man's body go slack. He didn't let go and, grunting from the pain in his shoulders, pulled hard one last time until he felt something give inside the man's throat. Only then did he let the body drop to the floor. Breathing hard, his heart pounding, he turned to look at his dead opponent. It was the first opportunity he had to have a good look at the man since he had entered the room. He thought he vaguely recognized the man from a previous mission. Some crazy scientist, if he remembered correctly. It was hard to be sure with all the burn scars, though. He stepped away from the body and looked up at Gaby. \"Are you okay?\", he asked, still trying to catch his breath. She was silently staring at him, her eyes wide, incredulous. After a few seconds, she finally spoke. \"You have your hands cuffed behind your back.\" Illya opened his mouth to answer but a groan of pain coming from the CIA agent reminded him that the poor man still had a hole in his leg and was probably going to bleed out. Straining his shoulders, he retrieved the handcuff key from his pocket and handed it to Gaby, turning his back to her so that she could uncuff him. Once they were both free, Illya rushed to the CIA agent's side and started unbuttoning his shirt as Gaby unlocked his cuffs. He took a look at the man's leg wound, it was still bleeding but there was no spurting and the blood flow was slow. Good. That meant no arterial bleeding. With Gaby's help he removed the agent's shirt, frowning as he noticed the bullet impacts on the man's ballistic vest. He balled up the shirt and handed it to Gaby who pressed it firmly against the agent's leg. The man gasped and jerked. Illya put a hand on his shoulder to still him. Judging by the impacts on the man's vest, the next step was going to be even more painful for him. \"I need to remove the vest. Try not to move.\", Illya said softly. After a couple of painful minutes, the vest was off and Illya gently helped the agent lean back against the wall. He took a look at the man's torso and he and Gaby exchanged a concerned glance. The CIA agent's chest was swollen and covered in impressive bruises, a thin trickle of blood was slowly running from a shallow circular hole just above his right nipple. The small wound on the man's chest, suddenly reminded Illya of what he had almost done to his partner earlier. He pushed the thought to the back of his mind and looked up at the injured man's face. \"It does not look good.\" \"That's a little harsh… I exercise daily…\", the agent answered weakly, his mouth curling up into a boyish smile. Illya rolled his eyes. Cowboy would probably get along well with this guy… Again, he pushed the thought aside and started feeling along the agent's ribs as gently as he could. As he pressed his fingers against a particularly swollen area, the agent cried out. His cry turned into a coughing fit and Illya frowned as he saw droplets of bright red blood drip onto the man's chin. He checked the agent's pulse and his frown deepened. \"Give me the good news first.\", the man said with a weak smile. Illya sighed. It looked like they weren't going to get any spontaneous help from the MI6 and even if he managed to contact Waverly and his boss agreed to send a rescue team with medical help, they would never arrive in time. The agent was probably going to die. \"The bullet in your leg missed the artery and the bleeding is not too severe. But you seem to have several badly broken ribs and you're bleeding internally. I can't do anything about the internal bleeding. Without quick medical treatment, you're going to die.\" The agent glanced at Gaby. \"Is he always that cheerful?\" Unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby kept nervously chewing her bottom lip as she finished wrapping and securing the shirt around the CIA guy's leg. Illya was busy retrieving the gun and looking for spare magazines on the scientist's body and in the cabinets. She looked up at the agent. Illya was right. He really didn't look well. His face was covered with a sheen of sweat and his breathing was rapid and shallow. After a couple of minutes, Illya was back with the gun loaded and a spare magazine, ready to go find the radio transmitter and attempt to contact Waverly. He motioned for Gaby to stand up and led her away from the agent. \"It's time to go.\", he said, keeping his voice low. \"I'm staying here.\", Gaby answered, pointing at the injured man. \"Someone needs to stay with him. And keep an eye on Sleeping Beauty-Solo.\" She saw Illya's blue eyes narrow in frustration and shift to the CIA agent. \"He's not going to make it. Nothing you can do to help him.\", he said, his Russian accent becoming slightly thicker as he grew impatient. \"At least he won't die alone. And what about Solo?\" Gaby noticed that Illya avoided her gaze every time she mentioned Napoleon. \"Solo will be fine. The door is locked. No one can get to him. But the door to this room can't be locked and the guards who are still looking for me will come here to report back to their boss at some point. And you have no weapon.\" She said nothing and stared at him challengingly for a few seconds. \"Fine.\", he growled. \"Wait here.\" Cursing under his breath, he exited the room before Gaby could ask for an explanation. A few minutes later he was back. With two guns. \"Got it from the guard who handcuffed me. They haven't found his body yet.\", he explained, placing the guard's gun into Gaby's hand. As he turned to leave, Gaby caught him by the forearm and gave it a slight squeeze, hoping he understood the message. Hurry up and don't get in trouble… She closed the door behind him and walked over to the scientist's body. He had already come back from the dead once and she wanted to make sure it wouldn't happen again. One look into the sightless eyes reassured her, Illya had definitely been more thorough than her. She returned to the agent's side and started using her sleeve to gently wipe the sweat from his face. She knew it was useless but she needed to keep her hands busy. They sat in silence for a while, lost in their respective thoughts, when suddenly, the agent's shaky voice brought Gaby back to reality. \"Your partner's awake…\" He was right. On the screen she could see that Napoleon's eyes were open and scanning the room. She rushed to the control panel to activate the microphone just as her partner attempted to lift his head and began to groan in pain. \"Solo! It's Gaby! You're injured, try not to move.\" \"Gaby…\" She noticed the weird way he was uttering her name, as if he was trying to decide whether he liked it or not. Illya had warned her that he might be slightly confused from the drug when he regained consciousness. \"Everything hurts…\", he said, his face screwed up in pain. \"Feels like I got hit by a train.\" \"The Moscow express, to be more precise.\" \"What…?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Gaby?\" He sounded distressed now. \"What's wrong, Solo?\" \"Where is my shirt?\" \"Illya used it to dress your wounds.\" \"Where is Illya?\" \"He's trying to contact Waverly to ask for a rescue team.\" \"He stabbed me…\" \"I know, it was a bit over the top… Don't touch the knife!\" She let out a sharp breath of relief as Napoleon's hand, which had started to reach for the knife handle, dropped back to the floor. At that moment the CIA agent was seized by a violent coughing fit. As she turned to him he gave her a weak thumbs up and mouthed: \"I'm fine\". Her eyes lingered on the fresh bright red droplets on his chin before she turned her attention back to the screen. \"Just lie still, try to relax, Solo. Help will be here soon, hopefully\" \"Gaby?\" She sighed. Woozy Solo was just as talkative as regular Solo. \"What?\" \"Your eyes are pretty…\" \"Thank you.\" \"And Illya's eyes are beautiful, too. I think your eyes should go on a date…\" Gaby frowned and, much to her annoyance, she felt herself blushing. Thankfully, she had her back turned to the CIA guy. \" He might feel a little woozy\", yeah right… Just as she was starting to wonder exactly what kind of drug Illya had given to Napoleon she heard distant shouting and gunshots. She grabbed the gun and exchanged a tense look with the CIA agent. Now she could hear footsteps in the corridor. She got up and trained the gun on the door. She kept her finger off the trigger, aware that the person outside might be Illya. The door opened slowly and she breathed a sigh of relief as she glimpsed a frowning face topped with messy light hair. His frown cleared as he saw that she was safe. \"What's going on out there?\", Gaby asked. \"I heard gunshots. Did you manage to contact Waverly?\" \"I didn't have to. Rescue team is here.\", Illya replied. He turned toward the CIA agent, a hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his lips. \"You might survive, after all.\" Gaby felt so relieved that she almost forgot to tell Illya about Napoleon. \"By the way, Solo's awake.\" His smile disappeared and she saw him shoot a furtive glance at the screen. He looked uneasy. \"Good.\", he muttered before he started heading for the door. \"Wait! \"good\"? That's it? And where are you going?\" \"I need to help the others and guide the medical team.\", he replied hurriedly as he exited the room. Gaby stared at the closed door for a few seconds, puzzled by her partner's behavior. What's the matter with you, Illya?... End of chapter 9. The more sadistic the bad guy is, the more satisfying it is when he finally gets what he deserves ;) (and I feel like I have to find a name for that CIA agent now :s :) )[Chapter 10] Thanks for the reviews on chapter 9! Here is the final chapter of this story, as always I hope you'll like it :) edit: there might be a small bonus chapter after this one :) Unknown location, Illya's p.o.v. He opens his eyes. White walls, and he knows he doesn't want to be here. He's not alone. Cowboy is here too, he's conscious this time. His wrists are cuffed to a pipe above his head and his mouth is taped shut. It wasn't like this… Solo's eyes are wide with fear and he can see his bare chest rising and falling rapidly. Cowboy is scared. He puts his hand on his partner's shoulder in a reassuring gesture and suddenly there is a knife in his hand. Solo flinches and Illya knows he really doesn't want to be here. He tries to let go of the knife but it feels like it's glued to his hand. His arm moves and he has no control over it. The tip of the blade is now resting against Solo's skin. He pushes the knife in, deep. That's not what happened… He slowly makes a long incision in his partner's body. It's easy, like cutting butter, and he feels sick. Cowboy doesn't scream. Simply looks at him, his eyes so wide open that it seems his eyelids will tear at the corners. Illya can feel his body trembling under the palm of his free hand. He looks down at the incision and his hand is inside the wound. He panics. He wants to pull his hand out but he has no control over his body. His hand starts moving around inside his partner's chest cavity and now there is screaming. So much screaming and the tape does little to muffle it. He just wants to make it end quickly now but he can't find his heart. He knows it has to be in there somewhere but he can't concentrate with all the screaming. He closes his eyes. He opens them again and the screaming has stopped. He knows there's something in his hand and he doesn't want to look down. No, please, it's not what happened… His gaze shifts down slowly and he is holding his partner's heart in his hand. And, absurdly, it's still beating. Horror and disgust overwhelm him and he knows he is going to be sick. Suddenly a hand closes around his wrist. Cowboy is no longer cuffed to the pipe. He plucks the heart from his hand and Illya watches in horror as his partner desperately attempts to push his own heart back into his body through the gaping wound. No…you should be dead…I'm sorry… He wants to stand up and run away from the grotesque scene. But he can't move. He wants to close his eyes to escape his partner's accusatory stare. But his eyes are already closed. He opened his eyes. \"Are you okay?\" Gaby was watching him curiously from the other side of the backseat. \"You were mumbling in your sleep.\" \"I'm fine. Just tired.\" Illya looked out the window of the car as he waited for his heartbeat to slow back down. He felt foolish for letting their captor get inside his head. Gaby's hand settled on his knee and he almost shied away from her touch. \"It's really late and Solo will be busy getting himself patched up. Maybe we should postpone the visit to the hospital until tomorrow and get some rest. We both need it.\", she said, scooting over so that she could rest her head against his shoulder. He agreed, trying to hide his relief. The last thing he wanted at that moment was to face his partner. Solo had been conscious, although not completely coherent, before they had taken him to the hospital, and Illya had done his best to avoid him. Gaby, who had talked to the medical team, had later listed to him his partner's confirmed and suspected injuries. Injuries he had inflicted. In addition to the various cuts, bruises and stab wounds, Solo apparently had at least one broken rib, moderate internal bleeding, and a concussion, no doubt from that last punch to the side of his head. At least, according to Gaby, the medics had sounded optimistic. They had been less sure about the other American agent who had been rushed to a different hospital, probably under the supervision of the CIA. They wanted to keep their man – and, more importantly, what he knew – safe. Illya sighed and looked down at Gaby. She still had her head against his shoulder and her regular breathing told him she had fallen asleep. Careful not to disturb her, he leaned his head back against the car seat but kept his eyes open. Soon, he started succumbing to the lulling motion of the car and as he felt himself drift off, he hoped for a dreamless sleep. Solo's hospital room, the next day, Gaby's p.o.v. \"Come on, Illya! At this rate, Solo will be out of the hospital before we even get to his room.\" Illya had been acting weird all day. Even during the meeting with Waverly that morning he had seemed exceptionally somber. And she had practically had to drag him along to the hospital to visit Solo. \"That's the room.\" She knocked and pushed the door open without waiting for an answer, almost hitting Waverly, who had been standing on the other side, in the process. \"Ah, good, more company for you, Solo. Come in, come in. I was just about to leave. And for the love of God, quit sulking, Kuryakin, you look like a hitman in search of a new target. You're going to scare the nurses off and, from what I understand, Solo seems to greatly appreciate their company.\" \"To be honest, Sir, I think it would take more than that to keep them from flirting with Solo.\", Gaby countered with a smile. She saw Napoleon wink at her from across the room. \"Touché, Miss Teller. But don't get too used to this, Solo. Remember, I want you back at work on Monday!\" \"He didn't say which Monday.\", Napoleon said with a slight shrug after Waverly had closed the door behind him. Gaby got closer to the bed. Illya didn't budge. \"Illya, we came here to visit Solo, not the coat rack at the far end of the room.\" He reluctantly stepped closer and Gaby shrugged as Solo shot her a questioning look. She sat down on the edge of the bed and took a moment to study her partner. He still had a huge bump and impressive bruising on the side of his head and she could make out the shape of the thick bandages under his hospital gown, he looked tired and his hair was messy but apart from that he didn't look too bad, much better than she had expected actually. \"So, tell me, I'm dying to know, what happened while I was unconscious? Nothing too kinky I hope?\" Gaby shot a glance at Illya and he avoided her gaze. She hesitated for a second then decided to do Illya a favor and clear the air. \"Well, I guess it depends if your definition of kinky includes getting your heart ripped out by your own partner.\" \"Ouch. Well I'm certainly glad he didn't go through with it.\", Solo answered, glancing furtively at Illya. \"It was a close call.\", Gaby added, pointing at the bandage just below his ribcage. \"Hmm…I knew that wasn't there before I lost consciousness. Wait…that means you were actually going to rip out my heart, Peril?\" \"I…I'm…\" Poor Illya looked and sounded like he'd rather be anywhere but here. Gaby chewed her lower lip nervously and looked alternately at her partners. \"Wow. So I suppose stabbing me wasn't enough?\", Solo went on. She shot him a look of disapproval but he ignored her. What are you doing, Solo?.. \"The thing is, I don't know if I can ever forgive you or trust you again.\" \"Solo, I…\" \"You completely ruined my favorite shirt.\" \"I'm sorry, I…what?\" \"All right, second favorite, but don't try to change the subject. Do you have any idea how much I paid for that shirt? I always knew you had poor taste in clothing, Peril, but honestly, I didn't think that you would go that far.\" Napoleon's p.o.v. Napoleon shot Gaby a rapid glance and saw that she was struggling to keep a straight face. He was finding it hard to remain serious himself. Illya looked like a deer caught in headlights. He stood completely frozen, staring at him with his mouth slightly open, visibly at a loss as to what to do or say. Napoleon could understand what was going on in his partner's mind and he knew that he would probably have felt the same way if their roles had been reversed so he was determined to make his partner understand – in his own way – that he wasn't blaming him for anything that had happened. Let's see if we can put a smile on that big Russian face of yours… \"By the way, you didn't need to go through all that trouble, Peril. My heart was yours from the start.\", he said, flashing his best cheeky smile. \"Well maybe not from the very start.\", he added, grimacing as he recalled his first encounter with the big Russian. \"But close enough.\" Now he's starting to get annoyed. He just needs one more little nudge… \"Oh well, I suppose that literally stealing your heart is a KGB agent's idea of a romantic gesture. I'd watch out if I were you, Gaby...\" There it is, the eye roll…And now, the coup de grâce… \"Honestly, Peril, I'm slightly upset that you thought I was going to blame you for all this. You know me better than that.\" He paused for effect. \"I'm not heartl…\" \"Stop right there, Cowboy, or I swear I'm going to finish the job.\" \"That's the spirit, Peril!\" The Russian finally seemed to realize that he and Gaby were looking at him expectantly and a hesitant, begrudging smile started to form on his lips. Mission accomplished… The tension in the room had abated noticeably and, although Napoleon could tell that his partner was still uneasy, the next fifteen minutes went by pleasantly enough with Gaby and Illya filling him in on what he had missed. Then Gaby got up from where she was perched on the edge of his bed and told them that she had to leave and that she would be back in a couple of hours. \"I won't be long, just a couple of hours at most. You can wait for me here, Illya.\" From the Russian's attitude, it was obvious that he wanted nothing more than to follow her out of the room. Don't even think about it, Peril. You're staying with me until there's not a trace of unjustified guilt left in your stubborn Russian mind… Illya's p.o.v \"So, I take it you'll be keeping me company, Peril?\" He had been about to leave but Solo's question made his reaction seem inadequate. That was typical of Solo. The American had always had a knack for making him feel inadequate. He dragged a chair close to the bed and sat down. Then he looked up and met his partner's gaze. Solo had his trademark facial expression on. Eyebrows pulled together, creased forehead. It gave him an air of sophisticated seriousness which – for some reason Illya could not fathom – most of the women he met seemed to find irresistible. Illya suspected that his partner used that expression on purpose and secretly practiced it every day in front of the mirror. They stared at each other in silence for a few awkward seconds then Illya broke eye contact and Solo broke the silence. \"One thing I have always appreciated about you, Peril, is your innate talent for small talk. Would you mind handing me that glass of water? I would get it myself but I don't want to risk rupturing my stitches…\" Illya shot him a guilty glance, grabbed the glass from the bedside table and held it out to him. His partner made to take it but, as he was raising his arm, he suddenly gasped, his face twisting in pain. He let his arm drop back down and made an apologetic face. \"Sorry, Peril, but I think you're also going to have to help me drink. Even the slightest movement hurts.\" Feeling even guiltier, Illya stood up and got closer to the head of the bed. He gently put a hand behind Solo's back to help him sit up straighter and brought the glass to his partner's lips, tipping it slightly, careful not to choke him with too much water. \"Thanks, Peril.\" \"It's the least I can do, after what happened.\" They spent the following half hour talking about the scientist and reminiscing about past missions and Illya gradually began to relax. After a while they fell into a companionable silence until Solo declared that he was thirsty again…and easily reached for the glass on the bedside table, only grimacing slightly as he settled back against the pillows. Illya stared in disbelief as he lifted the glass to his lips with no apparent effort. \"You can drink without help…\" \"Of course I can, Peril.\", Solo answered, winking at him and flashing his trademark smile. Illya tightened his lips and let the corners of his mouth curl down in an expression of ultimate annoyance. \"You're lucky you're injured…\" unknown location, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby silently followed the man through a small maze of corridors until he stopped in front of a door. \"We're here, Miss Teller. By the way, I hope you didn't mind the security check at the entrance, you know what it's like in our line of work. You just never know who can be trusted or not.\" He gave her a weird smile and a few awkward seconds passed before he went on. \"Just ring when you're done and I'll escort you out.\" She thanked the man and knocked on the door, smiling as she heard a familiar voice answer weakly. \"Hello, agent Marshall.\", she said as she entered the room. \"Miss Teller? Hello…I…I wasn't expecting you.\", the CIA agent answered, grimacing as he tried and failed to prop himself up higher in his hospital bed. \"Oh I won't be staying long, don't worry. I just wanted to see how you were doing.\" Gaby grabbed a chair from the corner of the room and sat down close to the side of the bed. She studied the agent's face for a second. \"You look…slightly better than you did last time I saw you.\" \"Thank you…I suppose.\" She gave him a playful smile and he went on. \"I can't say I feel much better though. Especially after the visit from my boss earlier today. Getting shot in the leg almost seems pleasant in comparison.\" \"It was that bad?\" \"No, actually it wasn't. I'm exaggerating. He was uncharacteristically sympathetic. I suspect my doctor showed him my X-rays to mollify him. Besides, the information I had gathered before my cover was blown and what they were able to retrieve from that scientist guy's lab were enough to please him. He's just bitter about having to share some of it with the MI6. \" Gaby gave an amused sigh. Little boys don't like to share their toys… \"How do the ribs feel?\" \"They hurt, but as long as I don't move, cough, sneeze, laugh or breathe, it's not too bad.\" She smiled sympathetically. \"And the leg?\" \"They said it should heal well but my days as an undercover field agent are over. At least for the next six months. How is Solo?\" \"He's fine, he'll make a full recovery.\" \"Glad to hear that.\" Her eyes fell on the hospital bracelet around the agent's wrist. He followed her gaze and flashed her his boyish grin. \"You like it? They had a toe ring version but I think this suits me better.\" She turned his wrist slightly so that she could read the name scribbled on it. \"Marshall, A., A. Marshall. What does the \"A\" stand for? Wait, don't tell me, let me guess…\" To her surprise, the agent let out an exaggerated groan. \"Oh please, not you too!\" Gaby's face twisted in an apologetic grimace as she realized what he was referring to. \"Sorry.\" He started laughing but the pain in his ribs rapidly dissuaded him. \"It's okay, as long as you don't shoot me every time you guess wrong.\" \"Don't worry that's not what I came here for.\", she said, letting go of his wrist and squeezing his hand in a comforting gesture. \"I wanted to thank you for risking your life to save me and my partners.\" \"Well, you're very welcome.\", he answered, visibly embarrassed. \"Speaking about your partners, I hope you didn't bring Kuryakin with you. I've seen what he's capable of and I wouldn't want him to walk in on us holding hands…\" Gaby felt her cheeks heat up. \"By the way\", he went on. \"Solo's right, you know. You two would be perfect together.\" An image chose this inopportune moment to pop up in her mind. Blond hair, blue eyes, a small v-shaped scar. She was now blushing so hard that she wondered for a second if her face would ever revert back to its original color. \"Adrian.\", she blurted out suddenly and she saw the agent raise a confused eyebrow. \"Or Alan. Alan Marshall has a nice ring to it. Or Aloysius maybe…\" The agent stared at her as if he was trying to decide whether he should tease her some more or allow her to change the subject. After a few seconds and to Gaby's relief, he smiled and let her off the hook. \"Aloysius? Seriously?\" Solo's hospital room, Gaby's p.o.v. (two hours later) As Gaby entered the room and saw her partners engaged in a game of chess, she thought to herself that if someone were to take a photograph at that precise moment, it would capture the relationship between the two men perfectly. Solo, looking tired but smug and Illya watching him with a look of extreme annoyance seasoned with a dash of concern. She stepped into the picture. \"You cheat…\" \"You simply got too used to playing against yourself, Peril. You've hit a plateau.\" \"I'm pretty sure that that pawn was already off the board…\" Napoleon winked at her and she smiled back. \"Care to join us, Gaby?\" \"Only if I don't have to play.\" \"All right, you can just watch me win then.\" She heard Illya mutter something under his breath and she shot Solo a questioning glance. \"What did he say?\" \"It's Russian for crook, cheater and…I didn't catch the last one.\" Illya gave him a pointed look and Gaby shook her head, the hint of a smile playing at the edges of her lips. Her partners would never change. Unknown location \"Here are the files you requested, with everything my man was able to dig up on the agents. Marshall is the one who was working undercover for the CIA. We still don't know how he managed to infiltrate the organization.\" \"Well, it seems clear to me, we have that brilliant scientist you suggested we hire to thank for that. What about the other three?\" \"Teller, Solo and Kuryakin. Apparently they're part of some international team working under the supervision of the MI6, the fruit of cooperation between the Americans, the British and the Russians. Teller is German, recruited by the British. Solo is CIA and Kuryakin was borrowed from the KGB.\" \"Interesting. What were they doing there?\" \"Apparently, our employee had crossed paths with them before. It appears that they were responsible for his hmm…unusual appearance. My guess is that he simply wanted his revenge. The man had an obsessive nature, he had probably been planning this for quite some time.\" \"A fat lot of good it did him. See, that's why I never trusted the man with any sensitive information about the organization. I had a feeling he would make a mistake sooner or later, and with the CIA becoming increasingly inquisitive, we can't afford mistakes.\" \"It's a pity that his work was lost, though. He had made good progress on the project and now it's all in the hands of the CIA.\" \"That's regrettable, indeed, but we can always find a replacement and start over later. The important thing is that they can't use what they found to get to us.\" \"Are you going to…hmm… inform them of what happened?\" \"I don't see the point in bothering them with such a minor incident. Unless you want to personally explain to them how a man you recommended let an undercover CIA agent get close to him, invited three MI6 agents into his secret lab and caused the shutdown of one of their scientific side-projects.\" \"No, Sir, I'd rather not. So what are we going to do about the agents? This incident seems to indicate that they shouldn't be underestimated. They might cause trouble in the future and I think it would be a mistake to let them live. Solo and Marshall are both recovering in the hospital. Killing them and making it look like an accident would be easy. Then we could pick off the other two…\" \"No. Let them live. For now. The CIA is already investigating us and it won't be long before the MI6 follows suit, we don't want to draw more attention by murdering their agents.\" \"With all due respect, I still think we should at least eliminate Marshall. If you're worried about drawing attention, one death will be less suspicious than four and he is more isolated and vulnerable than the others. One of my men is at the hospital with him right now. I just have one call to make and he will be taken care of. Or, if we want to be on the safe side concerning what he knows, my man can torture it out of him first, just to make sure he didn't hear or see something that could jeopardize the organization.\" \"Like I said, I'm not too worried about what Marshall knows, besides, he has probably already passed the information on to his superiors so there's really no point in killing him now. We'll just make sure to keep tabs on him and the three other agents in the future. And we can always get rid of them later, once the dust has settled a bit.\" \"But, Sir…\" \"You're not questioning my decisions, are you?\" \"No, Sir. Of course not.\" \"Good. You almost had me fooled for a moment there. Remember no one is irreplaceable, not even me and certainly not you… Well, I think that concludes our little meeting, unless there's anything you would like to add?\" \"…\" \"I didn't think so. I'll contact you again soon.\" The man's polite expression turned into a scowl as soon as his superior had left the room. His eyes settled on the telephone. One call to make. He hesitated for a couple of minutes then he lifted the receiver and started dialing. End of chapter 10. Let me know what you think :) (and no one will ever know what the first name of the CIA agent actually is :) )[Chapter 11] Chapter 11! I know I said it was going to be a \"small\" bonus chapter (because I felt bad for ending on a cliffhanger), it turned out to be a bit longer than I expected (never ending stooooryyyy (8) ). Let me know if you like it :) Warning: creepy character inside :) edit: first chapter of the sequel (\"A simple mission, really\") is out! :) re-edit: if you want to know what Marshall looks like, here is a link to his 'official portrait' :P : \"https\":\"/\"\"/\"\"ibb\".\"co\"/eKx4Fd (just remove the \"\") Marshall's hospital room, Marshall's p.o.v. He was staring at the ceiling, bored out of his mind. During the day, the visit from his boss, the more pleasant one from Gaby Teller, and the coming and going of the doctor and nurses had provided some distraction but it was now nighttime and everything was quiet. He had tried to fall asleep for a while but the dull pain in his ribs and the persistent itch under the bandage on his leg were not helping. He was so bored that he briefly considered using the nurse call button, just to get some company, but he new the nurse would probably murder him. He sighed and closed his eyes, trying for the umpteenth time to make himself fall asleep. Without much conviction, he started conjuring up peaceful mental imagery: the lazy ebb and flow of the ocean on a summer day, dead leaves slowly falling to the ground, the gentle sound of the rain on a window, the crackling of a comforting fire in the chimney, the sound of the door being furtively cracked open… He opened his eyes and made an effort to sit up. His visitor chose this moment to switch on the light. His eyes being used to the darkness, the sudden brightness blinded him and he groaned. Thanks… After a few seconds of furious blinking, he was finally able to identify his visitor. A doctor, judging by his attire. Something was odd though. What's with the surgical cap and mask?.. He briefly wondered if the doctor had made a mistake and was in the wrong room but the man was looking at him intently and making no move to leave. \"Can I help you with something?\" He knew it was a strange thing to say to a doctor but the whole situation was strange. His visitor's scrutinizing stare was making him slightly uncomfortable. After a few seconds, the man spoke, his voice somewhat muffled by the mask. \"I'm here to give you your medication, Mr. Marshall.\" \"What, now? What kind of medication? Why didn't you send a nurse?\" \"It will help you relax and go to sleep, Mr. Marshall.\" The man now had his back turned to him and seemed to preparing something on a small table at the far end of the room. Three questions, one answer. Not good… The agent tensed up. None of this made sense. The doctor's visit in the middle of the night, the medication his other doctor had mentioned nothing about, the surgical attire, his visitor's unnerving silence… Marshall's instincts screamed at him to get out of the room, but in his condition, it wasn't really an option. He slowly reached for the call button by his bed and pressed it three or four times. \"It's not going to work, Mr. Marshall.\" The man had apparently finished whatever he had been doing and was slowly stepping closer to the bed. \"What do you mean?\", Marshall asked as he felt his heart perform a series of somersaults worth a perfect ten. Instead of answering and before the agent had a chance to move, the man brutally grabbed him by the hair and tilted his head to the side, using his other hand to jab a needle into his neck, just below the angle of his jaw. What the…?! He opened his mouth to scream but his attacker covered it with a gloved hand, muffling his protests while at the same time maintaining his head firmly against the headboard. He started struggling but the man was strong and he was in no condition to fight. After a couple of minutes and to his surprise, the man released him and took a step back. He was now standing by the bed, watching him with curious, smiling eyes. \"What…what did you inject me with?\", Marshall asked, his voice sounding unusually thick to his own ears. He raised a trembling hand to his neck and realized with a rising feeling of panic that whatever the fake doctor had injected him with was starting to compromise his ability to coordinate his movements. Never mind his injuries, he needed to get out of there, fast. Gasping in pain, he tried to push himself off the bed. But as his feet touched the floor, his wounded leg gave out. The man caught him just before he collapsed and pushed him back onto the bed. \"Careful, Mr. Marshall, I shouldn't have to remind you that with the injuries you sustained, it's not a good idea to try to get out of bed.\" The tone was mockingly chiding, playful with a barely concealed hint of cruelty. The man was enjoying himself. As the agent flopped uselessly on the bed, trying in vain to push himself up, he realized with a mounting feeling of dread that it was too late, he was now completely at the mercy of his attacker. The man carefully laid him flat on his back, took hold of his left arm and held it in front of his eyes, as if to examine it. \"Ah, good thing your wrists are already bruised, Mr. Marshall, it will make my work even easier.\", he said, letting his arm drop back down and pulling something out of his coat pocket. The man moved out of his field of vision and he let out a pitiful groan as he felt his arms being pulled back above his head. He heard familiar clicking sounds and felt cold metal close around his tender wrists. No, please not again… The man stepped back into his field of vision, considered him for a second then bent down over him so that his face was close to the agent's ear. \"Don't worry, everything's going to be fine. Just relax, Asher.\" He tried to shout for help but his voice was weak. The man pressed a finger against his lips. \"Shh, don't bother trying, no one will hear you anyway. I made sure that we wouldn't be disturbed. I just want to have a little chat with the CIA agent who managed to infiltrate our organization. Congratulations, by the way. Sadly, my employers think that you should not be allowed to live so here is what's going to happen, you're going to tell me everything that you learned during your stay with us. It should be easy since you've probably already done it once for the benefit of your superiors. Then, I will kill you, Asher.\" \"I won't tell you anything… screw you and your organization.\" He had meant to sound determined and aggressive but his weak voice and slightly slurred speech were ruining his performance. \"Well, if I'm completely honest, I was hoping you would say something along those lines. Because it gives me an occasion to engage in one of my favorite activities.\" Asher Marshall closed his eyes wearily. It was not hard to guess the nature of that \"favorite activity\". Come on…I don't deserve this… He heard movement and, opening his eyes, realized that the man had left his field of vision again. He tried to raise his head but it felt as if it weighed a ton, as did the rest of his body. Only his heart seemed to have retained the ability to function normally, and it was hammering painfully against his damaged ribcage. Killer's p.o.v. Once he had made sure that Marshall was comfortable and knew what to expect, he took a moment to study his target. The agent was a nice specimen, in his late twenties, fit, not bad looking. The drug he had administered would keep him docile but he would still be able to think and talk, even if it took extra effort. And more importantly, the agent would be able to feel what he was about to do to him. He could tell Marshall was scared but was trying his best not to let it show. He particularly enjoyed it when his targets were field agents, they were usually tough guys and the fun lasted longer. For this assignment, his employer had been clear. He needed to make it look like Marshall's death was accidental, or \"due to natural causes\". Which meant that in order to torture him, he would have to work with the injuries the agent had already sustained and leave as few traces as possible. Perfect. He loved a good challenge. He retrieved Marshall's x-rays from the table where he had set them down earlier and stepped closer to the bed. \"Look what I found, Asher.\", he said, holding the x-rays in front of the agent's face. Calling his victims by their first name was one of his quirks. He had learned from experience that it was one of the simplest but most efficient ways to get the target's heart racing a bit faster. \"I've always found anatomy fascinating. It teaches you most of what you need to know to efficiently inflict pain on someone. Let's have a look at these, shall we?\", he said, holding an x-ray up to the light. \"Wow. That scientist guy really did a number on you… I don't know which one to pick. Let's see, right here, that's your fifth rib on your right side, quite a nasty fracture. How about we look for it together, Asher?\" He placed a gentle hand on the agent's chest and smiled as he saw panic flicker in his eyes. He could feel Marshall's frantic heartbeat under his palm and his smile widened. This was his favorite part, the moment just before he started inflicting pain, he could feel his victim's fear radiate from his body. \"Anything you would like to tell me before we start?\" \"Go to hell.\" Brave little agent… He clamped his other hand over Marshall's mouth to stifle the screams he knew were coming. He could have used tape, or a gag, but he preferred this method, it was much more intimate and satisfying. \"Let's start from the bottom, shall we?\" He brought his hand just below Marshall's ribcage and lightly brushed his finger over his ribs as if he were counting them. \"…Seven, six, five. I think that's the one.\" He paused and put on a fake sympathetic look. \"I won't torture you if you tell me what I want to know.\" Of course Marshall knew he was lying. He could see it in his eyes. He gave a small chuckle, placed his fingers over the agent's fractured rib and pushed down, slowly. He smiled with sadistic pleasure as he heard Marshall's gasp of pain, muffled under his hand. He increased the pressure slightly, just enough to make the agent scream. \"See, Asher, that's the nice thing about broken ribs, they hurt so bad that it's easy to inflict excruciating pain without causing too much damage.\" He waited a few more seconds, then he stopped applying pressure but kept his hand on his victim's chest. \"Hmm, I can tell you didn't like that. Shh, it's okay, just take a deep breath…or maybe don't.\" He gave another chuckle. He was enjoying himself too much. \"You know, I don't have to do this again, Asher. Just tell me what I want to know and the pain will end.\" He removed his hand from over the agent's mouth but from the look of determination in Marshall's eyes it was obvious that he wasn't ready to talk. Not that it really mattered to him. He was mostly torturing his target for his own amusement. He was paid to kill the agent, obtaining the information was just a bonus. He would prolong the fun for a little while, then he would kill Marshall and move on to his next target. \"Okay, let's pick another rib then!\" hospital, Sanders's p.o.v. He nodded at the security guards as he entered the building and, despite the late hour they let him through without asking any questions. Adrian Sanders was one of those men who radiated that special type of confidence that comes with power. He had zero tolerance for incompetence, very little patience and was used to having his own way. Consequently, he hadn't thought twice about coming to the hospital in the middle of the night to wake up his injured agent and ask him some follow up questions. He had managed to get some information from Marshall during his visit, that morning, but his agent's doctor had insisted that he should rest and that further \"questioning\" could wait. But Sanders was growing impatient, he had questions and needed detailed answers and if it meant that his injured agent had to lose a few hours of rest, it was a sacrifice he was more than willing to make. The man was still working for him, after all. Even if he was hospitalized. He quickly made his way through the maze of corridors to Marshall's room. The area seemed quieter and deserted compared to the rest of the building. Good. He had known that he would have less chances of bumping into his agent's doctor during the night. He would just need to make sure he disabled his call button. As he got closer to the door, he thought he heard what sounded like a whimper. Good, that meant Marshall was already awake. He had his hand on the handle and was about to open the door when he heard another whimper, overlapping with a low voice. He cursed inwardly. Marshall was not alone. He silently cracked the door open and saw a white coat and a scrub cap. The doctor had his back turned to him and was bent over his agent's bed, apparently tending to him. Sanders rolled his eyes. What's wrong with him now? A broken fingernail? Whatever the doctor was doing to his agent, it sounded painful. Very painful… He frowned. Something was off. He had initially thought that Marshall was trying to hold back his cries of pain. But that wasn't it. It actually sounded like his agent was screaming in agony and someone or something was muffling his screams. He silently stepped closer to the bed and saw one of Marshall's legs twitch slightly. Then he spotted the handcuffs and stopped dead in his tracks. At that moment, the \"doctor\", who obviously doubled as a contract killer, seemed to sense his presence and turned around. In a second, Sanders's gaze jumped from the handcuffs to the man's face, covered by a surgical mask, to the man's hand clamped over his agent's mouth. He started reaching under his coat for his shoulder holster. As an agent handler, he rarely had a reason to quick draw his weapon these days, and time had slightly blunted his reflexes. Slow reflexes did not seem to be an issue for his opponent, however. The moment Sanders started reaching for the gun, the man grabbed a heavy medical tray and hurled it at him. He barely had the time to raise his arm to prevent the tray from hitting him square in the face. He grunted, then cursed, then finally managed to draw his weapon. He looked up in time to see the fake doctor charging at him with a scalpel. He squeezed off a round without taking the time to aim. He heard a satisfying groan of pain and the scalpel clattered to the floor but, carried by his momentum, the much larger man still crashed into him. The impact winded him and he lost his grip on the gun as he went down. Royally pissed off, but also acutely aware of his own mortality, he retrieved the gun and got to his feet much faster than he would have thought himself capable of. Not fast enough to take another shot at his opponent, though. The other man, probably younger and more agile, had not waited for him and had already disappeared out of the room. He rushed out in the corridor. Of course his aim was not to try and catch up with the killer. The man had already demonstrated that he was much faster than him. Instead, he went to the alarm panel on the wall and smashed his hand on the button. One wounded man and a facility full of CIA security, they probably wouldn't need his help for the chase. Holstering his gun, he stepped back into the room to check on Marshall. The young agent was conscious but his eyes had a slightly glazed look. Sanders started checking his agent's body for potential life-threatening wounds. He wasn't exactly sure what the killer had been doing to him and he knew that Marshall would need to be examined by a doctor – an actual doctor – but as far as he could tell, his agent seemed fine. Well, at least not much worse than he was on my first visit… \"Do you think you're going to be okay, Marshall? Or should I send for someone to get you down to the morgue?\" \"That won't be…necessary…Sir.\" He noticed that his agent's speech was slightly slurred. The killer had probably drugged him to keep him docile. He briefly wondered how long Marshall's ordeal had lasted before he intervened. He gave and exasperated sigh. Even handling Solo had been less trouble. \"Good. Because I still have a couple of questions that need answers and I won't tolerate any more inconvenience.\" Hospital, killer's p.o.v. He heard the wail of the alarm and accelerated. He needed to get to his room, fast. Fortunately he had rehearsed this type of scenario in his mind a hundred times and he knew that there was little chance of bumping into guards in this part of the building. While he ran, he removed the mask, cap, gloves and the white coat and balled them up. He wasn't worried about the surveillance cameras. He had taken care of that earlier. The bullet fired by Sanders had grazed his arm. He kept the balled-up coat firmly pressed against the wound. He didn't want to leave a blood trail. The stinging pain was delightful but he knew he couldn't allow himself to be distracted by it. He would relish it later. Marshall is still alive… No. He couldn't afford to think about that now either. Still he could feel frustration building up inside him. He had been robbed of the satisfaction of killing his target. Sanders… He could have easily killed Marshall's handler. In fact he would have greatly enjoyed stabbing that scalpel into his eye and twisting the blade until there was nothing left but a bloody mess. Then a quick, precise stab between the ribs, or to the neck, to finish him off… But Sanders was simply not his target. In his line of work, discipline was key. As much as he hated the comparison, he had to be like a well-trained dog if he didn't want to end up unemployed, or dead. As anticipated, he reached his room without encountering anyone. He closed the door behind him and locked it. He needed to work fast if he didn't want to arouse suspicion. He pulled a suitcase from the closet and stuffed the white coat, mask, cap and gloves inside. He would dispose of those later. He removed his shirt and added it to the contents of the suitcase. Then he took a look at the wound on his arm. It was barely bleeding. The sight of his own blood sent a thrill through him. He wanted to press on the wound but he resisted the temptation. He opened a drawer and grabbed a piece of gauze and some tape. He quickly dressed the wound, put on a clean shirt and strapped on his shoulder holster. Then he unlocked the door and calmly stepped into the corridor. Now, let's see if we can catch that dangerous individual… Solo's hospital room, the next day, Napoleon's p.o.v. Gaby and Illya had arrived early to warn Napoleon that Waverly would be holding some kind of informal meeting in his room that afternoon. What he had not been warned about, however, was that his ex-handler would be there too. As he watched the middle-aged, grumpy man follow Waverly into the room, the thought crossed his mind that if he had known, he would probably have ruptured his stitches on purpose just to be excused from that meeting. It wasn't that he hated his ex-boss. He just liked him better when he wasn't there. \"Solo, Kuryakin, Miss Teller…\" Waverly had his usual \"we're-all-friends\" smile on. He made formal introductions between Sanders and Gaby. Napoleon noticed that Sanders was looking at him with the usual mixture of contempt and disappointment. Ah. How I have missed that look… \"So, I suppose you're all wondering what Mr. Sanders is doing here.\", Waverly started. He didn't seem bothered by the fact that he was the only one smiling in the room. \"Remember your new CIA playfellow, agent Asher Marshall? Well, Solo's former handler, Mr. Sanders here, happens to be Marshall's current handler. Charming coincidence, don't you think?\" Well, my condolences, agent Asher Marshall… \"Is everything okay with agent Marshall?\", Gaby asked, and he noticed that she was nervously chewing her bottom lip. Sanders proceeded to tell them how a killer, disguised as a doctor, hired by the organization they were investigating, had tortured and almost killed his agent in his hospital room during the night. \"We don't know how he managed to get to Marshall, we don't know how he managed to get out. The building was full of security guards, no one saw him, not even on the surveillance feed.\" Napoleon raised an eyebrow. \"He's good.\" \"He's more than good, Solo. If I hadn't had too much work and a bad case of insomnia last night, Marshall would be dead and no one would be able to piece together what had happened. The thing is, I don't think the man will give up so easily. And since you were involved in Marshall's mission, even if it was unintentional, there is a risk that he might target you as well.\" I'm sure you would be devastated, Sir… \"I'm afraid that means you will no longer be able to spend time alone with the nurses, Solo.\", Waverly added with a small, falsely apologetic smile. \"Pity. I have to say I wouldn't mind getting handcuffed to the bed by one of them.\" Napoleon grinned as he saw his former handler's mouth twist into a grimace of annoyance. \"I wonder how you can stand him.\", Sanders said, turning to Waverly. \"I just happen to have a sense of humor.\", the Englishman answered with a smile, shutting him up in typical Waverly fashion. The meeting went on for a while, then Sanders left and the atmosphere in the room seemed to lighten. \"It was uncharacteristically nice of Sanders to warn you that your agents might be targeted. I never knew he had a sense of fair play.\" \"Well, don't forget that you are one of the CIA's assets, Solo. He still thinks of you as one of his little proteges. Besides, he wasn't only warning me that you, Kuryakin, or Miss Teller were potential targets. He was also suggesting that I use my agents as bait to capture the killer.\" \"Charming.\" \"I said I would think about it.\", Waverly added, winking at them. \"Apparently, that's what my colleague from the CIA intends to do with agent Marshall.\" Napoleon saw Illya roll his eyes and Gaby resume her nervous lip-chewing. One lucky fellow, that agent Marshall… Unknown location, killer's p.o.v. He took off his shirt and sat down on the bed. He could see a small dried blood stain on the bandage. He removed the tape and gauze, scratched off the coagulated blood and pressed on the skin around the wound to make it bleed. He took a moment to appreciate the stinging pain, then he dressed the wound again. He got up, grabbed the files and spread them out on the bed before him. The first one was Marshall's. He couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration as he read the agent's name. He couldn't wait to get another opportunity to kill him. He wanted to hear Marshall take his last breaths. He wanted to feel his heartbeat falter and stop. He wanted to see the light go out in his eyes. But he knew now was not the right time. Now that they knew Marshall was one of his targets, approaching him would be more difficult. The wisest course of action was to leave Marshall alone for a while and eliminate another target in the meantime. He let his gaze travel from one file to the next. Solo looked so smug in the photograph. Killing him would be fun. The girl he would dispatch quickly, female targets rarely represented a challenge. Kuryakin, now that was a different story. A thrill of excitement ran through him at the prospect of killing the KGB agent. His thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of the telephone. The sudden noise surprised him but not the call itself. He had known it would come, sooner or later. He picked up the receiver and listened without uttering a word. He was not supposed to talk. After a few minutes, the call ended and he made a conscious effort not to slam down the receiver and hurl the phone at the large mirror in front of him. Discipline. Apparently his employers had had a change of heart. He hated it when that happened. They didn't realize how hard it was to take your mind off a target once you had decided that they would die at your hands. He forced himself to calm down by pressing his fingers against the wound in his arm. After all, he knew his employers. And he knew it was only a matter of time before the hunt was on again. He gathered the files from the bed and returned them to his empty suitcase. He couldn't wait. End of chapter 11 (and of the story, I swear :) ) Many thanks to Tamuril2 who suggested that Sanders join the story as Marshall's handler, it was really fun to write :) (and thanks for the reviews on chapter 10 :) ) ","Summary":" New story :) I hope you enjoy this one Disclaimer: I don't own the characters Unknown location Napo"},{"Movie":"Man From U.N.C.L.E.","Title":"Trust","Author":"who is sabrina","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11713228","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It happened by degrees. It was a gradual thing, so slow that it was hardly noticeable at all. It started, Napoleon later surmised, with the reflective surfaces. He wasn't sure how, or where, or when, but at some point he had stopped checking them. No longer did he look at small mirrors and polished teapots and chrome surfaces to glimpse the Russian agent's movements behind his back. No more tilting mirrors to odd angles that were perfect for surveillance. No more quick, paranoid glances with finely-tuned peripheral vision. No; somewhere along the way, those had stopped. The bugs and the trackers, of course, never had. But they were different now. No longer placed out of suspicion, but rather for the sole purpose of ensuring his partner's safety (just like the Russian trackers still safely nestled into his own boots). Other things were different, too - subtle changes that the American agent hadn't even recognized before. The absence of the tension he had once felt while in Illya's presence. The slow change of the constant banter between them - things originally meant as slights were now, oddly enough, terms of endearment - nicknames. Insults that were once meant sincerely were now said in jest (\"Absolutely hated working with you, Peril.\"). And on top of all this, even more telling was the slow, creeping change in Napoleon's working style. So used to working alone, the concept of reliance on a partner had been an uncomfortable one for the American spy. And yet somehow, said reliance had crept into his working style even without his permission. He grew used to the imposing presence at his back as he deftly picked lock after lock. He no longer strained to hear approaching footsteps as well as the click of the lock; he knew without checking that Illya was keeping a lookout. In a firefight, he became accustomed to the feel of someone else's back against his, rather than the cold hard side of a wall. And when he ran between two points of shelter, he didn't have to tell the Russian agent to cover him; it was already a given. Yes - in hindsight, all the signs were there. Napoleon could never say when exactly it happened, but it had happened nonetheless. Napoleon Solo trusted Illya Kuryakin. The American agent knew this perfectly well. But for Illya, apparently, it had been a bit of a surprise. ... Bucket of ice in hand, Illya Kuryakin strode down the hallway of the hotel he and Solo were currently staying in. He turned right, heavy footsteps muffled on the soft red carpet, and headed towards his room, where he and Solo had been (somewhat tiredly) celebrating the successful completion of their most recent mission. Reaching the door, the Russian pushed it open and entered the room - a sprawling den of plush couches and expensive furniture, with large wooden doors to the right that opened onto the bedroom. The balcony doors at the back of the room were open partially, letting the evening breeze sweep quietly inside. At least Waverly was never stingy about their lodgings, Illya mused as he set the ice bucket on a nearby table. Swinging the room door shut behind him, he continued on into the middle of the room, and then stopped short in surprise. Napoleon Solo was sprawled across the nearest couch, eyes closed, half-finished drink abandoned on the table. For a second, Illya wondered if something was wrong with the American agent. But the thought vanished immediately; the gentle rise and fall of the American's chest spoke clearly enough for his well-being, not to mention the fact that neither spy had been injured at all on their mission (a rare victory). And the possibility of a laced drink was ruled out immediately as well; Illya had had a glass, too. Frowning slightly, the Russian agent moved forward. \"Cowboy?\" he asked, hesitantly. The note of confusion was evident in his voice. \"Something wrong?\" The American shifted slightly, but otherwise made no acknowledgement. Frown deepening, Illya strode to the couch and tapped his partner's shoulder. \"Solo!\" he said. The former thief made no move at all this time, but before Illya could do anything else, the American spoke up. \"Something the matter, Peril?\" he asked calmly, eyes still closed, posture still relaxed. A small wave of relief ran through Illya at the confirmation that the American was indeed all right, but now the Russian's confusion only deepened. \"Everything's fine,\" Illya responded. \"But... what are you doing?\" he asked. This time, Solo opened one eye, watching Illya amusedly. \"It's called sleep,\" he informed him. \"It's this strange thing that human beings need. You may have heard of it.\" Illya rolled his eyes as the American closed his own once more. And he laid there, perfectly relaxed, completely content, and utterly... vulnerable. It was strange , Illya thought, still frowning. To be so open to attack like that. It went against everything he - and doubtless Napoleon, too - had ever been taught about spying. You must remain alert. You must be constantly vigilant. And, above all, you must never let your guard down. And yet here was Napoleon Solo, sleeping calmly in front of a spy. Likely sensing Illya's continued attention, the American agent opened both eyes this time, curiously taking in Illya's troubled expression. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. Illya paused, wondering how best to express just how defenseless the American agent was allowing himself to be. Finally, Illya just shrugged. \"I could've snapped your neck,\" he said bluntly. But the American only grinned. He closed his eyes and settled back into the couch, sinking deeper into its cushions. He flung one arm carelessly over the back of the couch, while the other draped limply over the side, fingers inches from the thick carpet. He was completely unprotected, and he knew it, yet still he remained entirely unconcerned. It bothered Illya. How could he be so untroubled? It's not like he didn't care for his own safety; Illya knew that Napoleon Solo was a careful man. But this... this was not careful. And it made no sense. \"Did you hear me?\" Illya asked finally, perturbed. \"I told you, I could snap your neck.\" Again, the American only smiled. \"I know,\" he said simply. \"But you won't.\" Illya was stunned into silence. The implications of those words crashed over him in one shattering epiphany that hit him like a ton of bricks. The American spy was content to be so unguarded simply because he felt he didn't need to have his guard up. He didn't need to be constantly vigilant. He didn't need to track the Russian's movements. He didn't feel uneasy, or tense, or uncertain. So yes, Illya could quite easily snap the American's neck in two. But he wouldn't. And his partner knew he wouldn't. The truth was obvious now: Napoleon Solo trusted Illya Kuryakin. It was weird. It was a little crazy. The idea that someone could place - had placed - their trust in Illya was an idea that was totally foreign to the Russian. This concept of trust was so different from anything he had experienced before. Amazed, Illya sank quietly into a nearby armchair and watched as his American partner slept on, vulnerable and yet perfectly at ease. Yes, the feeling of having someone's trust was utterly strange. But, Illya realized as the night breeze blew through the balcony doors, he found that he rather liked it.[Chapter 2] \"Finally,\" Napoleon muttered as he slid the hidden compartment on the side of the desk open. As he had expected, a small metal safe awaited within. \"Found it,\" he said, a little louder. Illya abandoned his careful inspection of the bookshelf and hurried over. \"Finally,\" he grumbled. \"It should not have been that hard to find. This is a small room,\" he frowned, glancing around. Indeed, the room they had snuck into was very small, but packed rather tightly with expensive furniture, rare books, and antique collections. The dim lighting in the room had not helped their search either, nor had the distracting noises of the party continuing on down the hall. It had taken longer than it should have, but still they had found it. Finally. \"Well, Cowboy, you had better...\" But Illya trailed off into silence, and Napoleon slid the compartment closed in equal silence. Footsteps. There were footsteps approaching. The Russian growled quietly and scanned the room for places to hide; if they were caught here, the game was up. But the room was full, every nook and cranny bulging with stuff. \"Nowhere to hide,\" Solo remarked disappointedly, reaching the same conclusion. He looked to Illya, who shrugged, and then started towards the door, where the footsteps were steadily approaching. He raised himself to his full, considerable height, and then flexed his muscles, ready to- \"Wait,\" the American blurted. Curious, Illya turned to see his partner reaching purposefully into the nearby liquor cabinet. The Russian was at the American's side in two strides. \"What are you-\" \"Shhh,\" Solo whispered, pulling out a bottle of vodka and unscrewing the cap. He took a quick sip, and then proceeded to splash the rest of the bottle methodically onto Illya's clothes. \"Hey!\" the Russian protested in an angry whisper, but his partner ignored him, instead carefully ruffling up his own clothes. His jaw was firmly set, his eyes calculating, and Illya relented. He knew that expression. The American had a plan. \"Lay down,\" Solo instructed quietly, as the footsteps reached the doorway. \"Close your eyes.\" Illya glared at his partner reproachfully, but dropped to the floor nonetheless. And in the second between Illya feigning sleep and the guard bursting through the doorway, Napoleon Solo had a sudden insight. Lay down , he had told Illya. Close your eyes. And, amazingly, the Russian had done just that. No questions or demanding to know his plan. No arguments or protests. Not even a second's hesitation. And that, the American realized, could only mean one thing. Illya Kuryakin trusted him. A wide, smug smile spread across Solo's face just as the doorknob turned, and by the time the guard barged into the room, Napoleon's giddiness was not entirely an act. \"Hi, there!\" Napoleon greeted immediately. It stopped the guard short, who took in the smiling, disheveled man before him, the clearly unconscious man on the floor, and the pervasive smell of alcohol that seemed to fill the room. \"You're not supposed to be here,\" the guard remarked, his confusion at the scene leaking into his voice, and making the statement sound like a question. Solo only laughed, like it was the funniest thing he had ever heard. This, of course, did nothing for the guard's comprehension. \"Oh man, do I have something for you!\" Solo cried happily, stumbling across the room toward the guard (Solo noted that the man took a step back). \"You work for Mr. Gruber, right? The host of this par- hic! - party?\" \"That's right,\" the guard affirmed, glancing warily at the man on the floor, then back to the drunk now directly in front of him. \"Lemme tell you,\" Napoleon began, slurring his words. \"I made a bet with Mr. Gruber,\" he laughed. \"I did. I made a bet that this man,\" he said, pointing enthusiastically in Illya's general direction, \"could not get drunk,\" he proclaimed proudly. \"I mean, look at 'im! He's a giant.\" The guard glanced once again at the body on the floor, and by the slight widening of his eyes, Solo figured that the other man agreed. \"But Mr. Gruber - the genius that he is - took me up on that bet! He told me where the good stuff was,\" the American explained, gesturing to the liquor cabinet, whose door still hung open precariously. \"And you know what? It worked. That man - hic! - is drunk.\" Solo shook his head in pretend amazement, eyes wide and just a little unfocused. \"So I need you to take this to Mr. Gruber.\" So saying, Napoleon pulled out his wallet and clumsily retrieved some cash, pushing it into the guard's hands. \"Give him that, and tell him he won our bet.\" \"Very good, sir,\" the guard agreed reluctantly, frowning still. \"But you are still not supposed to be here.\" \"Oh,\" Solo remarked, looking suddenly crestfallen. He looked pointedly to Illya's prone form and sighed. \"Want to help me move him?\" he asked the guard. \"But I should warn you, he's kind of an angry drunk.\" Illya took the opportunity to growl quietly in his apparent sleep, a low, ominous sound that made the guard take several involuntary steps back. He glanced again at the open liquor cabinet. \"Well,\" he said. \"I suppose if Mr. Gruber allowed you back here, it would be wrong of me to force you to leave.\" \"Hey, thanks,\" Napoleon grinned, slapping the guard on the shoulder in a friendly gesture that sent his supposedly-drunk self reeling. He grabbed onto the guard to stay upright, and then backed away when he had regained his balance, still grinning hugely. The guard, however, did not look amused. \"Good night,\" he said curtly, folding the money neatly in one hand, and grabbing the doorknob with the other. With one last disapproving stare, the guard shut the door behind him. His footsteps echoed down the hall, and then faded out of earshot. Napoleon moved back to the desk and slid the hidden compartment open once more, chuckling quietly. \"Nice acting,\" he commented as Illya stood up and joined him in front of the safe. \"You're buying me a new shirt,\" the Russian replied unhappily. \"Here, hang on to this,\" Napoleon told him, handing something over. Illya took it. It was the guard's security pass. \"It's so easy to pickpocket people when they think you're incredibly drunk,\" Solo remarked cheerily, expertly twirling the dial on the safe. \"At least now we can go out the back way.\" \"Good,\" Illya huffed. \"As soon as the guard gets to Mr. Gruber, we'll be out of time.\" \"No, we won't.\" \"Of course we will. Mr. Gruber will have no idea what the guard is talking about. You never made a bet with-\" But Illya stopped mid-sentence, suddenly remembering the earlier part of the evening. … It was the perfect time to sneak into Gruber's office, Illya knew. But, irritatingly, his partner had vanished. Somehow, Napoleon had snuck off in the crowd of people at the enormous party, and now Illya had no clue where he was. Sighing, he moved into a quiet corner and began to scan the crowd. He was nearly ready to give up when he finally found the American. He was standing near the wall, conversing easily with... Mr. Gruber himself. With an exasperated sigh, he approached the two men, striding up just as the two shook hands meaningfully. \"Ah, there you are,\" Napoleon remarked quickly. \"I've been looking everywhere.\" Illya suppressed a growl. \"Excuse us, Mr. Gruber,\" Solo continued. \"It was a pleasure,\" he grinned. And then the two spies headed off. \"What was that, Cowboy?\" Illya admonished as soon as they were out of earshot. \"I thought we were supposed to keep a low profile,\" he reminded the American pointedly. \"Hm. Waverly did say that, didn't he?\" Solo mused. \"But you know, for a murderous arms dealer, he's really a great guy.\" … \"I saw you shake hands with Gruber,\" Illya remembered. \"You really did make a bet with him?\" \"Of course I did, Peril,\" Solo smirked. \"So when the guard goes up to him, hands him some money, and says that an American asked to inform that he won their bet-\" \"Gruber will confirm your story. Without even knowing,\" Illya finished, inwardly amazed at his partner's shrewdness. Napoleon nodded, and just then, a rewarding click told them that the safe was now open. \"Hang on,\" Illya wondered. \"Gruber did not see me until after you made your bet. So what did you really bet him?\" \"He claimed he had the best security in the country. I told him any security has its flaws, but he seemed to think his was perfect. He bet that I couldn't find a single flaw in his security if I tried,\" Solo explained, swinging the safe door open with absurd ease. He reached in, grabbed the files they were tasked to retrieve, and then shut the safe door, re-locking it. \"I guess I lost,\" Solo grinned mischievously, sliding the files securely into his jacket. He strode to the door, held it open for the Russian, and shook his head in mock disappointment. \"His security is just flawless .\"[Chapter 3] The mission had started beautifully, which, in hindsight, might have been an indicator that things were soon to go quite horribly south. Illya and Napoleon had snuck into the heavily-guarded building without a single complication. They had retrieved the precious and highly-classified roll of film even faster than they had planned. They had even tampered with several computers for good measure. Of course it had gone too well to last. So now, with his expression carefully inscrutable, Illya watched as Kingston (the man from whom they had attempted to steal) repeatedly sunk his steel-toed shoe into Napoleon's stomach. The Russian's arms were starting to go numb from the vice-like grip of the guard behind him, and he felt a sudden rush of irritation; why did they always pick Solo for these things? Finally, Kingston let up, and stood back to smile at the American agent now gingerly picking himself up off the floor. Then he picked up a pistol from the nearest table, twirled it like something out of an old western picture, and then slammed the handle fiercely into Napoleon's temple. It was a bit harder for Illya to keep his expression blank now. As it was, he tensed; the guard holding him tightened his grip in response. \"Well?\" Kingston asked, crouching down before Napoleon. He grabbed the front of Solo's shirt in a fist, held the American at eye level. \"Had enough yet?\" he growled. Solo said nothing. Kingston laughed and gestured to a nearby guard, who promptly handed over a glistening silver knife. He took two steps toward the American, and then- \"Okay, okay!\" And now Illya was sure his mask had slipped; he was utterly incapable of concealing the blatant surprise he was feeling. If he had not seen it for himself, he never would have believed that that desperate cry had come from his partner. \"Here,\" Napoleon continued, voice strained and broken, and he reached a shaking hand into the inside of his jacket. He pulled out a black film case - the very reason for their mission - and then tossed it away from him. It skidded across the floor and stopped at Kingston's feet. \"Take it,\" Napoleon murmured. \"Just... let us go.\" And now there was no mistaking the pleading tone in his voice. Illya, for his part, could only stare, feeling like he had somehow fallen into an alternate universe. The plea in Solo's voice, the desperation, the shaking hands, the crumpled posture - none of it matched at all with the American Illya had come to know. But then, as Kingston bent down to pick up the surrendered case of film, Illya had a sudden insight. Everything made sense - clicked into place like a completed puzzle - and the Russian almost laughed. If this situation had happened several months ago, Illya would've been upset. Angry. Infuriated, even. How dare the American give into cowardice and willingly forfeit their mission? But now... Illya understood. And although Napoleon remained desperate and shame-faced upon the ground, and Kingston was opening the film case with a smug smile, Illya Kuryakin knew beyond a doubt that his American partner had not given into cowardice, and of course would never willingly forfeit their mission. Illya trusted him. Not to mention, the Russian had come to understand one immutable truth about the former thief: Napoleon Solo had an endless supply of tricks up his sleeves. And so, Illya watched as Kingston looked into the film case, and carefully pulled out a roll of film. \"Thank you,\" Kingston told Solo, with a mocking smile. The Russian agent had another second's glimpse of Kingston's satisfied expression, and then- Boom! In a blinding flash and an almighty roar, the room exploded. Illya came to with a gasp and a cough. Dust was still settling heavily around the room, so Illya was sure he had only been out for mere seconds. The guard that had previously held him was still unconscious on the ground, and so, Illya was pleased to note, were most of the other guards. Carefully, the Russian stood up and brushed small chunks of ceiling off his clothes. He spared no glance at what was sure to be particularly gruesome remnants of Kingston, and instead peered through the swirling smoke for his partner. There - a moving figure. He stumbled towards it, hoping it was Solo. His vision cleared as he moved closer, and sure enough, there was Napoleon, already stumbling to his feet. He, too, was brushing debris off his ever-fancy and expensive clothes, and looked rather upset about their undeniable ruin; Illya supposed this was a good thing. \"Solo!\" he called, and the American looked up. He squinted through the smoke for a moment before seeming to recognize his partner, and then he stepped cautiously over feebly-stirring bodies and chunks of debris to meet Illya. \"You alright, Cowboy?\" the Russian asked immediately, as soon as Napoleon reached him. \"Yeah, yeah,\" Solo replied quickly, waving off Illya's concern with a flick of a hand - a hand that was no longer shaking in the slightest. In fact, Solo's whole demeanor had changed. He was standing with his unerring posture and easy confidence, and straightening his clothes in a businesslike fashion, cool and calm. Illya made a mental note to remember that Napoleon was a highly skilled actor. \"Let's get out of here already,\" the American said after a moment, and together, he and Illya maneuvered through the doorway, grabbing weapons from among the rubble, and then broke into a run down a long hallway. Several turns and corridors later, they figured they were far away enough from the explosion to avoid the hordes of guards undeniably swarming towards that area. Simultaneously, they slowed to a quick walk. \"Ugh, I hate that ringing in your ears after an explosion,\" Solo complained lightly. But Illya was not about to engage in idle small talk; he was still trying to piece together exactly what had happened. \"You gave Kingston a fake film,\" Illya said. It wasn't really a question, but Napoleon nodded anyway. \"Uh-huh.\" \"But that was his film case,\" the Russian noted, remembering the black case in question. \"Yep,\" Napoleon agreed. \"His film case, our film.\" The American reached into his now-tattered jacket and pulled out a bright blue film case. \" Our film case,\" he explained, \" his film.\" \"You swapped them out,\" Illya nodded. Of course he had; the American was one walking, talking show of misdirection and sleight-of-hand. \"And added a little surprise,\" Solo grinned. \"That explosive - you have another one?\" \"Yeah, why?\" \"We should use it,\" Illya suggested. \"We can stop by the room with the fuse boxes on the way out, take out their electricity so they do not catch us while we leave the property.\" \"Sounds good to me,\" Solo agreed, and they turned onto another corridor, heading for the fuse boxes. A couple more hallways, and the room they wanted was in sight. Thankfully, they hadn't run into a single guard; they must still be mostly preoccupied with the explosion. Reaching the door, the two agents stood side by side, drawing dusty but nonetheless functional guns. A shared glance, a nod, and then Illya kicked the door open with a resounding crash. The two burst through, ready to fire, scanning the room carefully, but it, like the rest of the building, was quite empty. Napoleon put his gun away and advanced toward the fuse boxes. Illya followed, gun still out, keeping watch. A question occurred to him. \"What film did you put in there, anyway?\" \"Uh, not sure,\" Solo shrugged unconcernedly. \"I think it might've been the negatives from all those photos Gaby shot of the Grecian coast.\" Illya laughed, remembering Gaby's incessant gushing about the beautiful scenery. \"She won't be pleased with you,\" the Russian warned. But Solo only laughed quietly. \"Ah, she's never pleased with me.\" They reached the fuse boxes, which looked like they hadn't been accessed in months, or even years. A row of dingy old desks was pushed up in front of them, and piles of dusty papers were stacked precariously upon these desks. Solo shrugged and knelt on the dirty floor, pulling a small explosive from a concealed pocket. \"How much time does that one have?\" Illya asked, remembering the short time on the previous one. \"Oh, this one is longer,\" Solo explained. \"Several minutes. We'll have plenty of time to get out.\" \"Good,\" Illya said. He watched as Napoleon got on all fours and crawled beneath one of the desks to reach one of the fuse boxes. \"So, Peril, did you think I really gave it to him?\" Solo asked conversationally, as he stuck the small explosive to the grimy metal. Although the American was hidden by the desk, Illya could hear the wry grin in his voice. \"No,\" Illya told him truthfully. \"I trusted you,\" he explained, turning to scan the surrounding darkness for approaching figures. A small thud made him look back around; Napoleon had banged his head against the bottom of the desk in his hurry to straighten up, and was staring, shocked, at Illya. Several old papers fluttered to the ground. \"What did you say?\" the American asked, utterly bewildered. Illya turned back to the empty room to hide his embarrassment. Had he really just admitted that out loud? He sighed exasperatedly, but his partner remained silent behind him. Rolling his eyes, the Russian looked back to find Napoleon in the exact same position, still watching Illya disbelievingly. Despite the explosive now ticking steadily away, he seemed perfectly willing to remain there until Illya repeated himself. Tick. Tick. Tick. Illya supposed, just this once, there was no harm in admitting it. \"I trust you,\" he repeated sincerely, meeting eyes with the American. Instantaneously, a wide grin began to spread across Napoleon's face; it took everything the Russian had to hold in a laugh. \"Shut up,\" he said instead. \"I didn't say anything,\" Napoleon protested, still grinning hugely. \"Yes,\" Illya agreed with a curt nod. \"Why don't we keep it that way?\" And he turned and stalked out the nearest door, leaving an immoderately cheery Napoleon laughing in his wake.[Chapter 4] (A/N: Originally, this was supposed to be a three-parter, but because of all the wonderful feedback in the way of favorites, follows, and reviews, I've decided to continue this as a collection of one-shots. Thanks, readers! Thank you for favoriting and/or following! And of course, a big hearty THANK YOU to all the reviewers. You are the reason I've decided to continue. And so, without further ado, chapter four: The Gun.) Heavy footsteps, several pairs of them. The quiet humming of the water heater. Gaby's quiet breaths. Every sound seemed weirdly amplified to Napoleon, their surroundings pressing in on him in a confusing wave of senses. The cold concrete floor beneath them. The creaking of the wooden support beams. The reassuring metal of a gun in one hand. Hot, sticky blood against the palm of the other. Oh, right. The blood. Shaking his head to clear his mind, the American agent lifted his hand to inspect the wound on his leg. Still bleeding, but not life-threatening. At least there was that. Everything else seemed to be against them, what with him and Gaby hidden behind a water heater in a neglected basement with several guards on their tail, and somehow left with only one gun between the two of them. Gaby was peering around their hiding spot, and she moved back with a quiet curse in German, followed by another in Russian; Solo wondered briefly if Illya had taught her that one. \"It doesn't look good,\" she told him in a whisper. Her eyes flicked over the wound in his leg and the gun in his hand. Two agents, minus one agent, plus one gun and several pursuing guards. Maybe that wasn't a real equation, but Napoleon was pretty sure it equalled disaster. The footsteps drew nearer, slow and deliberate. They were searching the room, and it wouldn't take them very long to finish. \"Give me the gun,\" Gaby whispered urgently. \"What?\" \"If we stay here, they will find us eventually, and then it's over. But if you give me the gun, I can sneak out now, and take them out before they get to you. It will leave you defenseless,\" she admitted blatantly. \"But I won't let them reach this spot.\" So saying, she held out her hand expectantly. \"Trust me,\" she breathed. Ah, but there was the problem. Trust her? In a sudden, dreadful instant, Napoleon realized that he didn't. Of course, he knew she was an extremely capable agent, sufficiently adept at both shooting and stealth to be able to pull this off - in theory. But, over the course of their time together, Napoleon noted that they hadn't actually had that much time together. On missions, he was mostly paired with Illya, or else worked alone while Illya and Gaby were paired. His missions with Gaby had been relatively few, and even fewer had involved an actual, potentially-dangerous situation. Through no fault of her own, she simply hadn't had the time to earn his trust. Because that was how trust was built - slowly, steadily, over time. Rome wasn't built in a day, and all that. At least, that was how it had happened with Illya - a trust so creeping and stealthy that you never knew it was there until it pounced. But maybe - just maybe - it didn't have to be this way. In fact, she could earn his trust right here, right now, in this moment. What would happen if he blindly trusted, if he handed her the gun? She would either succeed and earn his trust unquestionably... or, she would almost succeed, in which case, he'd be dead, and wouldn't need to worry about such silly things as trust anyway. It was a bit of a gamble, Napoleon knew, but it had been far too long since his last game of cards. \"Hey!\" Gaby whispered sharply, hand waving in front of the other agent's face. Napoleon blinked. Her face came back into focus, eyebrows drawn together, hard eyes softened around the edges with something that seemed vaguely like concern. Huh. That was interesting. \"Solo! You with me?\" \"Yes, of course,\" he assured her, nodding. He placed their only gun securely in her hands. \"Go,\" he said. Half a smile quirked the corners of Gaby's lips, and then she was gone. It was fairly quick. Intermittent bursts of shooting that echoed around the room like a fireworks display. And then, quite abruptly, the shooting stopped. Now only one pair of footsteps remained - light, soft, unhurried. Napoleon was grinning by the time Gaby strolled around the corner. She grinned back, twirled the gun in a show-off kind of way, and then slid it securely into the holster at her belt. \"Ready to get out of here, Mr. Solo?\" she asked, reaching down and helping him to his feet. She looped an arm around him, taking some of his weight to help him stand. \"After you, Miss Teller.\" She raised an eyebrow at him, her eyes lighting up with mischief, and he instantly regretted his choice of expression. Smirking, she took a deliberate step forward, ahead of him. The American lost his balance instantly, teetering precariously. \"Figuratively! Figuratively!\" he amended, grabbing onto her shoulder to keep upright. She laughed, smoothly sliding back into place next to him. \"Together, then?\" she asked. \"Together,\" he agreed. They walked toward the nearest exit, slow and awkward at first. But by the time they emerged onto the manicured lawn, their movements were surprisingly synchronized. They moved quietly through the wet grass, Napoleon's panting breaths misting up in the cold night air. \"You know,\" Gaby mused. \"Together seems to be the best way to do things these days. Wouldn't you agree?\" In response, Napoleon pulled the gun from her belt. She moved with him instinctively as he turned, and had only an instant to be curious, before- bang! In the distance, a figure crumpled - a lone pursuing guard. The American turned back to her, twirling the gun the same way she had, and then slid it back into its place at her belt. Gaby's previous words ran through Napoleon's mind once again, oddly a perfect sentiment in regards to the whole U.N.C.L.E. venture. Together seems to be the best way to do things these days. Wouldn't you agree? He grinned smugly at her, and she rolled her eyes, absently readjusting her grip on him. They continued forward, and Napoleon nodded in the darkness. \"Indeed.\"[Chapter 5] Gaby Teller enjoyed a great many things about her newfound career as a spy - the high stakes, the exotic places, the reliably-frequent rushes of adrenaline, and the mind-bending, double-crossing, triple-crossing strategy of it all. It was fun - a kind of fun that car parts and machine oil had never been. And yet, her favorite moments were ones like these. \"Look up,\" Gaby chided with a smile, as Illya's gaze drifted to the mirror in front of him. His eyes locked with hers for the briefest of moments, and then snapped back up to the textured tiles of their hotel ceiling. \"I can't give you a proper shave if you don't keep your head up.\" Illya smirked slightly, but wisely remained silent; Gaby was bringing the straight razor up to his neck for another go. Hiding a smile, she leaned forward on the back of Illya's chair until her head was against his. The smell of his shaving cream filled her nostrils, and she wondered briefly if he could smell the shampoo in her hair just as strongly. But she was getting distracted. She had to do this right if Illya was going to let her do it again. Privately, she hoped this would become a regular occurrence. Letting out a slow breath, Gaby looked into the mirror in front of them, and then ever so carefully traced a path up the Russians neck with the razor. The blade sung as she lifted it away. She sloshed it in a bowl of water, rinsing off the shaving cream and fine hairs. \"You're good at this,\" Illya remarked quietly. He was watching her in the mirror again. She rolled her eyes to cover her flush of pleasure. \"If you keep looking in that mirror, I'm never going to finish.\" \"Sorry,\" he said, but he was smiling still. He looked up to the ceiling, and Gaby ran the razor up his neck again. Halfway done, and not a single flaw. It was getting easier. \"Thank you for letting me do this,\" she told him, as she cleaned the blade. Perhaps it would seem ordinary and unremarkable for anyone else, but for Illya, it was anything but. He was literally allowing himself to be defenseless in front of another spy with a deadly weapon. If he had shouted to the world that he trusted her, it wouldn't have meant more. He said nothing, possibly because he didn't have to, or maybe because Gaby had started shaving again. Either way, they finished the job in silence. She took a wet towel and cleaned his neck, and then stepped back to admire the job. \"Well?\" she asked. \"Am I hired as your personal barber?\" \"I thought you already had a job.\" \"I do, actually. A very good one,\" Gaby smiled, sitting on his lap. He adjusted his position to better accommodate her. For the second time that day, she felt a sudden rush of affection for their highly unlikely yet astonishingly capable team. For a chop shop girl, an easily-angered KGB agent, and a deceptive, light-fingered jailbird, they were impressive, even by Waverly's standards. Not to mention the unpredictable fact that they all got along beautifully. Coming out of their separate backgrounds of secrets, lies, and betrayal, they had somehow learned to trust each other - to lean on each other like old friends, or loyal family. Gaby loved the quiet moments in which this trust was blatantly obvious. And could she be blamed if she particularly loved the ones between herself and Illya? Perhaps the only thing she loved more was their American partner's impeccable ability to tactfully disappear at the best of times. Like now , she mused, as Illya picked her up and dropped her onto the nearest couch. She watched as he turned and began to clean the remnants of their shaving venture off of the hotel's antique vanity. She made a mental note to thank Solo later, after he returned. Vanity successfully cleaned, the Russian tossed the towel into the laundry basket, and then advanced toward Gaby. She swung her legs over the arm of the couch, crossed them flirtatiously, and then- Brrrring! The phone. Of course, it had to be the phone. Sighing, Gaby watched as Illya headed immediately for it. She could see the exact instant he switched into professional mode. Figuring she had better act professionally, too, she adjusted her position on the couch, and listened intently for the voice on the other end. \"Yes, sir,\" Illya replied. It was Waverly, then. \"No movement so far. We are still waiting.\" Their boss was saying something else, but Gaby couldn't make out anything more than his light tone and classy accent. But she could see Illya's expression, and she frowned as Illya's features hardened into what was undeniably annoyance. \"Everything is fine here, sir,\" he informed him, although his expression said otherwise. A short comment from Waverly, and then Illya was replacing the phone on its hook. \"Where is he?\" Illya grumbled, glaring at the door, and Gaby knew without asking that he was talking about Solo. The Russian strode the length of the room, and peered out behind the window curtains. \"I'm sure he'll be back soon,\" she placated, knowing Solo's uncanny knack for perfect timing. \"Don't worry.\" \"I'm not worried,\" he snapped. \"He can handle himself.\" But his fists were clenched at his sides. Gaby sighed, and crossed the room until she was standing directly behind him. She set a hand lightly on his shoulder, feeling the tension there. \"What did Waverly want?\" she asked. \"Just checking in. He also wanted to know if we were lying low, like we were told.\" The edge of bitterness in his tone was unmistakable. Gaby stifled a laugh, glad that she was hidden behind him. It was just like Illya to fiercely adhere to his orders, and equally just like Solo to ignore them - or, as he would say, justifiably dodge them. She was amazed they hadn't killed each other ages ago. \"Illya, Napoleon knows his orders. I'm sure he won't get into anything.\" Illya opened his mouth to reply, and right on cue, the hotel door swung open. Solo strolled through, and eased it closed behind him. Illya was advancing towards him before he had even crossed the entryway. \"Where have you been?\" Illya asked him angrily. Gaby noticed how Napoleon's gaze flicked almost imperceptibly to the Russian's fists. Checking how upset he was. Smart. \"We're supposed to lie low,\" Illya reminded him. \"Excuse me,\" Solo began, raising his eyebrows in mock indignation, \"are you insinuating that I willfully deviated from mission parameters?\" Illya deflated partially, torn between exasperation and amusement. But Gaby laughed. \"Illya, what on earth would make you think something like that ?\" she asked him, playing along with Solo's humor. \"Napoleon Solo is the epitome of a rule-following agent,\" she declared seriously. Even Illya had to laugh at that. \"Of course I am,\" Solo agreed, straightening his tie cockily. \"Soldier, remember?\" he grinned. \"And art thief,\" Gaby added pointedly. Napoleon smiled at her, shaking his head and dismissing the fact with a wave of his hand. \"Details.\"[Chapter 6] Napoleon Solo awoke slowly and hazily, which had never been a good sign. Dimly aware of this, he kept his eyes closed and body still, wanting to make some sense of the situation first. The low rumbling of a car engine. A padded seat beneath him, and a headrest behind his head. A metal door handle was digging into his side. All of this combined with the tell-tale jostling of the vehicle informed Napoleon that he was in the passenger seat of a car that was driving down a dirt road. So, the million dollar question: who was the driver? Solo listened intently for any indication, but the driver was utterly silent. The American agent was loath to give away the fact that he was awake, but clearly, he wasn't going to learn anything useful by continuing to feign unconsciousness. Reluctantly, Napoleon opened his eyes and turned his head to get a look at the driver. Instantly, stars exploded in his field of vision, and a fierce pain pulsed in the back of his head. \"Ugh, big mistake,\" he groaned, doubling over, eyes shut tight against the pain. \"I told you to lie still,\" chided the unmistakable, heavily-accented tones of Illya Kuryakin. \"Not that you would remember,\" he added. Slowly, Napoleon sat up and blinked the remaining stars out of his vision. He and Illya were indeed trundling down a dirt road, but the darkness of the night and the lack of street lights told him little about their location. \"You have a concussion,\" the Russian told him. \"That's why you're confused.\" Illya's voice was slightly clipped, as if irritated, or annoyed. His grip on the steering wheel and the tautness of his jaw confirmed this. But there was some other emotion that Solo couldn't quite put his finger on. There was a slight crinkle between Illya's eyebrows as they were drawn together. One of his hands on the steering wheel relaxed from the tight grip in favor of tapping restlessly. Not his angry, red-alert tapping, but more of a nervous twitch. Ah, yes. Nervous. The Russian was nervous. Said agent suddenly seemed to realize he was being watched. \"What?\" he asked, looking over at Solo. His light eyes flicked up and down the American's form - a quick check. Hm. Not nervous, then. Worried. Napoleon's lack of a reply seemed to exacerbate this; his fingers tapped faster. Some part of Solo recognized that he should make conversation as an indication of his well-being. But the relentless pulsing of his head and the general haziness that hung around him like molasses made him prefer silence. \"Don't worry, Cowboy,\" Illya said. Even in his semi-befuddled state, the American got the feeling that he was not the one whose worries needed calming. \"We're almost there.\" \"Almost there,\" Solo repeated blankly. The words floated around in his brain, but didn't seem to connect with anything. \"Almost where?\" he asked. Illya sighed. \"The extraction point,\" he answered shortly. \"The mission went badly. Very badly.\" Solo frowned. Had they-? \"It wasn't our fault,\" Illya added, breaking Solo's train of thought, and yet answering the question he hadn't even voiced aloud. Weird , Napoleon mused, distracted. How had he-? \"You asked me last time.\" Illya again answered the American's unfinished, unvoiced question. It took a moment for the Russian's explanation to make sense. Last time? Oh, of course. He had a concussion. And concussed people were extremely prone to repetitiveness. They must have had this exact conversation before. Perhaps many times before. At least Illya's odd mix of irritation and worry made sense now. \"Sorry,\" the American muttered, feeling distinctly disadvantaged. But he did seem to be aware and alert this time (not that he had any memory of any of the previous times to compare it to). So, wanting to offer some encouragement, he added hopefully, \"I think I'm good this time.\" Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the knuckles on Illya's hands whiten as he gripped the steering wheel tighter. \"You said that last time,\" the Russian informed him. After that, Napoleon resolved to keep his mouth shut. He really didn't want to make Illya repeat the same conversation over and over again. Not if he could help it, anyway. So he let his pounding head rest against the cool glass of the window, and watched the night's silhouettes blur as they sped past. He tried to remember what had happened, with mild success. A vague recollection of himself and Illya running across an illuminated lawn, trying to escape a well-conceived setup. Illya had been ahead of him, nearly at the fence, just steps from freedom. But someone had caught up to Solo; he could remember the strong arm that had grabbed him and wheeled him around. And after that, nothing. But he knew what must have happened. \"You came back for me,\" he concluded aloud, forgetting his internal vow of silence. Illya nodded in response. \"You could have left. You could have escaped without me.\" He was thinking aloud now, because his comprehension abilities were barely functioning, and his brain seemed to like this better. \"You endangered your own safety... to help me .\" He blinked, then looked over at Illya, whose jaw had, impossibly, tightened even more. \"You-\" Illya began, but Napoleon cut him off. \"I know, I know,\" the American interrupted, resigned. The two spies finished the remark together: \" Said that last time .\" \"Well, thanks anyway,\" Napoleon continued, after a few beats of silence. He was looking out the window again, determinedly avoiding the sight of his partner's steadily-increasing distress. \"Although, I'm not actually that surprised, surprisingly. I mean, about you coming back for me. It would've shocked me speechless a while ago, but I think I've sort of come to expect it.\" He was babbling now, he knew. Revealing too much. Doubtless making Illya extremely uncomfortable. Solo himself would have been uncomfortable, if he had had the mental clarity for that. \"Not that I'm not appreciative,\" he clarified, probably not too clearly. \"Grateful, yes. But not surprised.\" Illya said nothing, and Napoleon was visited by a sudden desire to vanish, and then reappear once his mind was more cooperative. What if he had repeated himself again? Would Illya be ripping his hair out by now? Unable to contain his curiosity, Solo gave in and risked a glance at the Russian. His partner was silent, watching the road carefully, face illuminated by the harsh glare of the headlights. But there was a slight tightness at the corner of his lips, and Napoleon inwardly sighed in relief. Illya was stifling a grin. \"That was different,\" Illya remarked, after a minute. \"Huh?\" Napoleon cringed at his own speech. Couldn't he be more... what was that word? Ah, yes. Eloquent. \"It was different,\" Illya repeated. \"You haven't said that before,\" he clarified, glancing sidelong at the American. \"Good!\" Napoleon grinned, encouraged. \"Yes, it's good,\" Illya agreed quietly, going back to watching the road. A helpful sign loomed out of the surrounding darkness, and now it was Illya's turn to be encouraged. \"Don't worry, Cowboy,\" he spoke up, wanting to share the good news. \"We're almost there.\" Solo made no reply, and Illya swallowed the curse that sprang onto his tongue. The American had doubtless fallen unconscious again. Perhaps Solo was worse than he realized. Letting out a long-suffering sigh and dreading what he would find, the Russian took his eyes off the road and glanced at the figure in the passenger seat. Napoleon was staring back at him, awake and alert, a hint of amusement and mischief in his eyes. \"What?\" Illya asked him. \"You said that already.\" … (A/N: Hey, readers! Hope you're enjoying!

Catch ya later.)[Chapter 7] They were too close, Illya knew. The explosion that was intended to take out the majority of the guards would quite possibly take Illya and his partner out, too. With that moment of insight, Illya tensed, and then- BOOM! An intense, searing flash of light. A concussive roar of sound. And then, nothing. Illya awoke slowly, sluggishly, breathing in the acrid smell of smoke. He could hear occasional sparks and the intermittent clunks of debris shifting and settling. He opened his eyes. Huh, that was weird. Darkness. Not just darkness - it was pitch black in there. He blinked again, and rubbed his eyes, but the same darkness greeted him again. With a dawning sense of dread, Illya moved his hand in front of his face and waved somewhat frantically. He could feel the rush of wind against his face, but he could see absolutely nothing. Blind , he concluded. He was blind. Assuring himself that it was highly likely to be merely temporary, Illya staggered to his feet. Aside from his unfortunate vision problem, there seemed to be nothing else majorly wrong - just your run-of-the-mill cuts and bruises. But his lack of sight left him feeling uncomfortably vulnerable, and he held his arms out ahead of him, inwardly cringing at how ridiculous he must look. A shift of debris from somewhere off to his right immediately put him on his guard. There was a quiet groan. \"Peril?\" A rush of guilt flooded immediately through Illya, followed by a wave of concern. How had he forgotten his partner? \"Cowboy? I'm here!\" he called. \"Peril?\" Solo called again, loudly. \"Right here.\" Illya figured it would do no good to stumble toward the sound of Napoleon's voice. Blindly navigating a debris-strewn room didn't seem very smart. But he frowned; why hadn't Solo approached him yet? A horrible thought intruded: what if Napoleon was blind, too? \"Follow the sound of my voice!\" Illya added tensely. Just in case. He could hear his partner's footsteps, sometimes on solid ground, and other times clambering over what sounded like large chunks of ceiling. Solo was slowly getting nearer. \" Illya ?\" Solo shouted. The use of his first name and the edge of desperation in Solo's voice had Illya oddly frightened. It was almost as if none of the Russian's previous responses had registered with his American partner. But just then, the footsteps became undeniably close, and then stopped. \"There you are!\" Solo exclaimed, relief flooding his tone. So he can see , Illya noted, as the footsteps rushed closer. A hand gripped his shoulder, and Illya reciprocated the gesture, feeling some of his tension lessen. He felt suddenly grounded, less exposed. \"Are you okay? Why didn't you answer me?\" Solo asked him, still strangely loud. \"I can't see,\" Illya informed him curtly. \"And I did answer you. And why are you yelling?\" \"I'm… yelling?\" Solo's voice had now dropped to a level so low that Illya could barely hear him. The Russian nodded in response, knowing Solo could see it. \"Sorry,\" the American apologized, voice back to a louder volume, but not quite a shout. \"I don't know how loud I am; I can't hear anything.\" \"But,\" Illya protested confusedly, \"you are responding to me.\" \"I'm reading your lips.\" Ah. Well, that explained everything. But unfortunately, that also meant… \"You're deaf?\" \"Yep,\" Solo responded. \"And you're blind?\" \"Yes,\" Illya agreed. \"Wonderful. Sounds like the beginning of a joke. A blind agent and a deaf agent walk into a mission…\" he trailed off ruefully, taking his hand off Illya's shoulder. The Russian had only a second to feel apprehensive, and then Solo's hand was back again, grasping the front of Illya's shirt and leading him carefully forward. \"Five steps down,\" Solo informed him after a moment, and the two descended the steps carefully. \"We're going down a long hallway,\" the American continued, for good measure. Illya could hear their footsteps echoing off the walls. He reached his hand out to his left, and ran it along the wall. Cobbled stone. They had walked several more steps before Illya suddenly realized there was another pair of footsteps approaching from the other direction. But Solo continued casually forward, unaware. Perhaps the guard was around a corner where Solo couldn't see him approaching? \"There's someone coming,\" Illya informed him tensely, but Solo continued forward. Illya mentally slapped himself. Talking to him from behind would accomplish nothing. He reached out and tapped his partner's back in an urgent double tap. He still could see only blackness, but he was sure Napoleon would have turned to look. \"There's someone coming,\" Illya said again. \"Thanks,\" Solo responded. He dropped his grip on Illya and hurried forward, while the Russian stood there, feeling highly embarrassed. He was good for nothing for this escape; he couldn't very well fight while blind. He dropped his hands to his sides, felt something metal in his pocket, and then remembered that he had a gun. \"Cowboy! Wait!\" he called loudly, stumbling forward a couple of steps with his arms outstretched, but it was no use; if Solo wasn't watching him, he would never get the message. The guard must have rounded the corner, because the fighting started suddenly. Thuds and grunts reached Illya's ears. He wasn't sure, but the guard sounded like a big guy, more his own size than Napoleon's. The Russian blinked in rapid succession, hoping against hope for a miracle. But still, there was nothing to see. \"Solo!\" he called again, wishing fervently that his partner would happen to spare him a glance. \"I have a gun! Use my gun!\" But the fist fighting continued, and Illya was pretty sure he heard the guard laughing; the Russian was all too aware how idiotic they must seem. For the moment, though, Illya didn't care. If Solo would be able to get the gun, the fight would be over. So he kept trying. \"Take my gun! My gun!\" He wasn't quite sure why he was yelling; he could very well stand there and mouth the words. But at least shouting was allowing him to vent some of his frustration. A particularly loud thump reached him; it sounded like someone had been thrown against a wall. A pained curse from Solo told Illya all he needed to know about his partner's odds. Illya tapped his fingers restlessly against his leg, trying to contain a sudden rage, caught between a fervent desire to help and an obvious reason not to. But then, the lighter pair of footsteps approached him. \"Excuse me,\" Napoleon said loudly. \"I need your size.\" Utterly bewildered, Illya felt his partner move behind him, gripping the Russian's shoulders. The guard's heavy footsteps rushed toward them. \"Duck!\" Napoleon yelled, pushing Illya down slightly. He felt his hair ruffle where the guard's blow barely missed his head. As they stood, Napoleon angled him slightly to dodge yet another blow. After a couple of movements, Illya found it surprisingly easy. They were unbelievably, impeccably in sync, and each slight movement on Solo's part had Illya moving smoothly along with him. They had dodged every hit, and the guard was getting seriously annoyed; Illya could hear his exasperated huffs. \"Twelve o'clock!\" Solo yelled. Understanding in an instant, Illya slammed his fist straight in front of him, and grinned as it connected solidly with their opponent. They ducked again, shifted. \"Two o'clock!\" Illya's heavy blow struck home again. He could hear Napoleon laughing behind him. They fell into a smooth, easy rhythm for the next minute or so, dodging and aiming at Solo's gleefully shouted instructions. The guard was now screaming in rage. \"12:45!\" Napoleon shouted. There was a moment of silence as all three men contemplated that. \"Sorry,\" Solo groaned. \"Got confused.\" A ferocious kick from the guard cut off Illya's intended response, and sent him reeling backwards into Solo; they crumpled to the ground in an ungraceful tangle of limbs. But this, Illya quickly realized, was exceedingly fortunate; the gun in his pocket was now digging obviously into Napoleon's side. \"What the-?\" Solo wondered amazedly. Illya felt the gun slide quickly out of his pocket, and then- Bang! There was a resounding thud as the guard hit the ground; Illya didn't need to see to know that the shot had been lethal. Beside him, Solo slumped, breathing heavily. \" Why didn't you tell me you had a gun ?!\" … The guard hurried down the hall alone, gun at the ready. The few of them remaining after the explosion had fanned out in separate directions, not knowing which path the two intruders would take. It was a guessing game, in these labyrinthine halls. Sighing impatiently, he turned a corner, and then stopped short in surprise. There they were, just ahead of him. The two intruders were making their way down the hall, side by side, each with a hand firmly grasping the other's shoulder. Strange , the guard mused. Undaunted, he hurried forward. \"Halt!\" he shouted, cocking his gun so that the sound echoed through the stone hall. The bigger, scarier-looking agent stopped immediately, but the other one continued forward a couple of steps before seeming to notice that his counterpart had stopped. The guard watched him turn to the other. \"What?\" he asked him. An American, the guard noted. \"There is a guard behind us, with a gun,\" the other responded in a heavy Russian accent. \"He told us to stop.\" Carefully, the guard advanced. \"Stop talking to each other,\" he commanded. The Russian remained silent. The American's gaze moved from the Russian to the guard, and then back again. \"What's going on?\" he asked. \"He wants us to stop talking.\" \"We did stop walking.\" \"No, talking .\" \"Oh.\" With that established, the two intruders turned to look at the guard, who felt suddenly nervous and under-qualified. Why were these intruders behaving so strangely? He gripped his gun tighter, flustered. \"Put your hands in the air,\" he ordered. Again, the Russian complied, but the American, who was watching the other end of the hall, presumably to see if more guards were coming, ignored him. \"I said put your hands in the air!\" the guard shouted, annoyed. But the American ignored him still. The guard stalked further down the hall, closing more of the distance between them. He watched as the Russian double-tapped the American's shoulder, who turned to look. \"What?\" he asked. \"He wants us to put our hands in the air.\" \" Stop talking to each other !\" the guard snapped. It would be nice to have the two intruders for questioning, but at this rate, he was nearly ready to shoot them and be done with it. At least the American had finally complied, raising his hands steadily into the air. The Russian tapped him again. The American turned. \"What?\" \"He wants us to stop talking.\" At that, the American turned to the face the guard. \"I'm not mocking you,\" he explained to him, unnecessarily loudly. \"I'm just deaf.\" \" What ?!\" the guard yelled, nearly beside himself. He strode forward until he stood right before the two of them, his trigger finger itching. The American turned back to the Russian when he tapped him yet again. \"Not mocking . He wants us to stop talking .\" The American looked confused. \"You said that already,\" he said, turning to the guard again. \" I know! \" the guard raged in response. \"But you keep doing it!\" He took a deep breath, willing himself to remain calm, to not let these intruders get under his skin. His boss had always warned him that his temper would get him in trouble. \"I'm taking you in for questioning,\" he informed them, with a forced calm. He raised the gun again, pointing it first at the Russian, and then the American. They were at point-blank range; there was no escaping now. The American tapped the Russian this time. \"What?\" \"He's pointing a gun at us.\" \"Thanks, Cowboy, but I think that's obvious. I'm sure he wouldn't be pointing it at the wall while threatening us,\" he remarked, blinking rapidly. The American was watching the Russian intently, concentrating, supposedly in an effort to understand him. The guard wasn't sure whether he was buying their act or not. But either way, they were both ignoring him, as if he wasn't even in the room, the Russian staring vaguely in the American's general direction, and the American watching the Russian in case he spoke again. The guard cleared his throat loudly. \"Start walking!\" he commanded, intending to march them straight to his boss. But the American, predictably, didn't move. And there was the Russian's infuriating double-tap again. \"What?\" \"He wants us to start walking.\" The American gave the Russian a funny look in response, causing the guard to raise his eyes to the heavens in a wordless gesture of immense exasperation. As such, he missed the American's quickly-stifled grin. \"I love dancing as much as the next guy-\" \" What?! \" the guard interrupted furiously. \"-but I'm not gonna waltz with you, Peril.\" \"Not waltzing. Walking .\" And there it was. The guard snapped. He launched himself at the American with an infuriated roar, but the intruder was quicker. In one fluid movement, he reached forward to point the gun safely downward, and then cleanly snapped the guard's wrist. The guard only had a moment to howl in pain before- \"Three o-clock!\" The Russian's staggering blow hit him full in the face. He stumbled backwards two steps, and then fell into unconsciousness. … Gaby revved the engine impatiently as the two figures hurried toward the getaway van. They stumbled towards the driver's side, and Gaby leaned out the window to get a good look at them. Their clothes were hopelessly tattered and burnt, but they seemed alright aside from the expected cuts and bruises. \"You okay?\" Gaby asked them quickly. \"Sure,\" Solo confirmed, watching her carefully. \"Except that I'm deaf and he's blind,\" he added, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Illya. They hurried around to the other side of the van. \"Very funny, Solo.\" She rolled her eyes, watching them. Solo was clearly leading Illya around. Huh. That was a joke, wasn't it? \"Oh, wait!\" she called after them, as they headed toward the passenger side. \"Don't get in the front passenger side! There's a pile of weapons on the seat; they'll fall out if you open the door.\" She watched, bewildered, as Illya leaned forward, and double-tapped Solo's back. The American turned around expectantly. \"Don't open the passenger side door. The seat is stacked with weapons.\" Napoleon nodded and continued on to the back door. He pulled it open, then moved Illya in front of it. \"One step up,\" he informed him. Illya clambered awkwardly in, and Solo filed in after. As they buckled in, Gaby hit the gas, and they sped away into the night. She watched her two partners carefully, half disbelieving, half concerned. She could completely see Solo playing a joke like this, but Illya would never have gone along with it. \"You two are seriously blind and deaf?\" Solo was looking out the window, and didn't respond. After a moment of silence, Illya spoke. \"Yes. There was an explosion; we were too close.\" \"Wow.\" Gaby didn't know what to say to that. \"It's temporary, though, right?\" Illya smiled encouragingly at the headrest of the passenger seat. \"I'm sure.\" They drove on in silence for a while, and Gaby's curiosity mounted. Her eyes flicked to the rearview mirror. Illya was blinking rapidly, a look of intense concentration on his face, and Solo was looking right back at Gaby, equally concentrated. She grinned. \"I have to ask. How on earth did you two get out of there?\" To her surprise, Illya chuckled quietly. \"The same way we do everything else.\" … (A/N: This chapter was inspired by the side-splitting comedy \"See No Evil, Hear No Evil\" starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. If you haven't seen it, I'd highly recommend it for a good laugh.)[Chapter 8] \"I cannot believe you.\" Illya's accent was heightened and sharpened out of sheer irritation, his hands curled into tight fists. His whole body was rigid with tension, but he could make no physical action, strapped to the seat as he was. Yet he still glared at Solo, whose brief display of genuine surprise did not go unnoticed. But the American said nothing, and after a couple of seconds, the floor vibrated beneath them, the sputtering of an engine filled the silence, and then they were in motion. Solo walked through the back of the van until he reached the divider that separated them from their captors. He pressed his ear to it, listening with a look of intense concentration. After several moments, he grinned and turned back to his bound partner. \"Hey, they're taking us to the big guy himself!\" But Illya did not grin back, and in fact was still seething. \"I know that,\" the Russian snapped. \"Marino has wanted us dead for months. Did you think they were going to drop me off at the closest hotel?\" \"No.\" The American shrugged his jacket off, and began tearing a long piece of fabric off his shirt. \"I thought maybe I could hitch a ride to the nearest bar, or casino. I could use a drink. Or a nice game of cards.\" Solo looked up to meet Illya's eyes, but got only a heated glare in return. His partner's continued anger killed his cheery mood, so he strode over to Illya in professional mode instead. \"How bad?\" Solo asked shortly, wrapping the strip of fabric around the deep cut in Illya's side. He tied it tightly, watched his partner hide a wince. \"Not bad. It's not going to kill me.\" Illya was pointedly looking away from Solo, watching the trundling metal doors at the back of the van and wishing the American had never come through them. \"I still can't believe you,\" he spat through gritted teeth, turning his gaze back to Napoleon. And again, some corner of his mind registered that Solo was actually surprised at his anger. But the soldier-turned-thief-turned-spy didn't miss a beat. \"Of course you can't believe me; half of everything I say is a lie.\" \"You know that's not what I mean. I can't believe how much of an idiot you are.\" Illya's hands are still clenched in tight fists, his posture unnaturally straight. \"They captured me , Solo. Not you.\" \"Yes,\" the American agreed evenly, his eyes darting again to the wound in his partner's side. \"I'm quite aware.\" \"Then why ,\" Illya ground out, \"did you feel the need to sneak onto this van with me?\" Solo has started to get irritated, too; Illya can tell by the set of his jaw. \"Because,\" Solo responded, with forced levity, \"Gaby would kill me if I let them take you like that.\" \"Well, congratulations, you've saved her the trouble of doing that. Since you've decided to tag along, Marino will just kill us both. I'm sure Waverly will be so proud; you just ensured your own unnecessary death.\" Napoleon blinked at him, finally understanding why Illya was so upset. He wasn't mad that Solo had come to save him; instead, he was convinced that Solo's last-second slip through the closing van doors meant that Marino would now kill both agents, instead of just the Russian. Illya was annoyed because, in his view, Solo was going to die for nothing. \"You know, I never noticed before…\" Solo began slowly, tilting his head to watch Illya contemplatively. The sudden switch in tone was so confusing that the Russian seemed to momentarily forget his anger. He watched Solo curiously, wondering what the American's supposed revelation had been. \"You're just a bright ray of sunshine, aren't you?\" And there it was. Illya's anger had returned. \"This is not the moment for jokes, Cowboy,\" Illya growled. But Solo was unconcerned; they were at least on better terms now. Illya had returned to nicknames. \"Ah, but Peril, it's always the moment for jokes,\" Solo mumbled idly, wandering back over to the divider. His eyes swept the entirety of their confines, each blank, unhelpful metal wall. \"Anyway, you shouldn't be such a drama queen.\" Illya rolled his eyes. \"Neither of us is gonna die. Well, okay, eventually. But not tonight. And certainly not at the hands of Marino.\" And, for the first time on their tense ride, some of Illya's anger began to melt away. His features shifted from irritation to determination, and he nodded curtly at his American partner. Perhaps Solo had not doomed himself by jumping into the van as an unnoticed, unplanned captive. If Solo thought that they could both make it out alive, then Illya would just have to trust him. He hadn't let him down yet. \"You know,\" Solo said conversationally, \"I always thought that I could've been an escape artist.\" His tone was light, but Illya knew him well enough to know that his idle remarks were merely to conceal the depth of his concentration and internal planning. It worked very well on many unsuspecting adversaries, and the habit had ingrained itself to the point where, in a chess match, Solo cracked incessant jokes whilst demolishing his opponent. Illya knew Solo's attention was only half on their conversation, but he replied anyway; it was a nice distraction from the relentless stinging in his side, too. He wondered briefly if Napoleon knew that. \"An escape artist?\" Illya echoed. \"No, I don't think so.\" \"Why not?\" Napoleon shot back, mockingly offended. \"Because, Cowboy, you were in prison .\" \"Well, I'm not now, am I?\" he retorted smugly. Illya found he didn't have a reply to that, so he merely huffed in annoyance. \"Are you going to untie me?\" the Russian finally asked; he was still strapped to the seat while his partner paced freely. \"Or did you just tag along to annoy me?\" But Solo had stopped in his tracks, as if struck. He turned slowly to face Illya, his expression calculating, pensive. \"No,\" he said slowly. Then he nodded, mostly to himself. \"No, I think it's better if you stay strapped down.\" So saying, he pulled a revolver out of his pocket and began fiddling with it, his hands moving in quick, precise movements. Illya was just about to ask what he was doing, but Solo hummed in thought and began explaining. \"I think we'll have an unfortunate car crash,\" he said matter-of-factly, \"in which the driver tragically meets his end. And his coworker, well, of course he dies, too. Their captive, meanwhile, miraculously makes it out and-\" Solo stopped. \"Wait. Scratch that.\" Illya waited to hear Solo's new improved plan. The American finished messing with the gun, and slid the chamber back into the revolver with a snap . A grim smile flashed across his features. \"There's an explosion,\" he announced. \"No one survives.\" \" What? \" \"Well, it is an awfully big explosion. And the car is just so incinerated by the time help arrives that there is no hope of examining the wreckage. Everyone is presumed dead.\" Ah, now Napoleon was starting to seem less insane. \"Presumed?\" Illya repeated, catching Solo's wording. \"Why, yes. Marino, he loses two of his guys, but hey! Those annoying U.N.C.L.E. agents that have been getting in his way are out of the picture! And you know what? Marino celebrates. Maybe even relaxes. Maybe even starts to get… careless .\" \"You want to fake our deaths. Lure him into a false sense of security.\" \"This mission has been dragging on for months as is. We're already deep. But we go just a little bit deeper, and Marino is ours. He'll get careless when he thinks no one's watching.\" \"Okay,\" Illya agreed. \"Deeper.\" Solo smiled at him, and then, without warning, threw open the divider and stuck his revolver through it. \"Stop the vehicle!\" Solo screamed, brandishing the gun at the driver. There was something clumsy and amateurish about his attempt, and as the captor in the passenger seat wrestled the gun just slightly too easily out of Solo's grip, Illya knew instantly that everything was going according to plan. The passenger aimed the gun right in Napoleon's face, and time seemed to slow as the nameless henchman's finger tightened around the trigger. Solo slammed the divider shut again, and ducked. BANG! The wall separating the two agents from the driver's cab dented outward with a metallic crunch , and Napoleon was thrown backwards from the force of the small explosion triggered by the rigged gun. Illya was shoved sharply, too, and the movement tore painfully at the wound in his side; he was glad that Solo had left him strapped in. But the van was now beginning to veer off course and pick up speed. The two agents shared a tense, worried glance, and then they were shoved roughly in the opposite direction. The van had plowed straight into something solid and unmoving. The back of the van lurched upwards with the force of the impact, and then dropped back onto the ground with a resounding thud; clouds of dirt drifted in through the misaligned back doors. \"Cowboy?\" Illya groaned immediately, coughing at the dirt that hung in the air. \"You okay?\" he asked the drifting dust. \"Better than you, I'm sure,\" Solo responded. He stood carefully, his silhouette now visible in the thick air. He approached Illya immediately, seemed to materialize a knife from nowhere, and set to work cutting the straps restraining his Russian partner. Soon, the final strap slipped off, and Illya stood gratefully, one arm moving to cradle his injured side. Solo made no comment on this, but met his eyes, a silent question. The Russian nodded in response, an unspoken reassurance. Napoleon handed Illya a flask of alcohol from inside his jacket, and Illya, without needing to be told, began pouring it on the van floor. Solo wrenched open the back doors and disappeared into the darkness outside; Illya knew without asking that he was tampering with the van's gas tank. When the Russian deemed the inside of the van to be sufficiently flammable, he put his hands in his pockets and strolled outside, stopping to admire the enormous tree that their van had barreled into. Napoleon met him, and wordlessly, they each tossed a small item to the other. Illya caught a small first aid kit, presumably fetched from the van's glove compartment. Solo caught Illya's box of matches. The American pulled one out and struck it; the warm glow illuminated his grinning face, and Illya was suddenly glad that Solo had slipped in through the closing van doors. \"We are going to let Gaby in on our scheme, aren't we?\" Illya asked him. His breath misted in the cold night air. \"Are you kidding me? She would kill us if we didn't.\" \"No,\" Illya disagreed. \"Just you.\" Solo laughed, and flicked the match.[Chapter 9] (A/N: A reversal of roles from the previous chapter. Thanks to Tamuril2 for suggesting that Illya reciprocate Solo's actions in \"The Van\". Please enjoy \"The Redux\", and as always, thank you so much for reading!) Illya followed them at a distance, stealing glances from hidden shadows, listening carefully to the heavy steps of the guard marching in tandem with Solo's uncoordinated scuffling. They turned down several corridors, each as unremarkable and unfamiliar as the next. Illya tried his hardest to keep his bearings; it would do them no good to get lost on their way out. Finally, the footsteps stopped, and Illya peered carefully around the corner. It was empty except for the lone guard and Solo, and the only room down the whole length of the hall was a single cell with barred doors. These doors were currently being unlocked by the guard, somewhat clumsily, as his other hand was busy gripping the back of Solo's jacket to keep him in some semblance of an upright position. Illya sighed inwardly, and surveyed the hallway again. It was too long; the guard would undeniably see him coming and shoot him before he could get anywhere near close enough to take him out. And he doubted the guard would leave his partner's cell unsupervised after he had been placed in it, even in his current state. So, there was only one thing left to do. As the guard swung the barred door open with a screechy protest of rusty hinges, and shoved Solo carelessly inside, Illya stepped into view and walked down the hallway towards the guard. Amazingly, the guard didn't notice. And yet there was no hope that Illya would be able to get to him before he did notice. So the Russian stopped where he was and cleared his throat pointedly, raising his arms in surrender. At the sound, the guard whirled around, gun at the ready. \"You!\" he shouted, immediately recognizing Illya as his prisoner's partner. \"Don't try anything, or I'll shoot!\" \"I'm not trying anything at all,\" Illya placated, moving slowly forward with his hands still signifying surrender. To his immense amusement, every two steps he took had the guard moving a step backwards, although he still kept his gun trained steadily on the Russian, finger on the trigger. Eventually, Illya was even with the cell doors, the guard watching warily from a few feet away. But still the other man said nothing, apparently waiting to see what Illya would do. The guard's hard expression slackened as the Russian silently strode into the cell, and then pointedly closed the iron doors, effectively taking himself captive. The guard's mouth dropped open, forming a comical \"o\" shape, and it was only after a few seconds that the man abruptly shut his mouth with a clack of teeth, and rushed forward to lock the cell doors, presumably before Illya could change his mind. With the cell now secured, the guard continued to stare, baffled, at the Russian, who held the guard's gaze in a nonchalant manner, as if he regularly walked himself into captivity. The guard blinked at him once more, and then turned and started dazedly down the hall, beginning his back-and-forth patrol of the long dark corridor. As soon as his steps faded out of earshot, Illya turned. Solo was no longer on the floor where the guard had dropped him, but was instead splayed out across the single wooden bench in the cell. He took up the whole length of it, lying flat on his back, arms folded neatly across his chest. \"Cowboy.\" Illya moved forward to stand in his partner's line of vision, voice low so as not to be overheard by the roaming guard. Solo, for his part, blinked up at the Russian with unfocused eyes. Illya waited patiently. Another blink. Another. Ah, there it was - the American grinned in apparent recognition. His eyes moved from Illya to the iron bars encasing the two of them, and back again. \"Is this a thing now?\" he asked finally, with a winning smile. \"Are we a package deal?\" \"Shut up, you idiot. The guard will hear us,\" Illya warned him, unamused. \"Amazing deals on U.N.C.L.E. agents! Get yours today!\" \"Solo…\" \"Catch one agent, get one free!\" \"Solo!\" Illya hissed. \"Hurry up and catch your agents, folks, because these deals are criminal .\" \"…Are you done?\" Illya asked him, after a moment of silence. But the American didn't answer him. His giddy smile faded, his eyebrows pulled together, and he seemed suddenly to get a grip on himself. He uncrossed his arms and pushed himself part of the way up, wide eyes staring at the dirty stone floor. \"What?\" Illya asked him. \"Did… Did I just make a really horrible pun?\" he whispered hoarsely. \"Yes.\" At this, the American sighed and slumped back onto the bench. \"What did they give me?\" he asked tonelessly. \"I don't know,\" Illya answered shortly. The image of the needle being jabbed into Solo's neck, and the frankly alarming speed with which his partner's expression dulled, popped into his mind. He shook his head, partly to clear it, and partly to respond to the American's resigned question. \"But I hope it wears off soon,\" Illya continued, glancing out the doors to see if the guard was nearing. \"It's making you even more intolerable than usual.\" A barely-stifled chuckle drew Illya's attention, and he turned back to find Solo shaking in silent laughter. His brief moment of lucidity had passed. With a long-suffering sigh, Illya stood over his partner once more and tapped him to get his focus - or at least, to get as much focus as Solo was currently able to grab hold of. The American bit his lip to keep from laughing, and looked up expectantly. \"Come on,\" Illya ordered gently, pulling Solo up into a sitting position. \"We're going to get out of here, and I'm going to give you the simplest job possible, okay? You think you can handle it?\" Solo bobbed his head a little excessively, which wasn't the most encouraging of signs, but Illya pressed on anyway. \"Get on the floor,\" he continued. \"Don't move, and don't make any noise.\" Illya wasn't sure how well a drugged Solo could follow instructions, but he had to trust that somewhere in his addled mind was the motivation to work with Illya, and not against him. Without looking to see if Solo would comply, without giving himself a moment to doubt his plan, Illya strode forward and pressed himself against the bars. \"Hey!\" he called, banging on the bars impatiently. \"Help! Hurry!\" The cacophony echoed through the empty hall, and the guard rushed over, eyes narrowed, jaw clenched. \"What do you want?\" he snapped. \" What do I want? \" Illya repeated, practically bellowing in outrage. \"You idiots!\" He spat several Russian curses in a heated stream. \"Do you want us for questioning, or not? Because if you do, we need to be alive , wouldn't you think?\" One of the guard's eyes twitched. \"What do you mean?\" His voice wavered the tiniest bit. \"What I mean is that this American agent is dying because you overdosed him!\" At this impassioned declaration, the guard stepped forward, trying to look around Illya, to see for himself. Almost there. Illya shifted to the side to provide a view for the guard, who stepped forward again. So close. \"Look at him!\" Illya urged, pointing aggressively at his partner, who, he was pleased to note, was playing along quite well. \"He hasn't moved since you so kindly threw him on the floor , and he is barely breathing.\" The guard, evidently to watch for the rise and fall of Solo's chest, moved one more step closer. There . With lightning speed, Illya reached his hand through the bars and grabbed the guard's shirt, slamming him forward into the iron bars. He slumped, immediately unconscious. Illya quickly rummaged through his pockets for the ring of keys, and upon finding them, began shoving random ones into the lock, hoping fervently for a fast match. The fifth key he tried slid satisfactorily in, and a heartening click echoed through the corridor as their cell door finally unlocked. \"Yes!\" Illya cheered quietly, shoving the door outwards and moving the guard's prone form with it. \"Let's go.\" He turned to find his partner in the same position. \"Solo,\" Illya hissed. \"You're done; we need to leave now.\" But still Napoleon remained motionless and unresponsive. Illya hurried over to him and knelt at his side, studiously ignoring the knot in his stomach. \"Wake up!\" To Illya's immense relief, Solo did just that, stirring and then watching the Russian uncomprehendingly. \"Peril? Wha's goin' on?\" He stared intensely at Illya, clearly making a great effort to focus. Another brief moment of relative clarity, it seemed. But there was no time to explain; someone was bound to come check on the agents soon, and they had better be a good distance away by then, if they had any shot at all of escaping. \"No time to explain,\" Illya told the bewildered American. \"Come with me, and keep a lookout if you can.\" Illya stood and pulled Solo to his feet as well, who steadied himself and then nodded, urging Illya ahead. Napoleon followed him quietly and without comment, and Illya was suddenly fiercely grateful that after everything, Solo could wake up in utter confusion and yet blindly follow him without question, reluctance, or suspicion. After passing through several corridors without running into a single soul, Illya had moved from being grateful for their unusual luck, to being highly suspicious of it. Something, somewhere, had to go wrong. Tensing, he slowed his pace as he turned the next corner, and then stopped abruptly. There were three guards down that very same hallway, miraculously wrapped in a conversation that meant they failed to notice the Russian spy standing only several feet away. Illya had a second to be relieved, and then Solo barreled into him from behind. The two spies lurched forward, stumbling conspicuously into the middle of the hall, and thus into the center of the guards' attention. The three guards instantly moved forward and surrounded them, drawing their guns, and then exchanging uncertain glances as the American suddenly burst into laughter. Illya tried to shoot him a warning glance, to wordlessly tell him to be quiet, but clearly, no form of communication was going to penetrate Solo's drug-induced state. The American continued to laugh, face flushed and eyes beginning to water, before he finally doubled over in near-hysteria, clinging to Illya's shoulder to stay upright. \"I'm sorry,\" he managed to gasp in between shouts of laughter that made Illya cringe. \"I didn't see you stop, and, I just - I just kept going!\" Illya ignored his elated partner and instead quickly scanned the corridor, looking for something - anything - to help their disastrous plight. The guards, meanwhile, were frowning at Solo, shifting their guns in their hands uneasily. In fact, Illya noticed, Solo was holding their attention entirely. The corridor offered nothing to aid their escape, so, Illya supposed, his partner would have to do. \"Sorry,\" Illya muttered quietly to Solo, before shoving him directly into one of the guards. Caught by surprise, the guard was knocked to the ground by Napoleon's dead weight. The other two guards, though momentarily stunned by the unexpected action, leapt forward, but Illya was quicker. The Russian had often taken two armed men down without being armed himself, and he made short work of them. As the second man slumped to the ground, Illya turned back to Solo, and was inexpressibly relieved to see that the American had at least had enough sense to wrestle the guard's gun away, and pin him down with it. Illya knelt beside his partner, and gently but firmly took the firearm out of his hands. He used the butt of it to knock the guard out cold. \"Keep moving,\" he told Solo urgently, grabbing him and pulling him back to his feet once more. Illya could feel the heat through the American's jacket as he pulled him along, and made note of the fact that Solo's face was still brightly flushed - unhealthily so. \"How come you get the gun?\" the American asked, a good five minutes after leaving the three unconscious guards behind. \"Because,\" Illya informed him quietly, \"you're not allowed one right now. You would probably shoot yourself on accident.\" The Russian spared a quick sideways glance at his partner, who looked momentarily affronted at these words. But he nonetheless continued to follow Illya obediently, indeed almost absent-mindedly. He was silent for the length of another corridor, apparently mulling this reasoning over. \"But,\" Napoleon spoke up eventually, \"I was a shoulder.\" This strange pronouncement nearly made Illya stop walking; as it was, he slowed his pace out of utter confusion. \"What?\" \"I can handle a gun, because I was a shoulder ,\" Napoleon repeated emphatically. Illya shot him an appraising look. The American was now looking confused, mouthing the word \"shoulder\", evidently perplexed about something. Illya shook his head and focused instead on their path. They turned another corner, and were met with stairs. Illya's heart lifted. They were going the right way. But now Solo was beginning to slow down, his steps becoming worryingly unsteady. \"We're almost out of the building, Cowboy. It won't take long.\" Illya put his arm around his partner, taking some of his weight, and the American hummed his thanks. They reached the top of the stairs, and saw a door just ahead, a promising breeze flowing from underneath it. The sight encouraged both spies, and the pair picked up their speed as they neared it. \"Soldier!\" Solo shouted suddenly, making Illya jump. \"Where?\" Illya pulled the gun and scanned the surrounding darkness warily, moving both of them back into a concealing shadow. \"No, not there ,\" Napoleon informed him amusedly, as if Illya had been silly to jump to that conclusion. \" Me .\" Illya dropped the gun and stared, bewildered, at his partner. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Soldier,\" Solo repeated. \"I can handle a gun, because I was a soldier .\" He grinned widely at Illya, who stared stoically back for several moments, internally reminding himself that Solo was drugged and not in his right mind, and therefore not to be held accountable for his actions - or words, for that matter. The Russian let out a slow breath, and then spoke with forced calm. \"Yes, you were a soldier. Can we go now?\" Solo nodded in response, and walked around the Russian, sweeping out the door ahead of him. Sighing, Illya followed, swinging the door open. He made it two steps onto the spongey grass before he was tackled from behind, the gun flying out of his hands and into the overgrown lawn. For a fleeting fraction of a second, Illya thought that Solo had run into him again, but in the next instant it was he who slammed into Solo , propelled forward by the unknown tackler behind him; all three of them landed sprawled in the wet grass. The attacker had Illya around the neck from behind, but the Russian maneuvered skillfully out of his grip. He stood in front of Solo, who was still lying in the grass, to face their assailant, ready and eager to take the man down in a pleasing fist fight that would surely relieve some of this calamitous night's stress. But the guard, instead of advancing on Illya, shoved a hand in his coat; it emerged with a glint of silver, and Illya realized his mistake with a sudden sinking feeling. Hopelessly, recklessly, Illya surged forward with a desperate idea to knock the gun out of the guard's hand, but he had barely moved before- Bang! It was the startled surprise in the guard's eyes, more than anything, that told Illya he was safe. The guard's surprise melted into confusion, and together the two men looked down at the revolver in the guard's hand. It hadn't been fired. Their united gaze shifted from the unfired gun to the American on the ground a few feet away. The spy held a pistol that was smoking heavily in the chilly evening, kept aloft by surprisingly steady hands. Illya grinned. The guard collapsed. \"You're welcome,\" Solo announced pointedly, almost dropping the gun as it felt suddenly heavier. Illya took it and pocketed it smoothly, watching as his partner's discerning gaze became increasingly vague and unfocused, a tell-tale sign that his helpful moment of lucidity was fading fast. \"Package deal!\" Napoleon shouted suddenly at the guard's dead body. Illya urgently shushed him, but was ignored. \"Mess with one U.N.C.L.E. agent, get another one free!\" \"Shhh!\" Illya cautioned yet again. \"We're not out of this yet. But we're so close. We just need to keep quiet , and we will be fine. Yes?\" \"Yes,\" Solo agreed, still a little on the loud side. \"Good.\" Illya leaned down and pulled Solo to his feet for what he hoped was the final time that night, and together, they headed quietly for the edge of the property line. After a fifteen minute walk, with pauses for hiding, the two agents arrived at their unmarked vehicle. Illya laughed shakily in relief, unlocking the passenger door and holding it open for Solo, who all but collapsed into the seat. The Russian shut the door behind him, and then crossed to the driver's side. Illya climbed in, slid the keys into the ignition, and leaned his head back against the headrest, eyes closed, feeling suddenly drained. He could very easily have fallen asleep there, but he knew they would need to get further away - preferably all the way back to their hotel - before they could finally rest. Or at least, he would have to wait, as he was the driver. Solo could sleep, and probably should . Illya frowned at the realization of the long silence that had gone on, and wondered if Solo had drifted to sleep already. Peeling his eyes open, he looked to his side. Napoleon was leaning forward, elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, fingers gripping his hair tightly. \"Hey,\" Illya said quietly. \"You okay?\" Solo looked up, eyes clearer than they had been all night, but he was slouched unnaturally. He ran his hands through his hair, looking to the floorboard beneath his feet, and then eventually meeting Illya's gaze again. \"Uh, did… I mean, am I…?\" he trailed off, blinking rapidly at the floorboard once more. \"Is this real?\" he asked finally, looking back to his partner. \"Yes.\" A quiet curse. \"They gave me something?\" \"Yes.\" Another breathless curse, German this time. \"Messed with my head,\" he groaned. Silence, and then: \"Was I a complete idiot?\" \"No more than usual,\" Illya told him good-naturedly. But Solo shot him a sharp look. \"Okay,\" Illya relented. \"Maybe a little more than usual.\" The American sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, eyes closed tightly. He wasn't his usual good-humored self, but instead bowed his head, exhausted and defeated. Illya simply started the engine. \"You know,\" he said, \"this is why I hate working with you, Cowboy.\" And to the Russian's immense relief, Solo sat up and glanced over, features alight with sudden appreciation, and grinned - a tired half-grin, but a grin nonetheless. \"You're a terrible spy, Peril,\" the American responded quietly, settling back into the seat. \"You, too,\" Illya told him. But Solo was already asleep.[Chapter 10] \"No.\" \"Come on, Illya. You know we promised we'd let him know how it went.\" \"We can call him.\" \"No, we're going to go see him, right now.\" \"Our room telephone works fine.\" \"This is ridiculous, Illya. We're already here.\" Gaby used her left hand to gesture at the door before which they had stood for several indecisive minutes; a few drops of water flew off of her sleeve with the movement. \"And you know this will cheer him up.\" \"He will laugh.\" \"Of course he will,\" Gaby agreed, smiling herself. But Illya was still flushed with embarrassment. Gaby could practically feel the heat of it radiating off the Russian in waves, despite the fact that both of them were currently drenched. \"He's probably sleeping,\" Illya returned eventually, a half-hearted protest. \"You know he isn't,\" Gaby rejoined patiently. \"Besides,\" she began, grinning with triumph; this was one point he would have to give in to. \"If we go to our own room, do you have anything to get these off?\" She moved her right hand pointedly, pulling Illya's left hand along with it. They both looked down at the handcuffs linking them together. \"Fine,\" Illya relented after a moment of deeply frustrated silence. Then he stretched out his right hand and knocked on the door. \"Cowboy,\" he called, raising his voice to be heard from within the room. \"It's us.\" There was a shuffle of movement from inside, quiet footsteps approaching the door. Gaby heard Illya sigh resignedly, and then the two agents watched as the room door swung open. Solo stood in the doorway, polite half-smile curving his lips in greeting. His dark hair was still more disheveled than usual, and he had swapped his normal high-end clothes for warm pajamas. He was slightly pale, nose a bit red, posture just slightly off of its regular military-style erectness. But all in all, Gaby noted, he was looking better. She watched as his eyes traveled over their waterlogged clothes, dripping steadily into the hotel's carpet, and finally settled on the handcuffs that chained the two of them together. His polite smile morphed further into a face-splitting grin the longer he examined their situation. Gaby suspected he was only containing full-on laughter in respect of Illya's obvious discomfort. \"Wow,\" Napoleon spoke finally, voice raspy and grating. He cleared his throat. \"It went that well, huh?\" he asked them, grinning hugely. \"That's right,\" Illya responded, nodding curtly. \"Go ahead. Get all of your terribly witty one-liners out of the way now.\" But Solo just continued to stare at them, inordinately happy about their apparent misfortune. After a minute, he shook his head. \"I've got nothing,\" he said with a shrug, undying grin still planted firmly on his face. Illya looked disbelieving. \"As fun as this is to stand here handcuffed and soaking wet,\" Gaby interjected, \"are you going to let us in, or just stand there smiling?\" \"Do I have a choice? I'd rather just stand here and-\" But Gaby cut Solo off with an impatient huff and pushed the door open wider, letting herself and Illya in. Solo closed the door behind them as they headed to a nearby dresser and began opening drawers at random. \"We need something to get these idiotic things off,\" Illya explained. \"Do you have those clunky bolt cutters of yours?\" \"Well, sure, you can waste your time digging them out,\" Solo told him. \"Or you can just come over here and I'll pick that in two seconds.\" The pair exchanged glances before heading back to stand before the American, holding out their hands to present the cuffs for his inspection. Napoleon moved forward for a closer look, holding a small metal tool that they hadn't seen him pick up. And then he stopped with the tool floating an inch from the cuffs, expression suddenly blank. \"What?\" Gaby asked. Solo blinked bemusedly at the cuffs for another second, a slow smile working its way back onto his face, and then he was laughing. He bit his lip in an effort to contain his apparent mirth, but then started laughing again almost immediately. The two cuffed spies watched him double over in extreme amusement, still holding their hands out, steadily getting more and more annoyed. \"Cowboy!\" Illya snapped. The American straightened up, still trying to smother the hilarity. \"Sorry,\" he apologized, looking distinctly not sorry. But then his quieting laughter gave way to coughing; he turned away quickly from the other two, holding out a finger in a \"give me a minute\" gesture. After his slight coughing fit had passed, he turned back to them, clearing his throat, and somehow still grinning. He impatiently waved off Gaby's unspoken concern, and then pointed at the glinting handcuffs. \"Please,\" Solo croaked joyously. \"Please, please, please tell me how you managed to get stuck in these.\" \"What do you mean?\" Illya asked. \"They're handcuffs. If you don't know how handcuffs work, you're definitely getting worse and not better.\" But Solo continued to grin at them, undeterred. \"They're magician's handcuffs.\" \"How did you know?\" Gaby asked, gaping, while Illya cursed quietly. \"Anyone who knows even the simplest sleight-of-hand will know what these are,\" Solo explained, chuckling lightly. \"But how come nobody told me there was a magician involved with this mission?\" \"First of all, because you're not supposed to be involved in the mission, as you're supposed to be resting ,\" Illya put in pointedly. \"So if you're not up to undoing these, then we'll just be on our way.\" He made as if to leave, but Solo rushed forward. \"Alright, alright,\" the American placated. The handcuffs slid off their wrists before they had even realized he had started on them. \"Secondly?\" Solo prompted. Illya frowned, rubbing his wrist where the cuffs had been. \"Secondly,\" he admitted, \"because there was no magician involved in this mission.\" \"There wasn't? Then how did you get cuffed with these? Why would non-magician arms dealers use these to cuff you?\" \"No, no, no. They did not cuff us,\" Illya answered shortly, marching toward the bathroom cabinet and pulling out thick towels for himself and Gaby. \"Okay, then I'm lost.\" \"The handcuffs and the…\" Gaby trailed off and gestured to her soaked clothes. \"None of that had anything to do with the mission, actually.\" She caught the towel that Illya tossed her, and then crossed the room to the cabinet that held emergency bags for each of the three agents, pulling some dry clothes from her bag. \"The mission went fine,\" she declared proudly. \"Ah, does that mean I owe you?\" Napoleon asked her. Illya, toweling off his hair, stopped to watch the two of them suspiciously. \"Owe you?\" the Russian echoed. \"No, it was a draw,\" Gaby told Solo, ignoring Illya. \"You were wrong about the first thing. We were actually very good at pretending to be strangers, thank you very much, and they did not peg us as a team.\" \"Well done!\" Solo grinned. \"But you were right about the night ending in a shootout,\" Gaby continued. Solo nodded knowingly. \"So we're even.\" \"Huh, a win-win situation,\" Solo mused, settling himself into one of the room's cushy armchairs. Gaby hummed in pleasant agreement and headed over to the bathroom to change. But Illya stepped in front of the bathroom door, blocking her. \"Hold on, hold on. Did you two make a bet about the outcome of the mission?\" he asked them, equal parts incredulous and annoyed. Gaby just smiled and stepped around him, darting through the door and closing it behind her. \"No, of course not!\" Solo informed Illya. \"We made two bets, of equal amount. That's why we ended up breaking even.\" Illya stared at him for several seconds, apparently decided it was simpler to let the whole thing go, and strode over to the still-open cabinet to fish out some of his own clothes. \"So?\" Napoleon asked him eventually. \"How did the magician-less mission go?\" With a resigned sigh, Illya gathered an armful of dry clothes and dropped them onto the plush couch across from Solo. He himself did not sit, but remained standing, damp and intermittently dripping, a respectful distance away from the hotel's nice furniture. The American continued to watch him eagerly, so Illya folded his arms and nodded in acquiescence, compliantly fulfilling his story-telling role. \"They didn't suspect us at all.\" … Illya followed a cheerfully-whistling Miller through a lavish hallway, Waverly's calm matter-of-fact instructions running through his head. If possible, we would like you two to simply get in and get out, establish a rapport with Miller. We know next to nothing about the way he runs his criminal operation, and having you two get in on it would be a tremendous help towards determining the extent of his reach. However, with that said, our lack of knowledge on Miller does mean that you are more or less going in blind. The hallway ended in a door, which Miller held open for Illya with a smile. Passing through it, Illya found himself in a spacious room, already occupied by three men and Gaby - or Sylvia Vogel, to everyone else. Miss Teller will be on the demand side of the operation, representing a potential purchaser of Miller's finest missiles, while you, Kuryakin, are coming from the supply side. You are an acquirer of particularly destructive arms, and are looking to turn a profit by aligning your specialties with Miller's organization. \"Mr. Volkov,\" Miller announced, addressing Illya politely, \"please allow me to introduce Miss Vogel. She has come to me as a representative of one… Mr. Hartmann?\" He looked inquisitively to Gaby, who nodded in confirmation. \"Mr. Hartmann,\" Miller repeated. \"He is looking to purchase a rather large batch of high-quality missiles.\" At this, he grinned jovially, like a baker negotiating the sale of several dozen pies. Illya nodded curtly, without comment; Miller had helpfully taken an immediate liking to Illya, being, as he had laughingly rejoiced, \"a man of few words and even less nonsense!\" The Russian had every intention of playing to this advantage, and so was resolved to conform to Miller's image of him. \"Oh, and these men,\" Miller added as an afterthought, \"are with me.\" He gestured to the three expressionless men, who nodded at Illya in acknowledgement. Illya nodded back, taking careful note that all three of them were armed; the holsters on their sides revealed glinting silver handles. If the situation does escalate to one in which violence is necessary , Waverly had added pleasantly, do try to capture Miller alive. That way we will at least have him for questioning, you understand. \"Now,\" Miller continued pleasantly, \"I must correct a small misconception on your part, Miss Vogel - or rather, on the part of your boss, Mr. Hartmann.\" So saying, Miller nodded to one of his men, who subtly moved behind Gaby. She glanced nervously at the man, moving forward to distance herself from him. But the man simply moved closer to her again, causing Gaby to look to Miller for an explanation. Illya, on his part, was fighting very hard to not tense up at the obvious threat. Volkov didn't know her, and wouldn't be the slightest bit upset at a threat towards her. So Illya kept his expression neutral, watching the scene unfold with vague disinterest. Gaby was trusting him to play his part, just as she was playing hers. One wrong move on his part could expose them both. There was simply no room for error. \"I'm afraid I don't understand,\" Gaby spoke finally, voice small with an almost imperceptible waver. She looked pleadingly at Miller, desperate for an explanation. \"You wish me to deliver a message to Mr. Hartmann?\" \"Oh, no, my dear,\" Miller corrected lightly. \"You are the message.\" Another nod had the man behind Gaby moving forward with startling speed. He grabbed her roughly, forcing her into a kneeling position in the middle of the room. Illya's world went suddenly red, but then- \" Remember your cover! \" It was Gaby, speaking in German, sobbing in fear in the middle of the room. To Miller and his men, she had resorted to hysterical pleas in her native tongue; they could not understand German, and so were oblivious to the spies' disguised conversation. Illya, however, could understand her perfectly. He blinked the edges of red out of his vision, and internally thanked Solo for the helpful tip. He had been the one to suggest that they use German or Russian, respectively, if they needed to communicate without the others catching on. Illya had been doubtful of this plan, but Solo had been completely confident. Trust me , he had said (or rather, whispered scratchily). They're American. They'll only know English. And he was right. \"I'm sorry, darling,\" Miller told Gaby, moving forward with a smile. \"It's nothing to do with you, Miss Vogel. It's just that I'm not the type of man you send your secretary to. If Mr. Hartmann wants to do business with me, he's going to have to show his face, and since he lacked the courtesy to do so, he'll have to learn the hard way.\" \"Are you going to kill me?\" Gaby asked him quietly, breathless with terror. \"No, Miss Vogel, I won't. Because, you see, this is a great learning opportunity for someone else.\" Miller nodded to his other two men, who moved behind him like bodyguards. \"Mr. Volkov!\" Illya moved forward without comment, making a point to look neither eager nor reluctant. \"It's time for you to get a feel for how I do business! If you're going to be on the team, you'll need to show me you can play the game. Not that I doubt you, of course, but… you understand my caution, I'm sure.\" \"What do you want?\" Illya asked him bluntly. Miller laughed again, loud and showy. \"Straight to the point. I like it.\" He pulled a pistol out of his coat, handed it over to Illya. Behind Miller, the two guards drew their own guns - a wordless warning. \"You are going to shoot her,\" Miller pronounced. Illya held the gun steady, safely lowered toward the ground, considering this. \"You want me to kill her?\" he confirmed, nodding at his tearful partner, still held in place by Miller's third man. \"Yes, indeed.\" \"Okay,\" Illya said. He shot Miller in the knee. The arms dealer crumpled to the ground with an agonized howl, as Gaby slammed her elbow backwards in a vicious blow to her captor's groin. She grabbed the gun from his holster and knocked him out with the butt of it, while Illya turned his gun on one of the thoroughly-surprised guards still standing behind Miller's huddled moaning form. Illya shot one guard, and Gaby shot the other with her newly-acquired weapon. Both dropped dead before they could fire a single shot. Together, Illya and Gaby knelt beside Miller, Gaby wiping the tear tracks off her face in annoyance. Illya forced Miller into a sitting position, watching him breathe an endless stream of pained curses. \"Nice work,\" Gaby commented lightly. \"He's alive.\" \"Yes,\" Illya spat distastefully. \"Fortunately for him, that's how Waverly wants it.\" … \"Impressive,\" Napoleon commented lightly. \"So you called Waverly for an extraction team and that was that, huh?\" \"Yes,\" Illya nodded as the bathroom door opened and Gaby walked out, hot steam swirling behind her. She unwrapped the towel from her hair and began drying it vigorously. \"Did you tell him how it went?\" \"I told him about the mission, yes.\" \"But not about the handcuffs!\" Solo interjected. Illya rolled his eyes and walked into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him with a little more force than necessary. They heard the shower head sputter and then spray. \"You're going to tell me, right?\" Solo asked Gaby eagerly. \"Of course,\" she laughed. She tossed her towel near the bathroom door, and then crossed to the hotel room's cart of drinks. \"It was really my fault, so I should be the one to explain.\" \"I just have to know, who handcuffed you with magician's handcuffs? It's such a strange thing to have.\" \"Not for a magician.\" Gaby crossed over to Napoleon with two drink glasses, and handed one to him before sitting down on the couch with the other. \"You're saying a magician handcuffed you two?\" Solo laughed. \"Yes, something Illya was very perturbed about. You see, after we finished the mission, it was so nice out that I insisted on walking back to the hotel. And of course, there was all the usual nightlife on the street.\" \"Like street magicians.\" \"Exactly. And there was one performing, and I made Illya go and look. And of course he picks us to be his volunteers from the audience. Everybody was watching us so expectantly, and the magician just looked so excited, I couldn't say no. So we went up there, and he- What?\" Gaby asked suddenly. Napoleon was frowning intently at his glass of clear liquid. \"What's the matter?\" \"It's water,\" he said, looking at her accusingly. \"You're sick,\" she responded evenly. \"But-\" \"Anyway,\" she pressed on. \"We went up there, and the magician handcuffs us together. He tells the audience he will free us, and says this loud, showy magic spell. And then…\" \"And then?\" Solo prompted quickly. \"And then he can't get them off.\" \"What?!\" \"Turns out, he was a very amateur street magician. This was apparently his first night performing.\" Gaby grinned as Solo predictably proceeded to find her story terribly amusing. \"What rotten luck!\" he managed hoarsely. \"Oh, that was only the beginning of our rotten luck. Because I then forced Illya to walk through the park with me, thinking it would be lovely and romantic. And it was! Up until the sprinklers turned on.\" \"No!\" Napoleon shouted joyously. \"Oh, yes. So we had to run to the nearest exit, and then had to walk the remaining five blocks while soaking wet and handcuffed by a failed street magician.\" Solo was now doubled over in his seat, alternatively laughing and coughing, apparently very much enjoying the mental image. \"I wish I was there to see that. Except I also don't, because I could've gotten the cuffs off of you, and I really, really enjoyed you two showing up at my door in magician's handcuffs.\" \"I figured you would,\" Gaby acknowledged, grinning. Her smile faded ever so slightly as she glanced at the bathroom door. \"Illya probably hates me right now, though.\" She was only half joking. Solo noticed. \"Nah, he doesn't.\" Gaby turned to find Solo smiling at her encouragingly. \"I know he hates that street magician, though. I am honestly very surprised he didn't kill him on the spot.\" \"Yes, Illya was very good at not killing people today,\" she laughed. \"Ah, well.\" Solo shrugged. \"There's always tomorrow.\"[Chapter 11] Napoleon Solo strolled easily into the kitchen, his feet kicking up broken tiles scattered on the floor. He wasn't concerned about making noise anymore; he was positive their man was long gone anyway. Still, he surveyed the kitchen carefully, taking in the worn cabinets, the empty shelves, the half-destroyed tile floor with its pieces laying in careless heaps about the kitchen, and the thick layer of dust that had accumulated over everything. \"Find anything?\" he asked, and Gaby popped up from behind the kitchen counter, a scowl on her face and dust in her hair. \"No,\" she reported. \"I don't think he's here. In fact, I don't think anyone has been here for years.\" She looked towards the grimy kitchen window. \"I doubt Illya has had any luck either.\" \"Probably not,\" Solo agreed, joining her behind the counter and noting the empty cupboards and drawers Gaby had pulled open. \"Although he'll definitely take longer to search. The grounds are a complete mess. He'll be wandering around in the field of weeds for a while yet.\" \"Good thing, too,\" said a voice. Gaby and Napoleon whirled to see a man dressed in all black saunter through the kitchen door. Four men filed in behind him. \"I take it you're looking for Bernard Leitner, too?\" asked the stranger. He shoved his hands in his pockets casually, while his men drew their guns behind him. \"Any information you'd like to share?\" \"Not particularly,\" Solo shrugged, inwardly cursing. They weren't prepared for a firefight. He glanced quickly at Gaby, who shook her head almost imperceptibly. No weapons either, then. \"Well,\" the man continued, \"if you're not going to help us, then I'm afraid you're in our way.\" He drew his own gun now. \"Are you two going to go quietly?\" he asked. Solo sighed. The ruined kitchen had nothing to offer them. Nothing except... \"Pan?\" he asked Gaby. She eyed the heavy cast iron frying pan sitting atop the stove. Her gaze flicked quickly around the unhelpful room, and she sighed too, undoubtedly coming to the same conclusion. There was nothing else. She nodded at Solo, looking steeled, determined. \"Why not?\" she replied quickly. \"Pan?\" the stranger wondered. \"Is that code for-?\" Bang! Napoleon swiped the pan off the counter and slammed it into the man's head mid-sentence. He crumpled instantaneously. Taking advantage of the others' surprise, Gaby vaulted herself over the counter and kicked two of their opponents backwards. They fell hard onto the ruined floor, guns sliding across the tile and burying themselves in kitchen debris. \"Pan!\" she yelled, throwing her hand out in Napoleon's general direction. She didn't have to wait more than a second before it was in her hand. She used it immediately, swinging the heavy cast iron with lethal force. \"Pan!\" Solo yelled from across the room. Gaby threw it back. At the other end of the kitchen, Solo caught it easily and slammed it into the jaw of the man that had just started to gain the upper hand against him. The pan cracked sickeningly against the man's jaw. Napoleon grinned in fierce triumph. \"Pan!\" Gaby yelled frantically, and Solo looked to see her struggling with one of their attackers, the two of them twirling around in a weird parody of a ballroom dance. He hesitated, watching carefully. Timing was everything. \"Pan!\" Gaby yelled again. Solo hurled it. Just then, Gaby turned to check the status of the pan. Her eyes widened comically as she realized it was on a violent path towards her head. She ducked quickly, and the cast iron sailed over her and straight into the face of her opponent. She watched him drop, and then turned to glare at Solo. \"You almost-\" she blocked an incoming punch from another assailant. \"-hit me!\" she yelled angrily. \"You're welcome!\" he called, turning away briefly from his current opponent to meet eyes with Gaby. He met eyes with the pan instead, and ducked. It sailed over his head this time, felling his opponent with a resounding clang . He looked at Gaby, astonished. \"Hey! That could have killed me!\" They both knew it couldn't have. Her aim was just as good as his, and his reflexes just as quick as hers. \"You're welcome!\" Gaby called back. Solo laughed as he retrieved the pan and used it to knock out the last man in his vicinity. Now only one remained, trading punches with Gaby. \"Pan!\" Solo warned, and Gaby held out a hand without taking her attention off her opponent. The American threw it precisely into her waiting fingers, and with another loud bang , the kitchen was silent. The two agents met eyes, panting breathlessly in the aftermath of the scuffle. They started to grin. Clink . Napoleon frowned and leaned around the counter to look for the source of the noise. One of the attackers had regained consciousness, and was on his hands and knees, attempting to sort quietly through the rubble in a quest for his lost pistol. Solo motioned to Gaby, who handed him the pan. He approached the other man silently. \"Watch out!\" Gaby yelled suddenly, but it was too late. Another man had sat up and kicked out at Napoleon's feet, effectively sending him toppling to the floor. Solo raised the frying pan, but Gaby got there first. With an angry yell, she kicked him hard in the head, and the man toppled, unquestionably out. The U.N.C.L.E. agents turned their attention back to the first man, but the extra time afforded by the second man had allowed him to finally find his gun. With a triumphant shout, the man pulled it from the rubble and aimed it at Solo. Wildly, thoughtlessly, the American brought up the frying pan. Ping! The bullet went straight through the cast iron and plowed into the cupboard an inch to Napoleon's right. Everyone stared. And then Napoleon used his free hand to slam the man's wrist into the ground. The gun skidded back into the pile of rubble while Gaby happily delivered another knock-out blow. \"I always wondered what would happen if you shot a cast iron skillet,\" she remarked with a grin. She laughed breathlessly, bending forward slightly to rest her hands on her knees. \"Well, now we know.\" Solo got to his feet, equally cheerful and equally breathless. He watched as Gaby stumbled away from him to go lean on a countertop. After a moment she cursed quietly. \"What is it?\" Napoleon asked, moving quickly towards her. \"Were you hit?\" \"Yes,\" she said, and his stomach dropped. \"By a sudden and profound realization,\" she panted, \"that we're both idiots.\" \"Wait, what?\" He reached her side, and his confusion vanished. Her hands were around a decrepit drawer she had pulled open, one hand around the loose drawer knob. Her other hand was underneath the drawer, to help support the weight of a couple dozen sharp, glinting knives - steak knives, butcher knives, carving knives, slicing knives. Napoleon suddenly felt like stabbing himself with one of them. \"How,\" he despaired, pained and breathless, \"did we miss that?\" Gaby frowned at him. \"We didn't,\" she said. \"We didn't miss a drawer full of knives, because there was no drawer full of knives. This never happened. Nobody finds out. Especially Illya.\" \"Agreed.\" Heavy footsteps echoed from the empty hall, and the two agents turned to see Illya walk into the room. Gaby moved quickly in front of the knife drawer. They watched him glance around the ruined kitchen at all the assailants, eyebrows raised the tiniest bit at the unexpected development. He didn't bother with examining them closely, looking instead to Gaby and Napoleon. They nodded. Gaby leaned back on the knife drawer in a would-be-casual pose. The drawer broke. With an impossibly loud clattering, the knives crashed to the floor amidst old splintered wood, spilling out onto the kitchen tiles and making their presence known. All three agents stared. Illya's brow crinkled, and Gaby and Napoleon watched with dread as he looked around the room once more, now curiously examining the prone forms of their opponents. His eyes moved from one to the other, doubtlessly noting the absence of knives and knife-inflicted injuries. He was surely also noticing the frequency of blunt force injuries. Napoleon suddenly remembered he was still holding the frying pan. Slowly, he set it on the closest counter. Illya watched, amused. As if in slow motion, Solo slid the condemning kitchenware away from them, across the counter. The cast iron squeaked loudly. Gaby sighed. \"Huh, I would have gone for the knives,\" Illya remarked lightly, while the other two internally cringed, bracing for the impending humiliation. \"Frying pan.\" He weighed the words, nodding approvingly at the attackers on the floor. \"Impressive.\" Napoleon, surprised, glanced quickly at Gaby. Her mouth was hanging open. She shut it with a clack. \"Well, what are you two standing around for?\" Illya asked. \"Let's go.\" \"Where to?\" Gaby asked, jumping hurriedly into business mode and following him back through the hall. \"Woolworth's?\" Illya suggested. \"The department store?\" Napoleon wondered. \"Why?\" \"Rolling pins, mixing bowls, cookie cutters,\" the Russian rattled off. \"You know.\" He grinned back at them. \"All your standard combat gear.\" (A/N: Thank you for 100+ favorites and follows!

Napoleon checked his watch, they were late. They passed the security controls and entered the building. Waverly was waiting for them in the main hall. He greeted them with his usual wide, warm smile. \"Miss Teller, gentlemen.\" He checked his watch. \"You're late.\" Napoleon exchanged a glance with his partners. Even though Waverly was still smiling pleasantly, they knew their boss well enough to detect the hint of annoyance in his affable tone. A security guard led them to the room where the meeting would be taking place. Waverly thanked the man and, instead of opening the door, he turned toward Napoleon. \"Oh and Solo, please try to tone down the snarky remarks this time.\", he said with a small smile. Napoleon opened his mouth to answer but Waverly was already turning back toward the door. Yes Sir… Before he followed Waverly inside the room, he glanced back at his partners and caught a glimpse of Illya's mocking half-smile. Thanks for the support, Peril… The room was a regular meeting room with tables arranged in a U-shape, and chairs which looked comfortable although Napoleon knew from experience that they actually weren't. At all. His former handler, Adrian Sanders greeted them curtly. Another man was standing in one corner of the room and nodded at them. Sanders invited them to sit down. Of course… Napoleon felt his lips curl up into a smile. He suspected that his former handler used those chairs on purpose to torture his \"guests\" during lengthy meetings. He watched as Gaby and Illya fell into the trap and sat down. Waverly chose to sit on the edge of one of the tables and Napoleon followed his example. Sanders shot him a stern look but said nothing. \"Well, Adrian, I think we're ready to start. I'll let you bring my… our agents up to speed.\" Napoleon caught the brief look of annoyance in his former handler's eyes. Sanders hated to be told what to do, but he also knew not to underestimate Waverly. Seeing those two cooperate together was going to be interesting. Sanders started pacing as he addressed them. \"I think you all remember agent Asher Marshall? You had the pleasure of meeting him when you somehow managed to get involved in one of his undercover assignments several months ago.\" \"Believe me, it wasn't intentional, Sir…\" \"Solo…\" Napoleon could hear the warning in Waverly's tone and did not insist. Gaby chose this moment to come to the rescue. \"We haven't heard from agent Marshall in about eight months. How is he doing?\" \"Well that's something we would all like to know, Miss Teller. Marshall went missing while working on an assignment, it's been two weeks.\" Napoleon frowned. \"Wait, wasn't Marshall shot in the leg during his last mission? I thought he was supposed to take it easy and not work in the field for a while.\" \"The doctors gave him the all clear a couple of months ago.\" \"And you sent him on an undercover mission so soon?\" \"This is not summer camp, Solo! Marshall is a field agent, it's his job and he's good at it, as long as he can walk and fire a weapon, I don't see why I would refrain from using him. Besides, it was supposed to be a simple information gathering mission with no infiltration work involved.\" \"What type of information was he supposed to gather?\", Illya asked. Napoleon glanced at him and couldn't suppress a slight smile as he noticed how the big Russian kept trying to adjust his position in the extremely uncomfortable chair. \"Well I might be able to elaborate on that, Kuryakin. If Solo is done whining about the way I treat my agents…\" \"Please go on, Adrian.\", Waverly said placatingly. Napoleon's gaze fell on Gaby, she looked tense and he knew it had nothing to do with her chair. She was worried about Marshall. He hadn't had occasion to meet the young agent face to face but apparently he was a nice guy. And in his opinion, anyone who had worked with Sanders for a prolonged period of time deserved a medal. He returned his attention to his former handler. \"…so, a few months ago, when we came across traces of suspicious financial transactions between somewhere in Devon, England, and some shady private company in America, we immediately wondered why such large sums of money were circulating between the two places and why the people involved were so intent on covering their tracks. Of course we started by investigating the American company but, despite our agents' best efforts, that trail rapidly went cold. The next logical step was to send someone to find out what was going on in Devon.\" \"So you sent Marshall.\" \"So I sent Marshall. The idea was to find elements that would allow us to resume the investigation in America. Like I said, it was a simple observation and information collecting assignment. Marshall's investigation led him to a small village in Dartmoor. During his first week there, Marshall reported back regularly. Although there wasn't much to report apart from the fact that most of the locals seemed to belong to some sort of secret society.\" Napoleon raised an eyebrow. \"What, like a masonic organization?\" \"Something of the kind, Solo. On a much smaller scale though, and apparently it is tied to some kind of peaceful nature worshipping cult. Marshall was a bit hazy on the details. Anyway, he described them as friendly but extremely secretive people. The following week I received another report from Marshall, he had been talking to some people from neighboring towns to gather information about this secret society. Nothing salient came out of it. Apparently no one knows much about the society and no one has had any reasons to complain about it. A few locals mentioned two cases of people disappearing in the area but those were isolated incidents and didn't seem connected to our investigation. Then in Marshall's final report, his discourse had changed. He suspected that some of the members of that secret society were not who they pretended to be and might be linked to our investigation. He concluded that he would need to infiltrate the society to learn more. Of course I granted him permission to do so. It was the breakthrough we'd been waiting for. Since then I've heard nothing from him.\" \"So you think that that secret society in Devon might in fact be a tiny branch of a larger international criminal organization?\" \"That's what we suspect, Kuryakin. And Marshall's last report and sudden disappearance would tend to confirm those suspicions.\" Gaby's p.o.v. As Sanders stopped pacing and looked at them, Gaby shifted nervously in her uncomfortable chair. What did you get yourself into, Asher?.. Then Solo asked the question on everyone's mind. \"So you want us to rescue Marshall? What makes you think he's still alive?\" \"Nothing.\", Sanders replied, resuming his pacing. \"To be honest I would be extremely surprised if Marshall wasn't already dead. This is not meant to be a rescue mission, Solo. This is more about not letting the investigation die with agent Marshall.\" Gaby felt her heart sink as she pictured Marshall's smiling face in her mind. She exchanged a glance with Illya. \"He could still be alive.\" \"Don't get me wrong, Kuryakin. If it does turn out to be a rescue mission then all the better. But your team's primary objective will be to infiltrate the secret society and find out what Marshall was on to before he disappeared.\" Sanders turned to Waverly. \"Now, since you've kindly accepted to let me borrow Kuryakin and Miss Teller – not you, Solo, I own you, remember? – I decided to add another of my agents to the team to balance things out.\" He nodded toward the corner of the room and the man who had been leaning against the wall walked up to them. He had been so quiet the whole time that Gaby had almost forgotten his presence. \"Agent Owen Blake, here, knows everything there is to know about the whole investigation and he has memorized the transcripts of Marshall's reports. He is also an expert in hand to hand combat and received medical training which might come in handy in case things get…complicated.\" Gaby observed the man with renewed interest. He was tall, broad-shouldered, in his late thirties, reddish-blond hair, piercing blue eyes and a winning smile. Now that she was seeing him up close, Gaby couldn't shake the impression that she had seen him somewhere before. Sanders and Waverly exchanged a few more words while the four agents stood awkwardly, looking at one another. \"Well, if you don't have any more questions, I'll let you discuss the practical details of the mission with Waverly and get acquainted with your new team member.\", Sanders declared before briskly heading for the door and leaving the room. Gaby wondered if The CIA handler actually had something urgent to attend to or if he was just in a hurry to get rid of them. \"Welcome to the team, agent Blake.\" At the sound of Solo's voice, Gaby's gaze shifted back to the center of the room and she saw the two Americans shaking hands. Then the CIA agent turned toward her. \"Miss Teller, I think we've met once before.\" As he uttered these words, she suddenly remembered why the man looked familiar. \"Yes, I remember you, from the hospital.\", she said giving him a warm smile and shaking his extended hand. He was the agent who had escorted her to Marshall's room when he had been recovering in the hospital. \"Poor Marshall. Such a good-natured guy, and an excellent field agent. I know there isn't much hope of him still being alive but I'll do whatever I can to help your team find out what happened to him and carry on his investigation.\" Gaby could hear genuine concern in Blake's voice as he talked about Marshall; the two of them had probably been close colleagues, or even friends. She noticed that Illya was making no move to introduce himself. The CIA agent walked up to him and extended his right hand. \"I look forward to working with you, Kuryakin.\" Illya seemed to hesitate. Then he nodded and shook Blake's hand, once. \"Don't take it personally, he's Russian.\", Solo commented with a chuckle. Gaby knew that Illya probably wasn't too happy about this new, forced addition to their team. But she wasn't too worried, he would get used to it, and it was only one mission. And agent Blake seems like a nice guy… \"Very well. Now if you don't mind,\" Waverly said as he checked his watch, \"I suggest we move on to the practical details as we don't have much time. You all still need to pack and you're leaving in six hours.\" Gaby saw Waverly's smile grow wider as he caught Illya's surprised facial expression. \"Don't worry, Kuryakin, you'll love the moor at this time of the year. It will suit your…contemplative personality.\" Hotel room, Blake's p.o.v. Owen Blake let out a tired sigh and sat down on the bed of his hotel room. He removed his shoulder holster, loosened his tie and pulled it off. Then he took off his shirt. He still had a couple of hours ahead of him. Enough to pack and take a shower. He replayed the events of the day in his mind as he absentmindedly scratched a small scar on his arm. Meeting his foster team had been interesting. Solo had been welcoming enough. Gaby Teller was charming. Kuryakin, however, had seemed reluctant to say the least. He wasn't too concerned about it though. He would find a way to make the Russian warm up to him. He got up, pulled an old suitcase out of the closet and set it down on the bed. As he started packing, his thoughts drifted to the mission and to Marshall. He smiled as he felt his pulse quicken in anticipation. He hoped that everything would go smoothly with his new teammates. He was determined to carry out his assignment successfully. And he really hoped that Marshall was still alive. End of chapter 1. Let me know what you think :)[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 is here! Thanks for the reviews on chapter 1 :) A few days later, in a cottage in Dartmoor, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby sighed and looked up from the transcript of Marshall's report she had been reading, she stretched her legs and adjusted her position on the couch. Blake was sitting in front of her on an armchair, reading a file and occasionally jotting down a few notes. For the past few days the two of them had been going over Marshall's reports again and again, dissecting them in order to gather any tiny bits of information that could help the investigation. Blake was currently working on a short list of names mentioned in one of the reports. Gaby was just about to resume her reading when she heard someone coughing outside. That meant Illya was back. Blake also looked up as he heard the coughing and gave her a knowing smile. They heard the sound of the door being closed a little too forcefully, and more coughing, inside this time. \"You're sure you don't want me to examine you, Kuryakin? It won't take long.\" \"I'm fine.\" Gaby set her file down on the couch and turned to look at him as he walked into the room. Of course he didn't look fine, his face had an unhealthy hue, the skin around his nose was red and chafed. He also looked pissed off, but that was a regular occurrence even when he was healthy. She could hear his noisy breathing, obviously caused by a clogged nose. How could he possibly hope to fool anyone. \"I think you should let agent Blake examine you. He was a military doctor after all. \" \"We don't have time for this. Cowb…Solo will be back soon.\" \"Illya…\" \"She's right you know, Peril.\" Gaby almost jumped at the sound of Napoleon's voice behind her. She hadn't heard him come in. \"No offense, but you look like death warmed up.\", Napoleon went on. \"Funny you're the one who got sick, one would think your Russian genes would immunize you against such common illnesses.\" He ignored Illya's glare, grinned at Gaby and turned toward Blake. \"How long would it take to give him a checkup?\" \"Ten, fifteen minutes at most.\", Blake answered, an amused smile playing on his lips. \"Perfect, just enough time for me to get changed and fix us a drink. Then I will fill you in on what happened tonight.\" \"We need to concentrate on the mission.\", Illya muttered, pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket. \"You're right, Peril. The mission is our priority and I won't let you jeopardize it with sniffles. Besides, you're supposed to have my back. What if someone blows my brains out while you're blowing your nose? Sorry Peril, but there will be no mission debrief until you let Blake examine you.\" Gaby watched as the discussion went on for a few more minutes. Then, finally, as he understood that his partners wouldn't leave him alone until he complied, Illya reluctantly agreed to let agent Blake examine him. Their new partner left the room and came back with a medical bag from which he pulled out a stethoscope and other instruments. Gaby vacated the couch and settled into one of the armchairs. As Blake made Illya take his shirt off and sit down on the couch, she couldn't suppress a fond smile; the big Russian looked like a sulking little boy. \"It might feel a bit cold.\", Blake said as he placed the stethoscope against his patient's chest. Illya rolled his eyes but Gaby saw him flinch ever so slightly when the cold disc touched his bare skin. She observed as the CIA agent listened to Illya's heart and lungs, took his blood pressure, checked his throat and ears and palpated his neck. Blake's gestures were precise, efficient, but also extremely gentle. She smiled. Her stubborn partner was obviously in good hands. Blake asked Illya a couple of questions, then he slipped a thermometer into his mouth and waited for a few minutes before he took it out and inspected it. \"Rhinopharyngitis, with moderate fever.\", he finally announced as he handed Illya's shirt back to him. \"Congratulations, Peril. You officially have a cold.\" That was Napoleon, emerging from the kitchen with the drinks. Gaby accepted the glass he was holding out and returned her attention to Illya and Blake. \"How long will it take for him to get better?\" \"It will probably run its course in about a week. In the meantime I can give him something to relieve the symptoms.\" Blake went to the kitchen, brought back a glass of water, then reached into his bag and pulled out what Gaby recognized as an aspirin powder packet. He mixed the contents of the packet with the water and handed the glass to Illya. \"Here you go\", he said with a gentle smile. \"Drink this, all of it. Then I suggest you go lie down for a while and wait for the medicine to take effect. It shouldn't be too long before you start feeling better.\" Illya looked mortified. He eyed the glass suspiciously for a few seconds. Then he looked up and seemed to notice that everyone was staring at him. He finally took the glass and downed its contents in one gulp, grimacing at the bitter taste. \"I'll give you some more in a few hours. Taking this regularly should keep your fever down.\", Blake said, taking the glass out of his hand. Illya thanked him curtly, stood up and headed for his room. A few seconds of silence passed, then… \"Want me to come tuck you in, Peril?\" Gaby chuckled and shook her head. You just can't help yourself, can you… Illya's p.o.v. Illya cursed under his breath as he heard Solo's voice through the door. He briefly considered making a trip to the bathroom to cough on Cowboy's toothbrush. Instead, he let out an exasperated sigh and started untying his shoes. Even though he would never have admitted it in front of his partners, he actually felt grateful. He had been feeling increasingly unwell for the last two days and the prospect of just lying down in the dark for a moment suddenly seemed particularly appealing. He opened his suitcase and selected a clean handkerchief. He tried to blow his congested nose, in vain. Blake probably knew a way to ease nasal congestion. He switched off the light and plopped onto the bed, fully clothed. He would never ask the American for help. He listened to his own noisy breathing for a while. Or maybe he would…later. He closed his eyes. He was already starting to feel better. Half an hour later, Solo's p.o.v. \"Feeling any better, Peril?\" Illya nodded and sat down on the couch, next to Gaby. He definitely looked better, more alert, and slightly less grumpy. Good job, Blake… \"Since everyone's here, I think we can finally start tonight's mission debrief.\" It had been decided that Napoleon would be the one to infiltrate the secret society. Consequently, he had been provided with a cover by the CIA – with a little help from Waverly. Since their arrival in Devon, he had been posing as Trevor Carlyle, a rich English businessman from Leeds, looking to buy property in the region. They had rented a different cottage for him just outside the village, which he used to maintain his cover. For the past few days, he had been taking long walks on the moor, but also, and more importantly, roaming around town, spending time at the only pub and talking to the locals. The idea was to spot a potential \"weak link\", a member of the secret society who would be more easily approachable than the others. Napoleon had rapidly isolated one potential candidate and, little by little, he had managed to get close to the man. It was with this man that Napoleon, or rather Trevor Carlyle, had met earlier that evening to tell him about his desire to join the secret society. \"How did he react when you mentioned the society?\" \"Oh, he was very surprised, and not particularly happy. I think he felt betrayed at first, but I managed to win him over with my…hum…boundless enthusiasm. Needless to say he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Anyway, although he made it clear that he couldn't introduce me to the \"higher members\" himself, he said he would put in a good word for me. Hopefully, this will grab the attention of the people who made Marshall disappear.\" \"Did he mention Marshall at all?\", Blake asked, concern evident in his tone. \"He didn't, no one did. A few townspeople even mentioned that they rarely saw new faces in town and that they hadn't had visitors in a long time. It's as if Marshall had never been here. Come to think of it, it's extremely unsettling because they do seem to be charming people, until you realize that they're all covering up Marshall's murd…suspicious disappearance.\" He shot a guilty glance at Gaby. Apparently eager to change the subject, she turned to Illya. The Russian had remained silent the whole time, he already knew most of what Napoleon had to say since he had been following him around and listening in all evening thanks to both a tracking device and a listening device hidden inside Napoleon's watch. \"So, I've been meaning to ask you.\", Gaby said. \"What's his British accent like?\" \"Almost as annoying as the American one.\", Illya answered with a smirk. \"By that he means that it's absolutely flawless. You're just jealous, Peril, because you can't get rid of your stubborn Russian accent.\" \"I don't need to get rid of it, Russian accent is something to be proud of.\" \"You keep telling yourself that. To get back on topic, I have another meeting scheduled with my new 'mate' tomorrow night. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to meet the people in charge of the organization. Then I'll just have to put on my best charming smile, remember to stick to the non-rhotic variety of English and convince them to let me become a member of their private little club. Best case scenario, they let me in, worst case scenario, they try to get rid of me and we'll finally know what happened to Marshall.\" Piece of cake, what could possibly go wrong?... End of chapter 2 :)[Chapter 3] Chapter 3! (looooooong chapter). Things are moving, slowly but surely ;) Let me know what you think :) Thanks for the reviews on chapter 2 :) A week later, in the village, outside the pub, Solo's p.o.v. \"I think I should get going, it's getting dimpsey and my wife doesn't like it when I'm late.\" \"All right, see you tomorrow, Davies, and give my greetings to your wife.\", Napoleon answered as he shook the man's extended hand. Davies nodded and took a few steps, then he seemed to hesitate and glanced back. \"Hey, don't worry about it too much, Carlyle. You know, those things can take time…\" \"I know. Thank you for your help, Davies, I really appreciate it.\" \"Don't mention it, mate.\" Napoleon watched him disappear around the corner of the street. He too would drive back to his cottage soon but first he would go for a walk around the village. It had become a habit since he had started meeting with Davies regularly. More than a simple leisurely stroll, it was a way to make sure no one was following him around. Except a big blond Russian, of course. As he walked down the main street, his mind drifted to his conversation with Davies. He hadn't had much luck in approaching the \"higher members\" of the secret society. It had been a week and Davies had not brought any encouraging news. They were either uninterested or extremely careful. Either way he would have to reconsider his strategy. As he took a deep breath to quench his frustration, he realized that he had almost reached the spot where he had parked his car…and that he was no longer alone. He turned around just in time to see the man disappear into a tiny perpendicular street. I have to warn Illya… \"Hello? Who's there?...\" He quickened his pace but just as he was about to reach his car, another man jumped out of an alleyway to his right and pounced on him. He fell down and before he had a chance to do anything, his attacker punched him in the side of the head. Hard enough to hurt and stun him, but not enough to do serious damage. Don't struggle. They probably won't kill you… He felt a weight on his back and his arms being pulled back, then something being slipped around his wrists and tightened. Remembering that he was supposed to be a scared businessman, he let out what he hoped was a convincing terrified squeal. Then everything went black. Great, the damn hood reeks of perspiration… Twenty minutes later, Illya's car, Illya's p.o.v. \"I think we should kill him.\" For the second time in one night Illya felt his pulse quicken as a rush of adrenaline shot through him. His hand hovered over the gun on the passenger seat of the car and he listened tensely, waiting for Cowboy's distress signal. For the second time, it didn't come. Another false alarm. He let out a sigh which promptly turned into a coughing fit. He waited for it to subside and leaned back against the car seat. He definitely wasn't getting better. At first, the medicine had been enough to ease his symptoms but for the past few days his cough had been getting worse and he now had a constant, annoying feeling of pressure on his chest. He also felt weak and tired most of the time. He would have to tell Blake about it. He rubbed his chest pensively as he focused on the conversation that was taking place not far from where he had parked the car. The men who had attacked Cowboy had used Solo's own car to drive him to an old, isolated house in a quiet part of the village. Illya had given them a head start then he had used his tracking device to discreetly follow them so that he could keep listening in on what was happening thanks to the microphone inside his partner's watch…and rescue Cowboy if necessary. The conversation had been going on for about fifteen minutes. Illya had heard two different interlocutors so far. Two men. One with a calm, composed voice. And another one who sounded more nervous and hostile. He was the one who had suggested killing Solo. Illya could understand why the man was nervous, Cowboy had wasted no time beating around the bush. He had simply told the two men that he knew the secret society was some sort of cover for a criminal organization and that he wanted in. Illya frowned as he heard his partner mention some of the names from Marshall's list. Blake had found out that most of the names belonged to wealthy English businessmen and other somewhat influential individuals but they weren't entirely sure yet of how those people were connected to the organization. Don't push your luck, Cowboy… There was a moment of silence then Nervous-voice spoke again. \"May I ask how you came to know so much about our organisation? That information is highly confidential.\" \"Well you've obviously done your research on me so you probably know that, in addition to selling antiquities, I'm also in the business of gathering valuable bits of information, which means that I have a few connections…\" Good save… \"Don't worry.\", Calm-voice cut in. \"We know about your connections, Mr. Carlyle, without them you would already be dead, or worse.\" There was a short pause. \"Well I must say it's a relief, then.\" Illya gave a puzzled frown. That had gone far more smoothly than he had expected. Sanders and Waverly must really have done an exceptional job with Cowboy's cover. \"I still think we don't need any new members.\", Nervous-voice insisted. \"He thinks the secret society is only a cover. He doesn't take the cult seriously…\" \"Forgive my colleague, he is rather mistrustful by nature, and we've recently had some…slight security issues.\" Another pause. They were testing him about Marshall. \"I see, nothing too serious, I hope?\" \"No, nothing to be concerned about. It has been taken care of.\" \"Good. If I do join your organisation, I want to be sure that my secrets will be kept safe.\" Calm-voice gave a curt laugh. \"If you do join our organisation, yes…Well, Mr. Carlyle, it has been a pleasure. You have impressive credentials and I'm convinced you could contribute greatly to our organisation…\" \"Does this mean I'm in?\" Calm-voice laughed again. \"Don't worry you'll have your answer soon. Oh and don't bother trying to contact us. We know where to find you.\" Illya heard several dragging noises, probably chairs being pushed back. The impromptu meeting was over. After a few minutes he heard the sound of a car engine. Again, he gave them a head start then started following Solo's car. After a short while, he realized that they were driving Cowboy back to his cottage and he decided to stop following them and drive back to the base cottage instead. It was probably wiser to avoid making contact right after the meeting. The men who had attacked Cowboy would probably stick around to make sure he didn't contact or meet with anyone. Two days later, base cottage, Gaby's p.o.v. \"Any chest pain?\" \"No, no pain. More like tightness.\" Gaby watched quietly as Blake pulled Illya's shirt open and auscultated him with his stethoscope. Poor Illya was definitely more docile now. She could easily understand why, after almost two weeks of sniffling and coughing, her partner just wanted to get better. \"Shortness of breath?\" \"A little. I…\" A fit of coughing prevented him from elaborating. Blake put a supportive hand on his patient's shoulder and waited for the coughing to subside. \"Well, I'm sorry, Kuryakin, but it seems that your cold is turning into bronchitis. It should clear up by itself but it will take about two more weeks.\" Gaby saw Illya's mouth twist into a grimace of annoyance. He looked at her but she had nothing to offer except an \"I'm sorry\" shrug and a sympathetic smile. \"The best thing we can do is to continue treating the symptoms with aspirin. For the chest congestion, I don't have any expectorants but a hot compress might help a little. And let me know immediately if you start experiencing chest pain or severe shortness of breath. Or if you start coughing up bloody mucus.\" Mmm charming… Blake got up and went to his room to fetch Illya's medicine and a towel for the compress. Gaby watched her partner lie down on the couch. With his tired face and his wrinkled shirt hanging open, he looked so miserable that she felt the urge to give him a hug. Instead, she enquired about Napoleon. \"What time did you say Solo would be here?\" \"He's late. Probably making sure he's not being followed.\" A few minutes later, they heard the sound of the front door closing and Napoleon walked into the room just as Blake was coming back with a glass of aspirin, a towel and a bowl of warm water. \"What did I miss? Is Peril dying?\" \"Bronchitis.\", Gaby answered as Illya drank the medicine. Napoleon sat down into one of the armchairs and watched with knitted eyebrows as Blake soaked the towel in the warm water and applied it to Illya's chest. \"Are you sure you're going to be okay, Peril? Maybe you should take it easy for a few days. I'm sure the three of us can manage without y…\" \"What are you talking about.\", Illya growled as he started to sit up. \"Easy, Kuryakin.\" Blake gently pushed him back down and adjusted the compress. Gaby shot Napoleon a disapproving look, he responded with a cheeky grin before changing the subject. \"So as you all know, tomorrow is the big day. The day of my initiation into the mysterious secret society.\" The previous evening, Napoleon had found a note on the kitchen table of his cottage – no signs of forced entry, which had hardly surprised him. Printed on the paper were the words \"initiation ceremony\", the date and the time of the event. Gaby felt a rush of excitement; this was the breakthrough they had been hoping for. Things were finally moving. But she was also aware that they would only have one shot at this and that they would need to plan things out carefully if they didn't want Napoleon to end up like poor Asher. She knew that Napoleon was worried about the initiation ceremony. Both he and Illya had had the impression that the meeting with the two \"higher members\" of the secret society had gone too smoothly. The next day, Napoleon had asked Davies about the two men. Apparently one of them was the leader of the secret society, and of the organization – or at least of that particular branch of the larger organization – and went by the name of Cleary. The other one was the leader of the mysterious cult around which the secret society revolved and wished to be addressed as 'cult master'. The two men's motivations for letting Napoleon join their organization were unclear to say the least, and there was a good chance that the whole initiation ceremony thing would turn out to be a trap. \"I'm going to need someone to follow me inside the building, in case things turn sour. Do you feel up to it, Peril?\" Napoleon's voice snapped her out of her thoughts. She glanced at Illya. Of course there was no way he would be able to carry out a stealthy infiltration mission with his uncontrollable fits of coughing, and he knew it. \"Let agent Blake do it.\", she suggested. \"I mean, if you don't mind…\", she added turning toward Blake. \"Not at all. Solo?\" She saw Napoleon hesitate for a second, he glanced at Illya, then he nodded. \"All right. Blake will follow me inside with the portable listening device. Illya, you will wait in the car in case we need reinforcements. Gaby, you will be our getaway driver.\" They spent a couple of hours going over the details of the plan and then Napoleon left. Illya was exhausted and retired for the night. Blake excused himself and went to his room to prepare a report for Sanders. Gaby decided to go to bed but she knew she wouldn't be able to fall asleep. After about an hour of tossing and turning, she got up to get a glass of water from the kitchen. As she got out of her room, she walked straight into a shirtless Blake who had apparently just stepped out of the bathroom. \"Agent Blake…I'm sorry…\" Blake laughed quietly. \"No harm done, don't worry. By the way, you can call me Owen, or just Blake, I don't mind.\" She nodded, vaguely embarrassed. As she turned to leave he put a hand on her arm. \"And don't worry too much about tomorrow night either. Everything will be fine.\" \"But Asher…\" \"Solo won't be alone. I'll be there to watch his back.\" She gave him a grateful smile and went back to bed. Maybe things would go smoothly after all. The next evening, unknown location, Solo's p.o.v. Napoleon stepped into the room. The two men who had escorted him there did not follow him. He heard the door close as he took in the scene before him. Inside the spacious room, a crowd of people was gathered around refreshment tables. At first glance, it looked like a normal evening party. The only difference was that all the guests were part of a secret society and members of a mysterious cult, and probably criminals. Taking a closer look at the guests, Napoleon noted that although some of them were dressed in suits and evening dresses, others – men and women – wore long, loose brown robes, just like the one he was wearing himself. The men who had taken him to this room had insisted that he slip it on, over his suit. They were the same men who had picked him up at his cottage earlier and he suspected they were also the men who had attacked him in the village two days earlier. At least this time they had blindfolded him instead of covering his head with a stinky hood. Looking at the faces, Napoleon recognized some people from the village but many of the cult members present in the room were people he had never seen before. \"Good evening, Mr. Carlyle. Are you enjoying the party so far?\" Napoleon recognized the voice even before he turned around. Cleary, the leader of the secret society was standing before him, dressed in an elegant black suit. Next to him was the cult master, wearing a crimson robe. He doesn't look particularly happy to see Trevor Carlyle… Napoleon flashed him his widest grin, then he exchanged a few more words with Cleary before the two of them moved on to another group of guests. Napoleon scanned the room and spotted Davies in the crowd. He was wearing a three-piece suit which looked slightly too big for him, and which had obviously seen better days. \"Hey mate! Congratulations, you must be chuffed! Sorry again about the other night, I had no idea they had planned a meeting with you. You know, higher members, they never bother to tell me anything. They probably think I'm a proper dimwit.\" Sorry, pal, but I can hardly blame them… \"No hard feelings, Davies, you don't need to keep apologising. That's quite a lot of people. Are they all here for my initiation ceremony?\" \"Well, there's usually not as many people when we welcome a new member. But your initiation coincides with another event that was planned for tonight so all the toffs are here.\" \"I see…it makes me slightly nervous, to be honest. Have you got any tips?\" Davies laughed and gave him a friendly slap on the shoulder. \"Ah cheer up, Carlyle, everything's going to be fine. This is just a formality. Soon you'll be one of us.\" \"But I don't know anything about the cult…\" \"You'll learn. One piece of advice, though, get rid of the robe, it clashes with your posh style.\" As they got closer to the center of the room, something caught Napoleon's attention. \"What's that large table in the middle of the room for?\", he asked, describing the object and its location for Blake's benefit. \"You'll see.\", Davies answered with a wink. Napoleon walked up to the table to take a closer look. It was made of metal and had leather restraints fixed to its four corners. He felt his pulse quicken slightly. That's never a good sign… He looked up and spotted the cult master who was watching him intently from across the room. He casually stepped away from the table and caught up with Davies. \"So, what do you think of the place, Carlyle?\" \"I must say it's a little different from what I expected. More, I don't know, more…modern.\" \"What? You thought it was going to be more medieval? All stone and torches? \"Something like that.\" Davies laughed again, his loud, unrefined laugh. \"Like I said, some of our members are important people, the crème de la crème, you know. Those people appreciate a certain level of comfort. It also makes cleaning up easier.\" \"Cleaning up?\" Davies suddenly seemed to visibly shrink and, following his gaze, Napoleon noticed that the cult master was now within earshot and was glaring disapprovingly at his companion. \"Ah, I don't want to say too much and spoil the surprise. Enough with all the questions, just enjoy the party for now.\" Davies led him to the refreshment tables and they both grabbed a drink. They ambled around the room for a while, exchanging greetings with the other guests, making small talk. Davies appeared delighted to walk around with the soon-to-be new member. He probably didn't have many opportunities to be in the limelight. Napoleon was using that casual tour of the huge room to scan for any potential exits he could use in case things went south. He used subtle, occasional comments to keep Blake informed about the layout of the room. Suddenly the sound of a ringing bell filled the room and everyone started converging toward the center of the room, where Napoleon had seen the table. Davies caught him by the arm and led him through the crowd. \"Come on mate, it's your big moment.\" Davies pushed him forward until he found himself at the center of the circle, next to Cleary and the cult master. Napoleon suddenly realized that everyone had gone quiet. A small door he had spotted earlier opened at the far end of the room. Two cult members appeared, half dragging, half supporting a shirtless man as they closed the distance that separated them from the center of the room. The prisoner was struggling weakly and shouting expletives at his captors. Slightly younger than Napoleon, lean and athletic, a full head of light brown hair. He looked almost exactly like the photograph in his file. Minus the smile. Well, I guess I found Marshall… End of chapter 3 :)[Chapter 4] Chapter 4! (shooorter chapter). I hope you like this one :) Thanks for the reviews :) Secret society castle, Blake's p.o.v. Blake wiped his sweaty brow as he finished installing the last explosive charge. That one was particularly important; it would allow him to cut the power inside the building, in case Solo needed to escape. He had been pleased to discover that the castle, which looked ancient from the outside, was actually equipped with a modern electrical system. The other explosive charges he had disseminated throughout the castle would help create chaos and an effective diversion. As soon as all hell broke loose, Kuryakin, who had stayed near the car, would take care of the guards outside to facilitate their escape. Once he had managed to sneek into the castle undetected, Blake had first located the room where Solo's initiation ceremony would be taking place. It was situated underground, in the castle crypt, which had apparently been converted into a huge reception room. That meant no windows, which would also be convenient in case he needed to rescue Solo. Then, as he was placing the charges, Blake had scanned the place for potential exits and strategic hiding places. He also had managed to come up with a rough estimate of the number of guards and their approximate positions. He adjusted the headset of the portable listening device he was carrying in his backpack. The thing was slightly cumbersome but it did the job. He focused on the sounds coming out of the speakers. Apparently Solo was still walking around the reception room. Blake made a mental note every time Solo made a descriptive comment about the layout of the room. A loud, rather unpleasant laugh occasionally rang in his ears. Probably Davies. He checked his watch. Now that he had finished installing the charges, the best thing to do was to get as close as possible to the reception room - without getting caught - in case he needed to intervene. He was just about to leave when he heard a loud ringing noise though the headset, it sounded like some kind of bell. He frowned…then froze. The ringing bell suddenly wasn't the only sound he was concerned about. Company… Although the end of the corridor he was in was partly enveloped in shadow, it didn't offer much concealment and it was too late to get to a better hiding place. He quickly removed the headset, set his backpack down on the floor and left it conspicuously in the middle of the corridor. Then he retreated in the shadow. Judging by the sound of the footsteps, it was only one guy. After a few seconds, the man came into view. The fact that he kept his gun trained on the backpack clearly indicated that he was not a professional. Foolish little fellow… Blake silently fished a single 9mm cartridge out of one of the pockets of his tactical vest. With his other hand, he slipped a knife out of the sheath strapped to his leg. He waited for the man to bend down and examine the backpack. Then he threw the cartridge as hard as he could against the opposite wall. As he had anticipated, the inexperienced man jumped to his feet – probably losing control of his bladder in the process – and swung his weapon toward the noise. As the guard started turning his back to him, Blake was already moving. He swiftly closed the distance between them, clamped one hand over the man's mouth and nose and used his other hand to stab his knife into the side of his throat. Then he twisted the knife and jerked it out of the wound. He felt the man's knees buckle and gently lowered him to the floor but kept his hand over his mouth and his nose pinched shut to keep him silent as he waited for him to die. Blake then dragged the body into the shadowed part of the corridor. Wasting no time, he knelt down and put the headset back on. He listened for a few seconds, frowned…then hurriedly scooped up his backpack and stood up to leave. Let's hope I'm not too late… That's when he felt a subtle displacement of air right behind him, and soon after, something hit him in the back of the head. Shit… At the same moment, reception room, Napoleon's p.o.v As the cult members dragged Marshall closer to the center of the room, Napoleon noticed the cuts and bruises on his arms, chest and face. He had obviously been beaten up, and more than once, but he didn't seem to be severely injured. Napoleon tore his gaze away from the CIA agent and turned toward Davies. \"Who is this young chap?\", he whispered. \"Ah don't worry about that, you don't need to know who he is.\" You're right, I don't. But Blake does… Napoleon shot a furtive glance at Cleary and his robed associate. He really didn't like the avid look on the cult master's face. \"What are they going to do to him?\" \"Oh, they are not going to do anything.\", Davies answered with a wink. \"You are.\" The two men and their prisoner finally reached the table at the center of the circle formed by the guests. As he spotted the table with the restraints, Marshall started struggling harder, kicking out at his captors. His efforts elicited a few laughs from the assembly of guests. Two other cult members came to the rescue, one of them clamped an arm around his chest, holding him upright and the other drove his knee into the agent's gut. As Marshall gasped and doubled over, two of the men grabbed him under the armpits while the two others grabbed his legs and they laid him down on the table, fastening the restraints around his wrists and ankles. The four men stepped back into the crowd and Marshall immediately started struggling against his bonds, tugging at the restraints, twisting his body from side to side. Again, a few laughs erupted from the crowd of cult members. \"Look at him, wriggling like a worm on a fish hook.\", Davies said with a hearty laugh. Napoleon forced a chuckle. Please tell me this is not what it looks like… \"Good evening ladies and gentlemen.\" The crowd fell silent at the sound of Cleary's voice. \"As you all know, we're welcoming a new member into our community tonight.\" He turned toward Napoleon. \"Mr. Carlyle, if you will just step this way…\", Cleary said, pointing at a spot next to the side of the table. Napoleon obliged and, as he stepped around the table, he seized the opportunity and discreetly pressed a button on his watch in order to send a distress signal to Blake. At that moment, Marshall, who had not noticed his presence before, stopped struggling and Napoleon saw the agent's eyes grow wide as saucers. Thankfully he almost immediately recovered from his surprise and started tugging at his restraints again, all the while staring at Napoleon with a convincing frightened gaze. The door at the far end of the room opened again and a cult member appeared. As the crowd parted to let the man through, Napoleon saw that he was carrying an object, apparently wrapped in a piece of cloth. He handed the object to the cult master who removed the cloth, revealing what looked like an ancient stone dagger. Dammit… Adopting a solemn expression, the cult master raised the dagger and a reverent murmur arose from the assembly. Then he positioned himself next to Napoleon and held out the dagger to him. Napoleon hesitantly reached for the stone blade. What the hell is Blake doing?... He made a show of nervously fiddling with the dagger. \"All right. Human sacrifice. Very well then...\" \"One of our most treasured traditions.\", Cleary commented. \"Regular offerings are meant to ensure the prosperity of our community.\" \"I see…\" \"Is there a problem, Mr. Carlyle?\" Time to improvise… \"No, I…this is a little embarrassing. I…I've never done this sort of thing before…would you mind walking me through it?\" Napoleon cringed inwardly at the sound of his own quavering voice. At least ridicule doesn't kill anyone. A dagger through the chest on the other hand… An amused murmur spread through the crowd of spectators. He saw the cult master roll his eyes and spotted Davies's perplexed expression. Even Marshall was watching him with a skeptical look. His fellow agent's eyes seemed to be telling him \"I hope you have something better than this…\" Working on it, pal… Cleary silenced the crowd again. \"Well, Mr. Carlyle, it's fairly simple. You plunge the blade into this young man's chest, he dies, you become one of us.\" Napoleon cursed inwardly. Even if Blake had not recognized his distress signal, he had clearly mentioned human sacrifice. Granted, Blake didn't know that the poor fellow about to be sacrificed was Marshall but it seemed reasonable to assume that his partner wouldn't just sit around and wait while he was forced to perform a human sacrifice, regardless of the victim's identity. No worries, he'll be here any second now… Napoleon gripped the dagger with both hands and started raising it. Then he pretended to hesitate and turned the blade as if to examine it. \"What kind of blade is this? Are…Are you sure this thing is sharp enough?\", he said as he brought his finger close to the blade to test its sharpness. \"Careful!\", The cult master barked. \"You'll taint the sacrificial dagger. Only the victim's blood shall cover its blade.\" Napoleon briefly considered \"accidentally\" cutting his finger to render the dagger useless but he doubted it would be enough to stop the ceremony. Besides, the crazy bastard probably owned the whole cutlery set, complete with stone sacrificial teaspoons. \"Sorry… Do I need to kill him on the first try or can I stab him multiple times?\" The look on Marshall's face would have been hilarious had the situation been less perilous. \"You can stab him as many times as you want, Mr. Carlyle. Although once is usually enough.\" \"Good…\" Napoleon raised the dagger again and let it hover over Marshall's body, as if he were trying to decide where to stab. After a few seconds, the cult master lost patience. \"What's wrong now?\", he snapped. Napoleon turned to him with a sheepish look on his face. \"I don't know where…\", he let his voice trail off. Again his words provoked a few laughs and jeering from the more unrefined members of the audience. \"Want us to mark the spot for you, Carlyle?\" \"The man's a bloody halfwit!\" \"Kill him already!\" Napoleon glanced at Cleary. The man was smiling and seemed to find the situation amusing. The cult master, on the other hand, looked furious. \"Enough!\", he roared. With an exasperated sigh, he snatched the dagger from his hands and for one chilling moment, Napoleon thought that he was going to stab Marshall himself. Instead, the man placed the tip of the dagger over the agent's solar plexus and hastily carved a small X shape into his skin. Napoleon refrained from wincing in sympathy as Marshall let out a small grunt of pain through gritted teeth. Sorry, Marshall… The cult master handed the dagger back to him and for the third time, Napoleon raised it. Slowly. He had run out of ideas. He saw a flicker of fear cross Marshall's eyes. He raised the dagger higher. He could see the younger agent's upper abdomen pulsing faintly, in time with the frantic beat of his heart. Napoleon stared at the bloody X-shaped cut… Of course he wasn't going to kill Marshall. But that meant his cover would almost certainly be blown. Dammit Blake!... End of chapter 4 :)[Chapter 5] Chapter 5! (my update-launcher is set to fully automatic :) ). I hope you are still enjoying this story :) Thanks for the reviews :) edit: my update-launcher is jammed :P sorry about that, life is kicking my butt right now, but don't worry, the next update should happen around july/august :) re- edit: if you want to know what Marshall looks like, here is a link to his 'official portrait' :P : \"https\":\"/\"\"/\"\"ibb\".\"co\"/eKx4Fd (just remove the \"\") Blake's p.o.v. Owen Blake felt a drop of sweat run down the nape of his neck as he stumbled forward. Fortunately he had instinctively ducked as soon as he had felt the ominous breeze behind his head and he hadn't taken the full brunt of the blow. Actually he was slightly surprised that the impact had not been more violent. It had felt like someone poking him hard in the back of the head. Perhaps his attacker had misjudged the distance, or the necessary amount of strength to bring him down. All this went through his mind during the few seconds it took to catch his balance. He knew that his opponent would expect him to turn around and face him. So he didn't. Instead, he rapidly glanced over his shoulder, bent his right knee then extended his leg, sending a powerful back kick into the man's chest. The moment his foot connected and he heard the man give a surprised gasp, Blake immediately spun around and adopted a fighting stance. His opponent had doubled over and apparently needed a moment to recover. Disarm him… Blake's eyes immediately shifted to the man's hands. Browning 9mm in his right hand. A swift, precise, basic front kick took care of that. Now the left hand… What the… Before Blake had a chance to move, his opponent lunged at him, swinging a machete in a horizontal slashing motion, almost slicing open his stomach. Blake's reflexes kicked in and he leapt backwards. The guard charged at him again. This time, Blake sidestepped him and, as he spun around, delivered a brutal elbow strike to the man's nose, shattering it. He then took full advantage of his opponent's momentary incapacity and moved to position himself behind him. A vicious stomp kick to the back of the knee and the man went down. Blake caught him as he collapsed, pulled him close, and snapped his neck in one swift motion. He let the body drop to the floor and took a slow, deep breath. The nape of his neck felt like it was soaked with sweat. He could even feel it trickle down his back. Blake's gaze settled on the machete next to his attacker's dead body. That really was a suspicious amount of sweat. His eyes remained fixed on the machete as he raised a hand to the back of his head. Outside the castle, Illya's p.o.v Illya made a conscious effort to relax and unclench his jaw. Everything was quiet on the moor – except for his occasional stifled coughing fits. The moon cast an eerie glow over the still landscape. From where he was standing, partly hidden behind a pile of rocks, he had a good view of the old, imposing, castle house. He raised the binoculars and zeroed in on the ground floor. No movement. Earlier, as guests were still arriving, Illya had seen security guards patrolling in front of the door, but they had since retreated inside the castle. Only the pale electric light filtering through the windows suggested that there was something going on inside. That and the impressive number of vehicles parked in the courtyard. He stepped to the right to get a better view and cursed inwardly as his shoe produced an annoying squelching sound. As he was moving away from the road to find a vantage point, he had stepped into a shallow bog-hole, which had done nothing to improve his temper. Waiting for the explosives to go off while having no idea of what was going on inside was really starting to get on his nerves. And, of course, he was worried about his partner's safety. Although he would have never admitted it in front of anyone – at least not in that particular wording – he actually cared about Solo. Of course Illya knew that Owen Blake was a competent field agent. But entrusting him with his partner's life…that was a different matter. Gaby, Solo and him were a team. Cowboy and him had been on so many missions together and he had always been there to keep the stupid American alive. And Cowboy had done the same for him…with much less class of course, but still. He should be inside the castle right now, watching Solo's back, not Blake. He angrily pounded his stupid congested chest with his fist. It certainly wasn't going to help his stupid bronchitis but he needed to release his frustration. Hopefully this initiation thing would go smoothly and Blake wouldn't need to intervene. He very much doubted that it would be the case, however, knowing his partner's propensity for getting in trouble. Blake had better know what he's doing… Blake's p.o.v. Blake could feel the back of his head throbbing as he hurried, as stealthily as possible, along the dimly lit corridors. Thankfully, after quickly – and blindly – feeling the edges and the inside of the wound, he had come to the conclusion that it wasn't life threatening, although it had been bleeding profusely. Blake knew that scalp wounds tended to bleed a lot and, although he had been unable to have a look at the gash, he was fairly confident that his brain wasn't showing through his skull. He had hastily secured a wad of gauze to the back of his head to minimize the bleeding and had started heading for the reception room. He was getting close now. He had decided that he would use the room's back entrance since, according to his previous observations, he was less likely to encounter any machete-wielding guards there. He had put the headset back on and he could hear Solo still playing the part of the squeamish, clumsy businessman in an attempt to buy some time. He knew that he would need to detonate the charges soon to stop what was happening, but he wanted to wait until he was close enough to maximize the element of surprise. He let out a short sigh of relief when he finally reached his destination. Then he heard what sounded like a faint grunt of pain through the speakers. No… Quickly, he set his backpack down on the floor, pulled out the thermal goggles and put them around his forehead. Then he set off the explosives. Reception room, Napoleon's p.o.v. While he was considering the vast array of his non-existent options, Napoleon had come to a point where he couldn't raise the dagger any higher without having to stand on tiptoes. The only thing he could do now was to keep pretending he was going to kill Marshall until the very last moment and hope Blake would finally barge in to save his colleague's butt, and Napoleon's cover. If not…he'd have to improvise again. In a desperate attempt to buy a few more seconds, he looked up and searched for Davies's face in the crowd but his 'mate' was nowhere to be seen. Disappointed with Napoleon's performance, he had probably retreated to the back of the crowd or was drinking up the whole refreshments table to forget about the embarrassing scene he had just witnessed. Painfully aware that everyone was holding their breath, impatiently waiting for him to finally murder poor Marshall, Napoleon turned his head to look at Cleary and forced a cheerful smile. \"Well, here we go!\", he said with feigned enthusiasm. He started bringing the dagger down and saw Marshall's eyes widen in a perfect combination of fear and disbelief. At that moment, a series of loud booms caused everyone in the room to jump, several guests even cried out in surprise. \"What…what was that?\", Napoleon asked in a trembling voice. He just had the time to see Cleary's confused gaze before the lights flickered, then went out altogether. \"Hey! What's going on? Is this part of the initiation?\" His question was drowned out by the panicked, overlapping voices of the cult members. With no windows, the room was pitch-black and apparently, none of the guests had thought of bringing a flashlight to the event. Napoleon blindly reached down to place a reassuring hand on Marshall's shoulder. Oops, that was his face… Suddenly he heard a crashing sound, probably the door being kicked in, and gunfire resonated through the room. Finally, and not a moment too soon… Napoleon could hear the cult members screaming and blindly scurrying to find shelter from the gunshots. He, on the other hand, didn't move. He remained at Marshall's side. They had agreed that Blake wouldn't shoot directly at people. Besides, he needed to make it easy for Blake to identify him since all his partner could see was a human-shaped heat source. \"No! Please don't kill me, I'm not even a member yet!\", he screamed in a terrified voice and as loud as he could. His sudden outburst achieved the desired effect and, a few seconds later, he felt Blake's hand on his shoulder. \"Get Marshall out of here.\", he whispered Blake said nothing for a second. He was probably surprised to hear that Marshall was alive. \"What about you?\", he finally said as he fired another two rounds. Probably to make sure that the cult members stayed out of earshot. \"I'm staying. You'll have to hit me to make it look plausible.\" \"I know. Take this.\" Blake grabbed his hand and he felt something being pressed against his palm. He brought the pill to his lips and quickly swallowed it. Then Blake struck him, hard, and pain exploded in his head. He didn't even have to fake the whimper which escaped his lips. Dammit, Blake, I said hit me, not punch my head off… He patiently waited for everything to go dark, then vaguely remembered that the room was already pitch-dark. Blake hit him a second time and even though he was already starting to lose consciousness, it still hurt. The last thing he felt before unconsciousness engulfed him completely was Blake's hand squeezing his wrist. Blake's p.o.v. He inserted a full magazine in his gun and chambered a round before quickly stepping over Solo's lifeless shape. As he reached the side of the table, he fired his gun twice, in two opposite directions. He heard a few screams and saw the cult members cower in fear. This would give him enough time to cut Marshall's bonds. He set his gun down on the table and, while he unsheathed his knife, put a reassuring hand on the younger agent's chest. He could feel Marshall's heart racing crazily under his palm. Like a little rabbit's heart… He leaned close to Marshall's ear. \"Don't worry, I'll get you out of here.\", he whispered as he patted the agent's chest in a comforting gesture. From the corner of his eye, he saw movement. A silhouette was slowly making its way along the wall to his right, probably looking for the door. He picked up the gun and fired a round into the silhouette's leg. Silhouette went down screaming. Nothing else moved. Good. Without wasting any more time, he rapidly sliced through Marshall's bonds with his razor-sharp combat knife. \"Can you walk?\", Blake whispered as he helped the younger agent off the table. \"I think so…\" \"Lean on me, I'll guide you.\" Blake wrapped Marshall's left arm around his neck and slipped his own arm under his armpit and around his waist to support him. He frowned as his hand brushed against the younger man's back and Marshall hissed in pain. What the hell is that?... Blake's gaze and gun kept shifting from one cult member silhouette to another as he and Marshall made their way toward the door but no one tried to stop them. The man he had shot was still whining pitifully. He had probably failed to hit an artery. They cleared the door and Blake gave Marshall his gun to hold while he fished something out of one of his tactical vest pockets. He tossed the tear-gas grenade inside the room and closed the damaged door as best he could. \"That should keep them busy for a while.\", he said in a hushed tone as he took the gun back from Marshall's hands. \"Solo?\" Blake's mouth twisted into an apologetic grimace he knew Marshall would be unable to see. \"He'll be fine, he's unconscious.\" As they began to hear screams and coughing sounds through the door, he adjusted his grip around Marshall's waist and they set out again. The younger agent was weak and was leaning on him rather heavily. The fact that he couldn't see anything wasn't helping either. At least once they got to the ground floor there would be moonlight filtering through the windows. But that also meant that the guards would be able to spot them more easily. Hopefully, Kuryakin would be there to help. Suddenly, a deafening sound filled the corridor and something ricocheted off the wall to his right. He ducked while protectively pushing Marshall behind him at the same time. Shit… End of chapter 5 :)[Chapter 6] New chapter! Sorry for the long wait. I hope you enjoy this one :) Blake's p.o.v. Get Marshall out of harm's way. Dive behind the nearest cover. Breathe. Spot the bastard. Blake backpedaled frantically and pushed Marshall behind the angle of wall at the end of the corridor. After lowering the younger agent to the floor, he remained crouched low and tentatively stuck his head out to scan the hallway. I see you, my little friend… Blake retreated behind the cover of the wall just before the gun barked again. The bullet hit the wall on the opposite side of the corridor. The guard was blind firing. Blake had just been able to catch a glimpse of the hand holding the weapon. He felt the corners of his mouth lift ever so slightly. The thought that the obviously undertrained security guard could very well have been shooting at his own, escaping employers amused him. His smile did not linger long. Even if the guard was blind and unable to pinpoint their position, he was blocking their progression and represented a threat which needed to be eliminated. Blake quickly assessed the situation. He knew that the guard's position mirrored theirs; the man was hiding behind the wall at the other end of the corridor, so shooting at him was useless. Besides, Blake did not have an unlimited stock of ammunition and they would probably need the gun once they got to the upper level. The best way to neutralize the guard was to use the complete darkness to his advantage and either sneak up on him or lure him out. But in order to do that, he would need a diversion. Quickly setting his backpack down, he leaned close to Marshall's ear. \"Next time he shoots, pretend you've been hit.\" \"What?\" \"Trust me. Pretend you're wounded. Make it sound like it's bad.\" Marshall's heat signature seemed to hesitate for a second, then nodded. Blake hastily unstrapped his tactical vest and removed his belt and leg sheath, keeping only the gun in one hand and his combat knife in the other. He then stuck his hand out and fired a single round in the general direction of the guard. He wasn't really trying to hit the man. He was simply giving away their position. Or rather Marshall's position. He quickly put the gun in Marshall's hands and gave him a light tap on the shoulder before lying down flat on the floor and waiting for the next gunshot. He didn't have to wait long, the guard fired again, closer to their position this time. Immediately, Marshall let out a loud, sharp cry of pain with a nice hint of surprise. Now… Keeping low, Blake started crawling as silently as possible toward the end of the corridor. Marshall was now gasping and whimpering loudly. Blake was hoping that the guard would get a confidence boost from knowing that his target was badly hurt and that the man would step out of cover and rush down the corridor to finish off his wounded prey. He had to admit that so far, the younger agent's performance was pretty convincing. I shouldn't be surprised, dear Asher has had some practice… A sudden deafening sound had him drop flat against the floor. The guard was shooting again, probably making sure that his target was in no condition to retaliate. Reassured that no one was shooting back and hearing that his opponent was still whimpering, the guard finally decided to leave the cover of the wall. He did not rush down the corridor as Blake had hoped, however. The agent watched the man-shaped heat source tentatively step forward, using the wall as a guide. He held his breath. Absolute silence… Marshall's gasps were getting softer, weaker, which made for an even more authentic performance but also covered Blake's approach less efficiently. Thankfully, he didn't need to crawl any further; the guard, probably eager to end Marshall's life, had started moving faster, holding the gun up with one hand, feeling the wall with the other. His torso completely exposed. Perfect. Blake adjusted his grip on his combat knife. The guard was only a few inches away from him when he seemed to sense that something was not right and suddenly froze. Too late. Before he had a chance to voice his concerns, Blake had already made his move. In went the knife, below the ribs. Then up, next stop: the heart. Blake caught the man as he collapsed to make sure that he would keep a grip on the knife. The unfortunate fellow wasn't dead and was making a rather peculiar, low, gurgling sound. Blake noticed that the dying man was clawing convulsively at his chest and, for the second time, he felt his mouth curl up into a smile. Sorry pal, but I don't think that's going to fix your heart… After a few seconds, the man fell silent and stopped moving. Blake pulled his knife out and quickly wiped the blade clean on the dead man's leg. Then, wasting no time, he picked up the guard's gun and started feeling his pockets for ammunition. A second gun would be useful, especially once Marshall and him left the underground level. He was just about to check the man's belt when he heard it. Footstep… His head snapped up and suddenly the corridor looked considerably warmer than it had a minute earlier. That heat source was way too close to him. And had fists. The blow caught him in the throat. It was an awkward, tentative punch. His opponent – obviously much better at stealth walking than the scout/diversion Blake had just killed – was still trying to figure out his exact position. Most people, when they get punched in the throat, will gasp and instinctively clutch their windpipe with bulging eyes, wondering for a second if that's how they die. And Blake was no exception to the rule. As he struggled to breathe normally, he felt a hand grab a fistful of his hair. Then the thermal goggles were yanked off, along with the makeshift bandage on the back of his head. Dammit… Now he was blind. And he was probably going to have a nasty scar. His eyes watered automatically as the hand gripping his hair pulled hard, forcing him to stumble forward on his knees. He had dropped the gun and couldn't find his knife. He would have to take care of this one with his bare hands. Before he could plan his next move, he suddenly felt a rush of displaced air as someone ran past him. There's two of them…shit, Asher!.. \"Marsh…\", he started shouting but was interrupted by the barrel of a gun being painfully shoved against his nose. The man was about to shoot him in the face. A gun did go off but not the one he had been expecting. This one had the distinctive sound of a gun fitted with a sound suppressor. One sharp click – eerily loud in the confined space. He felt the guard who had been holding him drop to the floor. Headshot. A second gunshot and Blake heard another body drop. A faint chuckle. Casual footsteps, receding in the darkness. Then silence. Blake spent a minute feeling the floor around him for his goggles before finally finding them around the second guard's forehead. Slipping them on again, he peered at the darkness before him for a few seconds. Then he retrieved his knife, the guard's gun and the ammo and quickly walked back to the other end of the corridor, stepping past the still warm body of the man who had just rushed past him to kill Marshall. Asher's p.o.v. After the episode in the basement corridor, they had managed to get to the ground floor quickly, without encountering more guards. That confrontation in the pitch-dark corridor had been intense. Asher had nearly jumped out of his skin and involuntarily squeezed off a round when he had finally felt Blake's hand on his shoulder. The man really did know how to creep up on someone. Asher usually wasn't that jumpy but he had had a rough couple of weeks, to say the least. Between his capture, the less than pleasant little sessions with Mr. Asshole Cult master, and almost being the victim of Solo's very first attempt at human sacrifice… Nah, he was almost certain that Solo would have stopped before sticking the blade into his body. Almost. Still he was thankful for Blake's impeccable sense of timing. Blake. Asher didn't know the man that well but he had heard his name mentioned on several occasions and had talked to him a couple of times. He had been relieved when, thanks to the moonlight filtering through the windows, he had finally been able to identify his savior. He knew it was silly but that moment when he had felt a hand come to rest on his chest as he was lying on that table, tied up and completely helpless, had reminded him of another rather unpleasant experience. He chased the thought away and tried to concentrate on not being too much of a burden for the other agent. Easier said than done, he could feel his strength fading with each step and he had to make a conscious effort to hold up the gun Blake had given him. Every inch of his body hurt, his throat was sore from too much screaming and he was incredibly thirsty. His mind started to wander again. Maybe a helicopter would come to pick them up once they were out… You're dreaming, Asher. Sanders would never send a helicopter just for you. Come to think of it, Sanders would never send a team to rescue you in the first place… But if Owen Blake was here, Sanders had to be involved somehow. His thoughts were interrupted as Blake abruptly stopped walking and pushed him against the wall of the narrow hallway they had just entered. That meant company. He watched as Blake soundlessly made his way toward the end of the corridor. Right after he had disappeared around the corner, Asher heard a faint gasp of surprise immediately followed by what sounded like a scuffle. He rushed – or rather staggered – forward, holding the gun up unsteadily. As he rounded the corner, he instinctively pointed the gun at the other man. The tall, blond man. Blake quickly forced his arm down, redirecting his aim toward the floor. Kuryakin… The Russian was apparently very surprised to see him. So this really wasn't supposed to be a rescue mission… \"I heard the explosions and saw the lights go out. I figured you would need help so I did some cleaning up on this floor.\" He paused and stifled a cough. Even in the semi-obscurity, Asher could tell that he was sick. \"Where's Solo?\", the Russian went on urgently. \"Downstairs with the nutcases. He's not coming with us.\" For a second, Asher thought that Kuryakin was going to destroy Blake. \"He's fine.\", Blake added placatingly. \"His cover hasn't been compromised. It was his decision to get on with the mission.\" Kuryakin still looked like he was going to destroy Blake but he hadn't done it yet, which was encouraging. He coughed again. \"Listen Kuryakin, once we get Marshall to the exit, I'll come back here with the listening device to make sure Solo is okay.\" \"I'll do it.\", the Russian replied, raising his voice slightly. He stifled another coughing fit. Asher saw Blake look around nervously. \"Be reasonable, Kuryakin. I don't think…\" He paused and frowned. \"What's wrong with your chest?\" The Russian, who had been rubbing his chest, quickly let his hand drop. He shot Blake a guilty glance. \"It feels tight, like I'm breathing syrup.\" He hesitated. \"And it hurts.\" \"I told you to let me know immediately if you experienced chest pain. This is serious, Kuryakin, you could die.\" Yeah well, all three of us are going to die if we don't get a move on… Asher was about to voice his concerns when a dizzy spell forced him to lean heavily against the wall. The two men turned to look at him. \"Let's go.\", Blake decided, slipping his arm around the younger agent's back. Asher bit back a gasp of pain. Hopefully his back wouldn't take too long to heal. Illya's p.o.v As they progressed toward the exit, Illya tried his best to contain his irritation. It bothered him that he had been unable to hit Blake earlier when the American had bumped into him. Not because he wanted to hurt Blake, not really. But even with the element of surprise on Illya's side, the CIA agent had been able to dodge his attack easily. \"Your labored breathing gave you away, you know.\", Blake had whispered, as if he could read Illya's mind. Of course Illya had been glad to discover that Asher Marshall was alive. He had recognized him easily, the agent didn't look much different from the last time Illya had seen him: shirtless, battered, and bleeding. He glanced at Blake and Marshall over his shoulder and sighed inwardly. He just wished Cowboy had decided to follow them. He knew his partner could take care of himself but he had a bad feeling about leaving him behind. They had finally agreed that Blake would stay with him. Marshall and Illya would head back to the cottage with Gaby. If they made it out alive, of course. They were getting close to the exit. Time to call Gaby… Without stopping, he holstered his Makarov, pulled the flare gun out of his leg holster and loaded it. He had left the door open to facilitate their escape. He turned to check that Blake and Marshall were still following. Marshall was weak and Blake had to support most of his weight. He turned back to the door and was about to step outside when a man appeared right in front of him. The guard looked as surprised as Illya felt but he also had a gun in his hand and it was pointed at Illya's chest. So Illya used the only weapon he had. The flare hit the man in the stomach before he had the chance to pull the trigger. His mouth opened in a silent \"oh\". Then not so silent. Illya grabbed the screaming man, making him pivot and pulled him close. He swiftly snapped his neck and let him drop to the ground. He turned around to find Blake and Marshall staring at him. \"I have a spare.\", he grumbled, fishing another flare out of his pocket. Wasting no more time, he shot the flare into the night sky. By the time they got to the far end of the courtyard, Gaby would be there to pick them up. Illya discarded the flare gun and Blake handed Marshall over to him. \"He's dehydrated, make sure he drinks a lot of water. And give him one of these, it'll help him sleep. The rest can wait until I get back. And Kuryakin, get some rest. I mean it.\" Illya nodded, accepting the small bottle of pills. He watched as Blake's silent shadow disappeared inside the building. Let's go, fragile American number 2… They had made good progress when Illya heard a loud noise and something whistled past his ear. Gunshots. Someone was shooting at them. There were being chased. He exchanged a rapid glance with Marshall, then hauled the protesting agent up over his shoulders in a fireman's carry and started running. More gunshots, closer. Illya concentrated on running faster. Marshall had fallen silent and was hanging limply across his shoulders. He suddenly found himself wondering if the American had been hit by one of the flying bullets. Then he realized that he could feel Marshall's heartbeat against his upper back. The courtyard. He could see the car. They were going to make it. He wondered if he would ever be able to catch his breath. It felt like a colony of jellyfish had taken up residence inside his lungs. As they finally reached the car, Illya set the CIA agent down and fired a few rounds at their pursuers to buy some time. He then flung open the car door and shoved Marshall inside. \"Drive!\", he said urgently as he got in and slammed the car door shut. \"Asher? You're alive! Where are Solo and Blake?\" \"DRIVE!\", Marshall and him shouted in perfect unison. \"Alright, alright!\" Gaby reversed aggressively out of the courtyard and they disappeared into the night. Several hours later, unknown location \"I think we should kill Carlyle.\" \"We are not killing Carlyle.\" \"It has to be him. The attack, the agent getting rescued, and on the night of his initiation…\" \"I'll admit that it's odd but it's just an unfortunate coincidence.\" \"Come on, Cleary, I don't believe in coincidences, neither do you. Just let me interrogate him, I'll make him talk.\" \"You mean you'll make him scream? Like the young agent? You didn't have much luck making that one talk, now, did you? We both know where that information came from… Admit it, you just hate Carlyle because he turned your ceremony into a parody.\" \"I'm telling you Carlyle shouldn't be trusted. I know he was involved, somehow…\" \"You know as well as I do that it can't be Carlyle.\" \"Well, I'm not so sure. Maybe you've been trusting the wrong people.\" \"Enough! No harm will come to Carlyle until I decide otherwise. Is that clear?\" \"As you wish. But when you do decide otherwise, I want to be the one who kills him.\" End of chapter 6. Chapter 7 is coming soon :)[Chapter 7] Chapter 7! A reaaally long, calmer, uneventful chapter, in which nothing bad happens to anybody... (I swear... :P ) Early morning, unknown location, Solo's p.o.v. Napoleon let out a pained groan as he slowly regained consciousness. As far as he could tell, he was lying face up on a soft surface. A bed? He had a formidable headache and didn't really feel like opening his eyes. He knew he would have to, eventually, but the thought of light hitting his retina and travelling through his sensitive optic nerve seemed particularly unappealing. He took a deep breath and cracked one eye open, then the other. Oww… It took a couple of seconds for the world to come into focus but when it did, Napoleon realized that his headache was actually the least of his concerns. A glinting blade was hanging over his sprawled-out body. \"Die, Carlyle!\" Now the blade was coming down. Napoleon felt a jolt of adrenaline course through his body and rolled off the bed much faster than his confused brain should have allowed him to. He then jumped to his feet, instinctively adopting a fighting stance. \"Wow, wow. Take it easy, mate, it's a joke.\" Davies was standing by the bed, holding out his hands in a placating gesture. \"See? It's a switchblade, not that old, junky sacrificial dagger. Every bit as efficient if you ask me and much less pompous.\" Before he could say more, he was interrupted by the sound of someone clearing their throat. Napoleon's head whipped around. Cleary and the cult master had just entered the room. Davies had seen them too. He seemed to shrink like a deflating balloon and promptly hid the switchblade behind his back, trying his best to avoid the cult master's furious glare. \"I see you're finally awake, Mr. Carlyle. Good, it would have been a shame to lose you. How are you feeling?\" Confused and wimpy… \"I…my head really hurts. I remember, I was about to kill the young lad… What happened?\" Cleary seemed to hesitate, apparently reluctant to talk about the incident of the previous night. Napoleon pretended not to notice that the cult master was now glaring at him . \"I'm afraid your victim is no longer available, Mr. Carlyle…\" I hope that means Blake and Marshall made it out alive… \"But don't concern yourself.\", Cleary went on. \"We'll find a replacement in no time and you'll be able to complete your initiation. In the meantime…we've brought you here.\" \"I see. I...I do hope that things will turn out better this time...Where is \"here\", if you don't mind my asking?\" \"I'm afraid I can't tell you that. After all, you're not a member of our wonderful community yet.\" Napoleon snorted inwardly while Trevor Carlyle kept a straight face. Wonderful community of fanatic killers… \"I'm sure you understand that we prefer you to stay with us until your initiation is complete.\" \"What does that mean? Am I a prisoner?\" Some of the worry in Napoleon's voice was actually genuine. This wasn't exactly what he had been expecting when he had decided to stay behind and remain undercover. \"No, not a prisoner, Mr. Carlyle, \"guest\" would be a more appropriate word choice. We want you to feel comfortable here. You're free to stroll around the place, as long as you're accompanied of course. Davies will be your guide since he's the one who first introduced you to us. I know he's not the most intellectually stimulating company but don't worry, this is only a temporary measure.\" \"It's perfectly fine, I understand. And I appreciate the fact that you are ready to give me a second chance.\", Napoleon answered, risking a glance at the cult master. The man had not uttered a single word and was glaring at him so intently that Napoleon half-expected him to suddenly pull the stone dagger out from under his robes and savagely stab him in the heart. Three or four times. \"Very well, then. I hope you'll enjoy your stay with us, Mr. Carlyle.\", Cleary concluded as he turned to leave, followed by the fuming cult master. Davies visibly relaxed once they were gone and he winked at Napoleon as a cheeky smile spread across his round face. \"You should have seen your face when you spotted the knife.\" \"You should have seen yours when Cleary and his friend walked in.\", Napoleon shot back, vaguely annoyed. Davies ignored his remark and went on. \"You've got impressive reflexes for a businessman. And that fighting stance… could have fooled me.\" The man laughed heartily and gave him a slap on the shoulder. Napoleon made an effort to laugh with him. Well, that certainly was a close shave… To be fair, Davies had caught him off-guard just as he was regaining consciousness, but he was well aware that even the slightest slip out of character could cause him to end up on the sacrificial table, for real this time. Davies was eyeing the side of his head where Blake had punched him. \"That's a nasty bump you've got there. Good thing Mr. Posh Lad has a hard head. You were lucky, mind you. One of the crème de la crème-blue blood-elite members was shot in the leg. Now that's got to hurt.\" What happened to not shooting at people, Blake?.. He suddenly wondered if Blake was nearby, listening to their conversation. He discreetly glanced at his left wrist…and his heart missed a beat. Blake was definitely not listening to this conversation. His watch was gone. His gaze shifted to the small nightstand next to the bed. Nothing. \"What's the matter, mate?\" \"Nothing, it's just… do you know what happened to my watch?\" \"Your watch? How should I know? Although…it was a nice watch, and you were unconscious…that's what you get for always being so posh.\" \"But you didn't take it, did you, Davies?\" \"Nah I wouldn't do that to you, mate. You'd know it was me if you saw me wearing it.\" Davies gave another hearty laugh and changed the subject. \"Anyway, it's too bad you didn't get to kill that handsome kiddie. But don't you worry, they'll find another victim for you very soon, you just stick the bloody blade into that one and Bob's your uncle! And at least this time you'll know \"where…\"\" He let his voice trail off and opened his eyes wide, brandishing his switchblade with trembling hands in an exaggerated re-enactment of Trevor Carlyle's poor performance. Napoleon cringed inwardly as he recalled the embarrassing situation. He put on a sulky expression for Davies's benefit. \"You could have warned me.\" Davies clicked his tongue. \"Sorry, mate, that's against the rules. Also, I didn't want to spoil the surprise.\" \"I appreciate your thoughtfulness. So, from what I understand, you are supposed to be my 'chaperon'? How is this going to work?\" \"Well if you fancy a stroll, I can give you a tour of the place. There are some restricted areas, though, higher members only, you know. And I'll need to bring you back here and lock you in before dinnertime. I need to get back to my wife, you know what she's like.\" Restricted areas? Interesting… So he would either have to give Davies the slip during the day, or find a way to get out of the room during the night. Either way, he was sure that an opportunity would present itself, sooner or later. His mind flashed back to the look of hatred on the cult master's face and he wondered if he was being tested. Nobody seemed to want to talk about the attack and it struck him as odd that Cleary was not more suspicious and was so ready to give him a second chance. He would have to be extremely careful, especially considering that his only way to call for help has mysteriously vanished. At least I still have my tracker on… Two hours later, base cottage, Illya's p.o.v. \"Hear that, Kuryakin?\" Illya refrained from rolling his eyes. He felt like a little kid being lectured. He was lying in bed, flat on his back. Blake was holding the diaphragm of the stethoscope against his chest. He had just taken the earpieces out of his ears and inserted them into Illya's. Illya didn't really know what to make of what he was hearing so he simply nodded. \"Those rattling sounds every time you inhale, that's fluid in your lungs.\" Illya silently stared at Blake, waiting for him to continue. He could easily guess what the CIA agent was going to say next. \"Sorry Kuryakin, but you really put the \"ill\" in \"Illya\". You have all the symptoms of pneumonia.\" Illya cursed softly. \"That means no more hiking on the moors, visiting castles, or shooting people with flare guns. In fact that means no more getting out of bed. At least for a few days. I will give you antibiotics to treat the infection but if you don't get better in a couple of days, we might have to get you to a hospital.\" Illya felt mortified, in the span of a few days he had become useless. Worse, he had become a burden. The time Blake spent taking care of him he could have spent patching up Marshall or watching Cowboy's back. Illya had even tried to help Gaby with the research but he was feeling so unwell that he couldn't concentrate, and even though she had tried to be nice about it, he could tell that his constant coughing was starting to get on her nerves. Blake put away the stethoscope and gave him a light pat on the chest. \"Plenty of rest will definitely help. I suggest you start now. I'll get you your medication.\" Blake walked out of the room and a few minutes later he was back with a glass which he set down on the nightstand, within easy reach. \"I'd better get back to shadowing Solo. I'll check on you in a few hours.\" Illya grumbled a \"thanks\" as Blake left and closed the door behind him. He wondered if the CIA agent would mention that he was ill when he reported back to Sanders and Waverly. He produced one of his famous eye roll-exasperated sigh combinations. He had very little tolerance for weakness, especially coming from himself. At least Cowboy was okay, that was something. And he was being useful. Illya couldn't shake a bad feeling about the whole thing, though. He knew how risky undercover work was. And things were going a little bit too smoothly for his taste. Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby's eyes shot open when she heard Blake enter the living room. She had been drifting off, slowly but surely. It had been an eventful and sleepless night. Once they had reached the cottage, Illya and her had taken care of Asher as best they could. They had put him in Blake's room, on his bed. They had given him water, a little food. They had cleaned and dressed the weird x-shaped wound on his chest, scrubbed the dried blood off his chest and stomach. Poor Asher also had lacerations and weird blister-like wounds all over his back. Unsure what to do about those, they had decided to let Blake handle it once he got back. Illya had given him a pill from a small bottle and he had quickly fallen asleep. At that point, Gaby had suddenly realized that Illya looked like he was about to drop dead. She had managed to send him to bed and had spent the rest of the night and part of the morning watching over both Asher and Illya. She had felt so relieved when Blake had finally stepped through the front door. And he was bringing good news too. Solo was alive, and he was okay. The leaders of the secret society had taken him to some sort of secret lair out on the moors. Apparently they wanted to keep an eye on him until he completed his initiation. Blake had swung by for a house call and was probably about to head out again. \"How is Illya?\" \"He has pneumonia. I gave him something to battle the infection but he is going to need a lot of rest to recover.\" Poor, stubborn Illya… \"And Asher?\" \"Well he's doing relatively well for someone who was beaten, barely given any food and water, tortured with electric shocks…\" \"Electric shocks?\" \"Anyway… he's going to be okay.\", Blake concluded, probably sensing the emotion in her voice and deciding that leaving out the details was the best thing to do. She decided to change the subject. \"So you're heading back to where they're keeping Solo? Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?\" \"No, no, you should get some rest, you really look like you need it.\" Thanks… \"There's one thing you could do for me, though, before I leave.\" He set a small case down on the coffee table, in front of her, then pointed at the freshly bandaged wound on the back of his head. \"I'd rather not do it myself, would you mind…?\" \"Of course.\" As she used her very basic sewing skills to stitch up the wound as best she could, she marveled at Blake's self-control. Not a sound escaped his lips. Not even the slightest hiss when she stuck the needle in or pulled the thread tight. He had taken his shirt off to avoid getting blood on it and she could see that his shoulder muscles were completely relaxed. She smiled as she recalled the times when she had had to dress some of Illya's and Napoleon's wounds. Her big strong Russian of a partner was a real baby in comparison. Once the wound was stitched up and bandaged, the CIA agent thanked her, put his shirt back on and stood up, ready to leave. As Gaby watched him step through the door, she decided that she liked Blake and that she was glad he was on their team. With Illya sick, Napoleon undercover and Asher to take care of, she wasn't sure how she could have handled everything without him. Illya's p.o.v. Illya heard the front door close. Probably Blake leaving. He sighed, the American had left the light on when he had exited his room and for the past twenty minutes Illya had been debating whether it was worth it to get out of bed and turn it off. He finally decided that he needed complete darkness in order to fall asleep and dragged himself out of bed with a grunt. He switched off the light and blindly crossed the room again, hitting his knee against the angle of a cabinet in the process. He cursed under his breath and let himself plop on the bed. He had just closed his eyes when he remembered he had forgotten to take his medication. He extended his arm, blindly reaching for the glass, finding it a little closer to him than he thought, and spilling its contents all over the nightstand. Good job Illya… Dr. Blake was not going to be pleased. He retracted his arm and let it drop across his chest. The simple action had winded him. He closed his eyes again. And waited. Eventually, after a good twenty minutes of tossing and turning, coughing, listening to his labored breathing and massaging his aching chest, he came to the conclusion that even though he felt exhausted, he was simply unable to fall asleep. He suddenly remembered the small bottle of pills Blake had given him for Marshall. That would certainly help. He had left the pills in Blake's room. He made his way to the American's room and opened the door silently. Marshall was asleep. It struck him how worn-out and vulnerable the agent looked. Vaguely embarrassed, Illya grabbed the bottle of pills and quickly exited the room. He went to the kitchen, poured himself a glass of water, downed two of the tiny pills, then decided to give Waverly a quick call while he waited for the drug to take effect. He was hoping he could talk his boss into sending some backup. With Illya – temporarily, he hoped – out of the picture and Marshall in need of medical care, they needed at least one more agent to make sure that Cowboy would have someone watching his back at all times. The phone was in a small room, some kind of tiny study, adjacent to the kitchen. Illya dialed the number, and brought the receiver to his ear. Nothing. \"What's wrong with the phone?\", he shouted loud enough for Gaby to hear. Then he took a series of rapid, shallow breaths. Great, he was getting out of breath from shouting. \"It's dead.\", Gaby replied. \"I think Blake used it this morning to make his report to Sanders and some time after that, it stopped working.\" So Blake has already reported back to Sanders… \"I tried to place a call about information on some of the names from Asher's list,\" Gaby went on. \"But there was no dial tone. Blake and I had a look at it but we couldn't figure out what the problem was. Shouldn't you be in bed?\" Weird… Illya put the receiver down and walked back to his room. It didn't really matter; he would use his own portable radio transmitter to call Waverly. He suddenly felt extremely tired. Unnaturally tired. The sleeping pills were kicking in, big time. Open the door, shut it, don't bother switching the light on, straight to the bed – without hitting the cabinet this time – and collapse. He would call Waverly later. He closed his eyes and surrendered to the comforting embrace of sleep. Late afternoon, secret society headquarters, Solo's p.o.v The perfect opportunity had, indeed, presented itself and sooner than Napoleon had expected. Shortly after taking him back to his room/cell, after a very instructive tour of the premises, Davies had left him alone inside the locked room. He had reappeared a few minutes later wearing a concerned expression on his homely face. \"Sorry mate, I'm going to have to take a break from the babysitting. Family emergency, my wife needs me.\" \"No problem, Davies. I think I'll manage to survive without you for a short while.\" \"I won't be long, an hour, hour and a half at most. The thing is…\", the man had hesitated. \"I'm not really supposed to leave you alone, you know, not until your personal security guard gets here anyway.\" \"Personal security guard? Isn't that a little excessive? Are they concerned that I'm going to escape or something?\" \"I'd appreciate it if you didn't.\", Davies had said with a grimace. \"Hum, unless I suddenly gain the ability to walk through locked doors, I'm not going to have much luck with that, am I?\" Reassured, the man had left Napoleon locked inside the room. Fatal mistake… What poor Davies didn't know was that the prong from Napoleon's belt buckle was actually a lock-picking tool, hidden inside the belt. Napoleon smiled to himself as he hurried stealthily toward the restricted area Davies had graciously shown him, from a reasonable distance, during the tour. He chose a door at random. Luckily, it was not locked, he pushed it open and walked into…some sort of storage room. Great, for your eyes only-clutter… He closed the door, looked around to make sure that there was no one coming and selected another door, praying that he would have more luck with that one. This time, it was locked, he quickly picked the lock and entered the room. Closing the door behind him, he fumbled around for the light switch. As a pale light revealed the interior of the room to him, Napoleon decided that it was definitely more interesting than the previous one. Those robes and the ceremony attire probably belonged to the cult master. It looked like he had stumbled upon the man's study. Napoleon felt his pulse quicken slightly. He walked up to a massive desk at the far end of the room. Let's see what you have to hide… He tried one of the drawers. Locked. Not for long. Paper, blank. Pens, a pair of scissors. Second drawer. A file. Not just any file. Where did you get this from?.. Marshall was smiling at him from the picture inside the file. He quickly opened the two remaining drawers and was relieved that his file was not in there. He was about to put Marshall's file back when he noticed something at the back of the drawer. A notebook. What do we have here? The cult master's teenage diary? From back when he was still only torturing insects and small animals… He looked at the first page, then flipped through the entire book. Very interesting… The book had a diary-like structure with a date preceding each entry. The rest of the text was numbers – a lot of numbers – and code. Napoleon smiled. Encrypted information meant valuable information. His smile faded to a more serious expression as he started to think about how he was going to bring that information with him. The notebook had about fifty pages; memorizing everything would be impossible. He was tempted to take it with him but he knew that if the cult master noticed it was missing, he would immediately suspect him. His forehead creased as he racked his brain for a minute. He flipped though the book again, looking at the dates. He counted about two months between each entry, one month between the last one and the one just before. That's more than enough time. In one month I'm sure I'll be one of the higher members… He used the scissors to help tear the cover off the notebook. Then he went to the bookcase and selected a book with roughly the same size and thickness. He repeated the same process with the scissors and placed the empty cover back on the bookshelf. Then he put the contents of the bookcase book inside the cover of the notebook, placed everything back in the drawer and examined the result. Not bad… The altered notebook would pass a rapid inspection. Napoleon slipped the encrypted pages under his shirt and quickly locked all the drawers again. He looked at the clock on the desk. He didn't have much time left. Davies would be back soon. He had wasted too much time playing hide-and-seek with the security guards. He quickly exited the room, locked it and walked away. He was almost out of the restricted area when something caught his eye… And what is this beauty?.. He was standing in front of a door he had not noticed before, it appeared to be locked by a complex safe-type mechanism. He was running out of time. But it was so tempting. He knew he would have to make a second trip anyway. But it was so tempting. Just a quick peek… He could see no apparent alarm system connected to the door. He was about to reach for the locking mechanism when an alarm suddenly started blaring making his heart jump, then sink. Oh come on, I haven't even touched anything yet!.. Same time, base cottage, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby parked the car in the small driveway next to their cottage. She was driving the car Blake had \"borrowed\" the previous night to follow Solo and get back to the cottage. She was just back from a trip to one of the neighboring towns where she had finally been able to place her call. She had also bought a few cans of soup for Illya. The first thing she noticed was that the other car was there too. That meant Blake was back, presumably with more news about Napoleon. She got inside, expecting to find the CIA agent in the living room but he was nowhere to be seen. He was probably with Illya, or Asher. She went to the kitchen and was about to fix herself a drink when a voice behind her almost made her drop the glass. \"Good afternoon, Miss Teller.\" She turned around to see Blake, standing in the kitchen. He had probably just come out of Illya's room. So damn stealthy… \"Agent Blake. Would you like a drink?\" \"No, thank you, I was just about to check on Marshall. Then I'll be off again in a couple of hours. I think Solo is planning to search the place where he's being kept sometime tonight. I think it might be a good idea for you to come with me this time. In case things go awry.\" \"Of course. A drink might not be the best idea then.\" \"Probably not.\", Blake answered, flashing her his winning smile. He walked out of the room and she settled in the armchair, she wanted to go over the notes she had taken during her telephone call. She was only a few minutes into her reading when Blake reappeared. \"Sorry to disturb you again, I just wanted to warn you, some of the wounds on Marshall's back have become infected and I'm going to have to clean them. It's not going to be pleasant for him so if you hear him cry out, don't worry, I'm not murdering him, just patching him up.\" Gaby gave him a weak smile and nodded. Poor Asher…good thing Blake's here to take care of him… Secret society headquarters, Solo's p.o.v Running footsteps. Several people. Getting closer. How did they get here so fast? Was it a trap?… Quick. Hide the pages from the notebook. Large painting on the wall to his right. He quickly lifted the bottom of the painting and carefully placed the pages on the thick wooden frame so that they would rest against the back of the canvas. The footsteps were getting closer, he could hear voices too. He barely had the time to step away from the painting before the first guard appeared. \"I've got him, he's here!\" Congratulations, pal, do you want a medal?.. More running footsteps, more guards, more medals. Napoleon counted about ten guards, all pointing their weapon at various parts of his body. He put on his most innocent look but he knew he probably wasn't going to be able to charm his way out of this one. \"What's going on? Am I in trouble?\" \"Yes I'm afraid you are in trouble, Mr. Carlyle.\" Cleary, the cult master…and Davies who was giving him a why-would-you-do-this-to-me look. \"I…I was only gone for an hour…my wife…\" \"Silence!\" The cult master hit the squirming man in the face so hard that he knocked him off his feet. Davies quickly stood up again, his nose was bleeding. Napoleon couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the man. He watched as Cleary walked up to the door with the complex locking mechanism, and grabbed the handle. To Cleary's obvious dismay and Napoleon's complete surprise, the door glided open soundlessly. Cleary disappeared inside. Well, apparently I've reached a new level of mastery. I am now able to unlock doors without even touching them... Napoleon heard a faint gasp coming from inside the room. \"It's all gone, our files, destroyed, all the data, erased…\" Cleary had finally re-emerged and was standing in the doorway. He looked like he had just been slapped in the face by a bear. His reaction and the cult master's display of anger seemed to indicate that this wasn't some kind of ellaborate trap. Napoleon was so puzzled that he almost forgot to maintain his British accent. \"Listen I know it looks bad but I've got nothing to do with…\" \" So…do you still think it can't be him?\", the cult master interrupted. Cleary looked at his colleague, then at Napoleon, then at the cult master again. He seemed genuinely troubled. \"I…I need to make a few calls.\" \"What about him?\" The cult master was pointing at Napoleon. \"Do as you see fit. I've got more important things to worry about right now.\", Cleary answered as he started to walk away. Then he seemed to hesitate. \"Just…don't kill him…yet.\" The gleeful expression on the cult master's face sent a chill down Napoleon's spine. It was the first time he had seen the man smile. And it was disturbing, to say the least. \"Don't worry. I will make sure that he stays alive.\" Why am I not finding this reassuring… Base cottage, Blake's p.o.v \"Okay, Marshall, let's have another look at those wounds, just sit up for me please.\" Blake positioned himself behind the other agent and examined the lacerations and blisters on his back. \"It really doesn't look good, I think I'm going to give you a shot first, just in case. Then I'll clean the wounds. It's probably going to hurt a little.\" Marshall nodded and obediently extended his arm for him to perform the injection. He felt the younger agent tense up slightly as he drove the needle into his arm. He set the syringe down and started probing one of the wounds. Marshall jerked and hissed in pain. Painful, uh?.. \"Just relax, Asher.\", he said in a soothing voice. \"Everything's going to be fine.\" The younger agent suddenly turned to face him. \"Is there something wrong?\" \"No…nothing wrong, I just remembered I needed to talk to Kuryakin about something. It's rather urgent.\", Marshall replied as he attempted to get out of bed. \"Wow, wow, easy.\" Blake put a firm hand on his shoulder to prevent him from getting up. He could feel the agent's racing pulse against the side of his hand. Why are you so agitated, all of a sudden, my little friend?.. \"You don't understand, it's important, I need to talk to him right now.\" \"I'm sure it can wait. Besides, Kuryakin is resting. I don't think it would be a good idea to disturb him.\" \"Fine, I'll just talk to Miss Teller, then.\" As Marshall tried to get out of bed again, Blake quickly placed his hand on the right side of the younger man's chest and applied just the right amount of pressure. Marshall immediately gasped and backed away from his touch. Blake smiled. \"It still hurts, doesn't it? Fifth rib on your right side.\" End of chapter 7. Or not :P , sorry Solo, sorry Marshall (thanks for the reviews on chapter 6 :) )[Chapter 8] Chapter 8... uh-oh, \"ouch\" is all I'm gonna say about this one :p If you want to know what Owen Blake looks like, here he is: \"https\":\"/\"\"/\"\"ibb\".\"co\"/ c2mZk9 (quick portrait) \"https\":\"/\"\"/\"\"ibb\".\"co\"/d1Kqa9 (colored portrait) (just remove the \"\") Warning: creepy-guy is back Base cottage, Asher's p.o.v. Asher felt his heart skip a beat or ten and for a couple of seconds he just sat there, cradling his ribs, gaping at Blake. Thankfully his reflexes kicked in and he managed to dodge the incoming punch directed at his face. The killer's fist brushed past his temple and Blake, carried by momentum, fell on top of him, pinning him to the bed. Before he could move, Blake's thumbs were on each side of his throat, pressing on his carotid arteries. No you don't… Asher could not afford to lose consciousness. He grabbed Blake's wrists, locking them against each side of his neck and twisting them slightly. He was going for a double arm lock but before he could raise his legs and wrap them around Blake's shoulders, the killer had already escaped his grip. Things were not looking good. He could feel the little strength he had left draining away, fast. The injection. It was too late. No. He would fight this time. Target his head wound. Make the bastard hurt… He struggled to reach behind the killer's head, awkwardly ripped off the bandage and clawed at the stitches as savagely as he could. To his horror, Blake barely winced and looked at him with an amused smile. What the hell?... \"If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to hurt me, Asher.\" He stared at the killer in disbelief for a couple of seconds and that was all it took for Blake to deliver an expert open hand chop to his throat. \"Hhhgh…\", was all that came out of Asher Marshall's mouth before Blake clamped a hand over it, pinching his nose between thumb and forefinger at the same time to keep him quiet. He tried to struggle but Blake was heavy and Asher, because of the drug he had been injected with, was already too weak to push him away. He couldn't breathe. The killer whispered in his ear. \"Shh, shhhh, Asher, hey Asher, look what I've got here.\" Blake had just used his free hand to fish something out of his pocket and was holding it in front of his eyes. He couldn't breathe. \"This little thing allows me to remotely detonate small explosive charges. Like the ones we used to rescue you. Or like the one I placed under lovely Gaby's armchair. You know, the one she's sitting in right now.\" Probably sensing that he was about to pass out, Blake let him take a couple of breaths before blocking his airways again. \"See, my concern is that the walls here are pretty thin, and I don't want anyone to spoil my fun this time. If at any point you try to call for help, Miss Teller will be blown to bits before you have a chance to say \"Kuryakin\". Calling him wouldn't help anyway.\", the bastard chuckled. \"Poor Kuryakin is already half-dead. So, do we have a deal?\" Asher was starting to get dizzy from the lack of oxygen, he felt too weak to nod so he blinked instead and Blake finally released him. It was like the first time. He was trapped inside his own body. His limbs felt impossibly heavy. He wasn't even sure that he would have been capable of shouting for help. Blake let a pair of handcuffs dangle right above his face. \"I'm trying hard to re-create the mood of our first encounter. I'm sure you'll appreciate the effort.\" As the killer finished cuffing him to the bed, Asher suddenly felt an uncontrollable fear overwhelm him and let out a weak, pitiful groan. \"Ah-ah\", Blake admonished, raising a finger in warning. \"You don't want to disturb sweet Gaby while she's reading, do you?\" He disappeared from Asher's field of vision for a few seconds and came back with a rag which he proceeded to stuff into the agent's mouth, then he sealed everything up with copious amounts of surgical tape. \"There, all better. Now, what am I going to do to you, Asher?\" Secret society headquarters, Solo's p.o.v. Well…I suppose it could be worse. At least I'm alive and I still have my pants on… Napoleon was standing in the middle of a brightly lit room. He could see brownish stains – which he had decided were humidity stains – on the stone floor and on the wall in front of him. His nose was itching but he couldn't scratch it because his arms were raised high above his head, his wrists locked in heavy manacles secured to a chain hanging from the low ceiling. His ankles were shackled to a bolt in the floor. He was alone in the room and nothing bad had happened yet. Except for that persistent nose itch. Before taking him to this room, the guards had searched him and removed his shirt – Careful! You'll get it all wrinkled! – Thankfully he had been allowed to keep his pants, and more importantly, his belt with the lock-picking tool and the emergency tracker in the buckle. Blake already knows I lost the watch, I'm sure he will realize something is wrong when he sees the tracker completely still for an extended period of time…or he'll think I'm taking a nap… The CIA agent would probably find a way to check on him and if he didn't, Napoleon knew that Illya would. In the meantime…well, he'd worry about that later. He had decided to maintain his British accent even though he knew that his cover was probably compromised. The less they knew about him, the better. He was still trying to wrap his head around what had happened earlier. He hadn't been in that room. There had to be someone else involved. Cleary and his friend wouldn't destroy their own sensitive information just to expose him… His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone walking into the room behind him. He heard the door close and soon after, the cult master appeared in front of him. He had changed back into his crimson robe and looked considerably more cheerful now that he had Napoleon at his mercy. \"Ah! Thank God you're here. My nose is itching, it's absolute torture…would you mind scratching it for me?\" \"Very funny, Mr. Carlyle. But we're not here to tell silly jokes, I'm afraid.\" \"Pity. What are we here for, then?\" The cult master glared at him, then after a few seconds, a smile spread across his face, not quite reaching his eyes, though. \"I'm here to make you suffer, Mr. Carlyle. And you're here to tell me who you really are, who you work for and what you were doing in that room.\" \"This is all a terrible mistake. I am Trevor Carlyle, I never set foot inside that room. I don't even know what was in there. You caught the wrong man.\" That part was true, at least. \"Interesting. You expect me to believe you? Even though we found you standing right in front of the unlocked door?\" \"I told you, Davies had left the door of my room unlocked. I figured no one would mind if I took a little stroll, I was looking for Mr. Cleary.\" \"In the restricted area?\" \"No one told me it was a restricted area.\" Napoleon noticed that the cult master had not mentioned the notebook. He did not seem to be worried about it and Napoleon intended to keep things that way. That meant he would have to keep the man entertained. As long as the cult master was with him, he wouldn't be checking the contents of his secret drawers. \"Well I'm sorry, Mr. Carlyle but your explanation is far from satisfying. Perhaps a healthy dose of pain will help you come up with a more reasonable story.\" \"Wait! All right, all right I'll tell you all you need to know. No need to torture me.\" \"I'm listening\", the cult master answered with a smile, stepping closer. \"Well, here's the truth, this robe really doesn't look good on you, and I'm not saying that because you're ugly – although you are. Actually, I don't think it could ever look good on anybody. The color is hideous and it looks so impractical. Are you even wearing anything undern…\" The cult master's fist slamming into his stomach stopped his tirade. Temporarily winded by the blow, Napoleon had to make an effort to speak distinctly. \"Oh my goodness, be careful!… Mr. Cleary said he wanted me to stay alive… You could have killed me with that exceptionally powerful punch.\" The cult master looked like he was about to hit him again – as hard as he could, this time – when something seemed to catch his attention. He pointed at the stab wound scar on Napoleon's chest. \"What happened here, Mr. Carlyle? A business accident?\" \"Just a minor argument with a friend. It…escalated a little\" \"Another businessman, I presume?\" \"Precisely. He hits much harder than you, mind you.\" \"I have many other ways of hurting you, Mr. Carlyle. So many. Perhaps a practical demonstration…\" The cult master stepped behind him and although Napoleon couldn't see what he was doing, he could hear what sounded like metallic objects being dragged on a hard surface. His pulse began to hammer. The man finally moved back into his field of vision just long enough to show him the object he had selected. A whip. That wasn't so bad. He could take it. As he felt his heart begin to pound harder, he wondered for a second if he should bother to scream in British too. \"Wait!... We…we haven't decided on a safe word.\" The man gave him a smile that could have illustrated the word \"sadistic\" in the dictionary. \"I'm afraid none of the words you will utter can save you now, Mr. Carlyle.\" As the cult master moved to position himself behind him, Napoleon took a deep breath and closed his eyes. All right. Remember. Pain is all in your mind… All he needed to do was concentrate on something else. Like finding shapes in the 'humidity' stains on the wall in front of him. The first blow came. Aaaah shit! Never mind… pain is definitely in your back... After a few minutes, every single stain on the damn wall had the distinct shape of pain. His muscles were aching from constantly tensing up in anticipation of the next blow. His back was on fire. Sweat was dripping from his forehead, into his eyes, already watering from the stinging pain. Suddenly, the lashing stopped and the cult master stepped back into his field of vision. \"Time for a short break, Mr. Carlyle. I wouldn't want you to get too used to the pain.\" \"Yeah… that would be a real shame, wouldn't it?\" The man smiled and put his finger under Napoleon's chin to tilt his head up. \"You are really not doing too bad…almost as good as that young man you were supposed to sacrifice last night. But we both know he wasn't a simple businessman, don't we, Mr. Carlyle?\" Two weeks of this? Damn…poor Marshall… \"I have no idea what you're talking about.\", Napoleon answered, his face a picture of innocence. \"We'll see about that, Mr. Carlyle. Your break is over.\" Hum…now would probably be a good time to come to the rescue, Peril…while I still have some skin on my back… Base cottage, Blake's p.o.v. At last… Blake smiled as he let his gaze wander over the helpless agent's body. He had waited patiently for this moment. He had been so pissed-off when he had seen the bruises, lacerations and electrical burns on Marshall's body. The assholes had damaged his target. He had decided to give the agent some time to recuperate. It bothered him to think that those fanatic bastards had done half the work for him. Asher Marshall was his prey. And he had wanted to wait until Kuryakin was on the brink of death, which was probably the case now with the nice cocktail he had given him earlier. His smile widened as he noticed that the X-shaped cut below Marshall's sternum had started bleeding again. He peeled off the bandage, dipped a finger into the fresh blood and licked it, all the while staring into Marshall's eyes. He almost burst out laughing at the horrified look on the agent's face, then he remembered the need to be silent. Not for much longer… He laid his hand flat on his target's stomach, feeling the rhythmic pulse of Marshall's blood flowing through his abdominal aorta. Fast. So fast. He could tell that the agent was trying really hard to struggle against his bonds but he was too weak and his very limited movements were slow and uncoordinated. He let out an amused sigh. \"You really don't like being trapped, do you, Asher? Not being able to move…it makes your tough little agent's heart race and race and race…\" He could see anger now in the agent's eyes, but the fear was still there too and he knew it wouldn't go away until those eyes stopped seeing for good. \"You think this is bad, Asher?\", he whispered into Marshall's ear. \"Well I have a surprise just for you…don't go anywhere.\" He chuckled and went to grab his medical bag from which he pulled out two small syringes and two small, labeled bottles, each full of a clear, yellowish liquid. He set everything down on the nightstand, then filled one of the syringes with liquid from one of the two bottles. He sat down on the bed and held up the syringe in front of Marshall's face. \"You're going to like this, Asher\", he whispered. \"See, this substance is derived from the venom of the blue-ringed octopus. To put it simply, it's a toxin which causes progressive paralysis of voluntary muscles. All voluntary muscles.\" He felt his lips curl up into a cruel smile as he saw Marshall's eyes widen in realization. \"Yes, Asher, that includes your diaphragm.\", he said, poking the agent's chest. \"First sweating, headache, weakness, then gradual paralysis, nausea, abdominal pain, increasing respiratory distress…and you'll be conscious through most of it.\" Giving a target a detailed description of what was going to happen to them never failed to trigger satisfying reactions. The look of raw fear in the agent's eyes sent a thrill through his body. Psychological torture was almost as fun as killing. Almost. \"But enough talking. It's time for your injection.\" Marshall whimpered weakly as he grabbed his left arm and injected him with the toxin. \"Shh, shh, there, that wasn't so bad, was it?\" He set the used syringe down on the nightstand and quickly started filling the second one with liquid from the other bottle. \"Now, Asher, because I am a compassionate person, I'm going to give you a chance. This…\", he said, holding up the full syringe. \"…is the antidote to the toxin I injected you with. It will reverse the paralysis and save your life…if you can reach it, of course.\" He waited a second for the words to sink in, then he thrust the needle into the agent's abdominal muscles and just left the syringe in, without depressing the plunger. Despair flashed across his victim's eyes. He was tempted to stay and just watch the toxin slowly take effect. But first he needed to eliminate the others. Discipline. \"Sorry Asher, but I'm going to have to leave you. I have two pressing issues I need to attend to. But don't worry, this is a modified, slow-acting version of the toxin. That means I'll be back in time to watch you suffocate to death. Or maybe I'll give you the antidote and dissect you alive instead. Oh, and I wouldn't count on good old Sanders saving you this time. As far as he's concerned, you've been dead for about three weeks.\" He walked up to the closet, pulled a black silk scarf out of his suitcase and stuffed it into his pocket. Beautiful scarf for a very pretty woman… He would take care of Miss Teller first. Then he would put the KGB agent out of his misery. He ruffled Marshall's hair in a mock-affectionate gesture and whispered one last time in his ear. \"Good luck, Asher!\" Then he put on his best Owen Blake smile and walked out of the room. When he got to the living room, Gaby Teller was still reading in the armchair. She looked up when she heard him come in. \"How is he?\" Probably really, really scared… \"He's fine, I gave him something for the pain. He's resting…peacefully.\" \"Good…\" He noticed that she was chewing nervously on her bottom lip. Don't worry about Asher. He'll live longer than you… \"What time are we leaving?\" \"In about an hour. I'd like to see how Kuryakin is doing first.\" She nodded and smiled at him. She really had a lovely smile. Stepping behind the armchair, he walked out of the living room, as if he were heading to the Russian's room but stopped in the corridor. He waited for her to resume her reading. Then he pulled the scarf out of his pocket and began his silent approach. End of chapter 8 I hope you are still enjoying the story :) (And I don't know how many times I wrote \"Asher\" in this chapter, but it felt like a lot :D )[Chapter 9] Chapter 9!...Ouchy ouch :P Secret society headquarters \"…but you said we would be protected…\" - You are protected, Mr. Cleary. \"You don't understand…one of our members was shot. Several others are considering leaving the organization.\" - This is a result of your own incompetence. Or maybe you are insinuating that it was our fault? \"No! It's not what I said. Of course not. It's just…there was also that incident with Carlyle…\" - An incident, Mr. Cleary? \"Our files, our data, archives of our transactions with you, extremely sensitive information…everything was destroyed. And…we have reason to believe that Carlyle was involved.\" -… \"Sir?\" - I see. Are you sure that everything was destroyed? \"Yes, Sir, it was all in the safe. Nothing could be salvaged.\" - How unfortunate. \"But…what about Carlyle?\" - We'll look into it, Mr. Cleary. In the meantime I suggest you stop worrying so much. You'll drive yourself to an early grave and we wouldn't want that, would we? \"No, Sir…Thank you, Sir.\" Base-cottage, Asher's p.o.v. Well…shit… Asher sighed inwardly. He wanted to live but lately life just didn't seem to want him. He had spent a few minutes beating himself up for not recognizing the killer earlier. In his defense, he wasn't the only one who had been fooled; although Asher had only met him recently, Blake had been working for the CIA for years. Still, the man had tortured him, had laughed while he was screaming in agony. He should have known. … He thought back to that moment on the sacrificial table, in the dark, when he had felt that hand on his chest. He should have trusted his gut. Now everybody was going to die. Well done, Asher. Not only are you incapable of keeping yourself alive, you're also taking everyone else down with you… Gaby, Kuryakin, he needed to warn them. He thought about the explosives. Had Blake been bluffing? He had no way of knowing but they were going to die anyway, even if he remained quiet. He tried to scream but the only sound he managed to make was a weak, muffled groan. No one would hear him. Even when he began to suffocate, no one would hear him. He was trying really hard to remain calm. How long had Blake said it would take for the toxin to take effect? Oh, right. The bastard hadn't said. Of course, it made things even worse for him, not knowing. How much time did he have left before paralysis started affecting his respiratory muscles? How many painful minutes would it take before he finally stopped breathing? How many before his heart stopped? He suddenly became hyper-aware of everything going on in his body. All those little things he had taken for granted. Air flowing in and out of his nose. His chest rising and falling. His heartbeat. He was going to go crazy. Okay, just breathe… … while you still can, whispered a little voice in the back of his head. He chose to ignore it and forced himself to take one deep breath, then another. As he started drawing a third breath fear suddenly gripped his heart. Was it just his imagination or was inhaling getting harder? Panic overwhelmed him and he tried to scream again, to no avail. No one would hear him. His gaze fell on the syringe still protruding from his abdomen and he desperately tried to move his arms and legs, to twist his body. After a minute of fruitless efforts, he stopped trying. What are you doing, Asher…you're not getting out of those handcuffs anyway… He knew there was no way he could get his hands on that syringe, and that was the only reason Blake had left it there, because knowing that the thing that could save him was right in front of him but still out of his reach was pure torture. Asher suddenly felt terribly lonely. He was going to die in this room, a slow, agonizing death, and there was nothing he could do. I don't want to die like this. I don't want to die… Illya's p.o.v He's alone, in his room. No. Not completely alone. There's a huge snake coiled around his chest. Squeezing. It hurts. He wants to get rid of the snake but he can't use his hands. He is holding something and he knows he can't let go. He can't quite remember why but it's important that he doesn't let go. The snake squeezes harder. It's hard to breathe. He closes his eyes and when he opens them again he's on the moors, it's nighttime and it's cold. He's still holding that very important thing, despite the barely bearable pressure on his chest. He knows he should look down but he doesn't want to. \" It's too late, you know…\" He knows it's the snake speaking. He can hear it inside his head. A cruel, mocking voice. He looks down. He's not holding something. He's holding someone. He's gripping Cowboy's hand as tightly as he can. But Cowboy is not gripping back. His body is almost completely submerged in a giant peat bog, only the top of his head is still sticking out. His face is under. He pulls as hard as he can but it has no effect. His strength is gone, his chest hurts, Cowboy is dying. \" I told you it's too late, why don't you just let go?\" Again that mocking voice inside his head. \" He's my friend, you asshole!\" The voice in his head laughs. The coils tighten around his chest, bringing him to his knees. It hurts! He can't breathe. He's going to die too. The voice laughs and laughs. Illya woke up with a start. The snake was still squeezing his chest! No. Not a snake, just fluid in his lungs. He gagged and was seized by a violent coughing fit. He barely had time to grab his handkerchief. Thick, bloody mucus. Wonderful. As he massaged his aching chest, he thought about the strange, vivid nightmare he had just woken up from. He shot an accusatory glance at the bottle of \"sleeping\" pills on the nightstand. Never again. At least he had been able to sleep for a few hours. He was not feeling worse than before his drug-induced nap, but he was definitely not feeling better either. The dream had reminded him of his aborted project of calling Waverly to request backup. He got up, put on a clean shirt, and was about to get out of the room when he suddenly remembered that the phone wasn't working. He grabbed his portable radio transmitter from a locked briefcase in the closet and called Waverly. His boss was apparently surprised to hear from him and Illya remembered that Blake had already reported back to both Sanders and Waverly. Illya didn't beat around the bush and immediately explained that they needed at least one more agent, listing several reasons, not insisting too much on the fact that he was ill, and stressing the fact that Blake was busy taking care of Marshall. - Wait…what did you say? \"Marshall was in bad shape when we found him, he had been tortured and…\" - You mean that Marshall is alive? \"Of course Marshall is alive. I thought Blake called to give you an account of last night's mission.\" - He did, Kuryakin. And he also confirmed that Marshall was dead, hence my puzzlement… Illya felt a sudden rush of adrenaline course through his body. He dropped the radio and pulled his suitcase out from under his bed. He reached under the clothes and grabbed his holster. Empty. His Makarov was gone. So was his combat knife. Rushing back to the closet, he checked the sheath on his tactical vest. His spare knife was still there. Blake had missed it. He quickly unsheathed the knife and walked out into the corridor as silently as possible. As he risked a glance inside the living room, his blood ran cold. Gaby!… The bastard had a scarf around Gaby's throat and was strangling her. She was still conscious and struggling but she was no match for Blake. Feeling a murderous rage take hold of him, Illya silently closed the distance between him and Blake and drew back the knife to stab him in the kidney. Then something unexpected happened. Before he could stick the blade into his back, Blake let go of Gaby – who dropped like a rag doll – and grabbed his wrist with one hand, twisting it in a painful wristlock as he spun around. Illya gasped and dropped the knife as Blake twisted harder, forcing him to his knees. The man was impossibly fast. Much faster than Illya. And strong. Blake clicked his tongue disapprovingly and smiled at him. \"Heavy breathing, Illya…\" He twisted even harder until Illya thought that his wrist was going to snap. \"I see you forgot to take your medication. It's okay, I'm here to take care of you.\" Blake drew back his free arm and smashed his fist into the side of Illya's head. Then he let go of his wrist and took a step back. \"I'm feeling generous today, so I'll let you try again.\" Illya knew that in his current state, he was no match for the American. Hell, even without being ill he wasn't certain that he would have stood a chance against the man. He laboriously tried to get to his feet but before he could stand up, Blake drove his knee into his gut. He gasped and doubled over, completely winded by the blow. But Blake wasn't finished with him. The bastard kicked him in the side, hard. He cried out in pain and Blake kicked him a second time, then a third, precise, vicious kicks meant to cause the maximum amount of pain possible. Blake was trying to incapacitate him. He wrapped his arms around his sides, trying to protect his ribs and Blake chose this moment to kick him in the face, sending him sprawling onto his back. \"Good idea, Illya, just roll over for me. Show me your cute, vulnerable little tummy…\" Stunned, Illya closed his eyes for a moment and when he opened them, Blake was leaning over him. He had his knife in his hand. The knife came down and suddenly he felt a burning line of pain across his stomach. Blake had just sliced open the bottom half of his shirt – and his skin –, exposing his stomach. \"Want to see what your intestines look like, Illya?\" He felt the tip of the blade dig into his skin and adrenaline kicked in, jerking him out of his daze. Grunting with the effort, he gripped Blake's wrist to prevent the blade from going in deeper. At the same moment, he heard a loud crashing sound and looked up to see Gaby holding a lamp which she had just smashed down on Blake's head. With an annoyed groan, the American snatched his hand out of Illya's grip and in the same movement spun around to hit Gaby in the head with the pommel of the knife. Taking advantage of his momentary inattention, Illya pounced on Blake and they both went down, fighting for the knife, rolling on the floor. It wasn't long before Blake overpowered him, though, and without really knowing how, Illya suddenly found himself lying flat on his back with the American looming over him. Déjà vu. The knife. He couldn't see the knife. He checked his own body, then Blake's hands, before finally locating the knife. It was embedded in the right side of Blake's chest, just below his ribcage. Illya stared at his opponent's face, he didn't seem to be in pain. If anything he looked annoyed. Blake looked down at the knife then at him and for a second Illya thought that the man was going to yank the knife out and stab him in the face. But he didn't. Instead he quickly backed away, closing a protective hand around the handle of the knife, and jumped to his feet. It was then that Illya realized his mistake. I should have pulled it out… He didn't get much time to beat himself up - or to do anything else, for that matter - as Blake delivered a brutal stomp kick to his gut before bolting for the front door. He wanted to get up, wanted to go after Blake but instead he was lying on the floor, clutching his stomach, trying hard not to throw up. He heard the engine of a car. It was too late. He didn't even have a gun. And Gaby needed him. He crawled over to her and worriedly pressed his fingers against the side of her neck. She was just unconscious. He gently brushed a loose strand of hair off her face. She had an impressive bump on the side of her head, it was bleeding. Panting with the effort, Illya carefully moved her to the couch and sat down beside her. He leaned over her and gave her a gentle tap on the cheek. She groaned. She was beginning to regain consciousness. Good. He saw her crack one eye open and look at him. He smiled at her encouragingly. She groaned again and raised a hand to the side of her head. He caught her hand in his and gently set it back down on the couch. \"Don't touch. You were hit pretty hard, you're bleeding and…\" Before he could finish his sentence, Gaby suddenly sat up, both eyes wide open, and croaked, \"Asher…\" Illya studied her face worriedly. \"No, I'm Illya.\", he answered. She frowned impatiently and shot him a 'please make an effort' look. \"No… Asher…He said Asher was resting!\" Illya felt his heart sink. He had completely forgotten about poor Marshall. Injured, helpless, vulnerable, probably dead Marshall… There might still be a chance… Ignoring the burning sensation in his chest, he rushed to Blake's bedroom as fast as he could. He reached the door, flung it open, took a step toward the bed, hoping against hope… But of course he was too late. One glance was enough for him to realize that the CIA agent was beyond help. He cursed softly and caught Gaby by the arm as she pushed past him to rush to Marshall's side. He knew Gaby considered Marshall a friend and although there was nothing he could do for the dead agent now, at least he could spare her the sight of his corpse. He felt anger rise inside him. He should have yanked the knife out. He should have killed the bastard. Torture room, Solo's p.o.v. \"You're still standing…impressive. Your colleague would be proud. But I keep forgetting, what's his name again?\" Napoleon made an effort to look up at the cult master who was now standing in front of him. \"Just say his name for me, Mr. Carlyle, and the pain will stop…for a little while.\" \"I told you I don't kn…\" The whip whistled through the air and Napoleon let out a surprised cry as a thin, bloody mark appeared across his chest. \"Wrong answer, Mr. Carlyle. Let's try something else, you still haven't told me your real name. I must admit that I'm dying to know.\" And I'm dying to punch your head in but we don't always get what we want… \"Trevor Carlyle is my real name. You're wasting your time…\" \"You're being very uncooperative, Mr. 'Carlyle'. I think it's time to take it up a notch.\" The cult master disappeared behind him for a minute. When he came back he was no longer holding the whip…but Napoleon wished he were. Oh come on…anything but that… Well maybe not anything but he remembered all too well the excruciating pain inflicted on him by Gaby's deranged uncle and he wasn't exactly eager to experience it again. As he stared at the electric cattle prod, he felt his heart begin to hammer again. \"What, no more lashing? I was just beginning to develop a taste for it.\" \"Don't worry, we can always come back to it later. In the meantime, I guarantee you're going to tell me your name, your colleague's name and everything else I want to know. And you're going to scream too. A lot.\" That's three no's, and one probably…let's just hope that it's not as bad as I remember… As the man stepped closer and raised the cattle prod, Napoleon couldn't help but flinch ever so slightly. \"Ah, I see I have made the right choice. Finally something you're really scared of, Mr. Carlyle.\", the cult master commented, smiling like a kid on Christmas morning. \"This is going to be even more enjoyable than I thought.\" He raised the prod again and slowly brought it closer to his victim's chest. Napoleon recoiled instinctively but shackled as he was, there was no escape. The electrodes touched his skin and agony coursed through his body. The pain didn't last long. But it was definitely worse than he remembered. And he knew it was only the beginning. End of chapter 9. (thank you for the views/reviews :) )[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 :) Short chapter but I just had to write this one fast ;) . edit: Next update should happen around the end of October. I hope my characters don't die of old age before I finish this story :P and in the meantime, here's another drawing of Marshall (if you have read the previous story, I think you'll recognize the scene ;) ) \"https\":\"/\"\"/\"\"ibb\".co\"/gVepw9 (just remove the \"\") Blake's p.o.v. Owen Blake cursed between his teeth as he drove away from the cottage at full speed. He shouldn't have played with the KGB agent. He should have been more careful. For some reason, Kuryakin hadn't ingested the poison. He should have killed him quickly, as soon as he'd realized that. But hurting him had been so satisfying. He had enjoyed watching the big, tough Russian crawl on the floor. He had taken great pleasure in making him cry out in pain. He would have loved watching the life go out of those blue eyes. Too bad that unfortunate incident with the knife had compromised his plans. He enjoyed pain and had an exceptionally high pain tolerance, but he was also able to recognize a potentially mortal wound when he saw one, and although killing was one of his favorite activities, dying certainly wasn't. He knew he needed to hurry. He estimated his chance of survival at around 50%. The knife was still in place. He didn't have too far to drive. He had prepared for this scenario. He would have everything he needed where he was going. He would be able to patch himself up. At least dear Asher is dead. One out of three… He smiled with sadistic pleasure as he briefly imagined how agonizing the young agent's death must have been. Perfect. He knew that Napoleon Solo would be taken care of as well. Of course the other two would have to be dealt with. Later. Keeping only one hand on the wheel, he carefully raised the other to wipe his face. His clammy face... He froze mid-gesture. Frowning, he pressed two fingers over his carotid artery. Shit… He knew what was happening. He had seen it happen many times before, to his victims. Make that 30%, and dropping… Apparently the knife had done more damage than he had initially thought. He suddenly became aware of his rapid, shallow breathing. Dropping fast… He sighed in frustration, wishing he could drive faster. He ran through a quick mental checklist of all the things he would need to do to keep himself alive. Not enough time. He wasn't going to make it. Illya's p.o.v \"He has a pulse!\" Of course Gaby had shown no consideration for his consideration. She had briskly snatched her arm out of his grip and had rushed to Marshall's side. She was now leaning over him, checking for a pulse. Illya stepped closer and eyed the agent's body skeptically. His gaze lingered on Marshall's open, unmoving eyes. \"Not possible. You're probably feeling your own pulse through your thumb.\" She shot him a furious glance and shifted her position so that she could press her ear against the CIA agent's chest. \"Illya, I can hear his heart!\" What?... It was his turn now, to rush to the American's side. Frowning, he gently pushed Gaby out of the way and laid his hand on Marshall's chest. And sure enough, the man's heart was beating. He's alive… Illya felt his frown deepen. Marshall certainly did not look alive. The agent's body was completely still. Illya quickly waved a hand in front of the open eyes. No reaction. He looked at the man's chest, no sign of breathing. A perfectly convincing corpse. Still, the rapid pounding under his hand was telling a different story. Illya's gaze shifted to Marshall's stomach where a syringe was embedded, and realization suddenly hit him. \"He's paralyzed!\", Gaby exclaimed, taking the words out of his mouth. And he's suffocating… Illya ripped off the tape covering Marshall's mouth as quickly as he could. How long had it been? Two minutes? More? He pulled the rag out of the agent's mouth, keeping his hand on his chest to monitor his heartbeat. Too fast. He could tell Marshall's heart was struggling to compensate for the lack of oxygen. Respiratory arrest he could do something about, cardiac arrest would be much harder to fix. Illya tilted the agent's head back and, without wasting a second, pinched his nose shut, took a deep breath and started blowing air into his mouth. Just as he was about to administer a second rescue breath, a severe coughing fit prevented him from doing so. \"I'll do it!\" Gaby, who had been watching him helplessly, moved to take his place and started breathing for Marshall. As he watched the agent's chest rise and fall, Illya wondered what Blake had injected him with to induce complete paralysis. Curare? No. He would already be dead… Whatever it was, he needed to find a solution, fast. If Marshall's respiratory muscles were paralyzed, rescue breathing would keep him alive for a little while but wouldn't solve the problem. For the second time, Illya's eyes settled on the syringe protruding from Marshall's stomach and he noticed that the plunger had not been depressed. The syringe was still completely full. He hastily stepped around the bed and walked over to the nightstand. There he found another syringe. Empty. And two tiny, half-empty bottles, each containing a yellowish liquid. He read the labels but the inscriptions meant nothing to him. The only salient information was that the inscriptions were not the same on both bottles. Different substances, two syringes… Again, Illya looked at the full syringe sticking out of the agent's body and he felt his blood boil. Is this what I think it is?... Sadistic asshole!… He pulled the full syringe out and, after a second's hesitation, injected its contents into Marshall's deltoid muscle. He looked up and exchanged a glance with Gaby who was still giving the agent mouth-to-mouth. Illya knew he probably looked as nervous as she did. Maybe he had been wrong. Maybe he had just killed Marshall… well, hastened his death, to be more exact. Wait and see… \"Come on, Asher, breathe…\" He could hear Gaby whispering encouraging words in between two rescue breaths. He checked the American's pulse. Still going. A few more tense minutes followed, then… \"He's breathing… I think he's breathing on his own!\" Gaby took a step back to give Marshall some air but kept her hand on his forehead and started gently smoothing his hair back. Illya blew out a deep sigh as relief washed over him. How many times do I have to save your life?... Marshall still looked slightly more dead than alive but he was breathing-gasping on his own, his chest was rising and falling, his eyes were moving – and filling up with tears. Whatever the antidote was, it was fast-acting. Illya put a hand on Gaby's shoulder and she turned to look at him. \"How did you know?\" \"I was not sure. But he was dying anyway…\" Her relieved expression suddenly changed to one of concern. \"Do you think he'll have brain damage?\" Only one way to know… \"Marshall, do you know where you are?\" The CIA agent's eyes focused on him and for a few seconds he didn't answer, then… \"Kuryakin…\", he said thickly. \"Please tell me I didn't crap myself…\" \"I think his brain is fine.\" Marshall gave him a weak smile, then his expression changed and once again, Illya caught a glimpse of vulnerability, just like when he had watched the agent sleep a few hours earlier. \"I thought…I really thought no one was coming…\" Marshall paused, as if he were trying to figure out what to say next, then simply added \"Thanks.\" Illya nodded, slightly embarrassed. He liked Marshall but the man was just so...honest. Sometimes it was hard to believe that he was an excellent undercover agent. \"And thanks for giving me the kiss of life, Miss Teller!\", Marshall went on, as a cheeky smile slowly worked its way across his face. Illya saw Gaby blush violently and shoot a furtive glance in his direction. \"Let's get you out of those handcuffs…\", she mumbled, apparently eager to change the subject. She started searching the room for the key and Illya was about to help her when something caught his eye. Blake's backpack. Cowboy!... Blake was a killer, Blake had lied about everything…and Blake had probably lied about Solo still being alive, too. Illya opened the backpack and emptied its contents onto the floor. He switched on the listening device, it was still working. Hopefully the tracking device was still working too. Then one object caught his attention. Cowboy's watch. The leather wristband had apparently been cut off with a knife. Illya's heart sank. He had entrusted an extremely dangerous, sadistic killer with his partner's life and now Cowboy was probably dead. How could he have let Blake fool him so easily? He looked up to see Gaby silently staring at the watch, and his feeling of despair suddenly turned into rage. His finger started drumming against his leg, faster and faster…then he felt Gaby's hand in his. \"Illya…\" \"I'm going to rescue him.\" \"It's probably too late…\" \"I don't care!\" \"I know…I'm coming with you.\" He looked at her. Even with the huge bump on the side of her head and the red marks on her throat she was as pretty as ever, and determined. But he couldn't afford to lose another partner. \"No. You stay here with Marshall. And you call Waverly for backup, and medical help for you both. I have a radio in my room.\" \"Illya you're ill, you'll die if you go alone.\" \"I won't. And I'm bringing Cowboy back.\" Even if it's just his dead body…I'm bringing him back… At the same moment, torture room \"What did you do to him?!\" \"I admit I might have got a little carried away.\" \"Bloody hell! I told you not to kill him!\" \"He's not dead. Just resting. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I kept the other one alive for more than two weeks. One day of this is not going to kill him.\" \"…\" \"How did it go?\" \"They said they would \"look into it\".\" \"And are you satisfied with that answer?\" \"Not really. Hence my visit. Wake him up.\" \"No need, he's coming to.\" \"I need you to make him talk. I don't care what method you use, I need answers, now.\" \"I see. What happened to \"no harm will come to Carlyle\"?\" \"Well, if it turns out that we made a mistake, I'll let him go and offer him my most sincere apologies. I highly doubt that it will be the case, though.\" \"He's fully conscious now. I think we can continue. Would you like to have a go? I can show you where it will hurt him the most…\" \"That's not what I'm here for. Not everybody enjoys your sick games. Now, make him talk.\" \"You don't know what you're missing. Now let's see if we can get something more than just screams out of Mr. Carlyle.\" End of chapter 10. I hope you enjoyed this one. I just couldn't let poor Marshall die, could I? :) . Things are not looking good for Solo, though :s[Chapter 11] Chapter 11! Sorry about the delay. As always, I hope you'll enjoy this chapter :) Warning: there is a tiny bit of gore in this chapter. It's really really tiny but I know some people don't like it and I don't want anyone to be grossed out :) Illya's p.o.v, Illya was trying hard to concentrate on his driving and on the tracking device. The immobile dot on the tracking device. He really wasn't feeling well. His chest felt tight and it hurt, he felt constantly short of breath, his coughing had not improved and, even though he was trying to convince himself otherwise, he felt completely exhausted. The fight with Blake had taken a toll on him too. He knew perfectly well that he was not in a fit state to execute a rescue mission. Going alone was foolish bordering on suicidal. He didn't even have a gun. But what else could he do. If there was even the slightest chance that his partner was still alive, he had to do something. And he was about 80% sure that Cowboy would do the same for him. He was getting close. He would find a spot to hide the car soon. When he had tried to start the car earlier as he had been about to leave the cottage, they had discovered that Blake had taken the key and tampered with the ignition system. Good thing Gaby had been able to fix it. But it had taken time, and Illya had almost gone crazy as he took care of Marshall while he waited for the car to be fixed, painfully aware of every minute flying by. You'd better be alive, Cowboy… Torture room, Solo's p.o.v, \"Nap time is over, Mr. Carlyle.\" \"Just five more minutes, Mum…\", Napoleon mumbled as he opened his eyes to a narrow slit then gave the cult master a \"screw you, asshole\" smile. They were alone in the room once again. Cleary had left after a short while. Apparently, the leader of the organization wasn't a fan of torture. That's at least one thing we have in common… The cult master, on the contrary, really seemed to be enjoying himself and the fact that he had failed, so far, to extract information from his victim did not seem to discourage him. Napoleon had to hand it to him; the man was good at what he did. He knew exactly when to stop and let his victim rest. Napoleon had only briefly lost consciousness once and even though he was in considerable pain and it felt like his body couldn't take much more, he knew it could, and that thought made his heart race with fear. \"Ready to pick up where we left off?\" Napoleon sighed inwardly as he watched the cult master raise the cattle prod. Here we go again… He closed his eyes and braced himself for the wave of agony he knew was coming. It didn't come, though. He opened his eyes as he heard the sound of the door being opened. He couldn't see what was going on behind him so he studied the cult master's reaction. The man had a look of extreme annoyance and contempt on his face. Not Cleary, then… \"What!\", the cult master barked, setting the cattle prod down. Napoleon exhaled a long breath and allowed his muscles to relax. Phew…whoever you are, thanks for that… After a few seconds, a hesitant, submissive voice sounded from behind Napoleon who immediately identified the visitor. Davies. \"Sorry…sorry to bother you, Sir, really…but…well, Mr. Cleary sent me, he wants you to see something…\" The cult master gave an exasperated sigh and stepped past Napoleon, leaving his field of vision. \"See what? Doesn't he know I'm busy?\" \"Oh don't worry, Sir…it won't take long…in fact, I've got it right here with me…\" Something Cleary wants him to see, and he has it with him… Please tell me it's not… Napoleon's heart somersaulted as a deafening sound suddenly filled the room. That definitely did not sound like a stolen book full of coded information. Whether he should be relieved or even more worried, he didn't know yet. For a few seconds he could only hear an unpleasant ringing in his ears, then footsteps. One person. \"Hey! Carlyle, my mate!\" Davies suddenly appeared in his field of vision. He was carrying a shotgun. \"Or should I say Solo? Nap-Nap? Nappy? Anyway, how are you doing? Sorry if I startled you with this, it's extremely loud and the recoil is a bitch but the result is so satisfying.\" For a couple of seconds, Napoleon just stared at him with his mouth slightly open, completely dumbfounded. Then he spoke, slowly. \"I don't mean to alarm you, Davies…but your Devon accent is gone.\" \"Haha, rather convincing, uh? Well, when you've been posted here for as long as I have, you inevitably pick up the accent. Your impression wasn't bad either, by the way, but I'm too good at recognizing fellow Americans. Although I'll admit that having read your file helped too.\" \"I see...why did you let me infiltrate the organization if you knew who I was. Why didn't you kill me?\" \"Simple, I needed you as a diversion.\" \"So it was you who destroyed the information contained in the safe and triggered the alarm. You're part of the larger American organization.\" \"Correct, you're a clever guy, Napoleon.\", Davies replied, winking at him. \"Yeah, unfortunately, I had to do some cleaning up. That branch of our organization was diseased. You know how it is, sometimes the tree needs pruning to thrive.\" Davies paused and Napoleon saw the man's gaze travel up and down his body. \"Damn, you're buff!\", he said, poking him in the stomach. \"I'm jealous, how many times a week do you work out?\" \"What about your wife? I suppose she's a part of it, too?\" As Napoleon uttered these words, Davies burst out into sonorous laughter. \"I don't have a wife, Napoleon.\" \"No, of course you don't, silly me…\" \"Ah, don't sound so disappointed, I'm sure that if I did have a wife, she would have been glad to invite you over for Sunday roast.\" Davies paused for a second, then a smile slowly spread across his pudgy face. \"Want to see something that will cheer you up?\" Not really, no… As Davies disappeared behind him, Napoleon took a moment to contemplate just how screwed he was. Of course Davies was going to kill him, it was only a matter of time. The man had probably already killed Cleary and he supposed that most of the guards in the building were dead too. His eyes fell on the shotgun, which Davies had left on the floor, and he suddenly felt extremely vulnerable. Shackled as he was, with his arms outstretched above his head, he was the perfect target. Okay, just stay calm, keep him talking… He could hear Davies coming back, and some weird sound, as if something was being dragged across the floor. Davies reappeared in front of him and Napoleon was able to identify the source of the dragging sound. The man was holding the cult master's corpse. The shotgun blast had blown off half his face. Napoleon looked at the ruined, bloody, empty eye socket and shuddered. \"What do you think? I've always thought that red was the right color for him, it literally brings out his eyes. Well, one eye at least…\" Napoleon looked away, trying hard not to picture what his own face would look like if Davies decided to shoot him too. He really missed the slow-witted, awkward, submissive Davies. \"Hey, come on, Napoleon. It's just a joke. If you think I'm bad, you have no idea what your colleagues are up against. I might like to blow people's heads off and I do have a very dark sense of humor but I'm no Blake.\" What?... \"What?\" \"Yeah, Owen, now he's one twisted son of a bitch. The kind even our kind is afraid of. I wouldn't want to be in your partners' shoes, especially that young agent, Asher Marshall. I bet he regretted not dying on the sacrificial table, that would have been a much gentler way to go, believe me. Owen was really obsessed with Marshall\", Davies snorted. \"Almost got himself killed to keep his target alive, now that's what I call dedication. Good thing I was there to help.\" Napoleon remained silent but thoughts were racing through his mind as he tried to wrap his head around what Davies had just told him. CIA agent Owen Blake was an assassin. But how..? and Blake had taken Marshall. He had literally handed Marshall over to his executioner. The young agent was probably dead. Maybe Illya and Gaby were dead too... Davies's voice interrupted his thoughts. \"Don't beat yourself up, there was nothing you could have done. I have yet to see one of Owen's targets escape him. But let's change the subject, I can tell it's upsetting you.\", he added, picking up the cattle prod. Napoleon muscles automatically tensed up as Davies stepped closer. \"So that's what he used to torture you?\" Keep him talking… \"Among other things…\" Davies eyed the electrical burns on his chest and shook his head. \"Pathetic. Someone should have taught him how to use it properly. Want me to show you?\", he said as his hand reached for Napoleon's belt buckle. No… please no… Davies stared at him for a few seconds then burst out laughing again. \"I'm just messing with you, don't worry.\" Haha...hilarious... Davies checked his watch. \"Anyway I'll have to get going soon. It's not that I'm not enjoying our little chat but the building is packed full of explosives and I really don't want to be around when it collapses.\" Keep him talking or you're dead… \"Why are you using a timer? Why not just trigger the explosion once you're out?\" \"Well, that's what I would do if I worked alone but my employers are extremely cautious people and they want to make sure that, should something happen to me on my way out, the job would still be done. I have about forty minutes left but there's a handful of guards upstairs who are still alive and I might need to take care of them, plus I don't like running.\" \"Who are they, your employers?\" \"Ah, wouldn't you like to know. Nosy Napoleon. Sorry but I can't answer that question, even if you're about to die.\" Davies set the cattle prod down and picked up the shotgun. \"Well, goodbye Napoleon, it's been nice knowing you.\" Napoleon felt his already racing heart start to beat even faster. Two thoughts were playing over and over in his mind; He's going to shoot me , and the image of the dead cult master's ruined face. Then Davies's laugh sounded again. It was seriously starting to get on Napoleon's nerves. \"I bet you thought I was going to shoot you. No, I wouldn't do that to my \"mate\", I'm just going to leave you here and let the explosion do the rest.\" He clapped Napoleon on the back, making him cry out in pain, and disappeared behind him. Napoleon heard the footsteps recede and he was left alone in the room. Well…that could have gone worse…I suppose… He was still going to die, blown to bits or crushed under a collapsing building, and if what Davies had said about Blake was true, his partners were either dead or really had their hands full. That probably meant that no one was coming to rescue him. He tugged at the manacles as hard as he could but only managed to hurt his wrists. There really was no escape this time. Napoleon sighed heavily, the next forty minutes were not going to be pleasant. A few moments passed in silence, then… Footsteps?... At least two people this time. And heavy, labored breathing. Getting closer. Inside the room now. \"Ah, I'm glad you're still here, Napoleon!\" Davies… \"Davies, you're back, miss me already? Or did you forget something?\" \"No. Much better, I have a little surprise for you. Consider it a parting gift.\" As he uttered those words, Davies stepped into his field of vision, he had apparently discarded the shotgun and was holding a browning 9mm, the gun was aimed at another man's back, the man was Illya. Napoleon felt a tiny measure of relief as he saw that his partner was still alive, but he also knew that Davies had brought Illya here because he wanted to execute the Russian in front of him. \"I found him coughing up a lung in the corridor upstairs and just couldn't resist.\" Napoleon studied his partner worriedly. Illya really looked much worse than the last time he had seen him. He looked like he was about to collapse and his breathing seemed extremely labored. \"Having some trouble catching our breath, are we, Kuryakin?\" Davies winked at Napoleon. \"Owen was always good with poison. Speaking about Owen, if Kuryakin is here, I suppose it means that my dear colleague is dead. How tragic. And impressive!\" He laughed. \"Tell me, Kuryakin, did he at least manage to kill his precious Asher before he died? I sincerely hope he did. If not, well...I'll just have to take care of him myself.\" Illya remained silent, he was obviously making a conscious effort to remain standing. Davies sighed and kicked him behind the legs, making him fall to his knees. The Russian slowly raised his head and looked directly into Napoleon's eyes. What were you thinking coming here alone, Peril. And in your condition… \"Since we have a little time left before this place blows up, I figured we could have some fun together. What do you think, Napoleon?\" Davies stepped around Illya and, keeping the gun trained on him, he went to pick up the cattle prod. Then he positioned himself behind Illya with the gun in one hand and the prod in the other. \"Let's find out how tough Kuryakin really is!\" Before Napoleon could say anything, Davies pressed the tip of the cattle prod against his partner's back. He watched and winced in sympathy as Illya screamed and collapsed. Davies pulled back his arm and smiled as Illya tried and failed to get up on his hands and knees. He gently pushed the Russian with his foot to make him roll onto his back. Then he crouched down, looked up at Napoleon and grinned before he forcefully shoved the tip of the cattle prod into the middle of Illya's chest. Again Napoleon could only watch as his partner screamed and writhed in agony on the floor. He gritted his teeth and waited for Davies to stop. He didn't. The man was following Illya's convulsive movements to make sure that the electrodes remained firmly pressed against the thrashing Russian's chest. He wasn't going to stop... Stop…stop!... \"Stop!\" Napoleon felt his blood boil as Davies smiled at him and kept the prod against his partner's chest a little longer. Then he finally stopped torturing poor Illya who rolled onto his stomach, coughing, choking and wheezing. \"Oh my, you're right, mate, it's time to stop. I was enjoying myself so much that I forgot to check my watch. Good thing I still have some time left, I'm afraid it's time to say goodbye to Kuryakin though.\" Davies dropped the cattle prod and grabbed Illya by the hair, pulling his head up so that Napoleon could see his face, the Russian was barely conscious. Davies brought the gun up and pressed it against Illya's temple. \"Wait…\" Napoleon felt his gut twist, he knew that nothing he would say could save his partner. \"On the count of three…\" No… Before the man could start counting, though, something happened that neither Davies nor Napoleon had been expecting. Illya suddenly grabbed the cattle prod which was lying on the floor and shoved it into Davies's groin area. The man shrieked and fell down, firing a wild round in the process, missing Illya's head by a good three inches. Ouch, I guess that's what he meant by \"using it properly\"… Davies was down and whimpering but he was still holding the gun and was aiming it at his partner again. But Illya had anticipated the man's reaction and was already upon him. Another shot rang out and Napoleon saw Davies's body go slack. Panting, Illya dropped the gun and shakily got to his feet. \"Wow, Peril, remind me never to torture you with a cattle prod…\" \"How much time do we have?\" \"I don't know, twenty minutes, twenty five maybe…\", he paused as he noticed that Illya was grimacing and pressing one hand against his chest. \"Are you going to be okay, Peril?\" \"I'll live... What about you?\" \"Well, let's just say I'm awfully glad you're here.\" \"You're welcome, Cowboy. Where are the keys?\" \"See the dead body over there? Not the one you just killed, the other one, missing half his face. He probably has the keys. Nice plan, by the way, but extremely risky.\" \"What plan?\", Illya answered, looking dead serious. Napoleon stared at him for a few seconds then the Russian's lips curled up into a small smile. \"I see you're developing a sense of humor, Peril, is that another symptom of your \"illness\"? By the way, Gaby and Marshall are alive, right?\" Illya nodded and started searching the cult master's body. After a few seconds, he frowned. \"No keys. He doesn't even have pockets.\" \"Well, that's problematic, to say the least…what about Davies?\" Napoleon watched as Illya searched Davies's corpse, then the entire room. No keys. Perfect… \"Do you see some tools that you could use to cut the chains or pry the manacles open?\" \"I don't see anything, no.\" \"Care to look again?\" \"We don't have much time.\" \"In that case, just leave without me, Peril. Save yourself while there's still time. You almost died trying to save me a minute ago and I don't want it to happen again. Have a good life, marry Gaby…\" \"Cowboy, I…are you serious?\" \"No. Get me out of those manacles.\" Illya let out an exasperated groan and walked out of his field of vision. \"You're not leaving, Peril, are you? It was only a joke.\" \"Don't be stupid.\", came the Russian's irritated voice behind him. Then Napoleon heard a dragging sound. \"What are you doing?\" \"There's a table behind you I dragged it closer so that I could stand on it. It will make what I'm about to do easier.\" \"I see…what are you about to do, if you don't mind my asking?\" Napoleon couldn't exactly pinpoint what it was, but something about the Russian's answer was making him nervous. \"I'm going to dislocate your thumbs.\" You're going to do what?... \"Peril, no! Wait!...\" End of chapter 11. Uh-oh :) I hope you enjoyed the read :) And thanks for the reviews on chapter 10 :)[Chapter 12] Final chapter! Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to read my stuff! :) (First chapter of the sequel \"Dans la gueule du loup (into the lion's den)\" is out :) ) Torture room, Solo's p.o.v. \"Aaaaaaaah! STOP!\" Napoleon blew out a small sigh of relief as the crushing pressure on his palm disappeared. Then relief gave way to anger. \"What is wrong with you, Peril!\" \"Sorry…\", he heard the Russian mumble somberly. \"I'll try to do it faster…\" \"No no no no no, Illya wait…please… let's just take moment to think here.\" He could feel the Russian's hand inside his, still holding his thumb awkwardly. Thankfully nothing happened, he had his partner's attention. Phew… \"Look at my feet…\" Silence. Then Illya let go of his hand and he heard him laboriously climb off the table. Then more silence. Napoleon knew that his partner was looking down at the shackles around his ankles. \"Yeah…unless you're planning on sawing off my feet too, dislocating my thumbs is not going to do much good.\" Silence again. \"You're not considering it…are you?\" Illya finally stepped back into his field of vision and Napoleon chose that moment to wince exaggeratedly and flex his painful hand. \"Sorry.\", the Russian repeated. \"Hmm, I'm sure a small part of you enjoyed it. You do realize that you almost ruined my hands? My most precious tools…\" The second Napoleon uttered these words, realization hit him. He would have hit himself, too, had he not been shackled to the ceiling. The lock-picking tool… Illya had stopped listening to him and was scanning the room, still looking for something that could help him free his partner. \"Peril, there's a lock-picking tool inside my belt…\" The Russian nodded and grabbed Napoleon's belt buckle a little too vigorously. \"Wow, I'm warning you, Peril, I'm not an easy man…\" Despite the urgency of the situation, he couldn't help but smile as his partner rolled his eyes and huffed out an exasperated sigh. Illya rapidly retrieved the lock pick and crouched down to work on the shackles around Napoleon's ankles. \"Wait, my hands first. No offense but I'll work much quicker than you once they're free.\" Again, the Russian nodded and climbed onto the table. Napoleon suddenly noticed that his friend's breathing had gotten worse. After a couple of minutes of cursing in Russian, a sudden, sharp, metallic click made Napoleon wince. Then he heard his partner grumble. \"Typical American tool…\" \"Actually, it was made in Germany…and please tell me you didn't break it.\" He received no answer but after a few more seconds, the manacles finally clicked open, freeing his hands. And at that moment, as his arms dropped back down, Napoleon suddenly became aware of how much everything hurt, the lacerations and burns on his back and chest, his sore muscles. Everything. But he couldn't afford to worry about that yet, not if he wanted Illya and him to make it out alive. Illya's p.o.v. He watched as his partner crouched down, groaning with pain, and used the tool to pick the locks on the shackles. And, unsurprisingly, he was much faster than Illya. \"Once again, my superior ski…\" \"Let's go!\", he growled, shutting the American up. He grabbed Davies's gun and rushed to the door. Panting, he turned to check that his partner was following. Too slow. His gaze rapidly shifted from the American's face to a thin, bleeding cut across his chest and he felt his jaw clench. Of course, he had seen the lacerations and burns on Cowboy's body. And he had just experienced the pain of being tortured with electric shocks himself. He knew that moving was probably very painful for his partner. But they needed to hurry. He grabbed the American by the forearm, pulled him close and slipped one arm around his back. That way Cowboy would have no choice but to match his pace. Trying his best to ignore his partner's gasps of pain, he started running. He didn't know how many explosive charges Davies had planted, or how big the explosion would be, but he wanted to use the precious time they had left to get as far away from the building as possible. He wasn't exactly feeling peachy himself. His breathing sounded like an angry rattlesnake was stuck in his lungs, the burning sensation in his chest was getting more and more intense as he ran and he felt drained. He hadn't even been able to dislocate Cowboy's thumb in one clean move. Which had turned out to be a good thing. How had he not noticed the shackles around his friend's ankles? He clearly hadn't been thinking straight. He sighed and tried to pick up the pace but running while supporting his partner was proving harder than he had thought. Cowboy had noticed too. \"It's okay, Peril, I can manage alone.\" \"No…\" \"I insist. Your arm keeps rubbing against my back and it's extremely unpleasant.\" Reluctant but also grateful, Illya let go of his partner and they hurried up the flight of stairs that would take them to the ground floor level. Cowboy was right, he seemed to have regained some energy and was doing fine without support. He, on the other hand, could feel himself getting weaker and weaker. To make things worse, a particularly violent coughing fit forced him to stop and sink to his knees. \"Are you okay, Peril?\" Is this a real question?... Illya could feel a mixture of spit and mucus inside his cupped hands and for a second he was tempted to wipe it off on the American's leg. Then he realized that what he had thought was spit and mucus was actually blood. Thick, frank, bright red blood. That definitely wasn't pneumonia. For the first time he wondered if the poison Blake had given him had caused some irreparable damage to his body. \"Wow…Illya, you're dying…\" Thank you, Cowboy, I hadn't noticed… \"We need to hurry…\" Without bothering to wipe the blood off his hands, he pushed himself to his feet and they started running again. Thankfully, getting from the torture room to the exit didn't take them too long and the only guards they encountered were the dead bodies left behind by Davies. They were almost out when Solo abruptly stopped. Illya glanced at his partner and something about his expression told him that he was not going to like what the American was about to say. \"I'll be right back, I've forgotten something. Just go, I'll catch up with you.\" Nice try but you're not going anywhere, stupid American… He grabbed his partner by the wrist and roughly pulled him toward the exit, well at least he made a valiant attempt at it. Solo easily escaped his grip and immediately started sprinting in the opposite direction. \"Cowboy! Wait!\" Illya felt his hands ball into fists and had to make an effort not to yell. The man he had just risked his life to rescue was running back into a building that was about to blow up. A string of Russian expletives escaped his lips. He had no way of knowing exactly how much time they had left before the place blew up. He knew he should really be getting out of there. It wasn't his fault if Cowboy had a death wish. Again, he cursed under his breath. Of course he wasn't leaving without Solo, not yet. He would wait a few more minutes. After a few more minutes, and then a few more, his partner finally reappeared. \"What are you still doing here, Peril?! I told you to get out!\" He could have punched the American in the face. He wanted to punch the American in the face. But there was no time. He would save the punch for later. Boosted by a sudden rush of adrenaline, they ran out of the building full speed and only stopped once they had put what seemed like a reasonable distance between them and the future site of the explosion. For a couple of minutes nothing happened, then they heard a series of deafening booms and felt the ground shake under their feet. \"Phew…,\" Solo said, grimacing as he carefully sat down on the wet grass. \"Good thing we made it out in time, right, Peril?\" Illya, who had just recovered from another formidable coughing fit, hesitated between destroying his partner and simply nodding. He finally chose the option that required less effort on his part. Then he noticed that Cowboy was holding something in his hand. Some sort of notebook. So this is what we almost died for?... It was probably something important. He should probably have been asking about it. He would do it later, right after the punch in the face. He looked down at the smeared blood on his hands. If he lived to see \"later\". Pushing the thought aside, he took a moment to study his partner. Shirtless, sweating, covered in bleeding cuts, bruises and burns, and obviously in pain. The American looked almost as bad as Illya felt. But at least he was alive. His friend was alive. They were all alive. For now… Two days later, Unknown location, \"Your idea was suprisingly good. Using the agents to shut down the Devon branch. An excellent way to keep both the MI6 and the CIA busy. Really, I salute your creativity. Very entertaining. Of course they made it out alive but that's only a minor inconvenience.\" \"You're not worried, Sir?\" \"Why should I be? All the information contained in Cleary's safe was destroyed, the building itself was destroyed. The potentially problematic members of the Devon branch are being dealt with as we speak. The MI6 and the CIA are basically back to square one. There is nothing to be worried about. The agents are insignificant, harmless. But they are entertaining. Now, as soon as they stop being entertaining, they'll die. It's as simple as that.\" \"I see.\" \"I suppose you're still bitter about losing your man. I'm truly sorry he didn't make it. Replacing him won't be easy.\" \"Blake? Oh I'm not too worried about Blake, Sir.\" \"But he died.\" \"He'll bounce back.\" \"Will he, now? Interesting.\" \"Sorry about your man, though.\" \"Yes, poor Davies, such a pity. At least he served his purpose. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?\" \"No, Sir.\" \"So, did I manage to assuage your concerns?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"Good. Like I once told our dearly departed friend Cleary, worrying too much is not healthy.\" \"…\" Hospital room, Gaby's p.o.v. Gaby slipped into the room as quietly as possible and closed the door behind her. She was late to the meeting because she had stopped en route to buy a box of chocolates for her partners. Waverly greeted her warmly, Sanders greeted her less warmly, his incriminating gaze immediately settling on the poor box of chocolates. She set it down on a table and took a few steps to position herself next to Illya. She was glad to see that the Russian was out of bed and had traded his hospital gown for normal clothes. Illya had been in pretty bad shape when Napoleon, Asher and him had been taken to the hospital, two days earlier. Fortunately, after analyzing the \"medicine\" Blake had given to Illya, the doctors had been able to give him something to counteract the effects of the poison. They wanted to keep him in a little longer for observation but he already looked like he was feeling much better and his breathing no longer sounded like a sheet of paper being ripped. Napoleon and Asher had been put in the same room, they were both still confined to their hospital beds but they wouldn't stay in the hospital too long either. Their wounds had been treated and bandaged and they were well on the way to complete recovery. The doctors just wanted to make sure that neither the prolonged electric torture they had both been submitted to, nor the toxin Asher had been injected with would have any long lasting negative effects. \"So, as I was saying…\", Sanders said, making Gaby's late entrance seem even more disrupting. \"Our experts have already started working on decoding the contents of the notebook Solo stole. We're hoping that it will yield some information that might get us closer to discovering who is pulling the strings.\" \"You're welcome, Sir.\" \"I'll admit, Solo, that stealing is probably the only thing you're good at.\" \"That hurts, Sir.\" Sanders ignored that last comment and went on. \"By the way, there is one question I've been meaning to ask you since you gave us your account, Solo…why didn't you stab Marshall?\" Gaby shot Asher a sideways glance. The agent's mouth was slightly open, his lips rounded, as if he was about to say \"what?\" but couldn't quite get the word out. \"I beg your pardon, Sir?..\" \"When you were trying to infiltrate the organization and the only way to get in was to sacrifice Marshall, why didn't you just stab him? It would have saved you a lot of time and trouble.\" \"I…it wouldn't have made any difference, they knew who I was from the start…\" \"Yes, but you didn't know it yet at that point, did you.\" \"We were trying to rescue Marshall, stabbing him in the chest seemed counterproductive at the time.\" \"Your primary objective was to gather information about the organization. Sometimes one needs to grow a spine, Solo, that includes knowing when to take the initiative and accept to make some necessary sacrifices.\" \"No offense, Sir, but it sounds like you wanted me to stab him…\" \"Don't let him fool you, Marshall.\", Waverly cut in, winking at Asher. \"I could swear I heard some emotion in his voice when Blake confirmed that you were dead.\" \"Consider yourself lucky. He certainly wouldn't shed a tear over my death.\" \"On the contrary, Solo. Tears of joy.\" \"What about Owen Blake?\", Waverly suddenly asked. His question had the desired effect, the bickering ceased instantly. \"An investigation is being conducted.\", Sanders answered evasively. \"And?\" \"And nothing, Solo. As of yet, we have found absolutely nothing about Blake that could have led us to suspect him.\" A moment passed in silence. Gaby exchanged a glance with Illya, then with Napoleon, then with Asher. She saw a shadow pass over the CIA agent's hazel eyes. She could tell that the question she was asking herself was on everybody else's mind too. How do we know there aren't others like Owen Blake?... Waverly was no longer smiling and looked pensive. Sanders had apparently said everything he wanted to say and it was clear from his body language that he was impatient to leave the room. And sure enough, a few minutes later, he got up to leave, soon followed by Waverly who had put his trademark smile back on to bid them goodbye. Gaby finally sat down on Napoleon's bed. The heavy atmosphere had followed Waverly and Sanders out of the room and she could tell that everyone felt a little more relaxed. \"Well…sorry Marshall but you heard Sanders, next time I'm forced to perform a human sacrifice and you're the victim, I will stab you.\" She saw Asher grimace comically and place a protective hand over the bandage below his sternum. \"Hopefully there won't be a next time…\" \"Ah don't worry, Peril will always be there to save you with mouth-to-mouth, won't he, Gaby?\" Gaby shot Illya a sheepish glance. Her partner looked part embarrassed part furious. \"He couldn't breathe… I did what I had to do.\" \"Of course you did, Peril, but did you try dislocating his thumbs first?\" Illya's face took on an angry red hue and he opened his mouth as if to say something then closed it and simply glared at the entire universe, just like he did every time he wanted to kill with words but was lacking a cutting retort. Gaby placed a gentle hand on his arm to appease him then shot Napoleon a scolding glare. \"I think Illya deserves a \"thank you\", none of us would be here if it wasn't for him.\" \"Of course, thank you, Peril.\", Napoleon quipped, looking smug as ever. Gaby studied Illya's face as he joined in the banter again. He looked tired, which wasn't surprising after what he had been through…but there was something else, too. She suspected he was still blaming himself for failing to kill Blake. She shivered as she involuntarily pictured the assassin's face in her mind. At least, even if the man hadn't died from his injury, after what Illya had done to him, he certainly wasn't going to hurt anyone anytime soon. About two months later, Asher's p.o.v. Asher closed the door behind him, put on his jacket and hurried – almost jogged – along the corridor. Running was a pleasure for him. He had missed it when he had been forced to lie in a hospital bed while he was recovering from his leg injury. His leg was almost back to normal now, the pain from his gunshot wound was barely noticeable at all. His most recent stay in the hospital had been much shorter, thankfully. His various cuts and bruises had healed nicely and he was in excellent shape. He felt ready to take on the new mission he had just been assigned to. He had just come out of a meeting with his handler and had been thrilled to learn that he would be working with Alexander Waverly's team again. Well, actually it was the first time he would officially be working with them. Working with a team would be very different from what he was used to but he didn't mind, he already knew he could trust all three of them. Solo, Gaby, and Kuryakin, who had already saved his life a few times. He waved at a few colleagues as he passed them. Most of them would be leaving soon too, it was getting late. Asher knew he needed to hurry. He wouldn't have much time to pack before leaving for the airport. He passed the last security check and walked through the exit gate. It was already dark out. The CIA building was located in the middle of a deserted area with only a few other disaffected buildings around and it was a long walk – or run – to where he usually parked his car. He loosened his tie, slipped it off and put it in his pocket. Then he started running, faster this time. It felt good. He felt alive. As he got closer to where he had parked his car, he stopped for a minute to catch his breath. He ran his hand through his sweaty light brown hair and undid the first two buttons of his shirt as he waited for his breathing and heart rate to settle. He was about to resume his jogging when something caught his eye. A tiny, glowing, red dot had just appeared on the ground in front of him. It looked like a gun laser sight. Weird. He frowned, took a step forward…and heard a sharp crack. Dust and bits of stone flew up as the bullet hit the ground close to his feet. What the hell?!… Completely frozen in place, Asher waited for his heart to start beating again. Sniper?... The shot had been loud, but far from deafening. The weapon was definitely fitted with a sound suppressor. He looked up at a disaffected building in the distance. It was too dark, too far away. He would never be able to spot the shooter. But the shooter had definitely spotted him. And he wanted to make sure Asher knew. The dot moved up, slowly. Up his leg. Up his stomach. Asher's gaze followed the dot and a quiet \"shit!\" escaped his lips as it stopped right over his heart. His first, instinctive – stupid – reaction was to flinch and cover his chest with both hands in a protective gesture. Then he quickly scanned his surroundings. No cover… He could see his car in the distance. He wished he hadn't parked so far from the high security area. He wished he hadn't parked so far from where he was standing right now. He knew there was no way he would be able to reach the car without taking a bullet. He knew he was going to try anyway. His eyes fixed on the red dot, he took a small, tentative step to the right. Another sharp crack, another heart attack. A second projectile had come close to hitting his foot. Debris had flown up again, hitting him in the leg this time. It hurt a little. Almost immediately, the dot was back on his chest. Of course he knew that the laser sight was not really used for aiming. Laser sights were mostly used in close quarter combat. At that distance, the shooter was probably using a scope for greater accuracy and comfort. The glowing dot on his chest was just part of a sick game, it was the shooter's way of telling him \"I have you pinned down, the next bullet is going to rip through your heart and I want you to see it coming.\" The very fact that he was aiming for Asher's heart also suggested that the shooter was playing with his target. A headshot would be just as efficient, if not more, than a shot to the chest but, whoever the shooter was, he clearly wanted Asher to see exactly where the bullet was going to hit him. He wanted him to be able to visualize his death. Shit…I can't die here…not now, not like this… Asher had been desperately clinging to the hope that someone would hear the shots and come to his rescue, but the sound suppressor was doing its job. The gun had already been fired twice and he knew no one was coming. He realized that he still had his hands pressed over his heart like a pathetic, useless shield. He glanced at the impact site in the ground next to his foot and the pounding under his hands grew in intensity. In addition to boring a nice hole into his chest, the bullet would probably rip off a finger or two. He let out a long, shaky breath. If he was going to die, at least he wanted to keep his fingers intact. Asher Marshall addressed a silent goodbye to the people he cared about and let his hands drop back down to his sides...

Please enjoy, and read/review :) ….. \"Пожалуйста! (Please!)\" Begged Subject 20, \"Пожалуйста, не делайте этого! (Please do not do this!)\" The individual struggled against the restraints tying them to the medical bed. As a surgery light was shone over them, a suited man appeared at their side. \"Я не знаю, почему вы расстроены . Вы помогают укрепить КГБ и, следовательно , Россия (I do not know why you're upset . You are helping to strengthen the KGB and, consequently, Russia)\" The young individual continued to sob and struggle, completely ignoring their superior. The suited man simply stared at him….no pity and no guilt for what he was about to do. He waved the doctor over, \"Получить с ним ... дайте мне знать , когда это сделано (Get on with it….let me know when it's done)\" He then strode out of the room, leaving the young individual screaming behind him. \"НЕТ! Пожалуйста! (NO! Please!)\" As the doctor strode closer, gas mask in hand, the individual's struggles intensified…even as the mask was placed over his face. The doctor felt no guilt at what he was going to do. \"Обратный отсчет от десяти ... десять ... девять ... восьми- (Count down from ten….ten….nine…eight-)\" Before even finishing the number eight, the young individual's eyes slipped shut and his sobs quietened off. Once sure that they were asleep, the doctor got to work. Several hours later, he was pulling the last stitch shut and waving at the viewing window, gesturing to his superior that he could come in. Once the suited man entered, the doctor beamed. \"Операция была Сукчес . За девять месяцев , вы будете иметь результаты (The operation was a success. In nine months, you will have your soldier.)\" The man nodded, pleased with the results. He then removed a revolver from his pocket and shot the doctor in the head. Upon hearing the bang, men stormed in….only to salute the superior agent. \"Приберёмся… (Clean this up….)\" he ordered, \"…И принять пациента к своей новой комнате . Эксперимент начинается сейчас (…And take the patient to their new room. The experiment starts now.)\" ….. The patient slowly blinked, their eyes quickly adjusting to the bright lights in the room. They tried to get up, only to fall back in pain, their hands brushing over fresh stitches on their stomach. \"Нет… (No…).\" They whispered in disbelief, staring down at the stitches, \"…Пожалуйста, нет! (Please no!)\" They glanced around the room from their position on the bed. There was a TV opposite which was next to a bookcase. A couch was near another wall, which contained two doors. Each probably leading to either a kitchen or a bathroom. They could see speakers in the corners of their room, and if they truly focused, they could see cameras near the bed and each doorway. Suddenly, the speakers crackled and a familiar voice came through. \"Я надеюсь, что вам удобно . Это будет вашим домом в течение следующих девяти месяцев .

(What have I ever done to deserve this?)\" \"...Вы были там (…You were there)\" With another crackle, the speakers went silent as the individual buried their head in their hands.[Chapter 2] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review J ….. The early morning sunlight shone through the blinds of Napoleon's room, lighting up the walls with a red hue. Blearily, Napoleon opened his eyes, blinking in an attempt to wake himself up. Glancing at the alarm, he cursed silently at his body alarm clock...it was only 6:00am. Feeling a familiar pressure on his chest, Napoleon ran his fingers through the blonde hair of his partner. \"Is too early…\" grunted Illya, softly batting at the fingers, \"…go back to sleep Cowboy.\" Napoleon chuckled, \"Are you sure you wouldn't to have a little fun before going to work…\" his other hand began to work its way down the Russian's back, \"…I can think of a good way to pass the time.\" \"You are incorrigible…\" Gently holding Illya's wrist to the pillow, Napoleon twisted until he was on top of his partner, grinning down at the un-impressed scowl on Illya's face. \"That's why you love me…\" he chuckled. \"Do I?\" Humming, Napoleon lowered himself down in order to kiss his partner. However, as soon as their lips touched, his mobile began to ring. \"Now?\" groaned Napoleon, \"It rings now?!\" Illya shook his head as Napoleon fell sideways onto the mattress dramatically, reaching over to grab the phone. Napoleon quickly checked the screen before answering, \"Agent Solo speaking.\" /Aah Mister Solo... came the familiar voice of Alexander Waverly, /…we have a bit of a situation down here. We'll need you and Mister Kuryakin to come in immediately. \"Of course Sir, we'll be there as soon as possible.\" Hanging up, Napoleon groaned and sat up on the bed. \"There had better be a World War about to break out if we have to come in at this time.\" \"Would Mister Waverly not have been more panicked?\" \"He's British Peril, if I'd heard him refuse a cup of tea, then I'd be worried.\" Quickly, the pair got dressed and made their way to UNCLE headquarters. Upon arriving, they were immediately led to Waverly's office, where Gaby stood waiting for them outside. \"Prepare yourself boys…\" she sighed, \"….this is a bad one.\" Napoleon and Illya exchanged concerned glances with one another before entering the office. As soon as they did, Napoleon tensed up. Sitting opposite Waverly, was his old handler Sanders. The CIA had reluctantly handed Solo over to Uncle, but not without a fight….and rumours were that Sanders was not happy with this. Seeing his lover tense up, Illya stepped slightly in front of him (which Napoleon rolled his eyes at). \"What is reason for this?\" grunted the Russian angrily. Waverly waved his hand in a silent gesture for Illya to stand down. \"We're all friends here Mister Kuryakin. Please…sit down. Mister Sanders has something rather interesting to tell us.\" Keeping their eyes on Sanders, Illya and Napoleon took a seat next to each as Gaby perched on the edge of Waverly's desk. Smirking slightly, Sanders pushed a CIA file towards the pair, \"Ten years ago, the KGB set up an initiative…they wanted to create the perfect spy…or weapon, however you want to see it. This experiment would be done using the genetic samples of two agents…one from the KGB and one from the CIA.\" He sighed, \"We were asked to provide a sperm sample…however, the CIA had very little hope in the project and decided to provide the sperm sample of a new recruit, one who we didn't hold out much hope for. As we predicted, the experiment didn't work for a long time…until around 6 years ago, when a KGB agent was successfully impregnated with the two samples and gave birth five years ago.\" Napoleon raised an eyebrow and smirked at Sanders, \"And of course, the CIA suddenly became interested again.\" \"Yes…the CIA and the KGB worked together in order to train the child. The deal between us, was that whilst it would live and train in Russia, the CIA would always be made privy to what was happening and have access to it.\" \"It?\" interrupted Illya, who had been getting tenser and tenser with every word, \"It is a child, not a gun!\" Sanders shrugged, \"Fine….he. However, a few weeks ago we found that the KGB were planning to break the deal. It-I beg your pardon, the child is being moved to a more secure location without informing the CIA.\" \"So gentlemen…\" began Waverly, \"….we will need one of you to infiltrate a KGB safe house. The child will only be there for a maximum of three hours, and the CIA have hired us to get him out.\" Napoleon nodded, \"That sounds acceptable. But why only one of us?\" \"Two would attract too much attention…Mister Solo, Mister Sanders has requested you for this mission.\" \"Not to be blunt, but why? Surely Peril here would have an easier time of sneaking into a KGB safe house to…acquire a Russian child?\" Sanders sighed, \"I'm not proud of this, but you have to remember that the CIA didn't believe that it would work…\" Narrowing his eyes in suspicion, Solo glared at his ex-handler. \"Why me?\" \"The genetic samples that the CIA gave to the KGB….were yours Solo.\" Sanders continued to talk, but all Solo could hear was a rushing noise as everything around him went silent…his sperm…his child. He held up a hand to stop Sanders in in tracks, \"You mean to tell me….\" He hissed, \"….that I have a son, who has been trained by the KGB for five years?!\" \"Well technically it was more like four years of training…but essentially yes.\" \"H-how? Why?!\" \"You had recently signed yourself over to the service of the CIA. We didn't have much hope for you and thanks to your womanizing ways, we managed to obtain the samples easily.\" Napoleon shook his head in denial, \"A-and the other donor?\" \"That was kept confidential by the KGB, just as they were unaware of who provided our sample.\" \"You make it sound like I gave it willingly!\" \"You did… to the woman anyway.\" Before Napoleon could leap up out of his chair, he felt a gentle but strong hand on his shoulder, holding him back. Twisting his head around, Napoleon felt his heart practically drop at the devastated look in Illya's eyes…despite his face remaining neutral. Letting Illya calm Napoleon down, Waverly took charge of the conversation once again. \"So you believe that, because of Napoleon's familial connection to the child, it'll be easier for him to remove the child from the safe house…What is his name anyway?\" Sanders shrugged, \"We've only ever known him as Project Principium.\" \"Great….\" Napoleon groaned, \"…I'm sure I can find a nickname with that! How about PP?\" \"The sarcasm is unnecessary Solo…\" sneered Sanders, pulling another file out of his briefcase, \"…you'll be happy to know, the KGB would monitor the visits between the child and his….mother. Apparently, this individual would call him Lyov.\" \"Lyov?\" \"It is another form of name Leo….\" Answered Illya, \"…or so I believe.\" Smiling at Illya in a silent thanks, Napoleon turned back to Sanders. \"Fine…saying I do take on this mission, what's the plan?\" Before Sanders could answer, Waverly butted in. \"Ah, I'm glad you asked Mister Solo. Miss Teller here has all the details.\" Gaby, who had been glancing between Sanders and Napoleon, gracefully pushed herself off the desk and handed Solo a file. \"Usually, the convoy consists of over ten, heavily armed guards. However, once they get to the safe house, a small group will move on ahead to the next, highly secure, safe-house in order to make sure there are no obstacles in the way….meaning that there will only be three armed guards in charge of protecting Pro-Lyov for three hours in the safe house.\" \"Should be easy to manage…\" sighed Napoleon, \"….when are they estimated to be at the safe house?\" \"In two days' time.\" \"Great….plenty of time to plan.\" \"You've done more in less time.\" There was silence as Napoleon stared down at the file, until he shook his head and glanced up at Sanders. \"What about the boy's mother?\" \"Who cares….\" Sneered Sanders, \"…they were only allowed to interact a couple of times a month. Chances are, the kid doesn't even know them!\" \"It's not a chance I'm willing to take!\" yelled Napoleon, slamming his fist down on Waverley's desk, \"I can't kidnap that kid knowing that his mother could be missing him!\" \"Mister Solo…\" interrupted Waverly, \"…I'm afraid we don't have much of a choice.\" There was a tense silence for a few moments, before Napoleon turned away in disgust. \"Fine…I'll take the job.\" He glanced back at Sanders, \"But only on one condition.\" \"You think you have the power to negotiate here?\" Waverly frowned at this, \"He is the one taking on the mission. I don't see the CIA leaping to Lyov's defence.\" \"Precisely!\" argued Napoleon, \"The CIA don't have his best interests at heart…which is why I don't think I should hand my son over to them.\" Sanders leapt up out of his seat, almost backing Napoleon into the wall (and he would have if Illya hadn't been standing there). \"We brought this case to you Solo! You wouldn't even have known without us, you would have gone on taming the Russian and blissfully ignoring any responsibilities!\" \"Don't speak about Illya like that!\" \"ENOUGH!\" ordered Gaby, silencing everyone (including Waverly), \"The CIA brought the case to us, and now the Head of UNCLE should make the decision of what to do…\" Everyone turned to stare at Waverly, who looked slightly flustered, \"Well, I rather think it depends on the situation. If Lyov is beyond redemption then he should go with the CIA, however…\" he held up a hand, stopping Sanders (who was smiling smugly) in his tracks, \"…if there are signs of the child acting as children of that age should, then Mister Solo should be given a chance to raise his son. Is everyone in agreement?\" Napoleon was quick to agree, however it was obvious that Sanders was still not pleased with the decision. Sensing that he was outnumbered, Sanders agreed as well. Seemingly oblivious to the tension in the room, Waverly clapped his hands together and grinned. \"Excellent! Mister Solo, I suggest you get everything you need. UNCLE can get you into Russia and near the safe-house, but from there on out, you'll have to make the journey back yourself.\" \"Yes Sir.\" With one last glare at Sanders, Napoleon left, closely followed by Illya. The pair travelled back to their apartment in silence, with Napoleon storming into the bedroom as soon as they arrived. \"I can't believe this. How could they keep this from me?!\" There was only silence from Illya, but Napoleon carried on regardless. \"And don't even get me started on the KGB! Treating my son like he was nothing but a science experiment! A weapon to be trained for the good of Russia! How did you ever work for them?!\" He span around in anger….but felt it drain away when he saw the devastated look in his lover's eyes. \"I-I'm sorry, I-\" \"This will change everything?\" Napoleon frowned at the question, \"Change?\" Gesturing between the two of them, Illya smiled sadly. \"Us. The child will change everything, nyet?\" \"No, no, no!\" gasped Napoleon rushing forwards, \"I-I know we haven't discussed children….hell, we haven't even discussed marriage, but I know that I won't give you up to raise my son. For all we know, his mother will be there and she can raise him and I'll have visitation rights or something!\" \"And if mother is not there….or someone not expected?\" \"T-then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it…but this will change nothing, I swear!\" Illya simply shrugged and backed out of the room, \"I hope so Cowboy….you had better pack. You have work to do.\" Before Napoleon could say anything, Illya left him to it. A couple of minutes later, the front door to the apartment opened and closed. \"Great…\" muttered Napoleon, \"….I've gained one son and lost a lover all in one day. Now all I need is for the stock market to crash and my favourite suit to tear.\"[Chapter 3] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review :-) ….. Napoleon groaned as an icy blast of wind seemed to penetrate all of his layers. \"How do these people stand this…\" he muttered, creeping up to the boundaries of the safe-house, \"…no wonder Illya's hands are-\" He stopped and sighed….he and Illya still hadn't reconciled since their discussion a couple of days ago. Not even on the plane to the Russian borders. ….Flashback… \"Now remember Mister Solo….\" Began Waverly, \"….once you get Lyov, you're on your own. We'll be waiting for you in another UNCLE safe-house near the Russian border. It's a pretty long journey from the KGB house, but the coordinates will be sent to your phone in code. I'm sure you'll be able to manage.\" Napoleon raised an eyebrow, \"Clearly you've never tried travelling with a five year old.\" \"Have you?\" \"Well….no. But I've heard it's torture.\" \"You should try dinnertime with baby…\" grunted Illya from across the aisle. At the surprised looks from the rest of his team, he shrugged, \"It was for undercover role.\" Napoleon nodded, trying not to make it seem as though he was uncomfortable. The atmosphere between the two was still quite tense. \"Well…\" he sighed, \"…at least I skipped that ordeal.\" The plane soon began to descent as it landed on an abandoned runway. As it was landing, Napoleon grabbed his rucksack and made sure all of his extremities were covered, \"Wish me luck…\" he grinned, trying not to sigh when Illya simply nodded at him. Taking a deep breath, Napoleon leapt out of the plane door as the wheels touched the tar-mac, landing in a snow-drift with a groan. ….End Flashback….. From his position, Napoleon could clearly see two guards patrolling the edge of the property. By his calculations, they had been there for an hour already, so Napoleon only had two hours to take them out and get a suitable distance away with his son. \"I bet I can do it in less than fifteen minutes…\" he whispered, twisting his head to speak to Illya….only to remember that the Russian wasn't there. \"….Oh yeah….Solo mission….for Solo.\" He crept into some nearby bushes, before using a specially designed watch, with knockout darts, to take out the two patrolling guards. Checking that they were unconscious, Napoleon then crept in through the front door, diving behind a sofa as the third guard entered the living room. \"Вы будете получать пищу, когда мы перейдем к следующему безопасного дома отродье! (You will receive food, when we move to the next safe house brat!)\" Yelled the guard angrily. As the guard glanced out of the window, probably searching for his two colleagues, Napoleon crept up behind him and pulled him into a chokehold, keeping the pressure steady until the man fell unconscious. Once sure that the man was out for the count, Napoleon crept in the direction of the room he had seen the guard coming out of. Upon pushing the door open, he cried out in pain when something hit him in the shoulder. \"AH! What the hell?!\" he yelped, his eyes scanning the bare room. Suddenly on the side of the bed, which had a threadbare sheet and thin mattress, he saw a small head peak over the top. This prompted Napoleon to kneel on the floor in an attempt to make himself seem smaller. \"Привет (Hi)…\" he whispered, choosing to speak in Russian, \"…Не бойся , я не причиню тебе вреда (Do not worry, I will not hurt you.)\" He remained as still as he could, barely breathing as a small boy tiptoed around the bed. The boy seemed very small for five years old, with blonde (slightly curly) hair and baby blue eyes. \"Huh…\" mused Napoleon, switching to English, \"…I guess your Mama was blonde?\" The child sat on the floor, by the end of the bed, and tilted his head in curiosity. Happy that the boy hadn't moved away, Napoleon shuffled a little closer and smiled at him. \"Является ли ваше имя Lyov? (Is your name Lyov?)\" Clearly, this was the right thing to say in order to gain the child's trust, because a beam appeared on his face and he crawled closer, nodding eagerly. Napoleon chuckled as Lyov sat right in front of him, \"Возможно, ваша мать вас так называть? (Did your Mother call you that?)\" Another nod, so Napoleon reached into his bag and pulled out a Superman figure in order to give to Lyov. \"Это для вас ... Я не знаю, если ваша мать упоминается что-нибудь обо мне , но я твой отец (This is for you…I do not know if your Mother mentioned something about me, but I am your Father.)\" He winced slightly at the obvious Star Wars reference, frowning as Lyov passed the figure from hand to hand. \"Вы когда-нибудь имели игрушку раньше? (Have you ever had a toy before?)\" He asked. Lyov shook his head, eyes widened when he was able to move the arms and legs of the figure. Napoleon glanced around the room and nodded, muttering to himself in English. \"Yeah…I can tell.\" Slowly, he pushed himself off of the floor and began to wander around the room. He opened up a bag to find plain grey t-shirts, and black trousers all neatly folded inside. \"Doesn't this kid have anything with a bit a colour?!\" he muttered to himself. The bag was light, and therefore, Napoleon was easily able to lift it onto his shoulder. Spinning around, he grinned at the sight of Lyov making the figure 'fly' in the air. \"Где ваше пальто Lyov? (Where is your coat Lyov?)\" He asked, watching as Lyov leapt to his feet and ran into the living area. Napoleon was quick to follow, only to yelp in surprise when he saw his son shimmying up a coat rack in order to grab a small parka, a grey woollen hat and scarf. \"Get down!\" Napoleon yelled, forgetting to speak in Russian, \"You'll hurt yourself!\" Lyov startled in surprise, his grip slipping slightly on the coat rack, however he manged not to fall off. Instead he slide down and ducked his head in shame and quickly put the warmer clothing on, glancing up every so often at Napoleon and clutching the clothes closer. This caused Napoleon to sigh, \"Я не собираюсь причинять тебе боль (I'm not going to hurt you).\" Clearly, Lyov didn't quite believe him, however the child went to grab his new toy anyway and shuffled to Napoleon. Gently (although Lyov still flinched), Napoleon took a hold of Lyov's hand and gently encouraged the child to leave the safe-house with him. Instantly, the pair were hit with an icy cold blast of wind. Napoleon shivered, hunching over into his coat in an attempt to stay warm….Lyov however, barely flinched causing Napoleon to sigh. \"Of course he's not bothered by the cold….\" He muttered, \"….god forbid a Russian actually feel the cold.\" They set off walking and managed to get to the boundaries of the property without much problem (although Lyov was very interested in the unconscious bodies of the other guards). \"У нас есть автомобиль...(We have a car…)\" he reassured Lyov, who was beginning to falter slightly, \"…Мы будем выйти из этого холода в ближайшее время (We will get out of this cold soon.)\" When Lyov truly began to slow down, each step taking about a minute, Napoleon lifted the child into his arms and practically sprinted to where he knew he had parked the car. Lyov seemed surprised at this, tensing in Napoleon's arms until they reached the vehicle. \"Thank god…\" muttered Napoleon, shifting his son to one arm in order to open the passenger side door, and then placing his son inside. After getting in himself, he quickly started the engine and turned the heater on. \"Лучше? (Better?)\" He asked, twisting around to smile at his son. Lyov nodded, putting his hood down and removing the scarf and gloves, the Superman figure resting on his lap. \"Хорошо (Good)…\" Napoleon pulled onto a nearby road and sped away from the boundaries of the safe-house, \"…Давайте попробуем найти где-нибудь , чтобы поесть (Let's try to find somewhere to eat.)\" They travelled for a couple of hours, in order to make sure that they were far enough from the safe-house. Lyov soon fell asleep, his head resting on the window, despite the car hitting several bumps along the road. Once he was sure that his son was fast asleep, Napoleon switched on his communicator. \"Agent Solo here.\" /Ah Mister Solo… came the voice of Waverly, /How is everything going? \"I've got the child and we are en-route to the UNCLE safe-house.\" /Excellent! Any problems so far? Napoleon glanced over at the child, \"None with the mission Sir…Lyov hasn't said anything though. Is there any record of mutism or speech difficulties?\" /Nyet…\" This time, Illya answered, /….he is probably just shy \"That sounds plausible….I have just taken him from the only life I've known. Do we know how many languages he's been exposed to? American life may be difficult if he can only speak and understand Russian.\" /He can speak and understand English... Illya again, /…Why/ Are you exposing him to bad Russian accent? Napoleon chuckled, feeling glad that their familiar banter was back in place. \"My accent isn't that bad!\" /Keep telling yourself that Cowboy There were the sounds of rustling and shuffling over the communicator for a few moments, before Waverly's voice came over the device again. \"What's your ETA at the safe-house Mister Solo?\" Glancing at the horizon, Napoleon frowned. \"It's getting a bit late Sir, so I may check us both into a motel for the night….but we should be there by noon tomorrow.\" /Hmmmm….do you have the necessary ID's for the motel? \"Of course Sir. I prepared suitable cover stories for both of us for just this occasion.\" /Excellent. We will see you tomorrow Mister Solo. Waverly out. Napoleon switched off the communicator, glancing at his son….only to find him wide awake. \"Hey kiddo!\" he gasped, trying to mask his surprise, \"You hungry?\" Lyov frowned at him, gesturing at his throat and mouth. \"Yeah, my Russian accent's lousy huh? Do you mind if I speak English?\" There was silence as Lyov thought to himself for a few moments, before he shrugged and smiled….Napoleon took that to mean that he could speak English. \"Thanks kiddo….so, are you hungry?\" Lyov nodded eagerly, causing Napoleon to grin. \"Excellent! I'm starving….I think there's a restaurant a little further up.\" After around 10 more minutes of driving, Napoleon finally pulled into the car-park of a road-side café. \"Come on kiddo…\" Napoleon stepped out of his door and ran around to the passenger side, \"…grub time.\" Silently, Lyov held up his Superman figure causing Napoleon to grin and chuckle. \"Yeah you can bring Supes with you….but he's not getting his own meal, okay?\" Lyov just gave him an 'obviously' look and pushed himself out into the cold. Napoleon locked the door and the pair entered (with Napoleon keeping a careful eye out for any suspicious individuals). They saw themselves to a booth and glanced at the menu. \"So what are you fancying kid?\" Napoleon asked, keeping his voice quiet in order not to be overheard speaking English, \"Pizza? A burger?\" Lyov frowned at him, before pointing to the picture of a simple bowl of soup. \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? That doesn't look very-\" Lyov interrupted him by pointing aggressively at the picture. \"Alright, alright…\" Napoleon held up his hands in mock surrender, however, he was quick to notice the child glancing at the pictures of the other meals in...longing? \"Hey…\" he whispered, \"….have you ever had any of these others foods before?\" Lyov shook his head. \"So, what have you eaten for the last five years?\" Lyov pointed at the picture of the soup again, and then at a picture of bread. Napoleon sighed, \"Okay….maybe you should have the soup. Anything else might be too rich for your system…although maybe I can get you some chips. They should be plain enough.\" Lyov looked on in curiosity as Napoleon flagged down a passing waitress. \"Можем ли мы иметь одну тарелку супа и одну тарелку жареного картофеля , пожалуйста? (Can we have a bowl of soup and a plate of chips please?)\" He asked, his most charming smile on his face. The waitress nodded, a perky smile on her face (which much be a requirement in this job). \"Любые напитки? (Any drinks?)\" \"Два воды , пожалуйста (Two waters please)\" The waitress nodded and flounced away. Once she was out of earshot, Napoleon turned back to his son. \"I assume water's okay?\" Lyov glanced up from his Superman figure and nodded, smiling shyly at his Father. A couple of minutes later, the waitress brought over two glasses of water and beamed at the pair, cooing at Lvov before flouncing off again. Napoleon was quick to take a gulp, thirsty after the many hours of driving. \"Aahh…\" he gasped in relief, \"…That hits the spot!\" He glanced at Lyov….and was alarmed to see two of him. His vision become blurred and it felt as though something heavy was resting against his shoulders. \"Oh not again…\" he whispered, catching Lyov's worried glance just before his head hit the table.[Chapter 4] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review :) ….. The first thing Napoleon felt was a dull ache in his head. When he went to rub the back of his head in an attempt to lessen the pain, he quickly realised that his wrists were strapped to a chair. \"Aaah…\" came an unfamiliar voice, \"…I think the American is awake, nyet?\" Weakly, Napoleon opened his eyes to see two men, clearly KGB agents, standing in front of him. \"Gentlemen…\"he greeted, trying to remain calm, \"…I don't think this is necessary. A simple chat over a cup of coffee would have been fine.\" \"The American think he's funny!\" chuckled one of the men, before back-handing Napoleon across the face. From behind them, there was a noise of protest, prompting Napoleon to focus on a small figure seated on a table. \"R-really?\" he coughed, \"You're going to make the kid watch you thugs beat me?\" The two men glanced behind them and shrugged, one of them grinning as Lyov scooted back as far as he could. \"Well, he has got to learn torture methods one day da?\" \"He's five!\" \"Better late than never…\" the guard scowled as Lyov clutched his Superman toy closer to him, \"…give me that!\" He snatched the toy away, pushing Lyov back when he tried to grab it, \"You Americans and your heroes.\" He sneered, throwing the toy to the far side of the room. Napoleon growled at this, \"Bastards….he's just a kid!\" \"Nyet. He is a weapon.\" The two guards then began hitting Napoleon in the stomach and face, laughing as the man grunted in pain. After a few minutes of steady beating, that left Napoleon's nose and lip bleeding and his breath laboured due to cracked ribs, the two men stopped and went to lean back against the table. \"Now that introductions are over…\" began one of the men, \"…tell us who employed you. CIA perhaps?\" \"Social services actually. Someone reported incidents of abuse towards Lyo-UPH!\" The fist to his stomach stopped Napoleon in his tracks, causing him to wheeze in pain as he desperately tried to catch his breath. As he gasped weakly, head lowered to his chest, he could hear the two guards instructing Lyov on the proper hitting technique in Russian….but not for very long. There was a sudden bang and one of the guards fell to the door…dead, with a bullet hole in between his eyes. The other guard yelled in anger and shock, only for there to be another bang, closely followed by his body hitting the floor. Weakly, Napoleon lifted his head aware from his chest only for his eyes to widen in alarm. Seated on the table, aiming a gun at the two fallen guards….was Lyov. He had a determined look in his eyes as he glared at the two corpses. \"L-lyov?\" stuttered Napoleon, still in shock, \"H-how did you-\" Before he could finish, Lyov pointed to one of the men on the floor. On closer inspection, Napoleon could tell that the gun holster on the man's belt was empty, which meant that Lyov had likely stolen it when the two guards leant back against the table. Napoleon was too stunned to talk, watching as Lyov leapt down from the table and pressed two fingers against each man's neck (although there was really no need….they were both shot in the head). In silence, he watched as Lyov un-cuffed him from the chair, and gestured towards the door frantically. Weakly, Napoleon got to his feet and limped towards the door, not even managing to muster up a smile when he saw Lyov gently grab his Superman figure from up off the ground. Once outside, they were once again hit with an icy blast of wind….and their car was no-where to be seen. \"W-we need to go back indoors kid….\" Stuttered Napoleon, but Lyov shook his head and pointed into the distance. Glancing in that area, Napoleon could see a dark SUV. \"Kid I-\"He paused when he saw that Lyov and disappeared, although it was only briefly. After less than a minute, Lyov ran out the small building, straight towards the SUV. In amazement, Napoleon continued to watch as Lyov used some stolen keys to unlock the car, gesturing for his Father to follow him. Weakly, Napoleon limped over and (whilst wincing heavily) attempted to climb into the front seat….but fell back into the snow, the pain from his ribs too much. \"I-I can't…\" he whispered, \"….not before I get some medical help.\" Lyov pursed his lips in thought, before nodding in determination and helping his Father as the man pushed himself up off the ground. He struggled to support the older man, but eventually, they made their way back into the small building. Napoleon went to sit down, watching in silence as his son rummaged through cupboards and drawers. After a couple of minutes of searching, Lyov held up his hand in triumph and grinned at his Father, bandages, a first aid box and a bottle of painkillers in his hand. He placed the items on the table by Napoleon, before attempting to push the two bodies of the dead guards to one side….he was semi successful. Napoleon smiled when Lyov gave up, the two bodies simply tipped onto their sides. \"So what's the plan kiddo?\" Lyov shrugged, grabbing the bandages and holding them up to Napoleon. \"Y-you're going to patch me up?\" Nodding eagerly, Lyov clambered up onto his Father's lap and grabbed a plaster from the first aid box, before carefully placing it under Napoleon's lip, where he was cut. As his son then went about cleaning the dried blood under his nose, Napoleon's thoughts turned to Illya and everyone waiting at the UNCLE safe-house. It was probably about noon by now….they would be concerned if he didn't show up. 'But it was too late now' thought Napoleon wearily, wincing when Lyov accidentally nudged his busted nose. \"So, how do you know how to do this anyway?\" he asked. Lyov stopped, his hand still clutching the tissue. With a deep sigh, he lifted his t-shirt up to show Napoleon a jagged scar on his mid-section, and tapped it with the other hand. Napoleon felt as though his heart had stopped, \"H-how did that happen kid?\" His son shrugged, letting the t-shirt fall back down and began to mime fighting, making karate chops and little boxing punches. He then mimed a stabbing action, before pointing at where the scar was again. \"S-so you were fighting….training?\" A silent nod. \"And someone stabbed you during it….you were training to defend yourself from a knife, and your trainer stabbed you?!\" Another nod. Napoleon had to take deep breaths, trying to reign in his anger at the thought of anybody hurting his son. \"W-who stitched you up?\" he asked, hoping that the answer wouldn't be what he thought it was….he was disappointed. Lyov mimed the action of stitching himself up, grinning up at his Father as though expecting a 'well done for knowing how to stitch yourself up at five years old!' Napoleon took another deep breath, and weakly smiled back. \"Okay, okay kiddo.\" After a couple of minutes, Napoleon's face was completely clean (although his nose was still very sore) and Lyov was reaching into the first aid box to grab the bandages. This was the last straw for Napoleon, \"Woah, woah, woah kiddo…\" he gently grabbed a hold of his son's wrists, and smirked at the boy's confused look, \"…I can strap up my own ribs okay? Why don't you go and see if there's any food in this dump? We may be here a while.\" Lyov nodded eagerly, and practically leapt off of Napoleon's lap (causing him to yelp in pain), before rushing into the kitchen…well, Napoleon assumed it was the kitchen, he didn't exactly get the full tour last time. Groaning, he managed to unbutton his shirt….when the door to the building flew open. Not even pausing to yelp at the sudden blast of cold air, Napoleon dived to the floor and quickly the one gun remaining in the guard's holster, aiming it at the figure in the doorway. \"Napoleon!\" Napoleon sighed in relief, \"Illya…\" he grinned up at the Russian \"….sorry we were late.\" Illya shut the door behind him and knelt in front of his lover, gently turning his head from side to side in order to see the extent of the wounds. \"What happened?\" he murmured. \"They had eyes on us…must have drugged my water when we stopped for a quick bite to eat.\" Napoleon winced, \"They didn't know who I was working for though….the CIA should expect a back-lash from the KGB.\" \"They tortured you?\" Napoleon shrugged, \"They knocked me about a bit. They didn't really get time to do anything worse though.\" Illya seemed confused at this, however, before he could say anything Napoleon groaned as the painful repercussions of diving to the ground made themselves known. Rolling his eyes, Illya helped the man off of the floor and back to the chair. \"You are a foolish man Cowboy.\" \"Hey!\" complained Napoleon, \"I prefer to think of it as being foolhardily brave.\" \"Call it what you want Cowboy, but it was a stupid thing to do.\" Choosing not to argue, Napoleon held up his arms obligingly when prompted so that Illya could wrap the bandages around his chest. \"I will call Waverly and tell him the mission was not a success…\" muttered Illya, eyes firmly focused on his work, \"….maybe we can catch them before-\" \"Woah, woah, woah…\" interrupted Napoleon, \"….what are you talking about Peril?\" \"Well they captured you….Lyov must be back with them.\" Napoleon chuckled and shook his head, \"They were cocky…brought the kid with them in order to teach him good torture skills I suppose.\" Illya seemed disgusted at this, although not very surprised. At his lover's silence, Napoleon continued, \"I don't know what they've been teaching that boy, but he managed to steal a gun and shoot them directly in the head!\" \"Lyov did this?!\" Napoleon nodded, \"But there's still a glimpse of a child in their Illya! I brought a toy with me and the wonder on his face…well, I think he just wants to be a normal five year old.\" Illya didn't seem convinced, but remained silent as he finished wrapping up his lovers' chest. As he finished tying off the bandages, the door leading to the kitchen slammed open and Lyov came rushing in, waving a loaf of bread in the air. Napoleon tensed slightly, getting ready to protect Illya if Lyov saw him as a threat….but was surprised. At the sight of Illya, Lyov dropped both the bread and his Superman figure on the ground and raced forwards. \"PAPA!\"[Chapter 5] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review :) ….. \"PAPA!\" Napoleon watched in shock as Lyov ran straight to Illya, a beaming grin on his face and his arm out-stretched wide. What was even more surprising, was that Illya beamed back at the child and lifted him into the air as Lyov ran into his arms. Spinning Lyov around, Napoleon was sure he had entered the twilight zone, because Illya was laughing as well. Eventually, the pair settled down and Lyov began to bounce up and down excitedly in Illya's arms. \"Superman!\" He kept exclaiming, \"He's Superman! Just like in your stories!\" Illya, who was clearly trying not meet Napoleon's eyes, smiled at Lyov. \"Da? I am sure Napoleon is happy to hear that.\" \"Uh huh! He is just like all those stories you told me!\" Napoleon could only watch in shock as Illya and Lyov continued to chatter, a sharp pain in his chest which he couldn't attribute to his cracked ribs. \"Where's Waverly?\" He interrupted, turning to face the door in a desperate attempt not to show the pain in his eyes. \"I can't imagine he's far behind.\" \"Napoleon-\" \"Well I hope he brought the plane. We are in the middle of nowhere after all.\" Napoleon heard Illya sigh before answering, \"His ETA is ten minutes from now…I assume that there will not be any more KGB agents?\" \"From the way they were planning to…question me, I don't think they were expecting anyone for a while.\" The next few minutes passed in silence, except for the excited chatter of Lyov, who was oblivious to the tension between the two adults. Eventually, there was another knock on the door and a familiar British accent could be heard outside. \"Hello? Mister Kuryakin?\" Napoleon rolled his eyes and opened the door, \"You know, if Illya had been overpowered and the KGB were here, then you'd be dead by now.\" Waverly shrugged as he shouldered his way in, \"I had every confidence in Mister Kuryakin….\" Upon glancing at the agent in question, he couldn't help but smile at the small child, who had buried his face in Illya's neck. \"Hello little one…\" greeted Waverly, stepping closer and trying to smile reassuringly at him. However, Lyov didn't lift his head up, instead trying to bury closer to Illya. Taking the subtle hint, Waverly turned his attention back to Napoleon, frowning in concern. \"I see the KGB didn't want to give Lyov up so easily?\" Napoleon nodded, wincing slightly as his head began to ache. \"Yes Sir. They must have had eyes on us since leaving the KGB safe-house. They drugged some water at a diner and I woke up here.\" Waverly nodded in understanding, \"We assumed it would be something like that, hence sending Mister Kuryakin to find you. Miss Teller is waiting for us back at the jet, if you would care to follow me?\" Napoleon and Illya nodded, with Napoleon stripping one of the guards of his coat. Once everything was grabbed (and Waverly had called some colleagues to clean up the scene), they all left and trudged over to where the jet was waiting. Napoleon still didn't look at Illya. Once everyone was strapped in, and Lyov was preoccupied with his Superman toy, Gaby lifted off. Once they were high enough in the air and had levelled off, Napoleon turned in his seat to face Lyov. \"Hey, you okay?\" Lyov was shaking slightly in his seat, his eyes squeezed shut as he shook his head in the negative. \"Too high…\" whimpered the five year old, \"…too high!\" Before Illya could help, Napoleon unbuckled his seat belt and knelt down in front of Lyov (ignoring the dull ache in his ribs). \"You wanna know something?\" He tapped the Superman figure, \"Superman can fly you know. In fact, he can fly so fast that he turns back time.\" \"So?!\" Napoleon ruffled Lyov's hair, \"So, if Superman can be a hero and fly, then you can as well….and if you're really scared, then I'll be here. Every step of the way.\" Lyov glanced at him, tears brimming in his eyes. \"You promise?\" \"Yeah…what are Dad's for after all?\" Dimly, he could hear Illya take a sharp intake of breath, but chose to ignore it, focusing on his son. Lyov was staring down at his Superman figure, remaining tense as the plane rocked slightly in the air. \"You'll be okay honey…\" soothed Napoleon, gently stroking his son's hair, \"….just imagine you're Superman.\" \"B-but I-I'm not American! The guards said so!\" Napoleon winced, \"The guards….what did the guards say you were?\" \"Русским оружием (A Russian weapon)\" \"Well you listen to me…\" Napoleon ordered gently, \"…You are not a weapon. You are a little boy, my little boy in fact. Those guards were wrong…besides, you're not fully Russian you know. You're half American as well.\" Lyov frowned at this, \"So…they were completely wrong?\" \"Exactly.\" Nodding, Lyov turned his attention back to the Superman figure. \"Does that mean I can be like Superman…he's American isn't he?\" \"Superman's just a good guy kid. It doesn't matter if you're American or Russian, okay?\" Lyov nodded eagerly, making Superman fly around (clearly not focusing on the face that they were flying in a plane). \"Then I will be Superman!\" As the plane continued to fly, Lyov eventually drifted off to sleep, Superman resting on his lap. Once sure that he was asleep, Napoleon and Illya were waved over to the back of the plane by Waverly. \"What's the verdict Agent Solo and Agent Kuryakin? Can Lyov be integrated into normal society?\" Before Napoleon could answer, Illya spoke up. \"It appears the situation was worse than I thought…Lyov was the one who killed the two guards in the cabin. The ones who were keeping Napoleon captive.\" Waverly's eyes opened wide in shock, \"Lyov was responsible?! For that?!\" Nodding, Illya sighed wearily. \"I-I didn't realise just how far into his training Lyov was…if they have perfected his aim with a weapon, who knows what else they have taught him.\" He glanced up Waverly, \"If I had known, I would have informed you Sir.\" \"Would you really?\" snarled Napoleon, \"Because from what I've seen, secrets are your speciality…or can it be considered lying now?\" \"Napoleon I- \" \"-No…\" Napoleon interrupted, \"…I'm not going to let you throw my son under the bus like that!\" Without waiting for an answer, Napoleon turned to Waverly. \"The kid isn't a full spy yet! He's fascinated with his Superman toy….and what spy is frightened of heights?! The KGB would have beaten it out of him as soon as they realised! It's not like Peril's anger! It can't be used as an asset!\"\" Illya opened his mouth to protest, but quickly found himself silenced when Waverly held up a hand, prompting Napoleon to continue. \"Give him a chance…\" begged Napoleon, \"…he just needs to know that he can be a normal child. One that can have fun without turning it into a training session. One that doesn't have to think that he has to grow up to be a weapon for the KGB…or the CIA.\" \"I see your point Agent Solo…. maybe a chance to grow up as a normal child is what Lyov needs. Can I count on the two of you to make that happen, or do I need to bring someone else in?\" Again, before Illya could say anything, Napoleon spoke up. \"There'll be no need for that Sir. I'll take him in.\" \"Will we?\" Slowly, Napoleon turned to Illya. \"Yes…. I will. Whether or not you're involved, depends on whether you're going to tell me the truth.\" It probably would have hurt less if Napoleon had struck him across the face. Illya's face grew pale and he took a small step backwards…before his fists clenched and he span around, storming back into the main area of the plane. \"Was that really necessary Mister Solo?\" asked Waverly, disapproval in his voice. \"Yes. He needs to explain why my kid is calling him Dad! He needs to explain how he's so familiar with Lyov!\" \"Or…. maybe you need to see things from his perspective?\" Waverly sighed, \"Lyov was a carefully kept secret from almost everybody. Maybe he felt like he couldn't tell anybody for fear of death…. Or Lyov's death. And-\" \"- and maybe he didn't know I was the Father.\" Finished Napoleon wearily, \"But once we found out, then he could have told me! But he didn't… and that's why I'm angry.\" There was silence for a few moments, before Waverly nodded. \"Understood…\" he stood up and sighed, \"… but Agent Solo. Please try and speak to Kuryakin. I won't have my finest team broken up over something so small… or someone.\" Napoleon nodded, heading back into the main area of the plane, refusing to look at Illya as he sat next to his (still-sleeping) son. \"When we get back to headquarters…\" he began, \"… Lyov will be taken to medical. Just to make sure that the LGB haven't left us any surprises… we'll talk while he's being examined.\" Illya opened his mouth to talk, but was silenced when Napoleon held up his hand. \"No…. later. I can't right now.\"[Chapter 6] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review :) ….. Once Lyov was safely with the nurse (although he did look very wary about it), Napoleon took advantage of the break and tugged Illya away, towards an unused room. He didn't have to try too hard. He tugged Illya inside and locked the door behind them. \"Alright…\" muttered Napoleon, \"…talk. What the hell is going on?!\" Illya took a deep breath and sighed, pulling an old wooden chair over and gesturing for Napoleon to sit down. \"Please…. Please sit.\" Keeping his eyes on his lover, Napoleon slowly lowered himself into the offered chair, frowning as Illya began to pace back and forth in front of him. After a few moments of silence, Napoleon practically threw his hands up in the air, \"Well are you going to tell me or not?!\" \"You were not told everything in meeting….\" Sighed Illya after remaining silent for a few more moments, \"…and the CIA were not told everything at beginning of project.\" \"…What do you mean?\" \"The KGB wanted to find out if they could create perfect spy… but they also wanted to see if they could do impossible task.\" \"Impossible task?\" \"…To see if a male can carry and birth baby.\" Napoleon felt his heart practically stop, \"B-but that's- \" \"-Impossible? Yes, it should have been…. But Russian scientists worked hard and realised that with donated egg, which was…messed with, and two sperm samples, the genes of the two samples would shine through. By implanting an artificial womb, their Russian sample could also carry baby.\" \"So…. Lyov doesn't really have a Mother. He has two Dads?\" \"Essentially.\" Napoleon nodded in understanding…. Until he came to a sudden realisation. \"He called you Papa.\" Illya opened his mouth, but Napoleon continued undeterred. \"You told him stories. Stories about an American hero… you must have known about his American blood. You'd spent time with him and y-you knew what his name meant! Because- \" \"- because I was the one who gave it to him.\" Illya turned away and sighed, \"I couldn't just keep calling him it… or the Project.\" \"B-but the CIA said that- \" \"- that his Mother was the one who gave him the name, Da.\" Napoleon sat there in silence as Illya continued. \"The CIA never knew about the second project… and I planned to keep it that way. I was already the KGB's lab rat…. I couldn't be the CIA's as well.\" Silence. Illya refused to look at his lover, instead, turning to face the wall. \"I was only allowed to see him once a week at first…. Then once every two weeks when he hit two…. And then once a month. I didn't think that would bother me, it was unwanted child after all, but after b-birth…. I thought about grabbing him and escaping from the KGB. My Father's debt be damned! \"How...\" Napoleon cleared his throat, \"… how did you- \" \"- give birth?\" Illya lifted his shirt and ran his fingers gently over a scar that stretched across his stomach. Flinching when Napoleon's fingers joined his own, running over the scar, Illya's voice was practically a whisper. \"They cut me open again.\" Napoleon seemed transfixed by the scar, \"You told me that this was a knife wound… although technically, I suppose it's true.\" \"It was easier to say than admit the truth.\" Again, there was silence. Illya allowed his shirt to fall back down, and took a step back. \"Please say something…\" he whispered. \"… Tell me you didn't know I was the other Father. Tell me that you didn't start a relationship with me, just because I was the other Father. Please Illya!\" Whilst their conversation had been filled with uncomfortable silences, Illya was quick to answer this time. \"Nyet…\" he went to his knees in front of Napoleon, \"…nyet, you must believe me. I did not know you were Father until meeting with Waverly.\" Napoleon nodded, \"Alright…\" he sighed, \"… I believe you.\" Smiling in relief, Illya went to kiss the other man… only for Napoleon to stop him. \"I can't right now Peril… come on. Let's go get Lyov.\" …. Upon arriving at the doctor's office, Napoleon chuckled at the sulky look on Lyov's face. \"Well at least that's normal…\" he laughed, bending down to lift Lyov into his arms, \"… a child who doesn't like the Doctor!\" The nurse blushed when Napoleon winked at her, clearing her throat as she turned her attention to her clipboard. \"Okay… she began, \"… Lyov is quite healthy overall, however, he is under-weight for his age. Severely malnourished as well. I'll provide you with some vitamin supplements in order to get him to the right weight. Apart from that, he seems to be fine. The KGB were very diligent about his vaccinations, which is a blessing at least.\" \"Yeah, a blessing…\" Napoleon glanced at his son, who beamed at him, \"… come on kiddo. We've got a couple of hours to kill before we meet up with Waverly.\" \"Kill hours?\" Napoleon winced, \"Figure of speech… come on, I think there's a wooded area near here.\" He headed towards the exit, paused and glanced back at Illya. Illya hadn't moved. \"Come on…\" Illya seemed very surprised at Napoleon's request, but hesitate for too long just in case Napoleon changed his mind. Without saying another word to one another, the pair and Lyov went outside. Almost as soon as they left the facility, Lyov's eyes grew wide as he glanced around, clearly trying to take everything in. \"What's wrong kid?\" asked Napoleon, frowning as his son didn't even glance at him when he spoke, \"Haven't you ever seen trees or grass before?\" No answer. Napoleon turned his attention to Illya and frowned, raising an eyebrow. Illya simply sighed, \"He has…. But not often. When he was being transported to other compounds, he would spend some time outside.\" \"How much time?\" Illya winced at this, \"I don't know… I may have been the one to carry him, but when it came to his training and the transportation details, I wasn't told much.\" Nodding in understanding, Napoleon chose not to say anything, simply placing his squirming son on the ground. Almost immediately, Lyov rushed off diving into a perfect handstand, before tumbling into a forward's roll. \"Did you see me Papa? Did you see me Dad?\" he laughed, beaming up at the two men. Still preening slightly at being called Dad, Napoleon was shocked when Illya got to the ground, mock-growling as he lifted his son into the air. \"You've been working on your gymnastics, haven't you?!\" \"Da! I can stay in a headstand for over half an hour!\" Whilst Napoleon didn't think this was entirely possible or healthy, Illya clearly didn't care, kissing his son on the cheek. Even though Lyov hadn't had much in the way of positive, loving contact, he still acted like any other five-year old being kissed by a parent. \"Papa!\" He squirmed in embarrassment, \"Nyet!\" Illya just grinned (a sight that Napoleon could never get used to), before mock-pouting at his son. \"Don't you love me?\" This changed Lyov's mood immediately, the five-year then desperately trying to reassure his Papa by kissing him repeatedly on the cheek. \"Nyet! Nyet! Love you Papa!\" He twisted around and grinned at Napoleon, \"And you Superman Daddy! Love you too!\" Napoleon watched in amusement as Illya laughed, placing Lyov back on the ground so that the child could run off and continued to play. After around half an hour of frantic rushing about and rolling about in the grass, Lyov suddenly stopped and leapt into a defensive position. \"Lyov?\" Illya's hand moved towards the back of his belt, clearly wary of whatever the child had spotted or heard. \"Lyov, what is it?\" Lyov barely moved, and if it wasn't for the way his eyes darted from side to side, Napoleon would compare him to a statue. Glancing in the direction that Lyov was facing, Napoleon could see something… or someone moving in amongst the trees. Silently gesturing for Illya to draw his own weapon, Napoleon removed his gun from a back holster and aimed at whoever was moving about in the trees. However, before he could say anything, Lyov suddenly took off in a run. \"LYOV NO!\"[Chapter 7] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review :) ….. To be honest, Napoleon felt sorry for the poor Agent. Having a five-year-old run towards him, clearly preparing to attack must have been a startling experience, and he was very lucky that Illya's reflexes were quick. Before Lyov could leap at the Agent (who was only delivering a message to the couple), Illya managed to grab the child and hold him in a secure hold, muttering to him in Russian as Napoleon scolded the Agent for 'sneaking about in the woods, ready to give people heart attacks.' As Illya calmed Lyov down (and it was concerning to see just how quickly Lyov could fly into assassin mode), the Agent stated that Waverly would like to see Napoleon, Illya and Lyov in his office. So, with a pouting Lyov in his arms (his ears still probably ringing from Illya's scolding lecture), Napoleon and Illya made their way to Waverly's office, cautiously knocking on the door as the sound seemed to echo throughout the long corridor. \"Enter.\" Slowly, Illya eased the door open, allowing Napoleon to go first, before entering himself. Seated at his desk, Waverly seemed engrossed in his paperwork, pen scribbling on the paper as the small family waited awkwardly in the doorway. \"You can sit down you know…\" Waverly chuckled, \"… I'll only be a minute.\" As they sat down, Napoleon was forced to tighten his grip as Lyov wriggled, wanting to explore the new room. Eventually, Lyov settled down, just as Waverly signed the last signature on the last piece of paperwork. \"Now gentlemen…\" the Head of UNCLE began, putting his pen down and giving the family a soft smile, \"… now that we've established that the KGB haven't left us any surprises, and you two appear to have had a much-needed chat, it's time to talk about your future.\" Napoleon blinked in confusion, \"Our future Sir?\" \"Yes. As agents of UNCLE. I assume the pair of you want to raise Lyov together?\" Feeling Illya tense up beside him, Napoleon was quick to answer, wanting to reassure his partner as quickly as he could. \"Of course, if that's possible?\" \"Oh it's perfectly possible…\" Waverly stated, \"… we're a very modern organisation. If you two want to continue going on missions together, then we can certainly arrange that.\" \"How?\" \"Well, due to a number of women now being employed by UNCLE, I have decided to try and set up a nursery for any children who may be related to our employees. This will be where children will stay when their parents are working.\" Illya frowned, \"What about school?\" \"Here I defer to you… how is his education level?\" \"He speaks at least five languages…. That I know of.\" \"And what about Maths, Geography, History?\" \"Yes, to the first two… but I think they would have only taught him Russian history.\" Waverly frowned at this. \"That's a bit… narrow-minded?\" \"It is the KGB way. Russia must be seen as strong and righteous in every aspect, so they only present one side of the argument. With every other subject, it is important to know as much as possible, but with History… he may struggle.\" \"Alright… well we can get him enrolled in a nearby school if need be, which will take care of any daytime missions. During the evening, is there anyone who you trust to take care of him?\" The pair thought to themselves for a few moments, before Illya hesitantly answered. \"Well… we were hoping that Gaby might help.\" \"Yes…\" continued Napoleon, \"… and if she's on a mission with us, then maybe… you could.\" Waverly frowned in confusion, \"Me? You would want me to take care of your son when you're on missions?\" Glancing at each other in slight alarm at the lack of emotion in Waverly's voice, Illya and Napoleon frowned. \"Well…\" began Napoleon, \"… We do trust you Sir. I know that this isn't really in your job description, but you know all the details about Lyov. Yes, he's still a child, but he's a child who reacts a certain way when faced with a threat.\" Almost immediately, everyone's thoughts turned to the scene back in the KGB safehouse and then, how Lyov reacted when faced with the perceived threat of the agent. Waverly was clearly thinking to himself, forehead furrowed in thought as his eyes focused on an unseen point in the distance. \"I'm… I'm not sure.\" He confessed, \"I have very little experience with children… I can hire a nanny for the evenings that you two and Gaby are occupied, but as for my own involvement… it is something I'll have to think about.\" Nodding their acceptance, Illya and Napoleon went to change the subject… only for the door to the office slam open and Waverly's personal assistant burst in. \"Sanders is here…\" the poor woman blurted out, \"… the doormen weren't able to stop him sir.\" Waverly shot to his feet, a frown on his face as he made his way around the desk. \"What?! We don't have anything scheduled!\" \"We told him that Sir, but he said that he didn't need an appointment.\" \"Everyone needs an appointment! It's just rude otherwise!\" Despite the seriousness of the situation, Napoleon resisted the urge to smile at Waverly's British-ness. They did have a problem however. If Sanders really was in the building, then he could really only be here for one reason. Lyov. \"Sir, is there another way out of this room?\" Napoleon asked, slight desperation in his voice, \"Preferably one that takes us as far away from Sanders as possible?\" Sadly, Waverly shook his head, his eyes focused on the door as the sound of Sanders berating some poor UNCLE agent could be heard down the corridor. Lyov, who could clearly sense the tension in the room, huddled up against his Papa, burying his face into Napoleon's neck in an attempt to hide. Carefully, Napoleon handed the small child over to Illya and moved to stand in front of them, hoping to shield his child from his old boss. Literally seconds later, Sanders entered the office, only to come face to face with Waverly. \"I don't recall having a meeting booked with you today…\" started Waverly, \"… I'm sure if you actually speak to my assistant, rather than push past her, then she'll be able to check my schedule for the upcoming week… or month and fit you in.\" Sanders just sneered, \"Really? Are you telling me that I'd actually get to see you,,, or would you continue to find excuses until the problem went away.\" \"… What do you want?\" Sanders glanced over towards Napoleon and the two hidden behind him. \"You know why I'm here. I'm here for the child.\" \"No!\" blurted out Napoleon in protest, \"That wasn't the agreement and you know it!\" \"Agent Solo is correct…\" Waverly sighed, \"… as I recall, the agreement was that if Lyov showed no signs of being able to blend into normal society as a regular child, then the CIA could have custody of him.\" \"Precisely.\" Sanders seemed very pleased with himself, \"Don't think that the news of a child who managed to take down two KGB agents hasn't reached CIA headquarters. It's obvious that he won't be able to just lead a 'normal life'.\" \"He was brought into this building only a few hours ago!\" Waverly growled, his British politeness being thrown out the window, \"You haven't given him the chance!\" \"Surely the fact that a small child could take out two highly trained KGB agents is reason enough to take him. Imagine what could happen if someone shouted at him, or made him feel threatened? We'd have a murder case on our hands!\" \"That's all hypothetical! You can't know that that would happen!\" \"Even hypothetical situations may happen, and therefore, there is still a risk.\" \"I won't do anything…\" Everyone turned to look at the child huddled in Illya's arms. During the course of the argument, Lyov had twisted around to glare at Sanders… although he did keep a tight hold of Illya's jumper in case the CIA agent tried to grab him. \"… I promise.\" The five-year-old continued, \"I won't be bad!\" Sanders just shook his head, \"Kid… I can't trust your word. You don't know how you're going to react in the future, and the paperwork for a teacher with a slit throat is hell.\" Lyov winced at the blunt way that Sanders highlighted his… vicious side. His fingers tightened on Illya's jumper as the Russian held him closer. As Sanders stepped closer, Napoleon stepped forwards to meet him, his fists clenched in preparation for a struggled. \"Not one step closer…\" he hissed, keeping his eyes on Sander, despite Illya whispering behind him that he himself \"should take care of the cocky American.\" Seeming to notice that he was severely out-numbered, Sanders stopped where he was and glanced around. \"Do you really want to risk your organisation?\" he asked Waverly, sneering as the Brit straightened up, \"Because I know for a fact that the CIA has a lot of lawyers that could do with their cages being rattled… And I'd be happy to rattle them.\" \"You would sue us for custody of Lyov?\" Napoleon exclaimed in shock, \"You don't have a case!\" \"Lyov is a project between the KGB and the CIA. With the KGB having forfeited their rights after breaking our contract, the CIA now have sole rights…. Lyov belongs to us.\"[Chapter 8] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review J ….. \"You would sue us for custody of Lyov?\" Napoleon exclaimed in shock, \"You don't have a case!\" \"Lyov is a project between the KGB and the CIA. With the KGB having forfeited their rights after breaking our contract, the CIA now have sole rights…. Lyov belongs to us.\" … Lyov belongs to us. Lyov belongs to us. Lyov belongs to us. Napoleon could hear those words repeating over and over again in his mind, making him feel sick. It had been weeks since Saunders had told them about the upcoming lawsuit, and everything had been quiet… ish. Waverly had gathered every available lawyer in order to prepare for the day that the lawsuit paperwork would come through. Aka, today. However, it hadn't been sent to UNCLE headquarters… it had been sent to their personal address, meaning that Saunders knew exactly where they lived. It was a sickening thought. Which didn't really explain why Napoleon was re-reading it for the tenth time, whilst Illya was finishing off some paperwork and Lyov was playing 'Superman' in the front room. Okay, he was leaping off the sofa and into a forward roll as he pretended to fly to the rescue, but it was still playtime, and Napoleon didn't want to stop that…. Not when Lyov had spent so little time playing. \"You look worried…\" Napoleon glanced up at Illya, who was staring at him in concern. \"… what is that?\" He tried to hide the letter, but it was too late…. Illya darted forwards and snatched it out of his hands, his eyes scanning the page as his face twisted in confusion. \"… How did he get our address?\" \"I don't know, but I'm going to find out.\" \"Do you believe UNCLE gave it to him?\" Napoleon shook his head as he pulled out his phone, \"Waverly wouldn't let that happen…. Not willingly anyway.\" \"… I will pack our bags.\" … \"Are wizards real Daddy?\" Lyov asked, glancing up from the first Harry Potter book, \"Because I want to go to Hogwarts.\" Napoleon glanced back, his eyes widening at how far into the book Lyov was. \"When did- \" \"- I start it? This morning.\" Lyov beamed at Napoleon, before turning his attention to Illya, \"So are wizards real?\" \"No, I am afraid not.\" \"Oh….\" Lyov seemed to just accept this, and continued to read. Satisfied that the child was distracted, Napoleon turned to Illya. \"Did you have to tell the truth like that?\" he whispered, \"Couldn't you have let him believe that magic was real? Most five-year olds do…. Is the reading thing normal by the way?\" \"Enhanced reading speed is a requirement for all agents… even children.\" Illya sighed, \"And I will not lie to him… I do not think I can.\" \"Why? Is he some sort of lie-detector as well?!\" \"No… I will feel bad if I do.\" ….. \"Gentlemen…\" Greeted Waverly, welcoming the three into his office, \"… Thank you for getting here so quickly.\" \"Did you get my message.\" \"Yes Agent Solo, and let me tell you, I am going to get to the bottom of how Saunders found out your address… do you have the court summons?\" Napoleon nodded, reaching into his inside pocket and pulling out the letter, quickly handing it over for Waverly to scan. \"Everything written in this document is nothing new…\" Waverly eventually concluded, \"… all these threats were made when Saunders was last here.\" \"And?\" \"… And I have suitably prepared our lawyers for this. They can deal with it.\" \"Except, we'll have to reveal all the nitty gritty details about how Lyov came into the world… I know it'll be a private court, which only the CIA and the KGB would be privy to… but- \" Here, Napoleon stopped, turning to Illya before he could say anything more…. What would be said next, was entirely up to Illya. Minutes ticked by, as Napoleon continued to glance over at Illya. Waverly quickly noticed the tension, choosing not to say anything as he waited patiently. Eventually, Illya sighed. \"Let us just say that Lyov… did not come into the world in usual way. I would prefer to keep this information away from the CIA bas- \" \"- Illya!\" Illya glanced down at Lyov, who was still focused on his book, and barely paying attention to anything around him. \"My apologies…. What do American lawyers have in mind?\" Waverly clearly knew they weren't telling the whole truth, but once again, he didn't pursue the matter any further and reached into one of the drawers built into his desk, pulling out some papers and sliding them over to the pair. \"This is everything that I and the lawyers have discussed since we learnt of Saunders' court-suit. It details a draft opening statement, the witnesses we could use and preparation against cross-examination.\" Pulling the papers closer, Napoleon and Illya read over the words. It was an interesting layout and did prepare for every eventuality that the CIA might throw at him…. Napoleon still wasn't convinced. \"What if the CIA throws a surprise at us? Will the lawyers be prepared for that?\" Waverly frowned at him, \"These are the most well-payed lawyers in the entire country, graduating top of their class. I think they'll be able to manage whatever curveball the CIA throws at use.\" No… still not convinced. …. \"What is zis music?\" Napoleon glanced up from all the lawyer paperwork and smirked at Illya, \"Frank Sinatra, My Way… a classic.\" \"Is that why Lyov is sleeping?\" Getting to his feet, Napoleon peered over the desk… only to smile softly when he saw his son curled up on the rug by the fire, the Harry Potter book in one arm and the Superman figure in the other. Numerous toys surrounded him, including toy trains, lego and a brand-new teddy bear. \"Huh… I guess all the excitement today tuckered him out.\" Ilya raised an eyebrow, \"Excitement? All we did is sit in boring office, listening to boring people.\" \"And Lyov listened to every word... do you think he understood it?\" Thinking to himself for a few short moments, Illya shook his head. \"Not all of it, nyet. Law was not in daily lessons.\" \"The KGB aren't to big on followings things like rules or laws huh?\" Illya didn't say a word, simply raising his eyebrow in a silent challenge, his face not even moving when Napoleon smirked at him. \"Bedroom?\" \"… Da.\" …. Lyov hummed happily as the warmth spread through his bones, pulling his Superman figure closely as slowly, he swam back into consciousness. The room was empty. When he had gone to sleep, his Papa was working at his desk…. Now there was nothing. He knew he shouldn't…. but he was tensing up, his mind instantly racing and thinking of every possibility. Were there attackers in the house? Has someone managed to grab his parents and steal them away? Had they…. Abandoned him? Or was it all a dream? Grabbing his book and Superman figure, Lyov shot to his feet and glanced around the room frantically. Once he was sure that his parents weren't in there, he ran to the door and carefully listened out, his face pursed in concentration. It all seemed silent at first… and then there was a dull bang from down the corridor, where his parent's bedrooms were. As silently as he could, he placed his book and his toy against the wall, hunkering down low and creeping along the ground until he reached the door of their room. There was another bang, prompting Lyov to cautiously push the door open and peek inside. …. As soon as the sliver of light from the landing shone into the room, Illya prodded Napoleon's shoulder. \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\" he hissed, \"Stop!\" Napoleon was quick to obey, pulling away from his lover in concern. \"What is it? Did I do something wrong?!\" Shaking his head in reassurance, Illya silently gestured towards the beam of light that was shining on their bedside table. Whilst Napoleon tensed briefly, he quickly realised who was on the other side of the door and chuckled, rolling off of Illya and onto his back. \"Lyov?!\" he called out, \"Lyov, if you want to come in you can…. We're decent… unfortunately.\" The last part was muttered, but Illya still heard him, slapping him lightly on the arm as the door opened further and Lyov crept in, still in a defensive position. As soon as he was sure that nothing bad was happening, and that there were no intruders in the house, Lyov straightened up and clambered onto the bed. \"I thought you left me…\" He whispered, burying in-between the two and snuggling up to Illya, \"… You weren't there.\" Illya and Napoleon glanced at each other in guilt, before Illya pulled their son closer and gently ruffled his hair. \"We will not leave you…\" he whispered in the five-year-olds ear, \"… we will never leave you.\" \"Yeah…\" Napoleon agreed, \"… it would take Superman himself to take you away from us.\" \"Really?\" \"Really, really!\" Lyov giggled, burying his face into Illya's chest. And then there was a loud knocking on the door. \"OPEN UP SOLO!\"[Chapter 9] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review J …. \"OPEN UP SOLO!\" All three of them tensed at the sound of Sanders' voice outside of the apartment, with Lyov burying his face into his Dad's chest, soft whimpering making its' way out of his mouth. \"Crap…\" Napoleon muttered under his breath, grabbing his gun from the pillow and leaping out of bed (quickly putting on some pants) and cautiously heading towards the front door, \"… crap, crap, crap.\" He then turned to Illya and winced, \"Remember how I mocked you for having all those escape routes planned in advance… yeah, I'm going to need you to use one of them and get yourself and Lyov out of here.\" \"I will not leave you here to- \" \"- Illya, I'm not giving you a choice here!\" Before Illya could try and argue again, Napoleon turned around and glared at him. \"Sanders want our son… now, you might be more than willing to fight with me like usual, but Sanders will just have another man sneak in and grab Lyov… you need to stay with him more than you need to stay with me.\" It took some time, but eventually Illya nodded in agreement, placing Lyov on the bed and getting dressed himself, whilst Napoleon continued to head towards the front door. \"Do you really want me to add attempted kidnapping to the lawyers list of charges they're going to bring against you?!\" he called through the wood of the door, \"I'm sure they'd have a field day.\" \"… I just want to talk Solo!\" \"Yeah! And I've got a part playing Superman! I beat Ben Affleck to the role, can you believe it?!\" \"Let us in Solo!\" As Napoleon continued to tease and torment Sanders, Illya lifted Lyov back into his arms and headed towards the corner of the room, pulling at a small book on the bookshelf, which caused a small panel to open. Once he crawled inside, the door shut behind him and they began to make their way through the dark, damp tunnel. \"What about Daddy?\" Lyov protested as Illya pushed him forwards, \"We can't leave him!\" \"Napoleon knows what he is doing. Keep crawling.\" \"But- \" The sound of gunshots echoed throughout the tunnel, prompting Lyov to twist around and try and force his way back. \"We need to save him!\" \"We need to save you!\" Illya pulled his son in front of him and made sure the child was looking at him, \"You are important here… Napoleon can handle himself, the Americans do not really want him, they want you. If they get you, they have won.\" More gunshots and the sound of Napoleon yelling. \"But- \" \"- But nothing. Now keep moving. We must get out of here.\" ….. \"What do you mean they're nowhere to be found?!\" Sanders snarled at his agent, who was looking like he'd rather be anywhere but here, \"There is one entrance and exit, the windows were all covered, how did they escape?!\" \"We aren't entirely sure Sir. We believe there is probably a secret exit somewhere in the apartment, but we are having some trouble finding it, and- \" \"- and even if you do find it, they're probably long gone by now.\" Sanders groaned, before swearing furiously under his breath, spinning around and punching the wall. \"Watch it…. I've just painted that.\" At Napoleon's teasing tone, Sanders span around and glared at him. Yes, they'd managed to subdue the ex-CIA agent, but lost the original target during the raid… the target and the ex-KGB agent… all in all, it was a disappointing day. \"Where would they go Solo?\" he sneered, \"We've surrounded all entrances and exits to the UNCLE headquarters… they have nowhere they can be safe.\" \"You're seriously trying to play that card?\" Solo shook his head in mock disappointment, \"You know what Illya is capable of. CIA agents are like toddlers to him.\" \"With a child in tow? He'll never make it.\" Solo just shrugged, infuriating Sanders and prompting him to backhand the man across the face. \"He might be able to avoid us…\" he sighed, smirking as Solo to tongued at his split lip, \"… but he won't be able to resist coming to save his darling boyfriend.\" ….. \"What do you mean you can't get a hold of them?\" Waverly asked in concern, frowning at a worried Gaby, \"They're meant to be at the apartment, remaining low whilst- \" \"- Some of our men spotted CIA agents lurking around the area.\" Waverly didn't even flinch at the interruption, but his face did go pale when he realised what the implications of that statement meant. \"You think Sanders has them?\" \"I think Sanders is trying… something tells me he wouldn't be able to resist boasting if he had Lyov.\" \"Get our best men over there right away! If Sanders is anywhere he's not meant to be, I want him dragged here! Unconscious if necessary!\" \"Sir, yes Sir!\" ….. \"We going to UNCLE?\" Illya pulled his son's hat further over his eyes, glancing around to make sure no-one had spotted them, \"Nyet…. We will have to remain low until UNCLE finds us.\" \"What about Papa?\" \"He will be fine. It is not him Sanders is after.\" He gently took his son's hand and tried to encourage him to walk… only for there to be resistance. \"He wants me… what if he hurts Papa to get to me?\" Illya winced at this, deciding to lift his son into his arms and keep moving, \"Your Papa can handle himself… we however, need to keep moving. He is not getting you.\" Huddling into his Dad's chest, Lyov chose to remain silent, watching the world go by as Illya practically raced down the streets, trying to find the most obscure motel in the city. … \"This is definitely illegal kidnapping…\" Napoleon mused in his cell, \"… actually, come to think of it, isn't all kidnapping illegal? Why do we feel the need to put an additional 'illegal' in front of it? Does it make it doubly illegal? Is the sentence higher if you add illegal on front of it?\" \"Shut. Up. Solo.\" Sanders growled from outside the cell, slamming his palm against the doors, \"You've done nothing but talk since we got here, but you've said nothing important!\" \"I know, it's a special talent of mine. Have you talked to Waverly yet? Has he brought the cane out? A little bit of British discipline might do you some good…\" Napoleon then stopped in his tracks and shuddered, \"… and my mind went somewhere it really shouldn't have gone. I'm not going to sleep in weeks with that image.\" Silence. \"Did I hurt your feelings Sanders? Or did I hit the nail on the head… this all just some kinky punishment thing between you and Waverly?\" More silence. \"… You've left, haven't you? I've been talking to myself for ages haven't i?\" Napoleon glanced up at the camera in the top left corner of his cell, \"Spoilsport.\" ….. \"Anything to report Gaby?\" Glancing around the apartment, having taken care of the CIA guards who were guarding the place, Gaby shook her head. \"Not much… bullet holes in the walls suggest a struggle and there is some blood on the wall, however, because it's near the front door I suspect it might be CIA blood. They must have got off a few good shots.\" \"Any sign of where they might have gone… or whether or not the CIA have them?\" Heading into the bedroom, Gaby glanced around and frowned. \"There's something… off about this place… something I'm missing.\" \"Oh?\" Walking over to the bookcase, she started pulling at all the books… until she heard a click and a door opened up. \"I think I know where Lyov, and either Illya or Napoleon are… they had an escape tunnel ready for this occurrence.\" \"Any idea where it leads?\" \"Nope… but I think we've got bigger problems. One person would have gone with Lyov, whilst one stayed here to fend off the CIA…. I think one of them was captured.\" Waverly cursed furiously over the comms, followed by the sound of something banging against the desk. \"Damn it Sanders…\" he muttered, \"…. Gaby, you try and find Lyov and whoever went with him. I'm going to put some pressure on Sanders. He can't get away from the law this time, this is an unlawful kidnapping!\" \"Sir, I- \" \"- You heard me Gaby. As of today, we are at war with the CIA!\"[Chapter 10] Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series I've been thinking of. Please enjoy, and read/review J …. His little bar had never been so busy. Usually, there were only a few regulars plus the occasional tourist who wandered in, but today, a number of men seemed to be in every corner of the bar area… several trained men. He'd served in the army, he knew trained men when he saw them. But, they were paying for drinks, so he kept his mouth shut and remained quiet. And then the blonde man and little boy walked in, the atmosphere changing instantly. \"Hello there! What can I get for you?\" The blonde man glanced around the room, tensing dramatically, before placing the child on a stool at the bar. \"Water for child please…\" he ordered, clearly Russian judging by the thick accent, glancing around as the other men in the bar all got to their feet. The bartender didn't want to get involved in this, giving the child a glass of water and watching in stunned silence as one of the men stepped closer. \"Mister Kuryakin… stand down. Just had the child over, and Mister Solo will be returned to you.\" The child looked terrified at this, catching the bartender's eyes, before turning his attention back to the water, swirling it around in the glass. It was at this moment; the bartender knew these men weren't taking the child away… not without a fight from him anyway. Catching the child's eye, he gestured for him to climb over the bar and take shelter behind it, whilst the strange men were still so occupied with the child's… father? Possibly? Thankfully, the child got the hint very quickly, scampering over the bar and dropping down to the ground effortlessly. A good thing too. One of the strange men lunged at the Russian with a large blade, only to scream in pain as his wrist was grabbed and pinned to the bar, the knife now in the Russian's hand. \"Tell Saunders, if he wants my son… he can come get him himself!\" The Russian growled, not even flinching as the rest of the men drew their own weapons. Swiftly, he pinned the man's hand to the bar by stabbing the knife through it, before darting forwards and slamming the heads of two men together, knocking them out instantly. Another man had his head slammed against the table, almost breaking the wood with the force of it. Two men had their guns disarmed and snatched from them, before two bullets hit them in the knees. The rest of the bullets were emptied out into several of the other men, not killing them, but preventing them from going anywhere. As the fight continued, the bartender glanced down at the boy hiding behind the bar, frowning when he realised the boy didn't even flinch at the sounds of violence. \"URGH!\" Turning his attention back to the fight, the bartender winced when he saw the Russian remove the knife from the pinned man's hand, swiping it around to stab the final attacked in the side, before kicking him to the ground and stabbing the knife back through the hand of the man at the bar. \"Tell Saunders to come and get Lyov himself.\" The Russian growled, before knocking the man out and turning his attention back to the bartender, \"You saw nothing, understood?\" The bartender nodded frantically, watching as the child shot to his feet and clambered back over the bar. \"Come…\" the Russian lifted the kid into his arms, before depositing a ten-dollar bill on the bar, \"… we must go now.\" Stunned, the bartender watched the couple leave, cautiously waving at the child as the boy waved goodbye to him. When they were gone, he gazed around the room, staring at all of the unconscious bodies lying on the floor. \"Well…. Who's going to clean this up?\" ….. \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY GOT AWAY!?\" Napoleon cackled at the anger in Saunders' voice, tonguing at the cut in his lower lip as Saunders threw the mobile to the ground, stomping on it in rage. \"Well…\" he chuckled, \"… isn't this a little bit awkward? Waverly knocking at your door and Illya running rings around your men. Anyone would think the CIA were incompetent!\" Before Saunders could respond, Napoleon spoke up again. \"Oh wait… they are incompetent!\" Really, he should have expected the punch to his face… and then to his stomach, causing him to wheeze in pain. \"You won't be laughing when this all works out to my advantage...\" Saunders sneered, \"… As soon as I have evidence that a five-year-old child can take down trained CIA agents, the boy is mine.\" Napoleon couldn't say anything to that… it was the truth after all. As soon as Lyov proved himself to be a threat, the CIA would be able to make their case air-tight. ….. \"Sir?\" Waverly never took his eyes off the phone. He needed it to ring… he needed the reassurance that everything was alright. \"Sir!\" At Gaby's raised voice, his eyes darted up to meet hers, frowning at the look on her face. \"What's happened.\" She placed a file on his desk, \"Reports of an attempted kidnapping in the bar in Whitechapel.\" \"Attempted kidnapping?\" \"It appears as though a Russian man… disagreed with the kidnappers and knocked all of them out. They all have minor bullet wounds and stab wounds, no fatalities.\" \"Illya understands what a death in the CIA would mean…\" Waverly sighed in relief, \"… and Lyov. Did he take part in it, do we know?\" \"The bartenders says no, as does the CCTV footage that we pulled from the scene. It looks like Lyov was hiding behind the bar at the time.\" This time, Waverly really did fell a wave of relief sweep through him. \"Thank goodness for small mercies. Any idea where they're heading to now?\" \"None… personally, I'm just waiting for more CIA bodies.\" \"… That would be very effective actually.\" RING, RING. RING, RING. RING, RING. Waverly practically dived at the phone, wrenching it up and towards his ear in desperation. \"Yes?\" /It's me.  Sighing in relief at the familiar Russian accent, Waverly completely relaxed. There was no chance of the CIA being able to trace this call, which meant that they were safe. \"Agent Kuryakin… I hope this is good news?\" /Lyov and I are still safe, but I do not know for how long. The Americans are… persistent.  \"Can… can I hear Ducktales in the background?\" There was a brief moment of silence, where Waverly could clearly hear the cartoon theme in the background, and a childish voice singing along eagerly. /Where is Napoleon?  Illya asked, clearing his throat nervously. Waverly knew he should have lied… but it would only lead to problems later on. \"I'm afraid Agent Solo was taken by the CIA, but I have every faith that we will get him back.\" It didn't seem to reassure Illya, who had started cursing as soon as Waverly confirmed that Napoleon had indeed been kidnapped. A few more seconds passed, before the phone call suddenly cut off and the dial tone echoed throughout the room. \"Shit…\" Waverly muttered under his breath, \"… shit, shit, shit.\" ….. A little over two hours after the phone call, when Lyov was wrapped up in a duvet, limbs spread out and his loyal Superman by his side, Illya found himself plotting and planning. The sounds of alarms out in the streets caused Lyov to stir slightly, a small whine escaping his mouth, prompting Illya to place a soothing hand on the child's back. \"Sleep little one…\" he muttered, remembering an old mantra that his own mother used to whisper to him in the dead of night, when the fears of the world outside consumed him, \"… dream of flying and freedom. One day when you're big and strong, your fears will disappear.\" He hoped his son's future would be better than his own. His family was treated like scum and he was nothing more than a well-trained attack dog or a science experiment for many years… until he met Napoleon. And now someone was threatening to take Napoleon away from him. He knew Waverly would stop at nothing to get Napoleon back… but he also knew that the CIA would do anything to get Lyov and raise him as nothing more than a killing machine, an assassin! Someone who could be sent anywhere to do anything, with no-one suspecting a thing. Well… Illya knew he wasn't going to let that happen. No matter what.[Chapter 11] \"Daddy?\" Illya hummed, acknowledging that he was listening, but not tearing his thoughts away from the plan he was making in his head. He vaguely remembered how to break into the CIA base if necessary, but it was all about the little details. \"Daddy… if the CIA want be for Papa, shouldn't I go to them?\" Immediately Illya snapped out of his thoughts and turned to his son his shock, \"What did you just- \" \"- I don't want them to kill Papa.\" There was a brief moment of silence, before Illya, slipped out of his chest, moving to his knees opposite his son, gently encouraging his son to look him in the eye. \"Do you know, how long I have wanted us to be family?\" Illya asked, \"Form the moment you were tiny baby, with tiny fingers reaching for the light.\" Lyov was silent, eyes widening as his Dad continued. \"I remember your first steps… I wanted you to be able to run free, outside in snow, not as a training mission.\" Illya took a deep breath, \"I wanted you to be able to wear something that wasn't grey, white or black. I wanted to go star-gazing, show you what full moon look like. I wanted to teach you how to fish, how to play ball games... I wanted you to be normal kid.\" Lyov was clearly stunned by the admission, however Illya had one last thing to say. \"You are my miracle child… but the CIA won't see a child. They will only see weapon.\" Pulling his son into a hug, Illya took several deep breaths in order to calm down, \"We will find another way to save Napoleon. I promise.\" \"But- \" \"- no buts. It is time for bed.\" Illya lifted the five-year-old into his arms and headed over to the modest bed that was in the room, \"We have a lot of work to do tomorrow.\" When he turned to head back to his plans, Lyov cautiously spoke up. \"We are going to get him back… right? Papa?\" \"… No matter what my little lion. No matter what.\" ….. \"You're looking a little paranoid there, Sanders!\" Sanders ignored him, frowning as he read through the warrant and law-suit that Waverly had hand-delivered straight into his hands. He still didn't know how the man and his little pretty secretary even got into his office. Needless to say, he'd ordered a complete lock-down. No-one gets in and no-one gets out. No communication comes in or out and everyone is checked. Napoleon Solo, of course, was finding the whole thing hilarious, especially as the number of guards around his cell was doubled. \"How much is your boss willing to defend you?\" Napoleon ignored the warning hisses from the guards, \"Because I can bet when this all goes to shit, and the CIA are exposed as being completely corrupt, he'll drop you like a hot potato!\" \"I am the boss Solo, or did you forget that?\" \"Awww…\" Napoleon pouted, despite the smirk on his face, \"… you know as well as I do, that you're not the boss of everything. There's always someone higher than you.\" Sanders remained silent at this, muscles tensing as Napoleon started to hum the National Anthem suggestively. When the humming got louder and louder, Sanders snapped. \"This is only going to get worse for you and your little family…\" he growled, \"… I want you and that Russian to watch! Watch as I ruin your little family and make that brat into what he was expected to be! A weapon! To be used at our disposal!\" A wicked smile then appeared on his face, \"Imagine the potential Solo… A child assassin. Nobody will ever see it coming.\" \"Except UNCLE.\" Napoleon wasn't smiling anymore, but he wasn't going to let Sanders know that the words were getting to him, \"Hence the reason Waverly is currently suing you and being a pain in the ass.\" Sanders just smirked, glancing over at the guards who straightened up. \"Grab him and bring him to my office. I have no doubt your pet Russian is coming for you… it'll be easier for you all to be in the same room, hmmm?\" Napoleon remained silent. He didn't want to give Sanders the satisfaction of knowing that he was right. … \"Agent Solo!\" Waverly immediately got to his feet as the American was shoved into the room, \"Are you alright?\" It wasn't hard to spot the bruises. \"Been better.\" As the door locked behind him, Napoleon glanced at the camera in the corner of the room. \"I feel like we're not trusted.\" \"Hurtful isn't it.\" In the blind-spot, Napoleon spotted Gaby pulling a bunch of broken devices from her pocket and crushing them either further. 'Does the camera have sound?' he signed to her, sighing when she nodded, \"'Any word on my favourite Russian?' She gave him a reassuring smile… which didn't actually help. That smile usually meant that Peril was about to be in a whole lot of trouble. … She couldn't believe what she was seeing. Standing in the lobby, literally a few feet away from her desk, was a sobbing child. Clearly lost, he'd stumbled into the building, tears streaming down his face as he wailed in displeasure. He couldn't have been older than five. \"Mommy!\" he cried out, the sound echoing throughout the room, \"Mommy!\" Her heart panged with the sheer desperation in the child's voice, and even though she knew she wasn't technically allowed to, she couldn't help but make her way around to the front of her desk, moving to crouch in front of the poor child. \"What's wrong sweetie?\" she asked, keeping an eye out for a possible frantic parent, \"Are you lost?\" \"I-I-I-I turned to look at the pretty flowers and then Mommy was gone!\" There was a very beautiful florist nearby, it wasn't completely unreasonable to assume that a child would become distracted. Still… there was something off about all this. Her instincts said no, but that deep desire within her, the desire to be a mum and have children of her own, drowned out her instincts and she found herself going back to her desk and putting up the sign that sad 'Out for Lunch', making sure the phones went straight to the secondary desk upstairs, before taking the child's hand and gently leading him back outside, knowing that it was likely that the boy's mother was looking for him outside. But the streets outside were empty. The child suddenly broke free, racing towards an alleyway. In her haste to try and stop him, she didn't even think about the possible dangers… not until someone grabbed her wrist and pulled her into the darkness of the alleyway. \"Good work.\" A blonde-haired man praised the child, who was nervously biting on his lip, \"Sorry about this…\" he was addressing her now, \"… but we need pass.\" She glanced down at the pass that was hanging around her neck. \"I-I only have access to the bottom floor!\" she desperately pleaded, \"Storerooms and all that!\" The man smiled… if it was meant to be reassuring, it failed miserably. \"That's all I need.\" ….. With the poor woman unconscious (chloroform of course, not through violence… he's not a savage), and tied up in one of the dumpsters, Illya had donned the outfit of a basic cleaner, cap pulled low over his face. \"I'm coming to! I'm coming to!\" Illya turned to his son, frowning as the child stared up at him in defiance. \"No. You are not.\" \"But- \" \"You are too young.\" Illya gestured at the dumpster, \"You keep an eye on woman.\" Just as he turned to leave, Lyov spoke up again. \"You won't fit in the vents…. You're too big.\" \"… You do not know that that was what I was going to do.\" Lyov just smirked. It was then that Illya realised that the KGB would probably have given Lyov the exact blueprints of the CIA building, giving him the weak spots so that one day, if the CIA ever wanted him, Lyov would be the key to their un-doing. \"Okay…\" Illya whispered, \"… new plan.\"[Chapter 12] *6 months ago* \"Faster!\" the KGB agent growled, eyes narrowing at the sight of the child crawling through the tight space, \"Faster, or I start shooting!\" The Project tensed and finally reacted to the order, its movements speeding up as he barrelled through the rest of the course. Unlike his earlier days of training, he didn't bound over to the agent with a grin on his face, asking how he did. They seemed to have beaten that out of him. \"Another few months and you'll be ready.\" The agent sneered as the child frowned at the reminder of what his existence was actually for, \"Back to your room boy, and wait for future instructions. Tomorrow, we will work on your hacking skills.\" As the boy raced off, the agent couldn't stop a small smirk from appearing on his face. The Americans wouldn't know what hit them. ***End flashback****** Getting into the building was easy. The CIA clearly were lax when it came to the lowest level of their building. After all, you needed a special code to get to them. Or so they thought. \"Daddy?\" Lyov cautiously spoke up from within the cleaning trolley, covered with a large towel, \"What if I can't find Papa?\" Illya knew the child's chances were slim. They weren't completely aware of any defences the CIA would have in the vents, and with so many rooms and so many floors, Napoleon could have been in any one of them. If he was even in this building. Knowing that the store-rooms had no cameras in them, Illya, knelt down and pulled Lyov into his arms. \"You will find them….\" He gently reassured the child, \"… You want to know how I know that?\" Lyov nodded. \"Because you're our son.\" Illya shrugged, \"You've got your Papa's attention to detail and my superior spy skills- \" He ignored Lyov's little giggle at this. \"- and I honestly believe that you can do anything you put your mind to.\" Illya smirked, \"Including out-smarting Sanders and saving your Papa, agreed?\" Lyov nodded eagerly, a look of determination flashing across his face as he was lifted up into the air and held up near the vents. It only took a few seconds for all the screws to be undone, the cover to be removed and for Lyov to crawl inside, shuffling his way through the ducts. …. 'Can you guys hear that, or is it just me?' Napoleon signed, making sure to keep his hands low as to avoid the attention of the camera. 'No… hear what?' Gaby signed back, following Napoleon's gaze up to the ceiling. 'The squeaking… like little boots rubbing across metal.' … Lyov peeked through the gaps in the vents, frowning when he came across yet another empty room. They were nowhere to be found, and he was starting to panic slightly. Shuffling forwards a little more, he attempted to peer through the next vent. There! Gaby, the old man his parents worked with and Papa! His training quickly kicking in, Lyov glanced around the small area. They didn't seem to be hurt, the door was probably locked… and there was a security camera on the right corner opposite, thankfully pointing at the people in the room. There was no way he was getting them out of here, without being spotted by the camera. Shuffling backwards, he quickly though of another plan. Now… where was the security room again? …. Napoleon's eyes darted towards the vent as the squeaking and banging passed over them. 'Dammit Illya.' He thought to himself, 'I hope you know what you two are doing.' ….. Thankful that the security room wasn't too far away from the room that his Papa was locked in, Lyov continued forwards until he reached that particular vent. Sanders was in there. Remaining as still as possible, Lyov watched as Sanders leaned into one of the screens, before cursing and taking several steps back. \"They should have done something by now… something should have happened by now! Isn't there a sign of anything?\" One of the technicians shook his head. \"Nothing Sir… everything is proceeding as normal. Nothing out of the ordinary at all.\" There was a brief moment of silence, before Sanders cursed again and stormed out of the room. \"… How is he in charge again?\" Lyov didn't know the answer to this himself, allowing himself to breathe as he examined the situation. He needed at least one of them to leave… if one of them left, then the other would be too focused on the screens to notice Lyov enter the room. A quick nerve pinch and he was be out for just long enough for Lyov to hack the systems and set the camera on a loop. If he could remember how to hack the systems. … Illya glanced up at the vent and frowned. This was taking too long…. Lyov should have been back by now, with news of where Napoleon and the others were being held. No alarms had been sound, but that didn't mean that nobody had noticed that something was wrong. And something was definitely wrong. Taking a seat in the small room, Illya kept his eyes on the vents, counting to one thousand in as many languages as he could. …. 'Come on' Lyov thought to himself, glaring at the back of the two men's heads, 'Leave, move, do something!' When they didn't even flinch at the major brain signals that Lyov was shooting at them, he sighed under his breath and buried his face in his hands. Okay…. New plan. …. Illya's eyes darted up to the vents as there was a tapping on the metal, pushing himself to his feet when he spotted Lyov. \"What are you doing?\" he hissed, moving a little bit closer, \"Where is Napoleon?\" \"I can't get to him!\" Lyov whispered back, \"He's locked in a room and the camera-men won't leave!\" That was a problem. \"Alright…\" Illya sighed wearily, \"… If… If I can make distraction… then you can get them out?\" \"I-I think so, but- \" \"- Do it.\" Illya turned to face the other door, \"And Lyov, please be as fast as you can.\" ","Summary":" Okay, after finally getting the Man from UNCLE DVD, I decided to crack on with the Napollya series "},{"Movie":"Zombieland","Title":"Rule Number 5 - No Attachments","Author":"Mad Hatter - J","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12206026","Passage":"[Chapter 1] THERE SHE WAS JUST...HITTING GRENADES FROM A ROOFTOP. SINGING DOO-WA DIDDY DIDDY DUM DIDDY-DOO. FWHACK. BOOM. 10 seconds later. FWACK. BOOM. He was drawn to the sound. It was the only sign of other survivors he had heard since he had high-tailed it out of his hometown in Florida. Now heading through Louisiana, he had left the relative safety of his Cadillac Escalade to investigate the cause of the echoing explosions. It was coming from a nearby rooftop. He checked around a corner for any stray zombies and, finding none, moved towards the revolving doors that led to the building's lobby. The doorway was blocked by several corpses, many without heads. He attempted to push the doors, hoping that the force would dislodge the zombies, but to no avail. Taking another look at the problem, he decided to drag each body one-by-one to the street curb. It proved more effective than his initial attempts. The lobby floor, once white marble, was now a sea of red. Whether it was zombie or human juice, he couldn't tell. Never to be dissuaded, he slogged his way through it, kicking a severed hand from his path. An abandoned bloodied chainsaw lay on the ground nearby. The elevators inside were golden and splattered with blood. Switching his sawed-off shotgun to the other hand, he pressed the button. Raising his gun, battle ready, he soon found that it had been unnecessary. The elevator was empty. The cheerful music going up was oddly soothing. Reaching the rooftop, he approached the doorway to the outside world with caution. He was a touch trigger-happy at times, but he was not an idiot. Not a complete idiot. FWAK. BOOM. Amused laughter. A new sound added to the only two he could make out from the street below. Female laughter. The door cracked open an inch as it was nudged by the barrel of a gun. Slowly, quietly, he made his way towards the figure that stood near the edge of the rooftop. She leaned on a golf-club, hand shielding her eyes from the sun as she surveyed the damage of her game. Next to her lay a box of grenades. Grenade golf. She picked up another from the box and placed it on the ground. Quickly withdrawing the pin, she took her position and swung, the grenade flying into the empty parking lot below. \"Four!\" she called after it. He chuckled from his position nearby. She continued to survey the parking lot appearing oblivious to the noise behind her. But she had heard. She had heard him park his car a couple of blocks away. She had heard him trying to open the lobby doors and then dragging the bodies to the curb. She had heard him coming up the elevator. And she had heard his attempted sneak attack on her before he had even opened the door. If she had learnt anything from being the sole survivor in this town, it was vigilance. She would be dead had it not been for keen eyes and pricked ears. Or at least undead. Based on his actions so far, she could tell he was human and based on the fact that he hadn't shot her yet, she felt she could safely say he was no real threat. She turned her head slowly in his direction. He was surprised by her lack of concern. \"You play?\" It took him a minute to realize she was referring to golf. \"I prefer less peaceful sports,\" he told her, gesturing to his shotgun. \"Me too usually, but I had these...\" she picked up a grenade and positioned herself once more, \"...lying around. I couldn't really think of a more entertaining way to pass time.\" She swung and this time he was able to watch its journey to the lot below. He now saw what she was doing. In this game of golf you didn't aim for the hole. You aimed for the zombie. He laughed with his hands on his hips as one of them was thrown into the air by the force of the blast, leaving his leg behind from the knee down. \"Oh man...you do this all day?\" he grinned, shaking his head slowly as he stared down at two zombies that had just shown up, attracted to the noise. \"Not all day. I try to fit some sharpshooting into my routine. Any weapons. Any I can get my hands on around here. It makes for good practice. Gotta learn how to use whatever's on hand. My motto: Stay armed and you'll remain unharmed.\" He looked around the rooftop, spotting the sniper rifle and an assortment of other weapons, as well as what looked like a makeshift bed. \"You sleep up here?\" \"In my view, it's the best place. Zombies have never made it up here. Mainly, I think, because they don't know I'm up here. I've got a 360 birds-eye view of the town, it's elevated, cool, and at the end of the day it's kind of nice to lie down in the fresh air and watch the stars.\" \"Where do you get your supplies?\" He scanned the surrounding buildings for signs of a grocery outlet, but saw none. \"This used to be an office building. There's plenty of stuff lying around here, but I got most of it from a store on the way up here.\" \"You ain't a local?\" he asked. He was trying to remember the name of the town he had seen on the sign on his way in, but for the life of him could not recall. \"I meant up to the roof.\" They both suddenly realized that they neither knew one another, nor trusted one another and simultaneously drew weapons; he raising the shotgun and she pulling a machete from a sheath attached to her pants. \"Who are you?\" she asked. \"Who are you ?\" he replied They eyed each other with suspicion for a long while before he decided to break the silence. \"I don't much like giving out my name to strangers.\" \"Neither. Where'd you come from?\" \"Tallahassee.\" \"Well, Tallahassee, welcome to Winnfield, Louisiana.\" He thought he'd recognized the accent. Louisiana. So he had been driving in the right direction. \"Where're you headed?\" she asked later as they sat on the roof eating soup out of cups, which she'd warmed up with a fire she'd built inside. \"Not really sure. Thought I might get out and see the country while there isn't much traffic.\" She smiled and nodded while swallowing the last spoonful of food. The sun was just starting to set and the sky was an orangey-pink coloration. It would have looked slightly beautiful if it wasn't for the zombies below strolling aimlessly about. \"You plan on staying here for good?\" Tallahassee asked her. He dropped his empty cup onto the head of a zombie below, causing both of them to break into laughter as the mug shattered and the zombie twisted around in confusion. \"Hadn't planned that far ahead. It's worked for me so far though. Don't see any point in leaving now.\" It was kind of nice to have someone to talk to after being alone for so long, but she had survived perfectly well by herself up on top of this building; she didn't particularly feel like leaving. One of her own personal rules in times like these was to remain solo. One person was easier to look after then...well, more than one. Tallahassee took off his hat, dusted the brim with the smack of a hand, and replaced it. It was strange meeting someone who had become so at ease with the situation, as she had too. His outfit: jeans, boots, t-shirt, leather jacket and cowboy hat; it seemed practical but also casual. Her own outfit included similar garments; boots with faded black jeans, a black t-shirt and the necklace her mother had given her for her for her 8th birthday. She played with the crystal tied onto the piece of leather, glancing at Tallahassee's own necklaces. It was an interesting collaboration of adornments. \"I'll probably be moving on tomorrow, then. Places to go. Zombies to kill...\" he trailed off and then a thought struck him, \"Hey, you haven't come across any Twinkies 'round here have you?\" She thought for a moment and shook her head. \"Damn,\" he said with disappointment, \"I've been craving a Twinkie like a motherfucker.\" \"How about a hot chocolate?\" she offered. \"You got some?\" \"Yeah. I stocked up on the shit. It's like camping when you were a kid. Sipping cocoa, watching the stars...\" she paused, reminiscing about her childhood. \"Marshmallows?\" \"Sure,\" he smiled. It was kind of nice now that he came to think of it. So they sat up on the roof, drinking hot chocolate with marshmallows, tossing rocks down at the zombies below as a form of entertainment, guns and knives by their sides just in case. Just in case. A/N: Hey all, just a quick note. I wrote this series a long time ago and originally posted it on Quizilla. This is the first time I've opened it in years after deciding I wanted to share it again, and as far as I can tell, it's filled with cheesy puns, so I apologize in advance, haha. The titles of each chapter are a play on a classic rock song title, also cheesy puns. Any feedback is much appreciated. xx[Chapter 2] SHE'S GOT GUNS, SHE KNOWS HOW TO USE THEM By nightfall, they'd set up another bed for Tallahassee, while Winnfield readjusted her own to a level of relative comfort. She would be up as soon as the sun rose, just like any other day, when she would go for a morning run. Yes, run was the right word. Or perhaps shootout was a better one. Either way she would be up and that was what mattered. Their beds weren't too far apart, but had been made in such a way that hers was above his, closer to the ledge, whilst when lying down his feet would be pointing towards hers. Not too far apart, but not too close. It was a reflection of the way she lived; how she related to people both now and before. As she sat with her back against the ledge wall, she watched Tallahassee, who was staring up at the stars and sitting like a kid with his knees drawn up to his chest and his arms clasped around them. She smiled for the first time in a long time at something other than the annihilation of the living dead. As he caught her looking at him, Tallahassee gave her a funny look. \"What?\" \"I was never much of a people person, but it's kind of nice having someone else,\" Winnfield replied, looking down at her boots. \"Must be the company\", he joked. Smiling at each other for a moment, they became distracted by a loud 'bang' nearby. Tallahassee rose to his feet, shotgun in hand and approached the doorway he had entered through earlier. Winnfield picked up her own gun and followed suit in case he needed backup. He grabbed the doorhandle and looked at her. \"1...2...3!\" He pulled it open and they both aimed their guns into the stairwell. A pair of eyes stared back at them. But they weren't human eyes. The pair stepped back as it came out onto the rooftop. \"You gotta be kidding me,\" Tallahassee said. It was a goat. A goat of the undead. \"A motherfucking goat?,\" he cried out. Winnfield couldn't reply though; she was laughing too hard. He glanced at her as though she was crazy, which wasn't completely out of the question as she continued laughing whilst it came after her. It was making weird sounds, like a cross between a normal goat noise and a never-ending belch. Tallahassee shot it, hitting it in the side. It fell to the ground, but continued its attempts to get up and consume the flesh of the human it was pursuing. Winnfield took up her own weapon and shot it in the head, finishing the job. She was still chuckling slightly as Tallahassee reached her side. Then he began laughing. \"That was the most fucked up thing I've ever seen; and I've seen a lot of fucked up things.\" \"Oh, man. That goes to the top of my list,\" she sighed, sitting down once more with her back against the wall. Tallahassee returned to the doorway to both close and barricade it with the material at hand. \"What list?\" he asked her as he wedged a chair under the handle. \"I've made a mental list of all the crazy things I've witnessed so far. Number one used to be a zombie fighting an alligator.\" \"Now that would be pretty awesome,\" he agreed, settling back down onto his own bed, \"I thought goat were herbivores, anyway.\" \"That wasn't a goat. That was a zombie-goat. I think it's fair to say that zombie-goats eat flesh.\" \"Well it is now.\" They both laughed at this, and then lapsed into a comfortable silence. Tallahassee was lying on his stomach facing Winnfield. He was glad he'd stopped to investigate what the noises were, but he would definitely be leaving the next day. One of his own rules of survival was no attachments. She would stay living up here and he would be on his way. \"Well, time to hit the hay,\" Winnfield said as she lay down on her improvised bed. She took off her boots and laid back, hands behind her head, staring up at the sprawling sky. Sensing that it was the end of conversation until morning, Tallahassee did the same. But Winnfield wasn't there when he woke up the following morning. In a moment of panic, he leapt up and ran to the edge of the building, checking to make sure his car was still where he had parked it. It was. He let out a sigh of relief, but his relief was short-lived as he heard gunshots from the streets below. Winnfield was running fast, her head turned in the direction of the zombie behind her. This was part of her daily routine; a way to keep fit and clear out the zombies. She didn't want to stay on the rooftop all day, safe though it was. Whilst jogging around the town that was now considerably less populated, even by zombies, she would scout out food stores, pharmacies and hiding places in case she ever came to be in need of either of the three. This morning she had investigated yet another chain restaurant, finding nothing but zombies and rotting burgers. Another one of her rules, though it was one she hated to follow, was strictly no consumption of meat. This whole thing had started because of an infected burger and she hadn't come this far avoiding being bitten, just to bite into a zombifying burger. After the goat last night, she certainly wouldn't be taking her chances with any animal meat. She came to a halt and shot the head off of the gut-muncher behind her, just as another one sprinted towards her from ahead. BANG! Before she had even raised her gun, a shot rang out. Glancing up at the rooftop above, she spotted Tallahassee with her sniper rifle, looking down through the scope. He waved down at her and she smiled. \"What are you doing?\" he called down to her. \"Exercising!\" she shouted back. \"Oh. Okay!\" he yelled, standing up with the rifle in hand. He soon joined her on the street, hat, boots and shades back on. He was ready to leave. \"Going?\" she asked with what could have been a hint of disappointment. \"Afraid so.\" They both leant on their guns, barrels pointed towards the asphalt, standing in an awkward silence that hadn't been present the night before. \"Alright, well, bye,\" he quickly farewelled, walking off towards his car. \"Yep,\" she replied, with a sigh soft enough to avoid being heard. She watched him leave and gave a wave and a forced smile as he drove by. It was the first time she had ever wanted to break one of her own rules: No Attachments.[Chapter 3] EVERY TIME YOU GO AWAY YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME WITH YOU It was only six hours later that Tallahassee spotted the second survivor he had come across since leaving Florida. They were heading in the opposite direction, wheeling a luggage bag behind them. As soon as they saw his car – its appearance menacing with the snowplow attached to the front – they ducked behind a rusty motorcycle that had been left abandoned on the road. Tallahassee battered cars out of his path, trying to get closer. He brought the car to a halt and slowly stepped out, watching the other person who cowered behind their cover with a gun pointed at him. For a young guy, he sure looked a hell of a lot like a pussy. Throwing his sunglasses into the car behind him, Tallahassee brought out a gun of his own and, after locking it into place, pointed it right back at the boy, who was now standing in a defensive pose. He was literally shaking in his boots. It was a good old Mexican standoff. Tallahassee was considering shooting him right there on the spot, but the kid's absolutely pathetic appearance appealed to the very small amount of decency left in him. As the boy raised his hand with a hitchhiking gesture, Tallahassee lowered his weapon and nodded for him to get in the car. Before he turned around, Tallahassee kicked the raised motorcycle back to its original position on the ground; a seemingly pointless act of destruction that nonetheless pleased him. \"Thank-you,\" the kid said, throwing his bag into the vehicle. As he climbed into the car, he looked into the backseat. Tallahassee observed him with a slight frown. \"What are you looking for?\" \"Nothing, I just have this list,\" the kid replied. He was already getting on Tallahassee's nerves. \"There's nothing back there but my duffel bag,\" he reassured him. The kid nodded in a kind of nervous way, and sat forward in his seat. \"Uh, what's your name?\" \"Stop. No names. I don't want us getting too familiar with each other,\" Tallahassee told him. He took out a large hunting knife from the sheath on his pants so that he could sit a little more comfortably, alarming the kid in the process. Ignoring his fear, Tallahassee placed the knife on top of the storage compartment between the seats and reached for his whiskey bottle. \"Careful, you nearly knocked your alcohol over with your knife\", the kid said, with cautious sarcasm. Ignoring him yet again, Tallahassee picked up a shot glass. \"Oh, no, it's okay. You don't have too...\" the kid began, but he was cut off. \"So, where you headed?\" \"Uh, Columbus, you?\" he replied as he watched the man pour out a drink. \"Tallahassee,\" he replied, handing the shot glass over. They toasted to nothing before drinking. Well, Tallahassee did anyway. He didn't notice the kid toss the contents of his glass out the window. \"Mmm,\" the kid smiled. \"More?\" Tallahassee offered. \"Uh, no. One for me. One and done I always say. Well, I said that once.\" Tallahassee drank another mouthful. \"You know, Tallahassee and Columbus are both east,\" the kid went on. \"So?\" Tallahassee asked, despite knowing where it was the kid was heading with this. \"So, Tallahassee, do you wanna stick together? At least for a while?\" he suggested. Tallahassee smiled, knowing the kid needed him a hell of a lot more than he needed the kid. \"Here's the deal, Columbus,\" he began, \"I'm not that easy to get along with, and I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch. So, I'll give this relationship 'til Texarkana.\" \"Texarkana? Really? You'll take me as far as that?\" Columbus replied, seeming quite happy whilst he buckled up, but Tallahassee was sensing a touch of sarcasm in his answer. \"You're a pappy little spitfuck, aren't ya?\" Columbus smiled in response and added, \"You know, you really should buckle up. For safety reasons.\" \"I can already tell you are gonna get on my nerves\" Tallahassee groaned. They took off down the road, dodging cars in their path. They had been on the road for about ten minutes before Tallahassee brought the car to a halt. Columbus eyed him nervously; surely he wasn't kicking him out already. But Tallahassee said nothing to him as he got out of the car. Columbus watched him walk out towards a ditch down the side of the road. He jumped out of the car to follow him. \"Uh, what are we doing here?\" \"We're taking a look. It's a goddamn hostess truck,\" Tallahassee replied, as though it was the most obvious answer. \"Yeah, I can see that. So what?\" \"I could really use a Twinkie.\" Tallahassee was about to make his way down the slope when he noticed Columbus looking hesitant. \"You coming?\" \"Ah, yes,\" Columbus replied, remaining where he stood. Tallahassee waited, and then stared at him with a disturbed expression as the kid started to do stretches and jumping-jacks. \"Are you fucking with me?\" he asked in all seriousness. \"No. You should actually limber up as well,\" Columbus suggested, ignoring Tallahassee's amused laughter. \"I don't believe in it. You ever see a lion limber up before it takes down a gazelle?\" Columbus considered this and then proceeded to walk down the hill towards the truck. He would have to take his chances. Gun resting on his shoulder, he waited while Tallahassee knocked on the truck's back doors. There was no reply; no growl of undead hunger. Drawing out his own sawed-off shotgun, Tallahassee proceeded to pull open the doors. Packets and packets off cakes came tumbling out, but, sadly, not the sort he was looking for. \"Snowballs? Snowballs! Where's the fucking Twinkies?!\" He accentuated his cursing with a swift kick at the packaged sweets. The look of devastation on his face said it all. \"I like Snowballs,\" Columbus replied through a mouthful of the cake. Tallahassee threw him a dark look, \"I hate coconut. Not the taste, the consistency.\" His angry breathing was starting to alarm Columbus. \"This Twinkie thing? It ain't over yet,\" the determined man declared. He returned to the car in a huff. Columbus, meanwhile, took the opportunity to grab a few packets before they left. The way he saw it, any food was good food. As he walked back up the hill, he felt an unavoidable need for a bathroom break. \"Uh, this may be a bad time, but I need to take the browns to the super bowl!\" he called up to Tallahassee. \"Oh really?\" came the reply. They came across a roadside restroom a few miles down the road from where they had found the Hostess truck. While Columbus entered the bathroom on high alert, Tallahassee remained out the front by the car, knife in hand and practising his killing moves. He was still pissed off about the continued absence of Twinkies in his life. To take his mind of this, he reached into his pocket for some gum, only to feel something pointy. \"What the...?\" He pulled the small object out. It was attached to a thin length of leather. \"You've got to be kidding me.\" Winnfield's necklace. As was custom with him, whenever he came across an interesting piece of adornment, he wore it himself. So seeing it as a parting gift, he tied the length of leather around his neck. Moving down the highway again some 15 minutes later, the duo reached a burnt out car in the middle of the road, blocking their pathway to some distant and imagined Eden. Tallahassee pulled over. \"Alright, I'll push, you steer,\" he told the boy. Continuing on their way, they began a conversation that Columbus was having a tiny bit of trouble following. \"The last time I laid… pipe?\" Tallahassee sighed. \"No, the last time you went twenty-toes? Put Percy in the playpen?\" \"Who's Percy?\" Tallahassee tried a few more analogies before Columbus finally understood what it was they were talking about. \"Oh, you mean made love?\" \"Well,\" Tallahassee considered, \"Just sex, really.\" \"Uh...\" Columbus knew he would have to come up with a story. And fast. Any form of approval from Tallahassee depended on it. He managed to fabricate a fairly believable story involving an abandoned Fed-Ex truck and a girl named Beverly Hills, before turning the question back on the original asker. \"Me? Well, I...I...\" Tallahassee didn't really seem to want to say, but they both quickly became distracted by a zombie that sat in the middle of the road ahead, chewing on some poor guy's intestines. \"Oh my God,\" Columbus said, taking in the gory sight, \"It makes you sick. It really makes you sick.\" Tallahassee just stared at him in disbelief of his girlish whining, and Columbus went on, \"It makes you sad. It makes you wish that, you know, if you could just go back to the way things were, you'd be out in the backyard trying to catch fireflies...yet instead, this.\" They both glanced back towards the zombie, and it looked towards them suddenly. Not towards them, exactly, but just beyond them. That was when they heard a roaring coming down the highway towards them. Turning in their seats they spotted a speeding motorbike. \"Either that's another survivor, or the zombies have taught themselves to ride bikes,\" Tallahassee joked. Columbus smiled but the worry was still evident on his features. He watched as the bike sped towards them and, as it went past the car, spotted longish strawberry blonde hair billowing out of the back of the helmet. Tallahassee narrowed his eyes as though experiencing some sort of recognition. \"You know them?\" Columbus asked. \"Yeah, I think I do.\" The bike kept going, slamming wheel-first into the zombies face, and splattering blood everywhere. Tallahassee laughed and Columbus narrowed his eyes, concerned by the fact that he found something like that funny. He was beginning to see that Tallahassee had a sick sense of humour. The bike made a u-turn and headed back towards them, pulling to a halt a few feet away. The rider stepped off. Removing the helmet, a pretty face was revealed; big blue eyes staring back at them, skin lightly tanned from a life spent mainly outdoors. She cut an athletic figure, which Columbus guessed was the result of escaping and killing zombies. She wore a t-shirt of military green under a black motorcycle jacket. Her jeans were black and faded and, strapped to her thigh much like Tallahassee wore, was a hunting knife in a sheath. She climbed off the bike and came towards them with a broad, confident smile. \"That you Tallahassee?\" she called to him. \"Sure is!\" he called out the window. He hopped out of the car and Columbus watched them both pause awkwardly, as though not really surely of an appropriate way to greet each other. They settled on a handshake. \"What're you doing out here? I thought you said you were staying back in Winnfield.\" \"Yeah, well. It seems I lost a treasured item of mine. Have you seen it?\" she replied, but she was smiling and had already spotted it around his neck. \"Oh, well, I...I thought it might have been a...I don't know,\" Tallahassee said, but she stopped him a shake of the head. \"Never mind,\" she said, \"It gave me an excuse to come looking for you.\" They stood looking at one another for a moment before Tallahassee broke the gaze by nodding over at her bike; a nice looking Harley. \"Where you headed now?\" \"Actually\", she explained, \"the bike's just about out of gas. I was hoping I'd stumble across some nice fellow who'd offer me a lift.\" \"Well, you probably won't come across someone like that for a long time, so you might just have to put up with us.\"[Chapter 4] HI NICE TO EAT YOU Winnfield was very similar to Tallahassee in some ways. She had the same sense of humour, the same strong desire to kill the undead and, as it would later turn out, the same taste in music and film. But before they drove on, after she ran the face off of a zombie with her motorcycle, she ran back to her bike to retrieve a large duffel bag. At first glance Columbus had guessed it contained her travel items; clothes, toiletries, food and water, then he noticed that some areas of the bag were pointy. As Winnfield saw him staring at the unusual corners, she explained to him, unzipping the bag as she did so, that she was collecting novels. It seemed an unusual hobby to take up in Zombieland, but he could see where she was coming from; she wanted to preserve some small part of what civilization there used to be, before all the nothingness. She was like the more educated version of Tallahassee; a kind of Tallahassee 2.0. As the threesome continued down the highway towards their own personal destinations, they settled into a comfortable conversation. Columbus felt a lot more at ease with another person in the car. \"So you're from Louisiana?\" he asked Winnfield, who was riding shotgun. Tallahassee had pretty much threatened to leave him on the side of the road – not necessarily alive, either – if he didn't move into the backseat. \"Yeah\" she quickly replied to him, but then turned to Tallahassee, \"Why are you going back this way? I thought you were heading west.\" \"I came from out west. There's nothing out there. I doubled back after I left your little set-up.\" \"He's hunting for Twinkies,\" Columbus explained. Tallahassee gave him a dark look which quickly shut him up. \"I figured that when you asked me if I'd seen any. Still haven't I'm afraid,\" Winnfield told them. \"Well there's a town coming up in a few miles and there ought to be a grocery store there,\" Tallahassee announced. \"Really? You, uh, you wanna stop?\" Columbus asked with a hint of fear. \"What's wrong, kid? You scared?\" Winnfield asked with a slick smile, but after he gave her an unconvincing shake of the head, she exchanged her smile for a look of sympathy. \"Nah, it's okay if you are. I was when this first started. I got used to it.\" Tallahassee, as Columbus would have guessed, was shaking his head. \"I wasn't scared.\" \"You want a fucking medal?\" Winnfield asked him with mock sincerity. He gave her the same look he had given Columbus only moments earlier, but it seemed friendlier when directed at her. Columbus glanced from one to the other and then rested his gaze upon Winnfield's bag. She looked back at him. \"You can have a look if you like.\" With strange level of curiosity, he looked through the various volumes contained in the duffel bag. It ranged from Stephen King and Anne Rice to Dickens, Voltaire and Sophocles. An interesting collection, most of which looked as though they had been read a number of times. He opened up a copy of The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, and glanced up at the owner. She sat smiling calmly, resting her elbow on the open window. Every now and then Tallahassee would glance over at her as though making sure that she was still there, that he hadn't just imagined picking her up. Columbus wouldn't have thought of her as the type to read this kind of material. \"You know, I did have this kind of rule that I wouldn't go out of my way to get to know anyone that I met who wasn't trying to consume my flesh, but since everyone's being so quiet, I say to hell with it,\" Winnfield said, breaking the silence. \"What? You wanna play 'I Spy'?\" Tallahassee joked, not very pleased with the idea. \"No. I had something in mind that'll help us get to know each other.\" \"A threesome?\" Tallahassee joked again, only this time it sounded a little less of a joke. \"Like 20 questions or something?\" Columbus asked. \"Yeah, something like that,\" Winnfield replied. \"Oh, great! I like this sort of thing. It helps break the ice, you know. Get rid of the awkwardness,\" Columbus smiled, showing enthusiasm for the idea. \"You think it would add to the awkwardness if I shoved this shotgun barrel up your ass?\" Tallahassee asked him, making a thrusting motion with the sawn-off. \"Probably,\" Columbus replied. \"Enough flirting,\" Winnfield jumped in, \"Come on, Hass. It won't kill you.\" \"No, but it might make me want to kill someone.\" \"Alright...\" Ignoring his negative response, she began thinking up some questions to ask. \"Oh, I've got one!\" Columbus said. \"Well, go on.\" \"Would you rather be stranded on an island alone, or with someone you hate?\" he asked. \"Alone,\" Tallahassee replied straight away. \"But what if the person grew on you?\" Columbus asked him. \"They haven't yet\" he said back, glaring directly at him via the rear-view mirror. Winnfield chuckled. \"Would you rather lose your legs, or lose your arms?\" she asked. \"Well it wouldn't matter if a zombie chewed 'em off, because you'd be dead anyway,\" Tallahassee pointed out. \"So then let's say you lost them some other way.\" \"That's a tough one,\" Columbus frowned, taking it very seriously, \"I mean, I could say arms because at least you could still run, but how would you open doors? And if you only had arms, you could open doors, but think of how slowly you'd move.\" \"Alright, I got one,\" Tallahassee announced, \"Would you rather have sex with someone you really hate or screw an animal?\" Columbus looked at him with a combination of disgust and disapproval. \"Sex with someone I hate. Isn't that the best kind? When you're just like 'I freaking hate you so much I just want to screw your brains out'.\" Tallahassee stared at her. \"You have got to be the greatest woman I have ever met.\" She smiled and looked back at Columbus, who was yet to reply. \"Yeah. Someone I hate,\" he replied, a little too fast. \"Aniphile,\" Tallahassee muttered just loud enough for them to hear. \"Speaking of animals,\" Winnfield said suddenly, \"How about that goat?\" Tallahassee laughed, \"Oh yeah. I nearly forgot about that.\" \"Goat?\" Columbus frowned. \"Ever see a goat trying to get a mouthful of human flesh?\" Tallahassee asked him. The kid's eyes widened at the thought and he shook his head. \"That was hilarious,\" Winnfield reminisced. \"Not so much for the goat though,\" Tallahassee pointed out.[Chapter 5] YOU'RE SIMPLY THE BEST... BETTER THAN THE INFECTIOUS A few abandoned cars remained in the parking lot as they finally came across an average-looking supermarket: Blaine's Grocers . Tallahassee parked close to the entrance, backing the Escalade up so that the trunk faced the electrically-powered doors. Although Winnfield was usually a fairly optimistic woman, she knew that it was only days now until the power would shut itself off for good. Until then, they could make the most of frozen foods like ice-cream, lighting at night time that made the living-dead easier to spot, and cooking appliances as opposed to using a fire, which made her feel a bit like a cave-woman. \"I'm gonna find me a Twinkie,\" Tallahassee informed them with a determined grin. Columbus didn't seem all too happy with having to stop for this sole reason. But by now he knew it was better to humor the man than to aggravate him; especially since Tallahassee didn't seem to have a problem with expressing his anger in inventively-violent ways. And as if to prove Columbus' point, Tallahassee opened the back of the car to reveal an assortment of garden implements and sporting equipment; from garden-shears, a pickaxe and a shovel, to a baseball bat and a hockey stick, as well as a couple of cans of gasoline. Whether those were intended for the car or if Tallahassee had other things in mind for them, Columbus wasn't sure. \"You are a scary man,\" he commented. Glancing at the girl next to him, Columbus initially thought that she too looked disturbed by the collection, then he realized that she was simply deep in thought as to which of the potential weapons she would choose. Tallahassee took out a pickaxe, considered it for a moment, then threw it back in the car, picking up the garden shears and snapping them open and closed a couple of times before sliding them into the back of his jeans for later use. He then selected a metal baseball bat before turning to Winnfield. \"You want anything?\" he asked her. She surveyed the items with careful consideration. \"Shovel,\" she finally decided, \"and that pickaxe.\" \"Are you going prospecting?\" Columbus muttered as Tallahassee passed Winnfield the requested tools. She gave Columbus a confident smile and turned to face the supermarket. \"Prospecting for zombie-gold\", she said. Tallahassee led the charge after grabbing his third and final weapon of choice; a banjo. Stepping into the store eagerly, with Columbus to his left and Winnfield to his right, he paused at the front of the store, allowing them a view of all the aisles. Just as everything fell silent, Tallahassee began plucking at the banjo; a tune that Winnfield recognized from Deliverance . It was the one from the particularly unsettling scene when the audience begins to realize that mayhap somethin' ain't right with the locals. It was a fitting song, to say the least. It wasn't long before one of their own disgruntled locals, a particularly large zombie, came waddling towards them. Taking off the banjo, Tallahassee held it upside down, wielding it like a bat, ready to swing. \"I'll go scout out the Twinkies,\" Winnfield told them. \"O- KAY!\" Tallahassee replied, the last half of the word strained by the amount of force he put into his swing. He took the zombie down like it wasn't even the 500 pounds that it was. Winnfield found the right aisle, but failed to come up with the goods. It looked like they had all either been sold or stolen. She did, however, find plenty of Hostess CupCakes and Sno Balls. Looking around, she spotted an empty shopping basket and began loading it with various items. \"No good on the Twinkies, Hass!\" she called out. \"Shit fuckin' damn it!\" she heard him curse. \"You could always check the back,\" Columbus pointed out to him. Winnfield continued making her way down the aisles, making the most of their trip to the grocery store. They might as well stock up on food and bottled water. She had reached the liquor section and, after deciding that Columbus probably didn't drink, began wondering which beer to get for Tallahassee. She had seen his bottle of Kentucky bourbon in the car, but at the end of the day beer always seemed the safe bet. As she settled on a case of Miller's, she heard a shriek from behind her. Sliding the beer across the floor, she gripped the shovel and turned to face the zombie that had been hiding in the wine section. It took a few steps, considering her whilst blood pooled from its decaying mouth. \"Winnfield! Where are ya?\" Tallahassee yelled from somewhere back in the main part of the store. \"Liquor!\" she called back. She started walking towards the bloodied man, unaware that Columbus had just found his way into the section. He watched as she swung the shovel blade into the zombies face, sending it onto its back. His eyes widened as she positioned the tip of the blade onto its neck and proceeded to jump onto the shovel, decapitating the flesh-hungry fiend. Scooping up the head with the gardening tool, Winnfield flung it at him, laughing playfully. \"Whoa! What the- Are you insane?\" he protested as he quickly dodged it. She breathed out heavily through her lips and leaned on the shovel. Shrugging, she smiled. \"I don't see a lot of Twinkie-huntin' going on here,\" Tallahassee commented as he walked up. He had witnessed the head-throwing incident and had gotten a pretty good laugh out of it. \"What's with the basket, anyway?\" \"Every good road trip needs snacks\", Winnfield told him, \"and I thought you might like some beer to go with your Twinkies.\" She motioned to the case of beer that now sat close to where Columbus was standing. Tallahassee grinned and nodded. \"I like the way you think.\" He picked up the box and passed it to Columbus, but before he could protest Tallahassee gave him a look that said 'One word of complaint and I'll shoot you in the foot. Make that both feet'. Winnfield tossed her shovel down and rested the pickaxe on her shoulder, the basket of goodies in her opposite hand. \"Don't worry, kid. I've got your back,\" she reassured him. Somehow he wasn't comforted by that. \"I'm Twinkie the Kid and I'm goin' to Twinkie Town,\" Winnfield overheard Tallahassee mutter to himself. She shook her head at his obsession, but she couldn't help but smile a little. It was almost cute. She noticed that he didn't have any weapons left besides the usual sawed-off shotgun, and found out why, as they passed the body of a very obese zombie who had come to a similar, decapitated end as her own 'friend'. Just as she started humming the tune to Dean Martin's 'Ain't That a Kick in the Head', quietly singing a few lines every now and then, they came to an abrupt halt. Checking to see why they weren't still making their way to the back of the store, she was surprised to see a distressed young woman standing near the door to the storage area. Tallahassee glanced back at Winnfield and Columbus, checking their responses. Winnfield nodded that they should lend whatever help they could, but when they turned back to look at the girl, she was already heading through the door. They followed her, but Columbus hesitated outside the doorway. \"I'll catch up,\" he told Winnfield as she turned to see what he was doing. Grabbing an empty box from the ground nearby, he opened the emergency EXIT door and wedged the carton against it to make sure it would stay open. If the need arose, they would have an easy escape route. \"It's my sister,\" the girl was telling Winnfield and Tallahassee, distress evident in her voice, \"She's been bitten.\" Winnfield winced and observed the little girl before them, who sat up on a table looking scared. The infected bite was clear on her forearm and, by the look of it, had been there for a few hours by then. Tallahassee gave a sympathetic nod of understanding. In a case like this, when it was caught early, there was only one humane thing that they could do; kill the person before they tried to eat them. \"How do you want to do this?\" Winnfield asked gently. The girl looked like she couldn't even comprehend the solution. Hearing footsteps behind them, they turned their heads. Columbus approached the group, and could tell by the looks on their faces that whatever the problem was, it wasn't good. \"They're sisters,\" Tallahassee filled him in, \"The little one's been bit. Act normal, try not to freak her out.\" He turned back to the two young girls, \"Columbus, this is Wichita and Little Rock.\" \"So, you did all this for a Twinkie?\" the older sister asked Columbus. \"Oh, no no no. He did,\" he nodded in Tallahassee's direction. \"I'm just kind of like a Sancho Panza character,\" he told her. She didn't get the reference, so Columbus jumped back in, changing the subject. \"Um, I don't think she has long to live,\" he whispered. \"Yeah, she doesn't,\" Winnfield said in a way that was so definite they all turned to look at her, \"I was with my brother when this started. He got bit too, and I was stupid enough to let him live until he turned. It's much less painful for everyone if you end it now.\" She swallowed, her throat making an audible click, and looked away. \"We already discussed it. We were just looking for a way out,\" Wichita explained. \"What? No. She's still just a little girl,\" Columbus protested. He glanced at Tallahassee, but found him gazing at Winnfield with what might have been concern. \"Don't talk about me like I'm not here!\" They all turned their attention to the infected person-of-interest. \"Look, kid,\" Winnfield began, taking a couple of steps towards her, the pickaxe she was holding dangling beside her leg, \"You're really sick. And if we don't do something now, you're gonna end up like one of those things out there. You don't want that, do you?\" Little Rock shook her head. \"Yeah, but your sister wants us to–\" Columbus said. \"It's not her decision,\" Little Rock told him before he could finish, \"It's mine. And I've already made up my mind.\" \"We already said goodbye, but we didn't have a gun,\" Wichita said. \"Well, we don't know that there's definitely no cure, right?\" Columbus reasoned. \"You're just gutless!\" Little Rock cried, \"Let him do it.\" She nodded to Tallahassee, who looked very uneasy about being given the job of child executioner. Columbus turned around and walked a few paces away, blocking his ears with his index fingers. He didn't need to witness something like this. Winnfield remained by Tallahassee's side, but was ready to shut her eyes the moment he put his finger on the trigger. He raised the gun slowly. \"Wait, wait! Let me do it,\" Wichita pleaded. She was already crying, but was still able to take the gun and point it at her little sister. Checking that both barrels of the shotgun were loaded, she cocked the gun and took a deep breath. They waited for a few moments, but when it seemed she couldn't bring herself to do it, Tallahassee stepped forward. \"You need some help?\" \"Now that you mention it...\" Wichita swung around, all traces of grief now gone from her face as she pointed the weapon at its previous owner. Tallahassee raised his hands in surprise. \"We'll take your weapons, your car keys and your ammunition.\" She smiled sweetly. Her little sister, an apparent hypochondriac, jumped down from the table to join her. \"And if you got it, sugarless gum.\" \"What the fuck?\" Tallahassee frowned. Winnfield raised the pickaxe slowly in a menacing way, to rest it on her shoulder, but she knew it was no use even trying anything against a shotgun. Columbus handed his shotgun over to Little Rock, who stopped in front of Winnfield, considered her weapon, and then decided she didn't want it. \"Wa...Wait, why are you guys doing this?\" Columbus asked. Winnfield was sort of amazed that, even now, Columbus still seemed to have some sort of faith in other humans. \"Well, better you make the mistake of trusting us, than we make the mistake of trusting you,\" Wichita replied, as if to prove Winnfield's thought. The two sisters quickly exited, leaving the other three survivors stunned by the sudden betrayal. Winnfield threw her basket of food on the ground. \"No use taking that anymore. A roadtrip's not the same without a car.\" Tallahassee grunted and stalked out of the room, back towards the main entrance. They were forced to watch as the girls left in their car, with their equipment. And, although they had been 'kind' enough to toss their bags out on the road, Little Rock still had the nerve to wave goodbye to them as they drove away. \"Why didn't you say somethin' to them?\" Tallahassee asked Winnfield once the Cadillac had disappeared from their sight, \"Reason with them, or something?\" \"What? You think just because we're girls we'd have some sort of sisterhood bond?\" \"Well...\" \"Oh yeah. 'Hey girls, we all have vaginas here. Can't we reach some sort of agreement? Maybe we can be BFF's and go shopping together and...and paint each other's toenails.' \" \"Alright, alright, I get your point.\" \"I can't believe they just did that,\" Columbus muttered. \"Kid, the world didn't get any less hostile after everyone started killing each other. It's basically the same place, only with less crappy TV shows. Come to think of it, if there's a TV company still running somewhere, you can bet they'll be developing a new reality show; something along the lines of Extreme Makeover: Zombie Edition.\" \" Zombies Gone Wild,\" Columbus suggested. \" Dancing with the Zombies .\" \" Pimp My Zombie.\" Winnfield started laughing and Columbus managed a smile. \" America's Got Zombies, \" she said in-between chuckles. \"Or Man vs. Zombie, \" Tallahassee mused, \"I'd watch that. Hell, I could be in that.\" They allowed themselves a moment to laugh before collecting their things from the side of the road. The only things they had left to defend themselves were Winnfield's pickaxe and a large rock that Tallahassee had found on the road. And since they were all a long while away from their desired destinations, without a working car in sight... \"Looks like we're hoofing it.\"[Chapter 6] WE CAN SHOOT IF WE WANT TO, WE CAN LEAVE OUR FRIENDS BEHIND 'CAUSE OUR FRIENDS ARE DEAD, AND IF THEY'RE NOT DEAD, WELL THEY'RE STILL A WASTE OF TIME Winnfield stood in awe of the massive metal machine. It was perfect. \"God, can you imagine?\" she muttered to herself. \"A tank?\" Tallahassee stood behind her, his eyes considering the broken down heap of junk. \"Now, if the people driving this thing couldn't use it to take down zombies, what makes you think that you could?\" \"I was just saying...It would be awesome.\" \"It would, but good luck gettin' around those tight suburban corners.\" He moved his hands as though driving a car, as he said this. \"Who needs corners when you have a tank?\" He nodded as he considered her point. Remaining a spectator to the conversation, Columbus thought back to the new pair of survivors they had crossed paths with only hours ago. Despite being weapon and car-jacked by the two, the older of two sisters, Wichita, had caught his attention and now he couldn't stop thinking about her. Aside from Winnfield, she had been the first girl he'd seen since his neighbour had taken shelter in his apartment; only to turn into a zombie and try to eat him. He wasn't having the best luck with women. Plus, he couldn't see himself starting that kind of relationship with Winnfield. She was probably too old for him and he assumed that Tallahassee would probably shoot him – or in their current gun-less situation, clobber him to death with the rock he was holding – if he were to show that kind of inclination towards her. The first young woman he comes across who seems potential girlfriend material and she leaves him for dead. He broke from his thoughts as Winnfield and Tallahassee made their way back towards him, Winnfield laughing at something Tallahassee had said. \"Find anything yet, kid?\" she asked him. He shook his head. \"Ah, well. It's not that bad walking. A little slow, sure, but- Whoa, look at that!\" she interrupted herself. She jogged over to a spot a few metres away from them. Catching up to her, Columbus spotted the body of a zombie with a foot clenched in its mouth, stuck under the tires of a small Daewoo. \"Hey, that kind of reminds me of something,\" Columbus began once they continued walking down the road, \"I saw this guy, a little while back, riding one of those 'serious-Tour-de-France' bikes, and he's peddling and the zombies head is like caught in the gear. You know, with the hair in the chain just like going around\". He made a circular motion with his index finger. \"That is cool\", Tallahassee laughed, \"but I once saw this construction worker, I shit you not, and he's on a steamroller. You ever roll a tube of toothpaste up from the bottom?\" \"Yeah, I always roll it up from the bottom\", Columbus replied as if it was a stupid question. \"Well, the zombie's head is the cap.\" Winnfield's expression flickered somewhere between amusement and disgust. \"Are you one of those guy's that always tries to one-up everyone else's story?\" Columbus asked. \"No,\" Tallahassee defended, \"I knew a guy way worse at that than me.\" \"Whatever, let's just find a car.\" \"Oh yeah, which reminds me. I never had headaches like this until your ass came on board. See Winnfield here? Quiet. Smart. Knows how and when to keep her yap-trap snapped...\" She looked over at him as he said this then exchanged glance with Columbus before facing forward once more. She was beginning to feel sort of useless; without any guns to shoot, no zombies to dispose of, or at least something to lug around with her, she was almost bored. Tallahassee was carrying her bag for her, having unloaded his own onto Columbus and all she had to carry was that same old pick-axe from earlier. And it wasn't even that heavy. \"...I mean, do what you want with a man, but do not fuck with his Cadillac.\" \"Hey, there's a nice minivan.\" Columbus stopped near the dark-green vehicle before beginning to approach it for a closer look. As long as it wasn't harbouring its previous driver, previously- living driver, there was a fair chance that they could get it running and be on the road within a few minutes time. But good-condition or not, it was still no Cadillac. Tallahassee finally found some use for his rock, throwing it so hard through the back window that it managed to make it through to the other side. Spotting a crowbar by the van's front tire, he climbed up onto the bonnet and got to work on the other windows, the lights and whatever else he found smash-worthy. Winnfield stood looking-on, with her arms folded across her stomach and that little, amused smile back on her face. Beside her, Columbus waited for the tantrum to be over, checking his watch and glancing around for something more interesting to look at. \"I want my Caddy back!\" Tallahassee cried whilst taking out the taillights, \"Stupid bitches!\" \"Better out than in,\" Winnfield said to Columbus. He could only agree with her, hoping that this release of steam would stop Tallahassee from committing any heinous acts of aggression against him. \"He looks like a Neanderthal,\" Columbus commented. Tallahassee tossed the crowbar into the air behind him and jumped down. \"Yeah,\" Winnfield agreed absent-mindedly, with her eyes on the man in a different way. \"I think I pulled something,\" Tallahassee groaned, clutching the back of his thigh. \"Feel better, though?\" Winnfield asked, clapping him gently on the shoulder. \"Much,\" he told her. They walked on for a couple of metres before it became apparent that Tallahassee was not about to let go what had happened. \"You think the three of us are smart enough to come up with a con like that?\" Winnfield and Columbus exchanged doubtful looks. \"Oh, man. You hesitated,\" Tallahassee caught on. \"I don't understand people sometimes. It's not like we have to compete for anything. It's a giant free-for-all now.\" \"Did you ever see Dawn of the Dead ?\" Columbus asked, \"People started turning against each other 'cause they're scared. I mean, how much do you really trust us?\" Tallahassee looked at her, waiting to hear her reply. She considered him, then smiled. \"I trust you guys. It's like war; you got my back, I got yours, no man gets left behind. I guess it's just easier to stick with what and who you know than to take a chance.\" And sometimes it turns out better to take that chance , she wanted to add, glancing at Tallahassee again. As he turned his head to look at her, she flicked her eyes down to the road, pretending not to notice his smirk. \"Question: Is it better to be smart? Or lucky?\" he suddenly asked. He took off at a fast jog, Winnfield not far behind and Columbus trying his best to keep up with both Tallahassee's duffle-bag and his own suitcase in tow. They were moving into a more suburban-looking part of the town, near houses and parks. Winnfield spotted what Tallahassee had been talking about and was now grinning. Slowing to a walk, Winnfield approached the big yellow Hummer eagerly, but Tallahassee put his arm out to halt her. \"Whoa-o-o,\" he stopped. Approaching the driver's side door cautiously, taking whatever chance he to act as 'the big-brave-man', he grabbed the doorhandle and pulled it open, revealing two severed hands still attached to the steering wheel. \"Heh-heh.\" He took a handkerchief from his pocket and attempted to pry the rigor mortised-hand off of its final position, but found that it had a rather tight grip. When he finally managed to remove it, he stepped back and showed it to Columbus, forcing up its middle finger at him. \"That's nice,\" Columbus frowned. Winnfield took the opportunity to reach in past Tallahassee in order to remove the second hand. It came off just as smoothly as the first. Holding it under the wrist with a piece of cloth she'd found on the ground, she examined it curiously before turning to the man next to her. \"High-five!\" he said. They slapped the pieces of dead-flesh together, then tried to get them to do fist-bumps. \"Hey, um, when you guys are done playing with some dead guy's hands, do you think maybe we could go?\" Columbus asked. Winnfield turned to give him a sheepish smile, but Tallahassee seemed to think it a good opportunity to use one of the hand's fingers to poke her in the cheek. She slapped it away and rubbed savagely at skin. \"That is so gross! You bastard!\" He dodged the hand that she threw at him and Columbus continued to look on, slowly growing used to the pair's morbid antics. By the end of it, both parties were laughing like kids, but that wasn't the last of what their new vehicle had in store for them. Realizing that he was going to be riding in the back again, Columbus opened the rear door, first checking for zombies, and noticed a large duffel bag on the seat. \"Hey, guys?\" \"What?\" Winnfield reached his side, her on his shoulder as she craned her neck for a look inside. Meanwhile, Tallahassee opened the opposite door and leaned in. Columbus unzipped the bag and pulled it open to reveal...a heck of a lot of guns. \"No. Way.\" It was like Christmas had come early. Tallahassee was suddenly twelve years-old again. \"Thank God for rednecks! This is a really big truck. And those are some really big guns.\" He was absolutely beaming. Winnfield leant against the driver's side door as she watched him shoot off a couple of Uzis, before turning around to get to work on starting the car. Within seconds, the engine roared to life. \"Have you boosted many cars before?\" Columbus asked her, suspiciously. \"When you're raised by three brothers, well... You pick shit up.\" She hopped into the driver's seat, thought about it, then slid over into the passenger side. She'd let Tallahassee take this one, even if was to make him just that little bit happier. As they had all been hoping, minutes later they were on the road, driving towards...well, just driving, really. But with a glance over at Tallahassee every now and then, Winnfield could tell from his determined grin what he had in mind. \"How do you expect to catch up with them?\" \"They gotta stop some time.\" \"You know,\" Columbus began, leaning forward from the backseat, \"they say 'He who seeks revenge should dig two graves.' \" \"Right, two graves; one for the big chick, one for the little chick.\" \"You are scary happy,\" Columbus commented. Tallahassee chuckled and nodded, playfully pushing Winnfield in the shoulder as she sat in the seat next to him shaking her head. His high spirits were contagious. \"Why can't we just forget about those girls and head home?\" Columbus asked. \"Home?\" Winnfield frowned. \"Well, you know, wherever home used to be.\" \"You wanna talk about home?\" Tallahassee's good mood seemed to evaporate before their eyes. \"Home for me was a...puppy named Buck. Cutest little dog ever.\" Winnfield smiled, but as she looked closer, she could sense something in his eyes. She had always been good at picking up on when guys were lying. Not so much when girls were, it turned out. Then again she had never grown up with sisters. Her brow creased but she kept her thoughts to herself. \"And then all those fuckin' zombies...I lost him. And there ain't no gettin' him back. So, uh, I guess I'm looking for a new home. By tomorrow, we could maybe be skinny-dippin' in Yellowstone River.\" He looked to Winnfield for her opinion on this activity. She did a poor job of suppressing a smirk. \"Aw, look at her blushin' \". \"Asshole.\" \"Alright, alright. Then maybe we could be swingin' from the chandeliers in the Playboy mansion,\" he suggested to Columbus. \"Zombie-bunnies,\" Winnfield thought aloud. Columbus screwed up his face at the thought. \"But today,\" Tallahassee continued, \"We got us a Vortec six-litre, fuckin' V8, a box full of hollow-points and, God-willin' a G.D. Twinkie. Gotta enjoy the little things.\" With a nod of agreement, Winnfield turned her head to look back at Columbus, and found him jotting something down on a piece of paper. \"What's that you got there?\" He glanced up. \"Uhh. Oh, it's nothing really. I just have this kind of list. My rules for surviving Zombieland.\" \"Mind if I take a look?\" He gave her one his nervous headshakes and passed the bit the pit of paper to her outstretched hand. She scanned the list of thirty-two items, nodding every so often in approval. She passed them back to him. \"Well, they seem to have worked out for you this far. But what do you plan on doing with them? Give them to the next generations?\" \"Next generations?\" Tallahassee asked, finding the concept of having to repopulate the world both amusing and attractive. She rolled her eyes. \"You know what I mean.\" \"I certainly hope that I do.\" \"Just keep driving.\"[Chapter 7] AMERICAN WOMAN, STAY AWAY FROM ME AMERICAN WOMAN, GOT MAD COW DISEASE The light in the sky was beginning to fade by the time they finally came across the two conniving sisters. Tallahassee's treasured Escalade sat abandoned in the middle of the road just ahead of them, but by now they knew better than to fall for whatever the girls had in store for them. Tallahassee stopped the car and got out, grabbing a pair of high-powered binoculars from his duffel-bag. Winnfield and Columbus followed suit, standing beside him and gazing at the potential ambush up ahead. \"Knowing them, it's a trap,\" Tallahassee surmised. He passed the binoculars to Winnfield. \"Wait here. Drive down if I signal.\" He grabbed a gun from the back of the car and started walking down the road towards his old Cadillac. \"I don't feel right about this,\" Winnfield sighed, \"Hop in the car kid. It's starting to get a little chilly, anyway.\" Columbus, chewing nervously on the drawstring of his jumper, did as she suggested, but remained vigilant from the backseat. Winnfield stared down the binoculars at the car, but couldn't see any movement. She waited. Tallahassee checked inside, underneath and then around the other side of the car, but there was no sign of either of the girls. Judging by the smoke coming from the engine, though, they had broken down and wouldn't be far off. Cupping his hands to his mouth, he made a whistling noise and then waved them down. Winnfield waved back and hopped into the driver's seat. Shutting the door, she turned to Columbus, only to find that, somehow, Little Rock had managed to move stealthily towards the car, into the back seat and was now holding a gun to the sheepish-looking boy's head. \"Drive\", she ordered sweetly. Clenching her jaw, Winnfield could only obey. Tallahassee smiled when she pulled up, but, for Columbus' sake, she couldn't tell him about the visitor in the back. \"I guess they must've hoofed it. Probably headed west\", he said, jumping into the passenger seat, \"Drive slow. Keep your eyes peeled.\" When Winnfield didn't move, he glanced over and saw her staring hard at the wheel, hands clenched tightly around it. \"They're in the back, aren't they?\" \"Just me.\" Little Rock popped up next to Columbus and pulled out her gun, previously Tallahassee's, to show that she meant business. She pushed it into Tallahassee's neck. \"Hey!\" Winnfield warned her. \"You got taken hostage, two-to-one I might add, by a twelve year-old?\" \"Don't look at me\", Winnfield told him, \"He was the one in the car.\" \"She was like a crouching tiger\", Columbus defended. Winnfield sighed and rolled her eyes, leaning her elbow on top of the window and rubbing her eyes in irritation. \"Gun please,\" Little Rock ordered Tallahassee, holding out her hand. \"Yeah,\" he laughed, \"like you know how to use-\" He was cut off as Little Rock fired the gun she was holding through the sunroof. Recovering from his flinch, Tallahassee shouted, \"Don't kill me with my own gun!\" Fuming, he passed her the gun he had been carrying. \"Thank-you\", she said, still with that innocent sweetness. She turned to Winnfield, \"Now honk your horn.\" Winnfield glared at her, but did as she was told. Nearby, from behind a giant hay roll, Wichita emerged carrying Columbus' gun. \"Oh look, it's her sister,\" he said, \"Hey!\" He waved a hand through the sunroof. Wichita approached Winnfield on the driver's side door, catching her cheesed-off expression. \"Oh, bummer,\" she told her with mock-pity, \"Now step away from the vehicle. You and him get in the back. Nervous guy can ride shotgun.\" Winnfield threw open her door, but not quickly enough to hit the swift, smiling Wichita. She approached the rear door only to catch Little Rock shaking her head, gun pointed. \"Other side,\" the girl told her, \"That way you two can't ambush me.\" \"Yeah,\" Winnfield chuckled sarcastically as she moved to the other door, \" Us ambush you .\" The drive after that wasn't so bad; until Wichita put on a mix CD featuring the likes of Lady Gaga, the Pussycat Dolls and Christina Aguilera. Winnfield cringed as 'Hush Hush' started playing, then snorted. \"Problem?\" Wichita asked, glancing at Winnfield via the rear-view mirror. \"Uh...\" Winnfield began, not knowing where to start. \"I think what Winnfield is trying to say is 'This music blows',\" Tallahassee helped. \"Driver's choice,\" Wichita told them. \"Do we get a choice of driver, then?\" Tallahassee asked. Winnfield grinned and looked into the rear-view to see how Wichita felt about this. She was glaring back at them. \"What happened to the Van Halen CD that was in there? You know, when we found the car?\" Winnfield asked. \"I tossed it\", she replied casually. When she saw the look on Winnfield's face, she changed her answer. \"I'm joking. It's on the dash. Man, you guys have got some major anger issues.\" \"Imagine that,\" Winnfield huffed. \"And you two have some serious pilfering issues,\" Tallahassee shot back to the thief. The conversation came to a halt after that. The tension inside the car was felt by all and it was starting to make Columbus uneasy. Looking at the almost professional way that Little Rock was holding her shotgun, he realised that these two girls could have killed them or at least left them on the side of the road. He supposed he owed them some gratitude. \"Thanks Wichita. Thanks Little Rock.\" They both gave him weird looks. While Little Rock was momentarily distracted, Tallahassee saw his chance. He grabbed the gun and reversed it, pointing it at her. Wichita braked hard, causing everyone to jerk forward in their seats. She pulled a revolver out of nowhere and aimed it at Tallahassee. Jumping to his defence, Winnfield slid the knife from the sheath strapped to her leg and held it to Wichita's throat. It glinted in the light of the setting sun. Wichita glanced from Tallahassee to Winnfield and then to her sister. Just when it seemed that nobody was prepared to back down, Columbus decided that enough was enough. \"Hey, for fuck's sake, enough already! We're being chased by ravenous freaks! 'Oh, they stole my hummer'. 'I don't like chart-topping Pop music.' 'We have trust issues'. Now get over it! We can't just fucking drive down the road playing 'I-Spy', or some shit for two hours, like five normal-ass Americans? Fuck me!\" \"Whoa,\" Tallahassee commented, once the kid had finished his rant. \"I know,\" said Columbus, taking a breather. \"Let me be the mature one,\" Tallahassee offered, withdrawing the shotgun from the stand-off. Winnfield put her knife away and Wichita turned around in her seat and got the car moving again. \"I appreciate you having my back, though,\" Tallahassee told Winnfield. \"Looks like I brought a knife to gunfight,\" she replied, doing a very poor impersonation of Sean Connery in The Untouchables . It was just the thing they needed to break the tension. They erupted into nervous giggles. And even though Little Rock didn't really get the reference, it didn't take a film buff to judge a poor attempt at a Scottish accent.[Chapter 8] BLOODY HAZE ALL IN MY BRAIN LATELY THINGS JUST DON'T SEEM THE SAME ACTIN' FUNNY AND I DON'T KNOW WHY 'SCUSE ME WHILE I SHOOT THIS GUY. Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me. To me. Mama, just killed a man. Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger; now he's dead. Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody leaked from the CD player's speakers, heavily audible over the sound of the shower spray. A woman in her mid-twenties attempted to mimic the falsetto tones of Freddy Mercury, not entirely failing, but her efforts were best left for a sleazy karaoke bar on a slow Friday night. \"Goodbye, everybody. I've got to go! Gotta leave you all behind and faaaace the truuuth!\" There was a series of bangs on the bathroom door. Her room-mate, also her twin brother, had never really been fond of her unnecessarily loud singing. Giggling, she turned off the taps, wrung the remainder of the water from her hair and stepped out of the shower. She grabbed one of the two white towels she had on hand and leaned forward so that she could wrap her hair in it. Once she'd secured the second towel around her body, she opened the door to tell him to go away. She froze. His face was pale and his eyes wide. He was clutching his forearm, from which blood was trickling at a steady rate. \"Oh shit! What happened? Oh my God!\" He forced a smile, always one to try for a laugh even in the most dire of situations. \"Don't worry about getting the paper this morning.\" A loud crash came from the front room. \"Quick! Close the door,\" he cried, pushing past her in a panic. He slammed the bathroom door closed and locked it, then leant back against it and slid down the floor below. His breathing was rapid and shaky. She turned and turned the music down so that she could hear him properly. \"Jonah, what happened?\" she asked slowly. \"Sis, remember how we were talking that time, about what our worst nightmare would be?\" \"Yeah, and you said 'a Wham! revival band'?\" \"Heh-heh. Yeah. Well...\" \"Are you trying to tell me that you were attacked by a George Michael impersonator?\" \"I was more referring to what you said.\" She stared at him with a frown, trying to recall what she had told him. \"Zombies...?\" \"Yeah,\" he sighed. She snorted. \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" \"Uhh...\" He showed her the wound he was covering up with his hand. It was a bite. The door began shaking behind him as something threw itself against the wood, and Jonah reached into his pocket, pulling out a set of keys. \"Here's the plan, baby-girl–\" He stopped and began coughing violently, covering his mouth with the back of his sleeve. When he eventually stopped, he moved his arm away and looked down at the blood spattered on the material. The virus was working its way through him faster than he had anticipated. The pounding on the door continued, but to no avail for the individual responsible. \"These are the keys to my truck. I want you to go through that window, run as fast as you can and drive to somewhere safe. Now, go! You might want to get some clothes on first, though.\" He turned to the side as he was overcome by another fit of violent coughing. Seizing the opportunity, she grabbed her clothes and pulled them on, beginning to realize the true severity of the situation. When she was done, she looked down at the keys in her hands. \"I'm not leaving you here. Do you reckon you can climb through?\" she gestured to the medium-sized window that sat above the bath. \"I got bit. I don't think I have a lot of time, you know. There's a shotgun in the back of the truck. A couple of boxes of ammo in the glove box. You'll be set until you get to wherever the safest place is right now. Go.\" The blood vessels in Jonah's eyes began bursting, turning his whites red. She put a trembling hand to her mouth and turned to the window. Giving her hands a quick shake, she grasped the bottom of the window and pulled it open, sticking her head through for a quick glance around the yard before she pushed herself out. Tears trickled down her face, but she forced herself to move, knowing in that moment how real this was; her worst nightmare realized. Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me. For me! The music continued to play from the bathroom, focusing the attention of whatever was trying to get in through the door, whilst also covering up any sound she made as she made her escape. Risking a glance back at her brother, she saw that he was now lying on his back, twitching like a fish out of water. She heard a shriek form across the street and saw her neighbor, a middle-aged man that was fond of hitting on her at inappropriate moments, running from his house as his wife chased him with outstretched arms. Blood was pouring from the woman's mouth as she snarled viciously at her prey. Gathering her thoughts, the girl ran for her brother's truck, ears pricked for the sound of anything chasing after her. She was in luck. The houses were well-spaced in her neighborhood, acres apart in most cases. The only people she had to worry about were those across the street, and the newspaper deliveryman that had smashed his way into her brother's home. Just as Jonah had promised, a shotgun lay in the truck's bed, along with a couple of hunting knives he hadn't mentioned, and a few landscaping tools she couldn't see any use for. She climbed into the driver's seat, locked the doors and fumbled with the keys before finally managing to shove one into the ignition. It roared to life. The radio came on, playing R.E.M.'s It's the End of the World As We Know It . She paused, staring down at the CD player before quickly switching it off. Too much , she thought. She took a moment to breathe, smoothing her still-damp hair back against her head. She leaned forward and rested her head on the steering wheel before she was startled by a sudden ' whack! ' that came from the opposite side of the car. Her brother had managed to climb through the bathroom window and was now attempting to get into the passenger seat. Only, it wasn't her brother anymore. It was something else. A bleeding, ravenous being. He smacked his hand onto the window, leaving a streak of clotted blood, and then tried the handle. She was glad she had locked it. Grabbing the shotgun from the seat next to her, she made sure it was loaded. It was. The thing that had once been her brother continued trying to find a way into the vehicle. She had to act fast. Just as Jonah smashed his arm through the window, she fired at him with scream of anguish. The buckshot shattered the glass completely and sent her brother flying backwards. Winnfield woke with a start. The sound of the shotgun blast echoed in her memory. Her head had been resting on Tallahassee's shoulder and as he felt the weight of it leave him, he looked down at her. She realized that she must have had a startled look on her face, because his own expression was one of concern. She glanced up at him, and then over at Little Rock, who was frowning but for once it wasn't in contempt. That's when Winnfield realized that everyone in the car was staring at her. She realized she had screamed out loud. Wichita had slammed on the brakes, and the jerk of the car suddenly coming to a halt had brought Winnfield back to the land of the living...well, mostly-living. \"Everything okay back there?\" Wichita asked, her voice tinged with kind of concerned sarcasm. Columbus, whose lost-puppy eyes had a slightly worried look in them, turned back to the front and leaned forward to get something out of the bag by his feet. Winnfield cleared her throat and accepted the bottle of water that Columbus was now offering her. \"Thanks. Uh, fine. Bad dream.\" \"I'll say,\" Tallahassee commented, eyeing her suspiciously as though he knew that she wasn't telling them the whole story. She turned her attention to the window and the landscape that began to pass quickly by as Wichita began driving forward once more. It took her a moment to realize that it was dark outside and that she couldn't make out much of anything that they were passing. She gave an audible sigh and closed her eyes once more as she rested her head back against the headrest. Columbus and Tallahassee exchanged looks, but they continued on in silence for the next few miles. Winnfield felt the car slowing to a halt again, but she wasn't sure how much time had passed. Her neck felt stiff from falling asleep in such an uncomfortable position. As she bent her head side-to-side to try to fix the crick, she realized that Wichita and Columbus, who was still riding shotgun, were having 'a moment'. Columbus glanced out his open door, towards a car that sat on the side of the road. The car was in pretty good nick, considering the circumstances and what had probably happened to original owner. He looked at the car, and then looked back at Wichita. He had wanted to drive back to Ohio to see if there was any hope of recovering his family. It didn't seem likely. He shut the door and remained where he was. Why take the chance when all he'd ever really wanted was sitting right beside him? Wichita seemed pleased enough by his decision, and the car began moving again. Looking at the man beside her, Winnfield found him now resting his head on her shoulder, fast asleep. A little bit of drool had escaped from the corner of his mouth and left a dark patch on her shirt. She grimaced, but it was a soft grimace which melted into a little smile. It was nice to have the comfort of human contact, even if said human was soaking her arm with his saliva. From the rear-view mirror, Wichita caught Winnfield's eye and they exchanged the briefest of smiles. For just a moment, it seemed possible that everything would turn out alright. Winnfield allowed the small bit of hope to lift her spirits; there was no point being pessimistic, even if everyone she had ever known and loved was borderline-dead. They had been driving for hours when Tallahassee finally woke up. Although it was dark outside, he still seemed anxious to get out of the cramped space. \"We're gonna have to pull over soon,\" he announced to everyone as he stretched, invading both Winnfield and Little Rock's personal space, \"I'm feeling cooped up.\" They passed a big road sign advertising a Native American souvenir shop just up ahead. They were making good time, already passing through Arizona, but Winnfield wasn't really sure where it was they were headed. She had been asleep for most of the drive, since the sisters had taken over and had missed a lot of the conversation that had taken place. When she was really honest with herself though, she really didn't care where they went, as long as it was somewhere . She was tired of the aimlessness of her post-America life. Zombieland offered some challenges, like the inconvenience of people constantly trying to eat you, but her real purpose felt depleted. She didn't have any family to look out for anymore, and she no longer had the everyday worries that once plagued the average person. She should have felt liberated, but when you couldn't even sleep without the fear of having your face bitten off, it was a little difficult. \"That'll do,\" Tallahassee said, nodding towards the small lot of buildings by the road in front of them. They pulled over and each grabbed whichever gun was closest to them. Walking across the crunchy, dirt road, everyone was at their most vigilant. This part was always the most dangerous; the half-way point between one safe place and the next. Even if they were pretty much in the middle of nowhere, with no other cars in sight and in dead silence, there was always that chance of a stray zombie. Once they were all positioned on the wooden porch of the main store, they stared at the open front door. \"Okay, who wants to go first?\" Tallahassee asked. The others stared at him. Winnfield paused, giving Columbus the chance to take this opportunity to impress Wichita, but when he shook his head, she stepped forward. \"I got this one,\" she told them. She had stuffed a handgun in the back of her jeans, but the weapon she had opted for was the trusty pickaxe she had kept since their little run-in back at the grocery store. Using the pointed tip, she tapped the little bell above the door that had once been used to alert the owners of incoming customers. Now the bell was being used to alert the customers of any incoming owners. Just as she'd thought, a bloodied man stepped out from behind the shelves and gave a deep, hungry growl. Not a lot of flesh to eat around this neck of the woods. Winnfield swung the pickaxe back and remained to the side of the door. The pose she held looked a lot like a baseball player waiting for a fast ball. She was determined to hit a home run. The moment the zombie's foot crossed onto the porch, Winnfield swung. The point of the pickaxe made its way through the centre of the man's head with enough force to bring him off his feet and onto his back. For some reason, despite the gun she already had on her and the small armory they had in the back of the hummer, Winnfield began trying to pull the pickaxe from the zombie's skull, but it was wedged in good and tight. She put her foot on his face to hold his head still, but that didn't seem to be helping. Just as she gave a good yank, he grabbed her by the ankle and gave another growl. She seemed to have forgotten 'Rule #2' on Columbus' list: 'Double Tap'. \"You little bastard!\" Winnfield scowled at the decomposing-yet-animated body , sounding more put out than angry. She tried to shake him off, but to no avail. \"Hold still,\" Tallahassee said, though she wasn't sure if he was talking to her or the squirming zombie. He stood on its arm and ended it once and for all with a blast from his shotgun. \"You alright?\" he asked Winnfield, as she smoothed back her hair. She bent down and gave the pickaxe another good tug, this time freeing it from the bloody cavity. \"Yeah, I'm good,\" she replied. \"Alright then, let's have a look-see, shall we?\" He stepped past her and into the store, oblivious to the fact that he'd just walked through a pool of brains. Wichita, Little Rock and Columbus followed suite, carefully avoiding the gory mess. \"Wow, this is really overpriced. Do you think they really expect people to pay two hundred dollars for a candle holder?\" Columbus asked, picking up one of the so-called 'souvenirs'. \"Well you're in luck, kid. For today only it's 100% off storewide,\" Winnfield replied. Wichita began browsing the stand of assorted hats, trying a couple on for the fun of it, while her little sister became absorbed in staring at the snow globes. Of course, the first place Tallahassee went was the weapons display, which held a number of spears and tomahawks. Winnfield spotted a display of crystals and found a necklace that looked almost the exact same as the one she had once worn, the one which now hung around Tallahassee's neck. She placed the one in her hand back onto the shelf and looked over at the man who had managed to lure her out of the one place she had felt safe. \"Is that perfume?\" Tallahassee asked Columbus as he walked up to him. \"It's cologne,\" Columbus told him, frowning at the idea of having sprayed himself with something so feminine. \"I'm thinking...\" – he sniffed at the air to place the scent – \" Lancôme Magnifique .\" Columbus decided it was probably not in his best interest to point out the fact that it was weird for Tallahassee to be so specific, after all, Columbus enjoyed life; but when he noticed that Wichita was close enough to be within earshot of Tallahassee's comments, he had to say something to stop him. Bad idea. \"Why don't you speak up, they might've missed it in Santa Fe.\" Tallahassee caught him glance over at Wichita again and managed to put two and two together...in his own way. \"Oh. My. God. You're thinking about fucking Wichita,\" he said, only bothering to lower his voice ever so slightly. \"Oh yeah, like you haven't spent the entire trip trying to get Winnfield's attention.\" Tallahassee gave him a look that said 'If you ever bring this up again, I will publicly castrate you', a look that shut Columbus up quick smart. \"Well, good luck picking her up when you smell like a fuckin' daisy.\" He turned away to see what Winnfield was up to, when he felt a spray of wet-mist hit the back of his neck. If the look on his face earlier had scared Columbus, the one he had on now was terrifying. \"Let me begin my three-part apology by saying that you are a wonderful human being...\" Columbus began, clutching the offending bottle of perfume. Winnfield looked on as Tallahassee slugged Columbus in the arm, sending the considerably smaller male backwards into an intricately decorated vase. The scene reminded her of her brothers, when they had all been kids and had played a game that involved punching each other in the arm with gradually-increased strength until someone chickened out. The phrase 'dead-arm' flashed in her mind and she quickly pushed the thought away. Tallahassee had quickly forgotten his anger, his mind now set firmly on destruction. \"Go on, break another\", he encouraged. Knowing that he now had Wichita's attention, Columbus knocked over another vase, and then one of the 'two-hundred dollar' candle holders. The sound of shattering porcelain began to fill the store, followed by glass and then anything else that was even remotely breakable. Following Tallahassee's earlier example, Columbus found that mindless destruction really did make you feel better. Winnfield was only a spectator at first, watching with a smile as Little Rock tossed snow globes on the ground, and Columbus and Wichita threw beads at one another. She felt a tap on her shoulder and turned to see Tallahassee, who held out a long-handled tomahawk, smiling as though he were passing her a bouquet of flowers. She accepted the gift and they set off together, battering glass display cabinets and mounted animal heads. By the end of it, the store was in total ruin and everyone was exhausted; spirits were higher and for a moment they were almost able forget about the apocalypse that awaited them outside.[Chapter 9] TWINKIE, TWINKIE, LITTLE BAR HOW I WONDER WHERE YOU ARE After what turned out to be a relatively good bonding experience, the fivesome returned to their mode of transport. Wichita seemed to have developed enough trust to allow someone else to drive while she got some sleep, so Winnfield volunteered to take the wheel. Of course, Tallahassee called shotgun. Columbus, Little Rock and Wichita were all asleep in the backseat when they hit the California state border. Before she had settled down to sleep, Little Rock had explained that she and her sister had made plans to revisit Pacific Playland , an amusement park they had gone to as kids, and that Winnfield should aim to keep driving towards Los Angeles. Winnfield was happy to oblige, and so here she found herself; in a quiet car, on a quiet road, in a quiet world. Except when you were seated next to Tallahassee, silence didn't last very long. \"So, about earlier. You know, when you woke up screamin' and all, what was that all about?\" he asked, trying his best to sound casual, \"I mean, if it's a sore subject or whatever, I get it...\" \"It's okay. I should probably get it off my chest at some stage, huh?\" As a result of her particular choice of words, Tallahassee's eyes flicked down to her chest, but she was too busy keeping a lookout for undead stragglers on the road to notice. \"Yeah. I heard it's good for your health,\" he agreed. \"Remember when I mentioned earlier that I had a brother, and that he got bit?\" Tallahassee nodded. \"Well, I was dreaming about that. When I first realized that all this was really happening. That people were actually turning into zombies and trying to eat their neighbors. That life would never be the same ever again.\" Tallahassee didn't know what to say that could add to her words; she had basically nailed the way he had first felt about it, too. But at the same time he didn't want to just let that thought linger in silence. It was too heavy to just leave open. Fortunately, Winnfield solved the problem for him. \"What smells like perfume?\" she asked. She had on a little lop-sided smile as she said it, a smile that made him smile. \"I didn't put it on, that fuckin' kid Columbus sprayed me like a skunk.\" \"I was going to say it smells nice, is all,\" Winnfield told him. Sensing an awkward moment brewing for herself she segued into a different topic. \"Speaking of smelling nice, I can't wait to find some place with working showers. Right now, I wouldn't even mind bathing in a goddamn river.\" \"I'm a bath man, myself,\" Tallahassee said, \"Nothing like a soak in the tub to relieve tense muscles.\" And the conversation continued on like this for the next few miles. Both were careful to not mention any more on the subject of zombies, family or the apocalypse. Tallahassee switched spots with Winnfield a short while after. As they were passing through the aptly-named town of Hell, just outside Los Angeles, not far from the Joshua Tree National Park, a group of three or four zombies strolled out onto the road in front of them. Tallahassee cursed, while Winnfield woke-up the three kids in the back seat. She told them what was going on and calmly asked Columbus to pass her the semi-automatic shotgun. Although shotguns weren't usually her choice of weapon due to their two round capacity, this particular shotgun, a Remington, could hold five rounds at any one time. She thanked God for the myriad of knowledge that her brothers had passed on to her. She slid out of her seat and jogged up to a spot that she considered to be a good range. Setting down on one knee, she waited for the zombies to get a little closer before she began blasting away. Watching from their seats in the car, the others could see that she had considerable aim; but Winnfield called luck on that. She had missed with the first shot, and had very nearly missed on the fourth, taking just enough of the zombie's neck away to classify it as 'decapitation'. Once she had finished, she paused in the middle of the road, breathed a huge sigh of relief through pursed lips, and thanked whoever was watching over her for letting her live past this latest confrontation. She received a few smiles of appreciation for her efforts when she returned to the car, and then they were back on their way to LA. Just another night in Zombieland. Tallahassee was careful to make sure he drove right over the heads of the annihilated zombies, just to make sure. You know; 'Double Tap'. But after that little event, everyone remained awake for the rest of the trip. It was hard to find that sense of peace when someone had just shaken you out of your sleep to tell you that things that wanted to eat your flesh were blocking the road and heading right for you. Nothing a lavender-scented candle and a glass of warm milk couldn't fix, right? \"You know, I think sleep deprivation is America's number one health problem,\" Columbus thought aloud, sensing the general sluggishness of everyone in the car. They passed a group of zombies, who were huddled around a corpse munching away like they hadn't eaten for weeks. \"Uh, no, I think that might be number two,\" Wichita commented as one of the zombies raised its head like a grazing cow. \"Heh heh, 'number two'...\" Tallahassee chuckled childishly. \"I wonder if we'll see anyone famous lurking around,\" Winnfield said. \"Like who, George Clooney?\" Tallahassee asked. \"I was thinking more along the lines of...Anne Hathaway, or...whatsername...Scarlet Johanssen.\" \"You ain't a lesbian, are you?\" \"Why? Just 'cause I mentioned two girls?\" \"Just checkin'. I knew this girl once, real nice. Had the greatest pair of...\" – his hand hovered around his chest and he gave himself a mental kick, quickly raising his hand to tap his head – \"Personalities.\" \"You knew a real nice girl with split-personality disorder?\" Winnfield asked him. \"Anyway, as I was saying,\" Tallahassee continued, giving her a half-hearted look of annoyance for interrupting his story. Winnfield tipped a quick wink to the three in the back before giving him her full attention. \"One minute she was all flirty, and the next she had her tongue down the throat of the girl that used to work the checkout at the local grocery store.\" \"Fascinating,\" Wichita commented in a bored drawl, \"We could have avoided that whole story if you'd just said 'Brad Pitt'.\" \"You know, I'm not really a Brad Pitt fan,\" Winnfield told her. \"Are you kidding?\" Columbus said, \"Even I'm a Brad Pitt fan, I mean...\" Realising how he'd just sounded, he shut his mouth and sat back and directed his gaze out the window to avoid the weird looks that everyone was giving him. \"On a slightly straighter note,\" Winnfield began, at which Tallahassee chuckled again, \"I agree with Columbus's earlier point. We should probably find somewhere to crash for a while. Somewhere with actual beds.\" \"Well, in a world just full 'o possibilities, it should at least be somewhere with style,\" Tallahassee agreed. \"What have you got in mind?\" Winnfield asked. He stopped the car in front of the Chinese Theatre. \"Columbus, how's about running on out there and gettin' us one of them maps?\" Columbus's face froze at the idea of leaving the relative-safety of the car. \"Don't worry, kid,\" Winnfield smiled, \"I'll come with you.\" They jumped out and made a run for it, towards the little stand that held the maps; Columbus as the procurer and Winnfield as the armed support. She shot down a Marilyn Monroe impersonator and dodged a snarling Charlie Chaplin. \"Got it!\" Columbus called. He turned around and nearly ran straight into the claw-like grasp of a zombie-jogger. His face pulled into a grim mask of horror: this was it; he was going to be eaten by a Jane Fonda Fitness Class fan. But then the butt of a gun came down against the side of the zombie's head and a long, athletic leg kicked into its stomach, sending it to the ground. Winnfield grabbed Columbus by the arm and pulled him towards the car. He jumped in through the back door, which was being held open and defended by Wichita. Winnfield had to make her way over to the other side. Here, she was confronted by a green-tinged Elvis impersonator. The other watched from inside the car as she tried the gun-butt-to-the-head trick again, but to no avail this time. The zombie grabbed her arm and she dropped the gun. \"God damn it,\" she cursed through a clenched jaw. While Elvis snapped his flesh-encrusted teeth at her, she managed to pull her machete from its sheath on her belt. She gave a growl that matched the zombie's, and cut off his arm at the elbow. Reaching her open hand into the car, Tallahassee passed her a revolver without her having to ask, while she kept her eyes on the dis-armed zombie. A quick shot to its head ended the little foray. \"Thank you very much,\" Winnfield told the corpse in a drawl that mocked his former profession, before climbing into her seat. She locked the door and leant forward, resting her head on her folded arms, atop the dashboard, machete still in hand. \"Phew,\" she commented, masking the true extent of her alarm, \"Close call. \"Alright?\" Tallahassee asked. For a brief moment she thought she was going to throw-up, but she managed to hold the bile down. She breathed a couple of silent, shaky breaths and sat up straight, replacing the knife in its sheath and giving the appearance of what she hoped was the most confident girl in the world. \"Yep, let's go.\" No one in the car was convinced. She reached a shaky hand to her forehead to wipe the nervous sweat away and, in doing so, smeared some of Elvis's mucky blood onto her skin. \"Uh, you got some...uh,\" Tallahassee frowned, gesturing to his forehead. Columbus, ever resourceful, passed forward a travel-pack of Kleenex. Using a bit of water from the water bottle he had given her earlier, Winnfield managed to clean herself up. \"So, whose house are we gate-crashing?\" she asked to break the uncomfortable silence. Feeling only slightly better about her state of mind, Tallahassee drove onward, towards his intended destination. \"I got someone in mind,\" he assured them, pocketing the map that had very nearly cost Winnfield her life. B.M. Those were the big golden letters that were fixed onto the cast-iron gates that cordoned off the house just beyond them from any unwanted visitors. \"B.M.?\" Columbus asked. He was expecting something more along the lines of T.C. or maybe even just a big 'O', but B.M. stumped him. Winnfield, on the other hand, was struck by the initials almost instantly. \"Really?\" she asked Tallahassee, like a kid whose parents had just revealed a trip to Disneyland. \"Really,\" Tallahassee nodded. \"I don't get it,\" Little Rock said, her face crumpled with confusion, \"Whose place is this?\" \"I'll tell you this much. It ain't Bob Marley's.\" Tallahassee managed to pry open the front gate with a crowbar, which proved an easier task than it should have been, since someone had cut off the power to the gate. He had forced Columbus to get out and help him, but all the anxious boy had managed to do was stand beside him and look hopeless. The ride up the smooth, white, concrete driveway was zombie-free, but that didn't stop them from loading up on as much ammunition and guns as they could carry. The front door to the house was locked, which surprised them a little, but it was nothing that Winnfield couldn't deal with, using yet another skill her brothers had passed on to her. Tallahassee had suggested kicking the door in, but Wichita pointed out that they would probably want to shut the door securely behind them in case they'd been followed by a horde or two. \"Alright, that should be...\" Winnfield gave the screwdriver she had jammed into the lock a firm whack with the palm of her hand, and the door swung open. She grinned proudly and yanked the screwdriver out in case there were other doors inside that required the same treatment. \"Age before beauty,\" she said to Tallahassee, gesturing for him to make his way in. He chuckled sarcastically, but went in anyway, his sawed-off at the ready. Stepping through into the house, they were met with a grand staircase that led up to a second floor. The ground level had marble flooring and the walls were just as white as the driveway. They were surrounded with furniture and various items which all looked like genuine antiques. Overall, the house screamed 'money'. \"This place is amazing,\" Wichita commented, as they walked down a short hallway that led into a finely furnished living space. \"Welcome to Le Mansion de Murray,\" Tallahassee announced with a grin. \"Oh, Bill Murray,\" Columbus said, as though he was neither surprised nor impressed by the revelation. An Andy Warhol-like artwork of Bill Murray's face, which would have been a dead giveaway as to the owner of the house anyway, sat on the wall closest to them. On another wall nearby was a different portrait, this time of Bill atop a large white horse. Either way, they would have worked it out eventually...well, maybe not Little Rock. \"Who's Bill Murray?\" she asked. Tallahassee looked at her as though she had just said 'There's a zombie apocalypse going on?' For a moment, he didn't quite know how to respond to her; to him it was almost blasphemy. \"That's like asking 'Who's Ghandi?'\" he managed to say, shocked by her ignorance. \"Who's Ghandi?\" she asked, shrugging yet again and glancing around at the others. \"Alrighty, let's see what we can find around here,\" Winnfield suggested. They made their way into the kitchen, searching through the cupboards and pantry for anything remotely edible. There were a couple of things, but unfortunately for Tallahassee... \"No Twinkies\", Winnfield said. \"Shit, fuck!\" He smacked his hands down on the kitchen bench with disappointment. Twinkies were starting to seem like an endangered species in Zombieland; not like back in Ye Olde American days, when they were around with abundance. Either Bill Murray had finished of his stocks of the spongy food, or he hadn't had any to start with. Not that it mattered; in the end Tallahassee was still Twinkie-less. \"Hey, inside voices,\" Columbus advised, \"At least until we know for sure that we're alone.\" \"Okay, Tallahassee, Wichita, why don't you two take that way?\" Winnfield said, pointing to the left of them, \"We'll take the other side. It'll be easier if we split up to search.\" \"Wait, what? Why do I gotta go with her?\" Tallahassee asked, having expected to be paired with the same woman that was taking charge of the situation. She raised an eyebrow at him, a little smile playing at her lips. \"Well, I think it would be better if I go with the youngest\" – she nodded towards Little Rock – \"and the...\" She looked at Columbus, the words 'weakest' and 'most-nervous' springing to mind as he looked back with mildly-confused innocence. \"And Columbus,\" she finished. Little Rock gave her a look that said 'I don't need a babysitter', but she decided not to argue. After seeing Winnfield take down both 'Elvis' and the other zombies that had gotten in their way, and with a relatively cool head too, she knew it was better for her health if Winnfield led the charge. Tallahassee furrowed his brow and looked like he wanted to dispute the allocation, but he was quickly shut down by Winnfield's concluding comment. \"Besides, we'll have time later for R and R, or... whatever takes our fancy.\" Without giving him a backwards glance, she moved off in the direction she had set for her 'team'. \"Whatever,\" Wichita sighed, then called after them, \"But shotgun having the first shower if there's a working water system here.\" She said 'shotgun' like she meant it quite literally, especially since she was adequately equipped to back up such a threat. \"Why didn't you go with Tallahassee?\" Winnfield kicked in a door and entered the room beyond it gun-first. Once she was satisfied that it wasn't occupied by the living dead, she gave Columbus a reply. \"Why didn't you go with Wichita?\" He stared at her, working over her answer in his mind and then gave a 'fair enough' nod. She continued to lead the way down a long corridor, a serious look of concentration on her face. Columbus had noticed that she'd changed a little since her encounter with the Elvis-impersonator; she wasn't joking around as much and she seemed a lot less crazy than his earlier impressions of her. He liked her better when she was goofing around, though; now, with her extra caution, she was a continuous reminder of what might be lying in wait around the next corner. \"He's a bit old for you, isn't he?\" Little Rock commented. Winnfield flattened herself against the wall at the very end of the corridor and gestured for the others to do the same. Taking a deep breath, she turned to face the next room and found the area empty. \"All clear\", she said. \"And no. Not really.\" Little Rock raised a judging eyebrow, but any further questions were wiped from her mind when she spotted a popcorn machine by the door of the adjoining room. \"He has his own movie theatre?\" Columbus approached the room with awe and lowered his gun when there were no signs of movement from inside it. \"Come on, Little Rock. I'm going to teach you a little something about Bill Murray.\" \"You two go ahead,\" Winnfield told them when Columbus turned to see if she was joining them, \"I'll get the popcorn.\" Noticing that there weren't any bowls or tubs by the popcorn machine, she walked all the way back down to the kitchen to retrieve one. Locating a large metal bowl in one of the lower cupboards, she was struck by the urge to check in on Wichita and Tallahassee. Entering the living room, she was met by a very surreal scene: Tallahassee and Wichita had an end each of a large hookah pipe, while Bill Murray stood between them lighting it up. They all glanced over at her when she accidentally knocked the metal bowl against the wall, making an echoing 'GONG' sound. Winnfield would have found it absolutely hilarious if she hadn't been so struck by Bill Murray's presence. She squeezed her eyes closed and then stretched them wide. Nope, he was real. \"There's plenty to go round,\" he said, breaking her from her daze. \"Any more people lurking around in my house that I should know about?\" He didn't sound angry, but asked in a good-humored kind of way. \"Uh, yeah. Sorry about just breaking in. We thought you'd be...\" \"Zombified?\" Taking in his get-up for the first time, Winnfield saw that he had dressed the part. That Bill, always with the jokes. \"Holy crap. I'm actually in a room with Bill Murray.\" He smiled, the same kind of humble smile he'd given to millions of fans before. From over by the hookah pipe, Tallahassee sucked in a huge breath of the smoke, held it in like a pro and then blew it out. He offered the pipe to Winnfield, but she shook her head. \"Uh, I have to go...I need to get back to...the others'll be wondering where I got to, so...\" Still a bit shocked by her proximity to the big Hollywood star, she slowly backed away. She turned back in the direction of the corridor leading back to the theatre room, her head remained pointed towards him as though she couldn't tear her eyes away. When she finally did manage to face forward, she nearly ran head-on into the wall. Giggling nervously and glancing back to see the reaction of the onlookers to her clumsy little moment, she quickly disappeared around the corner. Tallahassee grinned at her, and then proceeded to take another hit of the pipe. When she finally got back to Columbus and Little Rock, they had already started watching Ghostbusters , which Little Rock hadn't seen before. Winnfield took a seat beside Little Rock and stared down at the floor. Feeling their gazes on her, she turned her head and saw that they had equal expressions of puzzlement. \"What took you so long?\" Columbus asked. \"And why didn't you get any popcorn?\" Little Rock added. Winnfield looked down at the metal bowl in her hand and, sure enough, she'd forgotten the very thing she'd set out to acquire.[Chapter 10] SHOT THROUGH THE HEART, AND YOU'RE TO BLAME YOU GIVE FUN A BAD NAME ' 35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.' ' That's a big Twinkie.' Ghostbusters was just as great as Winnfield remembered; she laughed at all the lame jokes, and even gave a chuckle every now and then at the bad '80s special effects. She hadn't told Columbus and Little Rock about her strange encounter in the living room, mainly because she didn't know how to put it into words. How do you casually work that into a conversation, let alone into an engaged silence? 'Oh, by the way, when I was getting a bowl for the popcorn, I found Wichita and Tallahassee in the living room smoking weed with Bill Murray'? She hadn't quite gotten over the fact that she'd exchanged words with one of her all-time favourite actors, and in his own house, too. \"So, your sister's single, right?\" Columbus asked Little Rock, breaking the comfortable quiet, \"Nothing long distance or anything?\" Winnfield tore her eyes away from the film to give him one of her playfully-questioning raised eyebrows. How he expected Wichita to have maintained a long-distance relationship with some guy she had known before the collapse of civilisation, she had no clue; but she could see that Columbus was just trying to be smooth and nonchalant about things. Unfortunately, at least from Winnfield's point of view, he wasn't capable of being either of those things. He was amusing, though, she'd give him that. Little Rock didn't seem to think so, but she humoured him anyway with a shake of her head; no, Wichita was not in a relationship. \"And if she had, like, a type – if you can have a type – what would that be?\" \"She kinda goes for the bad boys,\" Little Rock replied. \"Really?\" \"Yep.\" Sensing an opportunity to show he had a rebellious side, (which was a big lie), Columbus 'accidentally' knocked their newly acquired bowl of popcorn to the ground, spilling the contents all over the nice, clean floor. \"Whoops.\" \"Hey! What...urgh.\" Little Rock rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \"It's alright, I'll go get more from the machine\", Winnfield said. She got out of her seat and bent down to retrieve the bowl. As she did this, her t-shirt pulled up to reveal a little tattoo on the small of her back. It was a pair of interlocking wings, and in the middle of them, strung close together like a crossword, were four names. Columbus recalled Winnfield saying that she had three brothers, and he realised that, somewhere in this tattoo, was her real name. He narrowed his eyes to try to read the elegant script better. Jonah. Lewis. Michael. H- Winnfield stood up before he could properly read the last name. He couldn't imagine her being any of the first three names, so he had just missed discovering her true name. There was something very unsatisfying about this failed attempt, as though he had missed out on some exclusive, secret information. As Winnfield strode out of the room, Columbus followed her with his eyes, now intrigued about what letters came after that 'H'. His moving gaze came to a halt as he locked eyes with Little Rock, who was giving him an odd look. She thought he had been giving Winnfield the old once-over. \"I wasn't...I just...Didn't you see...?\" But like so many other times in his life, the right words failed to present themselves. Winnfield stepped outside the little theatre and approached the machine that sat over by the wall. She pressed the button that warmed up fresh popcorn and heard voices coming towards her from the hallway. Her natural instinct was to whip out the only weapon she had on her at that moment, which happened to be her knife, but logical reasoning quickly kicked in and she remembered that zombies couldn't actually talk. Putting the knife away, she refocused on her original task and turned her head as the voices drew closer. \"So Columbus is the scared one?\" It was Bill Murray again. Winnfield felt a little pang of excitement and then reminded herself that in a world full of animated corpses, this really wasn't the time to geek out. \"Yeah, he's like a little bunny,\" Wichita's voice replied. The post-hookah three stepped out from the corridor and spotted Winnfield restocking the snack supplies. Each of them were pleasantly and only slightly noticeably high. Tallahassee put a finger to his lips to tell Winnfield to keep it quiet. He was finding whatever they had planned, very amusing. \"We're gonna play a little prank on Shirley in there,\" he whispered, and Winnfield knew that he didn't mean Little Rock. A tiny warning light went off somewhere in Winnfield's mind as she watched Bill zombie-walk his way into his private cinema, but she ignored it, too entertained to care about the questionable logic behind the prank. As a loud shot rang out, she knew she should have trusted her gut instinct, the instinct that had kept her alive in Zombieland for so long. Tallahassee and Wichita's eyes widened in alarm and Winnfield dropped the bowl she was holding, the sound of it clattering to the ground bringing them out of their stunned dazes long enough to race into the room. Columbus was up from his seat, a smoking shotgun in his hands and a look of determination on his face. As soon as he heard Wichita's gasp, he knew that she wasn't about to thank him for saving her little sister's life. \"Oh my God, I can't believe I shot Bill Murray.\" Realisation began to sink in while the healthier, on-screen version of Bill discussed the best way to dispel Slimer from the Sedgewick Hotel. In reality, he lay on the floor with buck-shot littered inside his chest, alive but certainly not well. \"Is that the way you say 'Hello' where you come from?\" he asked Columbus. Everyone gathered around him, crouching and sitting beside him with grim expressions. \"I don't think we're going to be able to stitch this,\" Tallahassee said as he pulled back a little bit of Bill's shirt for a better look at the wound. \"Well, death is the ultimate punch line, right?\" Winnfield thought aloud, \"And since you're a comedian...\" She received a number of awkward looks. \"Not as comforting as you might think,\" Bill wheezed. \"If it means anything now, I am so sorry,\" Columbus said, his facing pulling into the miserable-puppy expression that was beginning to seem like his natural appearance. \"It was just instinctive.\" The ensuing silence was broken by Wichita, who seemed to want to find some way to brighten the gloomy mood, though this was near impossible. \"Do you have any regrets?\" Bill thought about this before replying, \" Garfield , maybe.\" Winnfield grinned, but the moment of humour was short-lived as Bill began coughing and wheezing his last breaths. Winnfield was so suddenly overcome with memories of her brother, Jonah's horrible zombification process that she had to leave the room. She had gotten so used to suppressing her emotions since the zombie uprising that she was amazed by the rush of feelings pulsing through her mind. Of course, it had been easier maintaining an emotionless existence when she had been by herself. To her surprise, it was Columbus that came out to check on her. When he noticed her somewhat inquiring expression, he said, \"Tallahassee's gonna carry the body out. He's, uh, wrapping it up in one of the cinema curtains.\" \"Nice.\" \"Yeah. Real classy way to go.\" They both smiled, but it was a tense, forced process. \"How come you left?\" He couldn't really believe that it was because of the blood and gore, especially after some of the things he'd witnessed her do. \"You ever think of your family? I mean... have you ever had that moment when you just stop and realise how fucked up everything has become?\" \"I used to have those moments before this happened,\" Columbus replied, \"I guess it's what being in the army would feel like.\" Winnfield frowned but nodded to show that she was listening. \"You don't feel so bad when you're shooting at the bad guys...\" \"But then one of your guys catches friendly fire...\" \"Yeah.\" \"Ah well, kid, what's done is done. Let's leave it at that.\" \"You're surprisingly optimistic sometimes,\" Columbus smiled. \"Yeah, well...\" Winnfield told Columbus before going to retrieve her gun from where she had left it on the floor of the home cinema. Tallahassee bustled through the doors at that moment with the suspicious looking bundle in his arms. He didn't seem to be having too much trouble carrying it by himself, but he made Little Rock walk ahead of him to open doors where necessary. Wichita walked ahead of her little sister, gun poised to fire at the slightest sign of movement. Though after what just happened in the theatre room, firing at anything that moved probably wasn't the greatest of ideas. They gave Bill a hero's send-off, firing a few rounds into the clear blue sky before tossing the corpse over the balcony and onto the driveway below. As a loud crash sounded and they all stood in a stunned silence, Columbus fished something out of his pocket and offered it to them. \"Do you guys want some Purell?\" Needless to say, they accepted in unison. Since the apocalypse had only come around a few weeks earlier, food wasn't as scarce as one might think. Winnfield offered to make dinner on the condition that they sit down together to eat it. If they were sticking together for a while, they might as well act civilised towards each other, she figured. Her first order of duty was to throw away all the no-go items, first and foremost the meat, then items that were past their use-by date, followed by anything that came from a cow. It seemed illogical to the others that they should be forced to eat what was practically a vegan diet, but Winnfield wanted to be sure she wasn't serving up fried eggs with a side of mad-cow disease. That would ruin everyone's evening. After making sure that everyone was okay with her selection for that night's menu, she set to work cooking some pasta and deciding the best way to make a sauce to go with it. She grabbed some tomato paste and tinned diced tomatoes from the cupboard, and even found some cloves of garlic hidden away amongst some onions. She sighed as she stared into the boring red mixture, wishing she could throw in some minced beef at the very least. Hearing movement behind her she spun around and found Wichita holding a couple of bottles of wine. She placed them down on the counter and looked through the kitchen draws for a corkscrew. After she'd removed the cork from one of the bottles, she held it out to Winnfield. \"Think you can use some of this in the sauce?\" \"Good idea.\" She measured out two tablespoons carefully and then shrugged, tipping more straight from the bottle. Wichita left the kitchen as quickly as she had come in, and Winnfield was pleased to see that she was carrying some cutlery out to the table. Just as the food was about ready to serve up, the power cut out. Resourceful as ever, Columbus managed to find a torch and with it was able to locate some matches and candles. The next thing he did was hold the torch for Winnfield while she served up their belated dinner. Luckily, it was still relatively warm by the time it was finally set down on the table. With the table lit with only a couple of candles, the level on anxiety seemed to rise a few degrees; everyone made sure their guns were within reach in case they had any unexpected visitors. \"You know, considering you had shit all to make this with, it's pretty good,\" Tallahassee commented, breaking the silence. The others nodded in agreement. \"Thanks. I had to cook a lot for my brothers and my dad after my ma passed away.\" Her statement did little to encourage further conversation. They cleared they plates without any further word. \"Look what I found when I was looking for the candles,\" Columbus announced, holding up a Monopoly box. \"Really?\" Wichita asked, not at all excited by the idea. \"It's a good way to pass time.\" \"There's a reason they call them 'bored' games,\" she retorted. \"Hey! Lookie what I found.\" They glanced over at Tallahassee, who was holding up a few wads of cash. \"Sweet,\" Winnfield smirked, \"Let's raise the stakes.\" She grabbed the box from Columbus and set it out on the living room floor. \"'Raise the stakes'?\" Wichita asked. \"You know what I mean,\" Winnfield replied, shrugging off Wichita's negative attitude. She set to work throwing a few cushions onto the ground for them to lie on, and then retrieved a few beers and cokes from the fridge. Whenever she felt a little rocky emotionally, she covered it up by being as productive as possible. \"Alright. Who's ready for Family Games Night?\" she beamed.[Chapter 11] IT'S CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT AND SOMETHING EVIL'S LURKING IN THE DARK \"Alright, free parking!\" Wichita said, for once without her usual sarcasm. \"Which, might I add, is the best thing about Zombieland.\" Columbus shook his head. \"Nope, best thing about Z-Land? No more Facebook status updates. Like 'Rob Curtis is gearing up for Friday'. Who cares?\" Although Winnfield wasn't sure that people actually talked like that on Facebook, since Columbus sounded like an 80 year-old grandparent trying to be cool, she still agreed with him; the world was less reliant on technology now. Come to think of it, the world was less reliant on a lot of things; the human race included. \"Nah-uh,\" Tallahassee broke in, interrupting the thoughtful silence, \"The best thing is no more flushing. Epic.\" \"Remind me not to use the downstairs toilet,\" Winnfield frowned. \"Which one?\" Wichita added, a fair question since the late 'B.M.' appeared to have at least three on the ground floor alone. \"So what about the worst thing? About Z-Land?\" Columbus looked around at each face, though the expressions hardly seemed to vary. The worst thing about Zombieland? Well, when you thought about it, you certainly had plenty of things to choose from. \"Besides shooting my own brother?\" Winnfield answered, an uncharacteristic gloom blanketing her words. It seemed that in certain instances, speaking jovially about morbid things wasn't always her style. \"Probably never really knowing what happened to the rest of my family. For sure, anyway.\" She moved her piece, the top hat, forward three spaces, consequently passing 'GO'. Wichita, who was acting banker, passed her two hundred dollars of real money. No further comments were made in regards to her response, but the others were in silent agreement. It was better for their sanity if they simply presumed their other family members were dead, like the rest of the world seemed to be; the thought that they could be out there somewhere, waiting for their loved ones to remember them...it was too much to even consider. \"Shooting Bill Murray,\" Columbus said suddenly, bringing everyone out of their thoughtful trances. \"I guess that would probably be the worst thing. For me.\" It was a complete lie, as a sea of memories came flooding back to him; his first encounter with the new zombie population, running for his life every time he had to leave a building or vehicle, seeing other people being eaten alive while he managed yet another lucky escape... \"Losing Bob,\" Tallahassee sighed. \"Oh, that's his puppy,\" Columbus explained to the two sisters, noticing their identical expressions of failed recognition. Winnfield gave him a strange look, as though she was not impressed, but he didn't notice. If he had of, it might have dawned on him earlier that Bob was not of the four-legged variety. \"I never thought I could love anything the way I loved Bob,\" Tallahassee went on, \"The day he was born I just lost my mind. He had my personality, my appetite, my laugh...\" Columbus, who had been staring down at his pile of money awkwardly, not really comfortable when faced with the emotions of other people, glanced over at the brute he had generally feared since their first meeting, confused by the last characteristic he had mentioned. He had seen a lot of bizarre things in Zombieland, but a laughing dog still seemed unlikely. Winnfield watched, almost able to count down the seconds to his exact moment of realization. \"We made this wallet together out of duct tape,\" Tallahassee said, pulling the item out from his pocket. Columbus felt so ashamed of himself. This whole time he had thought that Tallahassee's sole loss had been a puppy; like a person who slaughtered zombies so mercilessly couldn't possibly have once had a family of their own. To the surprise of them all, Tallahassee started to cry. He picked up a few notes from is pile of earnings and dabbed at his eyes. Winnfield, who lay beside him propped up on one elbow, patted his shoulder in an attempt to console him. He gave a nod of appreciation and cleared his throat. \"Woo, I haven't cried like that since'Titanic',\" he said, appearing completely recovered from his moment of vulnerability. And since the mood was completely ruined, they abandoned the board game and each went off to find some other way to occupy themselves for the rest of the night. Before they parted, they looked at each other with suspicion. They each had the same priority before doing anything else, and that was to find a shower and spend a good twenty minutes or so scrubbing off the grime that Zombieland had insisted on covering them in. Since Wichita had called shower-shotgun the moment they had stepped inside the mansion, and since each member of the group respected the law of the shotgun call, she was allowed to walk away and find the nearest shower without dispute. With one quick, evaluating look at the remaining three, Little Rock took off after her. Winnfield, Columbus and Tallahassee eyed one another, considering their own next move. Columbus decided to back down and wait for his turn, while the other two prepared to slug it out (not literally of course...well, maybe) to see who would get the upstairs shower. It seemed likely that with such a huge, expensive house, there would be multiple stations for bathing on each floor, but Winnfield assumed that all the downstairs bathrooms would run on the same water system, while all the upstairs bathrooms would run on another, meaning only one person could shower on each floor at any given time, unless they didn't mind the water fluctuating between boiling and freezing every few seconds. As if someone had shot off a starting gun, the pair took off up the staircase. Winnfield, with the better cardio of the two, remained in the lead for most of the race, until Tallahassee decided to trip her up. He made sure to catch her before she hit the ground and really hurt herself, but as soon as she was down, he leapt over her and ran on ahead, leaving her scowling in the hallway. He found her sitting on the bed that was just outside the bathroom he had been using, and took the opportunity to show off what parts of him he could as he held onto the towel that was wrapped around his waist. \"Just gotta get my clothes,\" he said casually, walking –okay, strutting – past the bed towards the pile of stuff on the floor. She nodded and pretended to look indifferent. \"Hurry up, alright?\" she said as he re-entered the bathroom. As any delusional man would have, he took her words completely the wrong way, thinking that she wanted him to hurry up and join her, when all she wanted was to use the shower. Of course, she could have used one of the other bathrooms, but that was just not the way Winnfield did things. By the time he finished getting changed, Winnfield had left the room, boredom overriding her need to mess with another person's head. She was wandering through the other rooms of the upper floor, while Tallahassee thought she had gone downstairs to get a few props; maybe some wine, a few candles... Moving down to find her, he instead found Little Rock, abandoned by both 'budding couples', shooting at a bunch of plates she had set up along a table. If you could call what she was doing 'shooting'; she hadn't hit one target. His curiosity over Winnfield's behaviour nearly won him over, but he couldn't just stand there and watch someone be that horrible at shooting a gun. Sighing, he approached Little Rock, taking a seat on the chair beside hers, and watched her miss yet another shot. \"A hint?\" he offered. She looked over at him incredulously, that expression that most tweens seemed to carry on their faces when addressed by someone above the age of their latest teen idol. \"Exhale slowly, then squeeze the trigger.\" Her expression unchanged, Little Rock gave no sign that she had taken his advice, but secretly disheartened by her abilities, did as he suggested. She hit a plate on the first attempt. Tallahassee nodded and she couldn't help but grin. They spent the next fifteen minutes or so getting in a little target practice and setting up new items to destroy whenever they ran out. Tallahassee had nearly completely forgotten about the reason he had originally gone downstairs, but the female in question presented herself moments later, washed and dressed in clean clothes. She stood and watched them, arms folded and an amused look on her face. \"Want a turn?\" Tallahassee asked. Winnfield thought about it and then shook her head. \"I think I might just go back up to that room.\" Once again misinterpreting her words, he put down the gun and failed to notice her yawn. Running her hand through her half-dry hair, she turned and stalked back up the stairs, towards the bedroom, intending to get a good night's rest before the next day coughed up a medley of new problems for them to face. Tallahassee took off in search of Columbus. He had an actual reason to, but really it was just to brag. He found him browsing through the house's wine collection, his hair still on the damp side, yet still managing to look even curlier and boofier than before. He eyed the older man with caution, pulling out a bottle at random, looking at the label and deciding that it would do for his purposes. \"What's up?\" he asked Tallahassee, when it became apparent that he was waiting for him to ask. \"Alright, here's the deal,\" he began, with a serious expression, \"I may or may not – leaning more towards may - be getting laid tonight. So if you keep those two sisters occupied, I'll owe you one. I swear. I mean, I'll give that little one a new gun to play with or something so that you and her sister can get a little better acquainted, know what I mean?\" \"You and Winnfield?\" Columbus asked. \"Yee-ep. Looks that way. I saw it. They get this look. It's all in the eyes.\" He fluttered his fingers in front of his face to suggest this. \"Isn't that what they say about, like, crazed chimpanzees just before they rip their owner's face off?\" \"Same thing,\" Tallahassee nodded, \"It's instinct.\" \"Wait, so she hasn't actually told you that she wants to, uh, do anything?\" Tallahassee pursed his lips and considered this. \"Well, no. But like I said; instinct. In a pack of lions, the alpha male always knows when one of the lionesses is in heat.\" Columbus frowned at the analogy. \"Look, I ain't asking much\", the self-proclaimed 'alpha male' said, \"Just take one for the team.\" He slapped him on the back, nearly knocking the bottle of wine from his hands, and then turned to go find his waiting lady. He paused in the doorway, and then turned back, collecting a bottle for himself before leaving once more. Columbus stared after him, tapping the neck of the wine bottle into his open palm thoughtfully. Then Tallahassee's words struck him in a strange way and he started towards the last place he had seen Wichita. \"What happened to Florida and Louisiana?\" she asked, when he eventually found her in one of the many random rooms of the house. \"I think they might be...uh...'putting Percy in the playpen' \", he replied. \"Really\", she said in a way that was quite judgmental, \"How long have they known each other? Like, a week?\" Any hopes Columbus had had about what could happen between them in the next few hours were thrown out the window with those few words. But he noticed a playful look in her eyes and, further confused, took a seat next to her and began serving the wine. Winnfield lay on the same bed as earlier, propped up on the many pillows it had to offer, all of which were soft as marshmallows. With heavy thoughts plaguing her, she had little interest in what Tallahassee had planned, but he was feeling too ambitious to notice. \"Hey,\" he said, failing miserably at sounding smooth as he lent against the doorframe, beverage in hand. Winnfield smirked at his cheesy behavior, but didn't make any moves of her own; physical or otherwise. He approached the bed and sat down next to her, taking in her shorts and tank top with as much subtlety as he could manage. \"Thanks,\" Winnfield said, sitting up as he passed her a glass of Bordeaux. She noticed he had only brought one glass, and then watched as he proceeded to take a swig from the bottle. She didn't know what it was with guys, but they all seemed to have an issue with using a glass. She thought of the number of times she had told off one of her own brothers for doing the exact same thing; a thought that filled her with a sudden guilt, considering the current state of things. They drank in a comfortable silence, but with Tallahassee present the silence never lasted long. Sure enough, he put the bottle down on the nightstand and moved a little closer to her before saying, \"Sooo...\" Winnfield polished of the last of her drink and passed the glass to him to put beside the bottle. He was about to get her a refill, when she declined with a guilty expression. \"Hass, there's something I need to say.\" He immediately grew more interested, edging closer once more so that they were now almost touching. \"Yeah?\" he smiled, waiting in anticipation, willing and able. He leaned towards her and she turned her head away. When she looked back at him, she seemed determined about something. \"I decided I'm gonna head off on my own.\" Ignoring the look of utter devastation on his face, she went on, \"I'll leave tomorrow morning, before anyone else is awake, that way I can just sort of… disappear.\" \"Why? I mean...Look, was it something I said? The flushing thing? I was joking about that. I'll flush.\" \"No. It's just...What I said earlier about not knowing for sure about my family? It got me thinking. I've got to go out and look for them. My brothers are tough bastards, they taught me everything I know. I know they're out there somewhere. They never back down from a good fight.\" \"So you're just gonna bail?\" he asked. He sunk back into the pillows, momentarily distracted by their softness. There were so many things he wanted to say to keep her around, but they all contradicted his 'No Attachments' rule. Had he really expected that they would stick together? No. In Zombieland, no matter how big your group was, it was still every man, woman and child for themselves. \"I'll probably run into you again somewhere down the road. It's a small world.\" She smiled sadly and got up, turning to gaze at him for a moment before leaving the room. He wasn't sure where she had gone off to, and he didn't bother to find out. He felt absolutely gutted. The only thing he could think of doing, was going to make sure that Columbus didn't have any better luck than him that night.[Chapter 12] THIS USED TO BE A FUNHOUSE BUT NOW IT'S FULL OF EVIL CLOWNS When the sun finally rose the following day, it was as though you could almost hear Edvard Grieg's Morning Mood playing gently in the background. Not that Tallahassee would've known the song, let alone enjoyed its classical style, but once in a while there were mornings when the survivors would wake up and forget for a brief moment that the world they had once known had indeed come to a sudden, gory end. Columbus and Tallahassee were spared this moment for once as they were startled awake by the sound of slamming doors and screeching tyres. It took them a moment to comprehend the meaning of these sounds, then they both sprinted to the front door in time to watch the two sisters driving away in the yellow Hummer. As the car disappeared out the front gates, Columbus threw his hands up in defeat and turned to Tallahassee, who was surveying the yard, shirtless, with a look of indifferent acceptance. \"You are like a giant cock-blocking robot, developed in a secret fucking government lab!\" Columbus cried, surprising Tallahassee with the amount of anger in his voice. He stormed back into the mansion, intending to gather up the few items he usually carried and leave Tallahassee and Winnfield to their own devices. \"Well, it's not like I got a lady hanging off my arm either, is it?\" Tallahassee finally replied, following him to the room they had slept in. Columbus, who had been doing a mental inventory check of his things, looked up with a frown. \"What do you mean?\" \"The Winnfield thing didn't really work out. She left last night.\" Columbus would never actually admit it, but he was disappointed to hear this. The part about her leaving, that is. He couldn't care less that Tallahassee hadn't managed to 'go twenty toes' after all. Winnfield had begun to grow on him, even with all of her disturbing antics. \"Besides, who says it's my fault that you and Witch -ita didn't happen? You weren't exactly stormin' the trenches before I came along.\" Columbus gave him one last glare before moving to another room. He needed somewhere quiet to plan his next move. He needed to find a working car with enough fuel to get him somewhere. Anywhere would do. He spent a while looking for a big road map, finally coming across one in the bottom draw of a desk in one of the many random rooms around the house. He stared at it, a red marker in his hand poised to mark out his next route, but after twenty minutes he still didn't know where he was going to go. Where was there to go? According to Tallahassee, everywhere was the same desolate, corpse-ridden wasteland, so what was the point? He sighed and set aside the items for later consideration. He woke up nearly six hours later, eyes widening when he realized he had left himself so vulnerable without even knowing it. True, he hadn't slept well the night before because of the Wichita fiasco, and he had been left feeling like the walking dead (no pun intended) when he had been rudely thrown into consciousness by the sounds of her driving away, but he was sure he had never been so stupid as to fall asleep in an unsecured area without a weapon handy. He heard noises coming from the other room and decided to investigate, picking up the closest, heaviest item he could find, which happened to be a bust of Jabba the Hutt . He crept into the front room and found Tallahassee piling up random items, readying them for transport into whatever vehicle he found next; in other words, looting. There were a few new additions to his already 'attractive' outfit, including a beer helmet and a snakeskin jacket. Somehow, on Tallahassee, neither of these things looked odd. \"You know what they call Twinkies in Mexico? 'Los Submerinos',\" Tallahassee told him, as though the little argument they'd had earlier had never happened. \"That's where I'm headed, amigo.\" \"Whatever,\" Columbus replied. He realized he still hadn't figured out what he was going to do, where he was going to go. Then it dawned on him. He thought about the night before, sitting with Wichita, laughing and talking and just feeling comfortable with each other. He had never really had that with a girl before. He knew what he had to do. \"I'm going after Wichita.\" Tallahassee, who was in the process of carefully leaning a large portrait of Bill Murray against the wall, alongside the other items he planned on taking, shook his head. \"Did you ever read that book She's Just Not That Into You ?\" he asked, taking off the beer helmet and replacing it with his usual hat. \"You can't make yourself too available.\" Columbus frowned. Taking dating advice from Tallahassee seemed like taking diet advice from, well, Jabba the Hutt. He looked down at the bust in his hand, wondering why he was still holding it, and then tossed it into the adjoining room, ignoring the smash as it hit the marble floor. \"I don't care. I just wanna be with her. Have fun in Mexico. Say 'Hi' to Winnfield if you ever see her again.\" The last part was admittedly a little harsh, but he wasn't in a particularly charitable mood. He headed towards the garage to see what vehicles there were to choose from, refusing to say another word to Tallahassee, who was doing the same thing. While Tallahassee began loading a few items into a large SUV, Columbus spotted a motorcycle between the expensive looking cars, and, after uncovering a helmet and leather jacket (safety first!), waited while Tallahassee forced the garage door open. The snakeskin-clad man turned to him and almost looked sorry that they were parting ways. \"I'm not great at farewells, so, uh...that'll do pig.\" \"That's the worst goodbye ever. And you stole it from a movie.\" Columbus put the helmet on and rolled his eyes, approaching his chosen mode of transport and mounting it. Tallahassee checked that his stolen goods were secured and watched Columbus start up the bike and ride it out of the garage. But that's as far as he got. With next to no experience with motorbikes, he steered it right into a cluster of bushes that sat adjacent to the garage door. With the little dignity he had left, he scrambled to his feet and brushed himself off. Both Tallahassee and Columbus jumped as a burst of laughter echoed through the large parking space. From somewhere inside, a car door opened and slammed shut. Winnfield appeared from behind a fast looking sports car. Tallahassee did a double take as she approached him, and when he was sure it was her, he smiled broadly, his eyes lighting up a little. \"How long have you been sitting in there?\" Columbus called to her, throwing his helmet to the ground and pulling a twig out of his hair. \"I was going to leave at first light, but then I fell asleep. I guess you boys woke me up. You sound like bulls in a china shop, I ain't even kidding,\" she replied. \"So what's going on?\" \"You ain't goin' to find your brothers?\" Tallahassee asked her. \"They can wait\", she replied, \"I finally decided that it's best to stick with the people that I actually know are alive.\" The others nodded. \"Where're we headed?\" Columbus and Tallahassee exchanged looks and shrugged. \"Looks like we're goin' to Pacific Playland\", Tallahassee said. Winnfield held up a finger to say that she would be back in a moment, and soon reappeared with her trusty duffel bag (now a little heavier with the books she had taken from inside the house) and he rifle in hand. \"Alright\", she nodded, \"Let's go.\" Each with a smile on their face, they climbed into the car, completely underestimating the situation the two sisters had gotten themselves into. They began to feel that something wasn't right, when they passed through the streets of Los Angeles without encountering a single zombie. Not even a straggler, or an incapacitated crawler. \"What the hell is that?\" Winnfield, who was seated in the back for once, climbed forward and pointed towards some bright lights in the distance. \"That's not...I mean, they wouldn't have...would they?\" They each leaned forward and cocked their heads at the sight in wonder. \"Oh, frickfrack,\" Winnfield said, receiving strange looks from her two companions. But that pretty much summed it up. When they got closer to the theme park, their suspicions were confirmed. The sisters had, for God knows what reason, turned on all the lights, sounds and rides in the park, consequently luring all the zombies in the area like moths to an enormous, bright flame. A bright flame with jaunty tunes and crudely made stuffed-animal prizes. \"Hey, Winnfield?\" Tallahassee asked. \"Already there\", she replied, gathering up all the guns and ammo she could find and making sure every weapon was loaded. Columbus took the shotgun and sidearm she handed him. \"This is not going to be pretty.\" They were well prepared before they even arrived at the gates to the theme park; Tallahassee sporting an elaborate gun holster over his snakeskin jacket, Winnfield adding multiple single holsters to her pants and over her t-shirt, while Columbus was trying his best not to soil himself as he spotted the amount of undead swarming their destination. \"Still sure you want to do this, kid?\" Winnfield asked, leaning forward once more to pass Tallahassee a few extra clips of ammo. Columbus nodded, at first hesitant and then with more vigour as he thought about what was at stake. Winnfield clapped them both on the shoulder and sat back, putting on her seatbelt. Tallahassee brought the car to a halt a few hundred metres away from the park and got out of the car. He surveyed the situation as best he could under the dim glow of the streetlights, while Winnfield realised only then that the city's back-up generators must have kicked in some time during the night. She relayed this thought to Columbus, who nodded as though he hadn't thought about that either, and then he took off his leather jacket to allow his arms to move a little more freely. \"I think they might actually require our assistance this time,\" Tallahassee said as he climbed back into the driver's seat. \"What are we looking at here?\" Winnfield asked, checking the barrel of her gun to make sure it wouldn't jam at a crucial moment. \"I'm gonna say a couple o' hundred, easy\". Winnfield sighed and nodded at the bad but somewhat predictable news. \"Buckle up,\" Tallahassee warned his passengers, before slamming his foot down on the gas pedal. \"Time to nut up or shut up.\" They sped towards the open gates, where a few clueless zombies had congregated, too distracted by the pretty lights to be thinking about the two potential meals that lay inside. Tallahassee picked up a small machine gun and with a twist of the steering wheel, sent the car into a full spin, shooting out the window and taking out all the surrounding zombies in the process. \"Holy shit,\" Columbus commented, his heart racing a thousand miles an hour as his body mistook the stunt for a near-death experience. Winnfield made a clear sound of approval and poked her head out the window, looking around at the pile of the now definitely -dead. Tallahassee backed the car up over the corpses, (just in case), and then drove forward over them once more before continuing in the direction of the 'damsels in distress'. \"You know,\" Tallahassee said, glancing from Columbus to Winnfield, \"My momma always told me that someday I'd be good at something. Who would've thought that something would be killing zombies?\" \"Probably no one,\" Columbus replied. Winnfield chuckled. Once they were inside, Tallahassee stopped the car once more and they all got out. While Winnfield placed a few handguns in her holsters, Columbus ran towards some nearby railing, beyond which sat dark, sparkling water. Something yellow caught his eye and he realized that it was their old Hummer, the one that the girls had taken. It was almost completely submerged. \"Oh no. No, no, no, no,\" he pleaded. If they had still been in the car...maybe they had been run off the road by a horde, or maybe drowning had seemed like a better way to go than being eaten alive. Winnfield approached to see what was wrong, and just as she spotted the car, they both heard shouting from the other side of the fun-park. Columbus was the first to spot the two sisters, who appeared to be stuck at the top of one of the rides. From the looks of things, they were lucky to be that far off the ground, as a massive group of zombies had gathered around the base. Relief swept through Columbus and he turned back to his zombie-slaying pals. \"Hey, they're up there,\" he said, pointing with his shotgun, \"They're okay.\" \"Well, what are you waitin' for? Go get your gal,\" Tallahassee smiled. The pre-zombie-slaughter adrenaline was starting to kick in and he was raring to go. He turned to Winnfield and they gave each other a nod and a confident smile before setting off in opposite directions. Tallahassee began blasting an air horn, drawing the zombies' attention directly to them. A massive group headed for him, but he wasn't fazed, whipping out his machine gun and mowing them down in quick succession. \"Holy shit,\" Columbus commented, as he watched in awe, and then, as he spotted another horde heading right for him, \"Holy shit!\" He took off at a sprint, his well-developed cardio working in his favor, as it always did. Not too far away from where Tallahassee was currently kicking some major zombie ass, Winnfield found that she was actually able to stop running and take up a leisurely stroll. None of the zombies had followed her. She would have to go to them.[Chapter 13] EVERYBODY LOVES A CLOWN, SO WHY DON'T YOU? Heading back to the original starting point, Winnfield found Tallahassee's air horn discarded on the ground. She picked it up and looked around, unable to see any of the others in the area. She could hear gunshots coming from somewhere, which could either be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on who was doing the firing. Tallahassee had apparently taken all the zombies with him, and she pushed a sudden nagging concern to the back of her mind as she thought of the situation he had gotten himself into. Her own ammo clip was still full and was asking to be emptied. She spotted a straggler lurching around near a dumpster and with a sly grin, she tossed the air horn away and slowly approached it. Taking up her gun and lining up the kill shot, she became so engrossed in the task that, by the time she heard the deep, hungry growl, it was too late. There was not time to move from the reach of the cold, gripping hands that latched onto her shoulders, and she gave a small shriek of surprise. She would have clamped her hand over her mouth if one of them had been free to do so, but the zombie had her on the ground in a second. It was directly over her; what had once been a male in, perhaps, his forties, was now a decomposing monster trying to sink its yellow teeth into her throat. During the fall, her gun had been knocked from her hands, as always seems to be the case whenever someone is put in a situation where the weapon becomes their only means of defense. She looked over at it, finding it too far away to reach without having to let go of the zombie, which would then give him a clear shot at her straining ligaments. For the first time, she actually wished to be rescued; she didn't care if she lost BAMF points because of it. All she wanted was to see a knight in snakeskin armor appear from around the corner, who would pull the zombie off of her, help her to her feet and not make a big deal out of it. But that didn't happen. The undead brute continued to vomit blood and puss onto her clothes while she thrashed about to keep the foul liquid from dripping onto her face. The commotion attracted the zombie from beside the dumpster, which began a slow journey towards her. She saw that, somehow, both its ankles were snapped off to ninety-degree angles, making it near impossible for it to move any faster. She cried out again, this time in exertion, as she pushed as hard as she could to get the more pressing danger off of her, but it seemed more determined than she was. It tightened its grip and, for a second, almost reached its teeth to her collarbone. One last instinct kicked in and, without thinking, she kneed it in the balls, (or, at least, where they used to be). This seemed to do the trick, though not in the way it would when performed on a living man, as the zombie fell a little to the left, freeing her right arm. Her freed hand shot out and grabbed her revolver from its holster. Turning her head away to avoid most of the splatter from such a close-range shot, she pulled the trigger, and finally felt the zombie's hands fall away from her. She rolled towards her shotgun, picked it up and, keeping the momentum of the movement, got onto one knee. \"Yeah, I got a proposal for you,\" she growled, the absurdity of both her position and the situation taking its toll on her, \"Fucking die!\" Her shot rang out, and the zombie with the weak ankles slumped to the ground, its splattered brains adding to the graffiti on the wall behind it. The gunshots she had heard earlier seemed even closer from her new position. Getting to her feet, she took off at a slow sprint, hoping to run into a decent shootout. Something on a window caught her eye as she passed what had once been a small snack shop. Glancing around and seeing no zombies in her current vicinity, she shouldered her weapon and headed inside. The store room was on her immediate left as she entered, the door conveniently left unlocked. She opened it slowly, her revolver ready for any sudden movement. A scurrying of fur made her jump, but she had a strong trigger finger and managed to keep from shooting blindly into the murky space. She felt around the wall for a light switch, and when she finally happened across one, she flicked it on to reveal several rats running into a small hole in the floor in the corner of the room. She shook her head and began scanning the boxes on the shelf for the one that held Tallahassee's Holy Grail. It was directly in front of her. Grinning like an idiot, she pulled one of the little cakes out and stared at it, wondering how it could mean so much to a full-grown man. She put it in her empty holster for later, having decided to keep the revolver handy because a one-handed weapon was easier to move with. Wondering how far away the car was, Winnfield made to grab the box, but found that she had put herself in a vulnerable position yet again. Thankful that she wasn't completely cornered, she leapt out of the storeroom, pulling the door shut behind her to keep out curious flesh-eaters, and vaulted over the front counter, aiming her pistol at the zombie that stood in the store's entrance. Her first shot hit it in the cheek, leaving only a graze, but her second shot made it through the side of its head. Hearing a cluster of footsteps heading straight for her, she shot indecisive looks from the exit to the awaiting box of Twinkies, before her logic kicked in and she left before she could be ambushed. The onslaught was over in a matter of minutes, though it felt like it had taken much longer. While on the lookout for the two boys, Winnfield had come across Columbus, who had given her a little, awkward wave before finding himself face to face with a clown zombie. As much as she would have loved to stay and watch him fight it, if only for the novelty, she continued on her way to find Tallahassee. She followed the trail of bodies. In any other circumstances, she would have found this mode of tracking rather disturbing. Then she came across a scene of absolute massacre. And she was impressed – 'turned on' being too strong and weird of a description for that particular moment. Tallahassee stepped out from inside a small game booth that was now filled with exploded stuffed toys. He twirled his two handguns, holstered them, and gave her a mischievous grin. She found it hard to resist returning the smile, so she gave in, brushing a piece of hair out of her eyes before placing her hands in the small of her back in a gesture that said 'So-ooo...' \"How's about we see how the kid's fairin'?\" he asked. He climbed onto the roof of the structure and then reached down and offered her a hand to help her up. \"So, how'd you go?\" he asked once they were both up and watching Columbus finally rescue his girl. \"Uhhm...I nearly died once,\" she replied, as though she were trying to make her own escapade sound far more exciting than it really was. \"Yeah? You got a little-\" He reached forward and gently brushed a bit of brain splatter from her cheek. Not wanting to make the moment awkward by staring, Winnfield looked back towards Columbus, who was locking lips with Wichita in his moment of triumph. They both felt a sort of pride in the kid, who had come far since they had met him. Sure, he was still a skinny, nervous, maybe-virgin; but he was one step closer to not having his virginity speculated about, and that was something. \"Aww, little fawn's become a buck,\" Tallahassee said, \"He'll beat off to that for six months.\" \"I'm gonna go get the car,\" Winnfield said, after responding to his comment with a raised eyebrow and a quick laugh. She moved over to the edge of the roof, sat down with her legs over the edge, and then pushed herself off, landing smoothly below. Tallahassee watched her as she moved back towards their original starting point, pretending to have not been staring at her ass when she looked over her shoulder to check if he was following. She took off at a jog when she spotted Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock coming back from the other side of the park. When she reached the car, she began checking it over before proceeding to the backseat after recalling Columbus' list of rules. Aside from the small space she had made for herself on the drive to Pacific Playland, it was crammed with random items from Bill Murray's house, all of which were beyond unnecessary. She managed to stuff most of them into the back, to make room for the two additional passengers. In the duffel bag of guns that Tallahassee had kept from the Hummer, she came across a couple of additional handguns, which she placed in the pockets on the back of the two front seats, just in case; you never knew when you'd need a loaded gun handy, as she had so recently discovered. She was soon joined by a very bored looking Little Rock, who leaned casually against the open car door. Winnfield, who was currently leaning at a weird angle, looked under her bent arm at the young girl. \"Need some ammo?\" she asked her, noticing the careless way she was holding her weapon. \"Yeah. Thanks,\" the youngster replied. Winnfield guessed from her tone that the 'Thanks' was both for the ammunition and for coming back for them. Wichita joined them not long after, also receiving a clip of ammunition from their blood-splattered companion. Winnfield sat sideways on the edge of the car seat, her feet dangling out to the ground. She glanced down at her t-shirt and nearly gagged when she saw the mix of blood and thickened pus. \"Hey, could you guys do me a favor?\" she asked the two girls. Moments later they were standing with their backs to the door, arms crossed as though on guarding something, while Winnfield changed out of her soiled clothes. Using a bit of water from a bottle she found on the floor, and a small, clean portion of her bloody t-shirt, she managed to clean the rest of the muck from her stomach, too. She threw on a new shirt from her own luggage, and climbed out of the car, thanking the sisters for their assistance. \"Where the hell are the boys?\" she asked. Wichita nodded towards the little cafe Winnfield had searched earlier. She nodded knowingly, hoping they would discover the box themselves. When a gunshot sounded from inside, Winnfield jogged over to see what the trouble was. She found Columbus outside the storeroom with an apologetic look on his face as he watched Tallahassee sift through the remains of the box of Twinkies that Winnfield had nearly saved earlier. Winnfield shot Columbus a questioning look and he shook his head like he didn't know how it had happened. \"Itchy trigger finger?\" He nodded, guilty. \"Do you think you can just, maybe, pick out the buckshot and eat around it?\" he asked the crestfallen man-child from Florida. Tallahassee shook his head and gave the exploded cakes up for lost. The sound of an engine roaring to life distracted them from the tragedy of lost desserts. Columbus' eyes widened and he sprinted outside, uttering \"No, no, no!\" The sisters were driving off again. After everything they had done for them, they were just going to slip away and leave like they had so many times before? Of course not. Wichita brought the car to a stop and leant out the driver's side window, grinning mischievously at her admirer who couldn't help but smile back. It was a mean trick, but he had to admit, it was sort of funny after everything they had been through. Winnfield came out of the cafe, closely followed by Tallahassee, and she was struck by a thought. She reached into her holster and brought out the Twinkie she had stuck in there earlier, turning to show him the last survivor from the box that Columbus had fired on. His expression melted into disbelief when he saw it, and he stepped forward to take it from her, changing his mind at the last moment. Instead, he took hold of the woman herself and dipped her back, planting a big, bristly kiss on her lips. When he brought her up to her feet again, her cheeks were flushed and she looked a little dazed, but she seemed happy nonetheless, passing him the cream-filled cake which he eagerly accepted. He ate it slowly, savoring the taste of what could be the last Twinkie left in the country, and watched Winnfield's face for her reaction to his unexpected action. Slowly, she smiled up at him. While all this was happening, the other three watched from the car. \"Urgh,\" Wichita commented,\" Finally.\"[Chapter 14] FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS \"So, where are we going?\" Little Rock asked. The five survivors glanced around at each other. They had left Pacific Playland about twenty minutes ago and had driven along in considerable silence for most of that time. Now, with Wichita behind the wheel, Little Rock riding shotgun, and Winnfield, Columbus and Tallahassee in the back, choosing a destination seemed like a good idea. \"Ladies' choice,\" Tallahassee suggested, \"and seeing as you two have already picked ... Winnfield? It's out of you and Columbus.\" Ignoring the childish insult, Columbus looked at Winnfield and gave a small nod: her choice. \"Alright, looks like we're headin' for my home state,\" she announced. \"Which would be...?\" Wichita asked. \"Louisiana,\" the three in the back replied in unison. \"For future reference, I only need one of you to answer. It's less creepy that way,\" Wichita frowned, though she had found it sort of cute. \"Do you have family there?\" Columbus asked Winnfield after a few moments silence. She nodded and then cocked her head to the side. \"Well, possibly.\" \"Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean...\" Wichita trailed off, not wanting to be too direct in case it came across sounding heartless; but Winnfield knew what she was getting at. \"Maybe it's not a good idea,\" she said, \"Maybe, instead, we should go to a big ol' amusement park when it's dark, and then turn all the lights on. That won't attract zombies or anything.\" \"Alright, you made your point. It's just ...\" \"How can I be sure there'll be any family left to find?\" Wichita nodded. \"If I know my brothers well enough, they'll be alright. My oldest brother, Lewis\" –she didn't seem to care that she had divulged a real name here – \"He moved to a little town outside Baton Rouge, just because it's called 'Slaughter'. \"'Welcome to the town of Slaughter'. Yeah, I could see that,\" Tallahassee thought aloud. Winnfield rolled her eyes playfully. \"How old are your brothers?\" Wichita asked casually. A little too casually, Columbus thought. With a furrowed brow and pursed lips, Winnfield did her best to recall the correct answer. \"Thirty-three and twenty...nine? Something like that.\" \"And you said you're the youngest? Aww, you're just a baby, then,\" Tallahassee said. \"I wouldn't call twenty-six 'a baby'.\" \"Twenty-six?\" Columbus asked. \"Do I not look that old?\" \"It's not ... I just thought ... You're not that much older than me, then.\" Winnfield shrugged in a way that asked what his point was. He waved his hand to dismiss his own comment, and then went back to staring out the window. \"Which way do you want to go?\" Wichita asked when they came to a large road sign that suggested multiple exits out of L.A. \"According to this map, we could take the I-15 and then change to the I-40 a few miles up,\" Columbus suggested, glancing over the map he had found in 'Le Mansion de Murray'. \"Nah, take the I-10,\" Winnfield told her, \"That'll lead take us back the way we came. At least we know that there weren't many zombies along that road.\" \"Could that not have changed in the last couple of days?\" Columbus asked. \"Besides, if we take the I-40, we'll avoid going through any major towns or cities for a while.\" \"But we'll end up driving along the Mojave.\" \"So?\" \"Which way is it?\" Wichita asked, growing steadily impatient with their bickering. \"Just take the I-40,\" Winnfield sighed. An hour later they were cruising along Columbus' chosen route with very little to do. 'I-Spy' wasn't very fun when all you had to choose from were 'road', 'sky' and 'barren landscape'. \"I could really go for a steak right now,\" Tallahassee said. \"Tell me you're kidding,\" Winnfield frowned. \"A nice, big, juicy steak, medium-rare - \" \"With a side of zombification?\" Columbus asked. \"Speaking of food,\" Wichita said, as Tallahassee continued to daydream about the lunch he wished he was having, \"Do we have any?\" There was an awkward silence before they realised that after all the surviving they had just done, they were now on an empty desert highway without any food or much water, and without a grocery store or gas station for miles. \"I think we should look for a mall,\" Little Rock suggested, only to receive disapproving looks from those in the car who had seen Dawn of the Dead. \"All we need is food. And a few medical supplies probably wouldn't hurt, either,\" Winnfield told her, before turning to look in the back of the car. \"We seem to be pretty well stocked in the random crap department.\" \"Hey, that stuff is not crap!\" said Tallahassee, returning her disapproving stare. She reached back and pulled out a novelty-sized Baby Ruth bar, giving him a look that read 'No, not at all'. She threw it back and borrowed the roadmap from Columbus. \"You got a marker?\" she asked him. They met a few lone zombies along the highway, which they ran down without stopping, and also spotted a few crushed corpses by the side of the road – a sight which gave them hope that maybe they weren't alone after all. But if any survivors had come this way before them, they had passed on to a better place. As the buildings began to grow closer together and there seemed to be less surrounding desert, the group kept their eyes peeled for somewhere to stop. They were dying for a toilet break since they had been drinking so much in an attempt to keep their hunger at bay, but by now there were growling stomachs all around. \"There haven't really been many zombies around on the roads,\" Columbus commented, \"Does anyone else find that weird?\" \"Are you complaining?\" Wichita replied. He shook his head, but he was right – the roads were eerily empty. It was as though someone had gone through and cleared out the living dead for them, like a protective convoy that they couldn't see and could never catch up to. \"I never did see any army cars or soldiers or anything like that. You'd think that they would have been out dealing with all this,\" Wichita thought aloud. \"We found a tank,\" Columbus told her, smiling as he recalled Winnfield's suggestion to drive it through the streets and blast anything they came across. \"Just after you guys, uh, stole our car.\" \"Yeah, sorry about that.\" \"Sure,\" Tallahassee sniffed, as if he was still hadn't forgiven the sisters for making off with his self-modified Cadillac. \"Hey, I think I see some stores up ahead,\" Columbus announced, pointing past a row of houses, down towards the end of a street they now found themselves approaching. They parked a short way down from the line of stores to give themselves some running space in case they came across a crowd of undead-shoppers. A run-in seemed unlikely in this particular neighbourhood, but it was a precaution that would pay-off should they find themselves surrounded and in need of a chance to create some distance. As soon as they left the car, they spread out in a horizontal line with Wichita and Tallahassee on the far left and far right respectively, keeping an eye on the surrounding alleyways and front yards, while Winnfield ran on ahead to scout out the street corners. \"All clear,\" she called back to them. They jogged up to meet her, keeping their weapons pressed close to them, and began their shopping experience from the leftmost store, which happened to be bakery. The shopfront was splattered with blood and a dark, thick material that they would rather not have to think about too much. Moving on to the next shop, they found a small boutique that was more than likely filled with overpriced jewellery and, for some unknown reason, dozens of pairs of leather driving gloves. Once again, they skipped it and moved on. Tallahassee and Winnfield, who had managed to get ahead of the others, stopped in front of the next store simultaneously, though for very different reasons. \" Aphrodite's Closet ,\" Wichita read from the store's front door, \"Tacky name.\" Whilst she and Little Rock moved on, Columbus paused, momentarily mesmerised by the mannequins in the window which were clad in the laciest, 'barely-there' undergarments he had ever seen. He had never thought that he could ever be attracted to an inanimate object – though at one stage he had feared he might end up one of those boys with only 'polyester girls' for company – but these mannequins were quite detailed. Finally urging himself to follow the real flesh-and-blood girl of his dreams, he risked a quick glance at Winnfield, who was staring intently into the store. Tallahassee was looking from her, to the lingerie and then back again, as if waiting to see if she would go inside the store for a better look. If she did decide to, he would be going with her...for defensive purposes only, of course. \"Come on you guys!\" Little Rock called from the grocery store at the far end of the lot. She and her sister had managed to wedge open the previously-automatic doors and were keeping them ajar with a few massive bags of dog food they had found piled at the front of the store. Winnfield stepped up to the glass and cupped her hands on either side of her face for a better look inside. It was then that Tallahassee realised she wasn't considering which silk teddy she would look best in; something was up. \"What do you see?\" Columbus asked, moving back towards her, his grip tightening on his gun. \"I thought...\" Through the dark gloom of the store, all was still. She was sure that something had moved in there. But maybe several hours cooped up in a car on a desert highway, without any food, had something to do with that. \"Guess not,\" she decided. She suddenly scrunched her face into an expression of discomfort. \"What is wrong with you?\" Tallahassee asked, giving her a strange look. \"My bladder is about to burst,\" she replied. She looked around and spotted a public toilet block not too far from where they were. Little Rock followed her gaze and then hopped nimbly over the makeshift doorstopper \"Bathroom break,\" she agreed quickly, heading towards the public block. Columbus' third rule for surviving Zombieland began flashing in his mind like a giant Broadway sign: BEWARE OF BATHROOMS! Catching his worried expression, Winnfield said, \"I doubt we'll run into anything in there. I mean, zombies are more the roaming type.\" \"Marauding,\" Tallahassee corrected her, \"Marauding for flesh.\" \"Right. Besides, I've seen more horrifying things than zombies in public restrooms...\" They hurried after Little Rock, who fast approached the small brick building, and hesitated outside, taking in the peeling paint and roof covered in bird-droppings, before splitting up and heading towards the appropriate entrances. Columbus decided to go in first for once, raising his weapon to meet whatever might lay in wait ahead of him. The men's' room was empty, but the flickering light inside only added to the creepy atmosphere. In the ladies' room, Winnfield fared just as well, though she found herself hoping that the dark smears on the walls actually were zombie blood. She, Wichita and Little Rock screwed up their faces as they saw how dirty the bathroom was; but they had little other choice. No one particularly felt like venturing into one of the suburban homes, where real danger was most likely prowling. \"Urgh, I know we're in the middle of an apocalypse, but really ?\" Wichita said, checking one of the stalls and looking back to the others with her hand clamped over her mouth and nose. \"This one down the end is the cleanest,\" she told them, \"But that's not saying much.\" Winnfield, who had gone first, since she was making even weirder faces of discomfort by that time, waited outside for the two sisters to finish up. She found Columbus leaning back against the wall by the entrance to the men's room, looking quite thoughtful. \"Seen anything?\" she asked him as she walked over. \"No,\" he replied, \"It's weird, you know? I keep thinking maybe they've, like, congregated somewhere and this massive horde will just come running around the corner at any moment.\" Winnfield chuckled. \"'Congregated'? Like they're organised?\" Columbus smiled sheepishly and shrugged. \"Who knows what they're capable of?\" \"What did I miss?\" a voice asked very close to Winnfield's ear, warm breath tickling her neck. She jumped and spun around. \"Jeee-sus, Hass! You wanna end up like your friend Mr. Murray?\" \"Alright, let's do this,\" Wichita said as she and Little Rock came out from the restroom. Winnfield jabbed Tallahassee in the side with her elbow and followed them back to the grocery store. A horrific stench hit them the moment they ventured inside. Since they were all fairly familiar with the smell of corpses and zombie muck by this point, they quickly discerned that they weren't about to be faced with a scene of mass slaughter. It was the stomach-churning stench of off milk. Winnfield actually gagged. \"Let's be quick about this, shall we?\" she suggested, receiving nods of mutual agreement. Spotting a rack of neckerchiefs, she grabbed one and tied it over her face, bandit-style. Stepping back in line with the others, she looked determinedly towards the back of the store, now ready to face the vomit-inducing smell throughout the rest their shopping experience. \"You look like you're about to rob a bank,\" Columbus told her. She threw him a sideways glance, cocked her gun, and started for the first aisle. Ten minutes later, they emerged from the store laden with several bags of supplies. Despite the sour milk smell following them through every aisle, the majority of their harvest was actually cereal, which had the advantages of being both lighter and more convenient than cans of food – especially once you divided it into smaller, portion-sized bags – and kept for a surprisingly long time. Since Little Rock was the only one not carrying anything, she now had the role of lookout, though if any danger were to present itself, they would all have dropped their bags and drawn their guns. They weren't about to make a twelve year-old take on a zombie by herself. Tallahassee, who was already outside the store, held his hand out to Winnfield as she stepped up onto the mound of pet-food bags. Smiling, she pulled the neckerchief down off her face and accepted, allowing him to help her down. \"Okay, so if we keep taking turns driving, we should be in Louisiana by tomorrow night,\" Columbus said as they all headed back to the car. Then they froze. The ominous tolls of a church bell echoed through the empty town. \"What is that?\" Little Rock asked, managing to cover up most of the fear that was slowly spreading through her. \"Did anyone see any churches on the way in?\" Winnfield asked. Columbus shook his head, gazing off in the direction he thought the sound might be coming from. \"Alright,\" she said, \"We'll dump this stuff in the car, and then the three of us will go check it out.\" \"The three of us?\" Wichita asked. \"Columbus, Tallahassee and myself,\" Winnfield replied, adjusting the weight of her bag of groceries, which was balanced on her hip like a small child. \"Wait, why do we have to stay behind?\" Little Rock frowned. \"Someone has to watch the car,\" Winnfield lied. Her real concern was leading such a young girl into either a scene of mass carnage, or otherwise into some kind of danger involving crazed survivors that had been forced into fear and isolation. Even though Little Rock had already been exposed to some pretty horrible things, if she could prevent a kid from having to witness anything more, she would take that opportunity. \"What do you think it is?\" Columbus asked as the three amigos headed off on their investigative expedition. \"Sanctuary! Sanctuary!\" Winnfield replied, spreading her arms out above her head. Tallahassee gave her a weird look. \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame? No?\" she tried. \"I think you might have spent a bit too much time up on that roof by yourself,\" he told her. They crossed over a small intersection and spotted the church, an old brown-brick building that had probably been hand-built by the first townspeople centuries ago. There were a couple of cars parked on the road in front of it, neither of which looked in any way damaged. The three glanced at each other. \"Could mean more survivors,\" Winnfield said. \"Yeah, well we aren't taking in any more strays,\" Tallahassee replied. \"Gee, thanks.\" \"Not what I meant,\" he said, raising his hands in defence. \"Wanna take different entrances?\" he suggested. They considered this for a moment and then decided that it was probably a good idea. Start at different ends and then meet in the middle; all bases covered. \"Can we have a code word in case one of us gets into trouble?\" Winnfield asked. \"How 'bout 'Holy shit, there's a zombie over here!'\" Tallahassee replied. Winnfield frowned. \"I'm not going to say 'Holy shit in a church. What kind of person do you think I am?\" \"If one of us yells, I'm sure we'll figure it out,\" Columbus told them. At this point he was itching to get inside. In the past he would have avoided this kind of potentially dangerous situation, but ever since his heroics at Pacific Playland, he had begun to realise that maybe he was braver than he thought. \"I'll take the back entrance,\" he said. Tallahassee chuckled immaturely at this, though over the sound of the church bells it was barely audible. What they did hear, though, was a sudden shout from above. \"Hey!\" They spun around to face the bell tower, shielding their eyes from the harsh midday sun. The caller was a man who looked to be in his mid-thirties. He waved down at them from a window just below the row of bells that dangled from the very top of the tower. In his free hand he held a rifle in his, but he didn't appear to want to use it on them. \"Uh, hi,\" Columbus replied. \"You scared the shit out of us!\" Winnfield called to him. \"What?\" he asked. \"I said you scared the shit out of us!\" \"What? Sorry,\" the man said, \"I can't hear you over the bells.\" Winnfield cupped her hand to her ear to show that she hadn't heard him. \"The bells!\" he shouted. She rolled her eyes and nodded to him that this was obvious. He gestured for them to wait a moment, and then disappeared from the window. Tallahassee, who was steadily becoming suspicious of the whole situation, raised his gun and stared at the door at the bottom of the tower. Of course, since he had found Winnfield by herself the first time they had met, he didn't really have any reason to mistrust someone simply for being a lone survivor. The chiming had stopped now, much to the relief of their ears, and the heavy, wooden door creaked on its rusty hinges as it was pushed slowly open. Tallahassee put his hand on Winnfield's shoulder and stepped up in front of her- a gesture she found slightly offensive, as though he thought she couldn't defend herself. Apparently kissing someone made them suddenly in need of your protection. \"Whoa, what's with the gun?\" the man asked him, holding a hand up to show he didn't mean any harm. After a brief moment's thought, Tallahassee lowered his weapon. \"I tell you,\" the man continued, throwing a cautious glance at him before turning his attention to Winnfield, who looked the calmest of the three, \"It's nice to see some living faces. I wanted to stop you all from goin' inside the church. Ain't nothing you want to see in there, believe me.\" \"What's in there?\" Columbus asked, curiosity getting the better of him, though he looked concerned about what the answer might be. The man shook his head in a sorrowful way and looked over at the quiet church building. \"About thirty or so people decided that a church is a real fine place to barricade themselves during a crisis like this. Only they didn't realise that a bunch of them had been bitten by these things. So, as you can imagine...\" He shook his head once more. \"Jesus.\" \"Right you are,\" he said. \"They made it so nothing could get in, but in the end none of them got out.\" \"How did you survive?\" asked Winnfield. \"Sheer dumb luck, that's how. I decided at the last minute to go back for my rifle and came back to find that they'd locked me out. Most of 'em were hysterical by then, and there's no reasoning with people when they're like that, you know?\" She nodded, recalling the last few moments as she had driven out of her neighbourhood in her brother's car; people running themselves into literal dead-ends, screaming and giving up their whole world for lost. Throw humanity into chaos and suddenly everyone loses the ability to function. \"So I headed on up to the tower, locked myself in and settled up under the bells. It's a real nice sort of bird's nest to shoot from. The sound took a bit of getting used to, though.\" He ran a hand through his receding, pale-red hair. \"Are they...automated?\" Winnfield asked, unable to see how anyone could be bothered to ring the bells manually. \"Oh, yeah. I set them to ring at noon every day. It used to bring in a lot of ghouls, but I think I've just about cleared them out. I've got the whole place to myself, pretty much.\" He smiled and scratched thoughtfully at his whiskered jaw. \"Where are you guys headed?\" Before she answered, Winnfield received a warning look from Tallahassee: No more strays. Not that they had any room in their car, anyway, but she agreed. Going from no attachments to four had been a harder process than it appeared. But as easy as it was to be a lone wolf, being in a pack had its advantages – mainly the fact that you got to talk to someone other than yourself. \"We're headed east, actually.\" \"Don't tell me it's 'cause you heard that there aren't any villains down that way.\" Doing her best to push out the images of evil cloaked men with pencil-moustaches running around the eastern states, Winnfield managed to shake her head. She threw Columbus and Tallahassee knowing looks; they were well and truly past that stage by now. East, west, north, south; it didn't matter – zombies weren't known to abide by hearsay. \"Well, good luck. Like I said, it's just nice to see some actual people passin' through.\" \"We're the first you've seen?\" \"Oh no, a few have passed through, actually. Yeah,\" he nodded, slowly turning back towards his awaiting tower. With those few words, hope suddenly found its way back to Winnfield; hope and relief. All this time she had thought they were the only people left in all of the US. When she thought about it now it seemed kind of silly. \"Oh, also\", he said, turning back as he stood in the doorway, \"Feel free to help yourselves to any supplies around the town. I'm pretty well stocked up.\" He smiled, nodded and made his exit, pulling the door closed and sliding across a heavy deadbolt. \"Well that was-\" \"Weird?\" Columbus tried. \"I was going to say 'interesting', but that did feel kind of surreal,\" replied Winnfield, \"What are the odds, huh?\" \"What, did you think we were the only ones left?\" Tallahassee asked them. \"I would've cried for humanity,\" Columbus replied. \"You would cry over anything, Shirley,\" Tallahassee said, slipping his free hand into Winnfield's.[Chapter 15] LET'S TAKE THE ROAD OUT TO THE COUNTRYSIDE, MY DEAR WHERE THE MOUNTAINS GO FOREVER AND THE BIRDS ARE ALWAYS NEAR. WE'LL BUILD A BETTER LIFE, WE'LL LEAVE THE CITY FAR BEHIND US LIVING WHERE THE OUTSIDE WORLD WILL NEVER FIND US... STOCKPILING WEAPONRY \"You and Columbus...Are you guys like 'together' now, or...?\" \"It's not like we're dating or anything. But, you know...I like him.\" Taking advantage of the warm western weather, Wichita and her little sister lay on the front of the car, soaking up nearly enough sunshine to forget that they were in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Nearly, but not quite. \"He did save our lives,\" Wichita went on, re-positioning herself on the hot metal. \"Yeah,\" Little Rock agreed. \"The other two definitely are.\" \"Florida and Louisiana?\" She thought about the kiss back in Pacific Playland. \"Yeah. That's obvious.\" \"They're weird.\" \"I think that's the attraction,\" Wichita smiled. \"God, I wish those bells would stop already. It's almost as bad as listening to Tallahassee's music for three hours straight.\" A couple of minutes later, the sound did stop; only to be replaced by a sound far worse. It was pure luck that the chiming ceased when it had, otherwise the two sisters might never have heard the hacking cough before it was too late. Expecting to see a familiar face, Wichita sat up and took off her sunglasses. \"Do you hear someth–\" Little Rock began, but Wichita was way ahead of her. \"Holy crap!\" Grabbing her sister's hand, she pulled her to the other side of the car, using the vehicle as a shield between themselves and the approaching creature. In its current state, it looked far from anything that had once been human. Its face appeared to have been torn off, perhaps by another zombie moments before it had succumbed to its undead fate. One of its arms was missing from the elbow, leaving only a shiny white nub protruding from the shreds of flesh that had once been part of a forearm. One of its feet were also missing, leaving it to hobble slowly towards its prey. Arguably its most disturbing feature, though, was the long hair that grew in patches on what was left of its scalp. It was very thin and very hungry. After the momentary shock of having something like that creep up on you, Wichita's nerve picked back up and she lined up what she hoped would be her first and only shot. It struck it in the collarbone, causing it to stumble back a few steps, but doing little in the way of stopping it. \"Here!\" Little Rock said, holding her hand out for the gun. \"I've got it,\" Wichita told her, taking another shot that this time hit it in the shoulder. With an angry sigh, she lined up her third shot. Little Rock, meanwhile, had given up on her sister's skills after the first failed attempt. She moved to the backseat of the car and took out one of the rifles. Back at her sister's side, she followed Tallahassee's shooting advice, which had yet to fail her, and took out the zombie clear through head. \"Nice shot,\" Wichita told her, genuinely impressed, \"but I would've had it. It's just, with this sunglare...\" \"Sure,\" Little Rock replied. The two sisters exchanged smiles and got to their feet, deciding not to get too comfortable in case of another surprise attack. By the time Winnfield, Columbus and Tallahassee returned from their little outing, they found Wichita sitting Indian-style on the bonnet of the car, a rifle across her lap. They could just make out the top of Little Rock's head as she fiddled with something in the front seat. \"She's trying the radio,\" Wichita explained when she saw Tallahassee craning his neck for a better look. \"I doubt she'll find anything but, you know, it keeps her entertained.\" \"You guys run into trouble?\" Columbus asked, spotting the flattened zombie not far from the car. \"Nothing we couldn't handle,\" Wichita smiled, raising the rifle and using the butt to push herself off the bonnet. \"So I'm not going crazy!\" Winnfield said, kicking the mangled corpse in the head, \"I did see something in that store.\" \"What was the mystery noise?\" Wichita asked Columbus, drawing his attention from the odd southerner. \"It was a guy,\" he told her. \"Some guy locked himself up in a bell tower and makes the noise to attract zombies.\" \"Wait, an actual living guy?\" The three nodded. Not wanting to look too surprised by this news since, like the others, Wichita had been under the impression they were likely to be the last survivors in the country, she gave a casual nod. \"Oh.\" \"Whatcha doin', kid?\" Winnfield asked, stepping over to the driver's side window while Columbus and Tallahassee continued to relay the story to Wichita. \"There are like no stations at all. No music or anything,\" Little Rock replied. She twisted the radio dial all the way to the right, paused, and then all the way to the left. \"There was this one guy on here. I think he was a priest or something.\" \"Really? Hey, scoot over.\" Little Rock obeyed, climbing over into the passenger seat and readjusting it to an upright position. Winnfield got into the car and began playing with the dial, listening carefully for even the slightest sign of life. Nothing. Dead air. Yeah, that sounded about right. \"You drivin'?\" Tallahassee asked suddenly, leaning in her window. \"I guess so. Kid's called shotgun.\" Tallahassee moved to the next door and hopped in. Winnfield waited while a smiling Columbus and Wichita finished up their conversation and got in, too. A little while later, after a brief lunch break, they were back on the main highway, heading for New Mexico. They were barely fifteen minutes across the border when Columbus and Winnfield began arguing directions again. Driving into or near a capital city was not a good idea, and the thought of it went against Columbus' every instinct. Winnfield, on the other hand, was willing to charge through Albuquerque, guns blazing if necessary, just to cut time off their trip. She was so close to her home and her brothers that she could almost taste it...not literally, of course. That would be weird. It eventually came to a point where they had to pull over. While Columbus and Winnfield stood at the front of the car with the big map spread across the bonnet, discussing numerous alternative routes, and Tallahassee went to the side of the road to relieve himself, Wichita took a couple of muesli bars out for her and Little Rock. She glanced up from tearing open the wrapper, as Winnfield raised her voice a little outside. She couldn't quite make out what the two were saying, but Winnfield looked ready to hit something. More likely someone . Tallahassee sauntered over and made as if to wipe his hand on Columbus' face, breaking into laughter along with Winnfield. She tossed him a bottle of Purell she had 'borrowed' from Columbus and turned her attention back to the map, where Columbus was now marking out a new route. Wichita couldn't help but notice the way that the three stuck together, sort of like an exclusive group of survivors that she and her sister had become the third wheels to. They had their in-jokes, shared experiences and even an odd sort of bond for such a rag-tag bunch. As she munched on the fruit and oat bar, she couldn't help but wonder how things might change if they were to find Winnfield's brothers. If they ever got around to actually driving to Louisiana, that is. Columbus and Winnfield appeared to have reached an agreement, as Winnfield playfully held out her hand to shake on it. Columbus, slightly confused, reached out to take it, but instead Winnfield pulled him forward and ruffled his hair, grinning as she then snatched up the map and got back into the driver's seat. Since Little Rock had climbed into the back with her sister, the front passenger seat was freed up once again for Tallahassee, who automatically claimed the space beside Winnfield. The new chosen route added almost half a day to their trip, but Columbus was convinced that in the long run, avoiding all the major cities and towns would be in their best interest. Winnfield wasn't exactly pleased with the plan, but Columbus had a way of convincing her with all that logic of his. But it was Columbus' decision that would lose them their car and all their supplies. They just didn't know it yet. Entering a town called Truth or Consequences, Winnfield nearly missed the big burning house to her left. She had just driven passed it when she threw the car into reverse and stopped right out the front. They all stared at it for a couple of minutes, entranced by the movement of the flames, when they all heard something that sounded a lot like a kid crying. \"What the hell?\" Winnfield said, her eyes widening. \"Guys, I think –\" Columbus began, but Tallahassee was already out of the car and making a beeline straight for the building. Wichita paused for a moment before following suit, Little Rock not far behind her. \"Wait, where's everyone...Didn't you guys see Jurassic Park ? Get back in the car. It could be anything!\" Winnfield growled as they all ignored her, turning to see what Columbus was going to do. He gave her a 'What? Don't blame me!' look and shrugged. \"It sounded like a kid,\" he reasoned. \"You know what else sounds like a kid? A zombie that used to be one.\" She sighed, irritated by yet another delay, and picked up her shotgun. \"Are you coming or what?\" Columbus quickly undid his seatbelt, and grabbed the nearest gun, jogging after her. They found the other three around the back of the house, each of them disarmed. A man had Little Rock by the neck, a gun pointed to her head, and a little boy of about six years by his side. The boy's cheeks were wet with crocodile tears. As they rounded the corner, Winnfield's natural instinct kicked in and she aimed her shotgun right at the man. \"Whoa, now. No one needs to get hurt here,\" he reasoned, \"All we need is your car and whatever you got in it. There ain't any supplies around here and I ain't about to let my boy die. So what's it going to be?\" \"Pardon?\" Winnfield asked in disbelief, her eyes darting around as she tried to assess the situation as best as she could. \"Drop the gun or I start shootin'. Startin' with this one.\" Although she could tell he was every bit serious about doing it, Winnfield could see tears forming in his eyes – desperate times call for...well, you know the rest. She glanced over at Wichita, who was silently begging her to do what the man asked. When she locked eyes with Tallahassee, she knew she didn't have a choice. She hesitated and then dropped the gun. \"Kick it over here,\" he said, tightening his grip around Little Rock as he gestured for her to hurry up. Her lip curled up into a sneer as she did what he said. The man looked to Columbus, who had already dropped his weapon, and nodded for him to do the same thing. Wichita could feel Columbus' eyes on her as he stood behind her, and as if the thoughts from his overactive mind had somehow drifted into hers, she realised how screwed they really were. This guy was going to leave them with nothing. He took up their guns, giving a few to his little boy to hold, had the nerve to thank them, (though it seemed to be out of polite habit, not out of spite), gently released Little Rock, but in his hurry knocked her to the ground, and then ran for the car, which Winnfield had left running in case they needed to make a speedy exit. She was kicking herself for it now. While Wichita helped Little Rock to her feet, checking if she was okay, Winnfield turned towards the road. As if he'd read her mind, Tallahassee put a hand on her shoulder to stop her, only to be met with a stormy look as she shrugged off his grip. \"I'm just as pissed as you are, probably even more since the guy managed to jump me first, but you go out there now and he is gonna shoot you. He don't wanna, but he ain't gonna ask questions first when he's got a kid to look out for. And I don't wanna be buryin' you.\" Winnfield's expression softened after a moment's thought and she nodded. \"I would smash the crap out of that house's widows right now, if it weren't already burning,\" she said. \"Speaking of which,\" Columbus began, \"We should probably...\" \"Yeah,\" the others agreed, jogging across to an adjacent field just as the flames hit a gas tank, sending a fireball into the sky. They collapsed beneath a tree, all except for Winnfield, who decided to take out her anger on the oak. A few cuts and splinters later, she rejoined them. Tallahassee got to his feet and looked down at the others. \"Alrighty, first things first. Weapons,\" Winnfield said. \"What?\" asked Columbus, shielding his eyes against the sunlight as he looked up at her. \"We aren't gonna sit around and mope for the rest of the apocalypse. We've come this far, so yeah. Weapons.\" \"I think I see a farm down there,\" Tallahassee told her, pointing in the direction they had been driving. Little Rock dried her face on the back of her sleeve and got to her feet, trying to cover up a sniffle as she said, \"Alright, let's go.\" \"Wait, that guy said that there aren't any supplies for miles,\" Columbus said, standing up and brushing the dirt from his jeans. \"He also said, 'Hi, random strangers. Thanks for handing me all your supplies without a fight'. We might as well try. I don't see any other choice, really.\" Wichita was the last person to get up, her eyes filled with tears as she thought of how close she'd come to losing her sister; basically the only thing she had to live for anymore. Columbus looked over at her sympathetically, not really sure what he should do. Hug her? Comfort her? Offer her his condolences? Catching his awkward expression, Wichita got to her feet and pretended to be alright. \"One thing the asshole didn't get...\" Winnfield began. She pulled their map from her back pocket, waving it with a big grin. \"At least we'll know which direction to not find supplies in.\" The only half-useful thing they managed to find at the farmhouse was a working tractor, which Winnfield jokingly suggested they could use to dig their own graves. Columbus and the sisters decided to brave the derelict house, but as they tried to push open the front door they found the water-expanded wood stuck fast in the frame. As Columbus tried one last time to throw himself against it, doing nothing but bruising the hell out of his shoulder, Winnfield hopped up onto the porch and slid open one of the front windows with ease. Since she and Tallahassee were able to see the potential-weapon in almost any object, they decided to search an old wooden shed out the back of the homestead, discovering a bunch of rusty tools that seemed to disintegrate the moment you touched them, as well as a few monster-sized spiders that revealed one of Winnfield's weaknesses. Tallahassee, of course, found this hilarious. Winnfield jumped about a foot in the air as she felt a tickle on the back of her neck, slapping away whatever it was that was causing it. Tallahassee grinned and dropped the piece of straw the moment she spun around. \"Asshole,\" she said, heading around the back of the shed to see if they'd missed anything. He chuckled and went after her, gently running his fingers along the back of her neck as he snuck up behind her. \"I swear to God...\" She turned around tried to grab his arm, but he moved out of her reach. A different look crossed her face now and this time he stayed completely still, allowing her to wrap her arm around his neck and kiss him. This kiss felt a lot more serious than the one they had shared at Pacific Playland. Slowly, they stepped backwards towards the shed until Winnfield was right up against it. She paused for a moment to check for spiders, then, after a brief exchange of smiles, went right on back to kissing him. He felt like a teenager who had snuck out to play hooky with the girl next-door. Only instead of awkward hand placement and quick, desperate lip-locking, they were both experienced adults who knew just the right buttons to press. But just as he was sliding a hand under her shirt, they heard the others calling them from the farmhouse. They stopped, both amused and disappointed by their luck, and stepped away from the old shed. Winnfield – who had a few new splinters to add to the ones she had gotten from the oak tree – walked on ahead, turning to offer him a mischievous smile. He had to pause for a moment while he got his breath back, then walked after her with a big, silly smile plastered on his face. \"You guys find anything?\" Columbus asked the pair when they reached the front of the house. \"Nope,\" Winnfield replied, running her hands back through her hair. Wichita was the only one who noticed her adjust her shirt, which was a little askew. \"We might have more luck in the next town over,\" Columbus went on, leading the way down the road. \"I found this,\" said Little Rock, holding up a rusty kitchen knife. \"Problem with rust in this place, or...\" Winnfield commented. Tallahassee reached out for the weapon, presuming Little Rock was showing it to them because she had intended on giving it to one of them, but he was wrong. \"Nah-uh. Get your own,\" she told him, going to catch up with her sister, leaving Tallahassee to scowl after her. \"Come on, ya big lummox,\" Winnfield told him with a grin, \"It's not like it's the end of the world.\" A/N: Just a quick note. This is the last of the material I had written. I had forgotten I even made it past the movie plot. I have a lot of other stories on the go right now, so I'm not in a hurry to update this one. I'll see how it goes, though. Thanks in advance to those who decide to like or review. xx Edit: Having read the chapters I have past the film's storyline, I remembered I had a whole sequel planned for this story. I think if I receive enough interest in the original story, I could start working on new chapters, however the second half would be written in a completely different tone to the movie. Whereas the original story was relatively playful, the second half I had planned is quite dark - it would include finding Winnfield's remaining brothers and staying on their property for a while; Winnfield's oldest brother getting between her and Tallahassee, and Wichita showing interest in Winnfield's other brother, causing tension between her and Columbus. But like I said, I'd like to see if there's any interest before adding to my already-full workload when it comes to writing. If any of this sounds interesting to you, let me know in the reviews section. Thanks. xx ","Summary":" THERE SHE WAS JUST...HITTING GRENADES FROM A ROOFTOP. SINGING DOO-WA DIDDY DIDDY DUM DIDDY-DOO.

History class is… boring. And growing up in the 2025 isn't exactly the most interesting. So as my teacher continues to blabber on about how the missile crisis in Russia is one of the most horrible events to happen in modern history, I can't help but stare out the window and hope that something interesting happen for once. I lived in a modern day house. The interior changed often, which was no surprise if you had met my mother. Jessica Starr was one of the most impulsive women of today. She was very popular, had a lot of friends and a lot of house parties. Which could be fun at times, except when I'm trying to finish homework. She's also a genius, she has two different occupations and balances them out equally. Everywhere she goes people know her name, but I've never been able to figure out why. She always tells me to live life to the fullest, because you never know what's going to happen. Some days I can't stand her, but… she's my mom. And I have to remember that she is who she is. My dad wasn't always around. Don't get me wrong, my parents love me each other… a lot. But Dad works all around the world, and was currently in Germany working on some science shit no one understands. Sometimes I miss him, but what can you do? \"Do you want to order pizza tonight?\" Mom asks me. \"Sure,\" I say, not even taking the time to look up from my Algebra homework. \"Taco?\" She asks. \"You know it.\" I grin. I frowned at the equation in front of me. Damn exceled classes. \"Do you want help?\" My mom must have seen the concerned look on my face. I slide the paper over to her, confident she would never find the answer. \"Seven point eight five.\" She says in record time. \" What? \" I ask, bewildered. \"Y equals seven point eight five.\" She says slowly as if talking to a five year old. \"Come on Lumi you knew that.\" \"…Of course I did.\" I say pulling the paper away from her. She laughs, \"You're definitely my kid.\" \"Shut up .\" I groan. Mom went back to the kitchen to continue cleaning dishes. I closed my book and put the paper in my backpack. Now I could finally relax. I got up and walked to the living room. It was filled with marshmallow chairs, a pretzel sofa and all the other candy themed furniture pieces. My mom was crazy, and I accepted that. I pick up the Oculus and grab the controller. I turn on Dead and Still Killing, and continue chopping zombies' heads off from where I last left off. I turn my head to face the next ugly bastard when- \"Hey Lumi?\" I jumped, tripping over the coffee table and landing with my feet in the air and my hands holding me up from the floor. The Oculus fell from my eyes and I realize I'm still in my own home, where my mom isn't fighting zombies but stains on dirty dishes. I force my legs past my head and roll up so I'm standing normally. \"Yeah, mom?\" I ask breathlessly. \"Everything okay? I was just wondering if you've seen your brother around…\" She says, finishing up the dishes. \"Yeah. Hansel wasn't at school today. Again.\" I mumble the last part. \"God damn it, I'm calling your father.\" Mom says. This wasn't a very big threat, it's when she takes matters into her own hands that you should run. Run for your life. That's all I can do for now… Sorry for the inconvenience… Seeya soon! /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 2] Okay, sorry about that, I was in the middle of a class when I was writing that. So anyways, I hope you like the first chapter, which just gave a little introduction to the main character, Lumina Starr. OCs will gradually come in. I still want more… Okay, let's go!^.^ A loud alarm went off at six am. I roll over and turn my phone off. I hate getting up so early. It's awful. But it's school, what are you going to do? Somewhere in the house there was a crashing noise. I get out of bed and walk down the hall and into the bathroom. In the mirror I can see my mom picking shards of glass. \"Shit.\" She says under her breath. I pretend I didn't hear anything and continue to get ready for school. I grab the clothes I had laid out on the couch in my room and shut my door. Somewhere in Russia... \"Faster!\" Mama yells. I hurl myself over the barrier, landing on one knee and sliding behind the steel wall. Grabbing the gun slung behind my back, I shoot at the targets on the other side. Suddenly the lights brighten and the targets slide into the floor, the walls and barriers disappearing into the floor. \"So?\" I ask. \"Could be much better.\" Mama says taking the gun from me. \"I am sorry.\" I apologize. \"But… you did well, Evangeline.\" Mama pats my head and we head up the elevator. The fireplace in our living room was more than just something to heat the house, but also a disguise to the secret elevator going down to the crisis room. But now that was gone for the night, a warm house filled with expensive arts and sculptures. Hot chocolate was sitting on the coffee table. Sebastian must have left it for us. Vlad was studying some papers while sitting on the couch. The house was quiet now. Minneapolis, Minnesota… \"Mom! I'm going to be so late if you don't hurry up!\" I groan. This was not the first time she was the source of my delay. \"Just a second, Lumina.\" My mom said in a very impatient voice. \"This can wait. We need to leave now. \" \"Lumina!\" She barks. \"I'll be there in a second.\" She says in a more calm tone than before. \"Just let me go wash my hands.\" I roll my eyes and open the door into the frozen wasteland. The brisk wind blew my hat backwards, my mom caught it behind me with lightning speed. Thank god she was finally ready. My mom could be a terrible driver. Sometimes she got so lost in thought that she'd forget what's right in front of her. But it when she drives right through a red light, I lose it. \"Jesus, mom! Would you pay attention and watch where you are going?\" I cry as she swerves to narrowly miss an oncoming car. \"I'm sorry, I didn't see…\" \"No! You didn't see! Maybe if you just pay a little more attention you would see! Maybe you would see that your son has become a delinquent! Maybe you would see how hard it is for your daughter that her father and brother aren't around anymore. You can't see that I need a real mom! God, sometimes… sometimes I just hate you so much! You know? You're just so… ugh.\" I realize we had very conveniently arrived at my school. I open the door and step out. \"Lumi, wait…\" \"I'm late for school, as usual.\" I say and shut the door before she says anything else. I know it's a little slow going, I'm sorry. I usually don't make the chapters this short…. They're around 1,000 words on a normal day. Anyways… see ya next time! /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 3] Sorry it's been so long. I kinda forgot about copy and paste... Haha...ha... So, well, here's the next chapter. Uhm so if there are a lot of mistakes, I'm using an apple product . Tick...tick...tick... Please, please make it end faster. This is so boring! Like, oh my god. No one cares about the freaking... Whatever we're talking about. There are way too many wars in the history of the world. Can't people just make peace? Something, anything happen! This boring old town needs some excitement. Tick... Tick.. Tick... \"Alright everyone, please pull out your notebooks and copy what's been written on the board.\" Mrs. Kyllier says. Most call her Mrs. Killer since her classes were just that boring. \"Just the highlited par-\" Mrs. Kyllier stops mid-sentence and hunches over a bit. She covers her mouth with her hand but that doesn't stop the red colored vomit from escaping her mouth. Quite a few students jumped backwards. Everyone was grossed out and one kid fainted. I sit, utterly disturbed and confused. \"Someone go get the nurse.\" The guy next to me says. At least we have one genius in this class. \"I'll get her.\" I say standing, and opening the doors calmly. I walk with a leisurely pace down the hall, waving at some passing friends. Finally after that terribly long and exhausting walk, I come to a set of doors, which opens to the Nurse's office. \"Hi, Gina.\" I smile. \"What's up?\" She asks. I wasn't sure if anyone else ever noticed, but I always thought our nurse was a little awkward. \"Our teacher's a little... Sick. It's kind of an emergency.\" I explain. \"Hmm...\" Is all she says as she gets up from the chair and walks with me trailing behind. \"It's Mrs. Kyllier's room\" I add. She nods and steps into the room, only to return and shut the door. A hand raised to her heart as if she were startled. \"What's wrong?\" \"Don't go in there.\" Gina shakes her head. Walking away quickly. \"We need to call for help now.\" I ignore her and open the door again. Something was obviously not right here. The chalkboard smeared with blood, the desks and chairs toppled over. Broken windows. The only students left in the room were lying motionless. Eyes wide. \"Help.\" I hear. I turn and see the guy who had said to call for help earlier, tucked in the corner behind a desk. I move toward him, careful for anything still here. \"What happened?\" I ask, kneeling in front of him. \"The teacher... She went crazy or something. Started... Eating... Everyone.\" He says, his face turns pale at the memory. \"We need to get you out of here. What hurts?\" I ask. \"Just my ankle. I should be okay.\" He says. I grab his arm and pull him up carefully, then swing his arm around my shoulder to support him. \"I don't know your name.\" I say as we make our way out of the classroom. \"My name's Grey. I'm actually good friends your brother. I've been to your house before...\" He trails off. \"Sorry. I don't remember.\" I say. \"We both know what this is. Don't we.\" He says suddenly changing subjects. \"What?\" I ask him. \"What happened to our class. You know what it is, don't you?\" He raises an eyebrow. I think for a minute. Then it his me. \"It can't be.\" I shake my head, not allowing it. \"It is.\" He sighs. \"We have just survived the beginning of the second zombie apocalypse.\" Don't hate me because it's so short!D,X I will make it up to you all I swear. But I'm tired. So goodnight everyone! /1_/1 (=U . U=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 4] Hello lovelies... I just realized I had said the year was 2025, but it's supposed to be 2029... Sowwy... Just warning you all, I do things like that ALOT. if you read ZCCM the first... you would know. Thanks Apostle13, I'm a little confused though but whatever... Your country says Irish... I'm going to assume that means Ireland... Thanks everyone for your reviews and such!^_^ Once again using an apple product for lack of a laptop, so spelling errors are inevitable. I swear to god when Lumina's name was not meant to be a pun. It was purely coincidence that her first name happens to be Luminous while her last name is Starr... I really just noticed that. Oh one more thing. I reeaally want a new name for this but I can't think of one... Any ideas? Anyone? Moscow, Russia \"Of course.\" I hear Mama say as she speaks on the phone. I'm hiding behind the couch so she doesn't see me eavesdropping, \"I can't believe this. It's been nearly no time at all.\" She says. \"They've hardly grown...\" I'm able to make out a female voice speaking frantically at the other end. \"What about Luffy? Is he on a business trip now?\" Mama says suddenly. \"I see...\" There's complete silence. Then something crashes to the floor, I can see little shards of broken clay scattered on the floor from behind the couch. \"No!\" Mama squeaks. \"That settles it then. I'm going to send Eve there.\" Me? What do I have to do with whatever's happening? \"I can't. I'm getting too old for this bullshit.\" Mama's accent thickens as she becomes more and more furious. \"Eve can handle this. I know she can. I've been preparing her for this since-\" She's cut off by the woman on the other end. \"I don't know. When Nel and I made the cure we didn't think... I don't know. I just don't know.\" She sighs heavily, sitting on the couch. The sudden change startles me and I scurry back to my room. \"Are you done packing?\" Mama huffs, leaning against the door frame. \"Yes.\" I say, grabbing my backpack. \"I don't know when I'm going to see you again. But we need to leave today, before the airlines are shut down. I know you'll be okay. I know I'm going to see you again.\" Mama pinches her sinuses, breathing in and then continuing, \"America is about to face the second apocalypse. Our goal is to keep it contained there, and kill it as soon as possible. I've raised you to be prepared for this moment since you were a little girl. And now it's time for you to fix things. I can't go with you, because I need to stay here and work on the cure.\" She sighs. Then grabs a folder, watermarked with the \"классифицированный\" which means \"classified.\" She pulls out what appears to be profiles of people. Shocked, I watch as she flips through different profiles. Odd names like Nicholas Cartier, Bradley James, Ophelia Tenebaum, and one I heard while Mama was on the phone last night, Luffy Starr. \"Here they are.\" She pulls out to profiles of a woman and her daughter. \"Jessica and Luminous Starr. If you see either of them, stay with them as long as possible. These are the only two people you can trust.\" \"I understand.\" I confirm. Somewhere between Minnesota and North Dakota (probably Fargo) \"Oh god.\" I say, kneeling over the poor, bloody boy on the side of the road. \"Oh god, what did I do?\" I cry. \"It wasn't your fault.\" Grey says, walking up behind me. \"He was standing in the middle of the road. There was nothing else you could do. Something was obviously wrong with the brakes.\" \"But... Oh this is awful.\" I sigh. \"I didn't mean to kill him.\" \"To be honest, Lumina, I don't think he was alive when he was standing there.\" \"What? How could that be?\" I ask confused. \"Look at these gashes.\" Grey says, pointing at several marks exposing his rib cage. \"That wasn't made by the car. That was made by...\" \"Someone infected by the disease.\" I nod in agreement. \"Still...\" I say with a horrible feeling in my stomach. The boy could have been no more than eight years old. \"It's gonna be okay.\" Grey reassures me. Then to my surprise he wraps his arms around me in a bear hug. \"I'm not going to let anything hurt you.\" I take a second to be warmed by him. The frigid air had chilled me to the bone. And it was nice to feel protected. Something black moved out of the corner of my eye. I pull back to watch as Grey is attacked from behind by the boy. His eyes grow big as his neck is broken, and his eyes fall shut. The boy takes a second to sink his teeth into Grey's shoulder, ripping out a hunk of flesh. I topple backwards and make a run for it. Grabbing the bat I had picked up earlier from out of the car, then returning to the horrible little boy. While he was occupied eating my friend, I whacked the hello it of him with rage. He turned on me. I ran to the other side of the road. The boy stood up a little wobbly. I heard a slight wooshing sound that was growing louder and louder... The boy crept closer and closer. There was no where to run, open fields for miles. The totaled car... This was it. But what was that sound? Then it hit me! Well actually it hit the infected boy. A truck sped past, tearing the boy apart but not stopping for anything. The vehicle disappeared from sight, and I was left alone with two dead bodies. I didn't feel it necessary for Grey to have such an unhappy ending. But I suppose he made it longer than the other kids in our class. But even so I thought he deserved a proper burial. I carefully dragged his limp body away from the road, and began to scoop mud up from the ground. I didn't care about staying clean anymore. It was life or death now. By the time the sun was setting I was able to finish burying Grey. Thankfully no other zombies had appeared while I was working. But now I had to find somewhere to clean up a little, stay warm, and sleep. Today was just not my day. I walked and walked and walked. The sun had set. I was freezing and tired and sad. But I suppose it's better than being dead. Grey was dead. A lot of my friends were probably dead. My brother was likely dead. My parents... Well my parents were probably dead, too. And suddenly that noise had returned. What was that noise again? Oh. Yes! There's still hope! I whip my head around to see two headlights decelerating as it nears me. \"Hiya!\" A cheerful, feminine voice says. \"Need a lift?\" She asks. \"Sure.\" I say, opening the passenger door and hopping in. \"Thanks.\" \"Where you headed?\" She asks. \"Anywhere but here.\" I say. \"What's your name?\" She asks, still cheerful. \"Lumina.\" I tell her. All this cheerfulness could really start to get on my nerves. \"My name's Phooka. It's nice to meet you.\" She smiles and starts the car once more. Okedoke. I got a little more done and introduced a new character!:D I might write later, might not. We'll see. It's snowing here. How about anywhere else? /1_/1 (=^ . ^=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 5] Hi again. I'm home sick today, which would explain all the writing. If I haven't gotten to your character yet, please be patient. I have a very specific way of doing things. U.U Sorry to make you all wait. Ah... Where were we...? \"My name's Phooka.\" The girl says, \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Nice to meet you, too.\" I mumble. We drive in silence as it starts to rain. The haze that had settled over my mind a few hours ago began to fade away as shock and worry began to set in. \"Sorry to be kind of a downer, but you know what's going on around here don't you?\" Phooka asks suddenly. I lift my head as I hear this. So this was going on in other places...? \"Yeah, yeah the... Infection thing right?\" I ask. \"Yeah. A little weird dont'cha think?\" She sighs as a city comes into view. She sure is awfully cheerful... It's starting to creep me out. \"It's happened before.\" I say, distracted by my thoughts. Was this city going to have the same problems? \"Huh?\" She seems surprised by this. \"What're you talking about?\" I was about to tell her when she cuts me off, \"Oh! Look! There's the city! Welcome to North Dakota!\" I look at the small town with their lights glowing. \"So this is Bismarck.\" I say as we hop out of the vehicle. \"I've heard a lot about this town. It's an interesting place.\" \"That's odd.\" She laughs. I didn't see what was funny about that... But okay. \"There's a bakery down this street, I go there whenever I visit.\" \"You live around here?\" I ask. \"Yup!\" She smiles. I expect her to say more but she doesn't. The bakery is nearly empty. A waitress was wiping the counter off with a rag. A man was cooking in the back. The aroma of coffee and apple pie filled the air. \"An iced coffee and the Apple Pocket.\" I say looking at the first item listed on the menu. I just want food. I'm so hungry. \"A scone and coffee please!\" Phooka says in a singsongy voice. I notice she leaves quite a big tip. She's so weird... \"So where are you from?\" She asks as we sit down at a table by the window. \"Minneapolis. I was separated from my family when this started... My friend was killed by one of the infected.\" I say keeping my voice low. I notice a tv mounted on the wall, in extreme convenience, the waitress turns the channel to the news. A red banner scrolls across the bottom of the screen. White letters read \"World Faces the Next Crisis!\" I blink twice as I finally start to realize this is all real. I had only been in a daze for the past few hours. \"Oh my god.\" The waitress says as she sets the food and drinks on the table. \"Oh...\" She rushes back behind the counter and into the kitchen. I sink my teeth into the apple pocket thing, which was just bread filled with apples. The coffee wasn't too bad either. The cook and waitress were arguing. As far as I was concerned that was never good for business. Their arguing ceases, and the waitress returns. \"I'm sorry we're closing for the night, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\" She squeaks nervously. \"But your sign says-\" \"Am I going to have to call your parents?\" She asks. Phooka and I share glances. Suddenly there's a loud thumping sound behind us. All our heads whip around and watch in horror as a man pounds his fists against the window, smearing blood all over the glasses. The waitress shrieks and we all jump backwards. \"Phillip!\" She calls, her voice shaking. The cook bursts out from the kitchen with a fire extinguisher and a pan. \"Here, Shelby!\" He tosses her the pan. \"There's more in the kitchen! Go quickly.\" Phooka and I run into the kitchen. A rusty pipe was lying on the floor next to the garbage. I grab it and notice the back door was slightly open. I rush to it and pull it shut. A force on the other side is trying to keep it open. \"Ugh! Shit! Phooka, gimme a hand here!\" I yell. Freezing wind chills the air through the door. She runs over and we both tug on the handle, toppling backwards as it shuts and automatically locks. \"Come on.\" Phooka and I stand up and run back out to the entrance where Shelby and Phillip are trying to open a panel with a crowbar. \"Give me that.\" I demand since they were having no success. To my surprise I'm strong enough to rip the thing right off. Let's get something straight. I'm a cheerleader. I lift 180 pound girls into the air daily. We are some of the strongest bitches out there. Respect the cheerleader. \"Thanks.\" Phillip huffs. He was just jealous that a sixteen year old was strong than a thirty year old, old man. I smirk at him. He pulls a lever and suddenly two metal blinds cover and close over the window. Bars shoot out from the wall barricading the door. This wasn't just some old bakery. Shelby pops some of the floor boards up and unlatches a metal trap door. \"Down here!\" She says pointing down to a flight of stairs. The four of us go down Shelby locking the door in place. A light flickers on to reveal a small hallway and crawl space. \"Hey, Phooka?\" I say. \"What?\" She asks. \"Do you remember when I said Bismarck was an interesting town?\" I ask. \"Yeah.\" She says, panicking a little. \"This is what I meant.\" I laugh. \"The tunnel ends here.\" Shelby says, opening a vault. \"I'm not sure what is on the other side of this door, so be prepared.\" We nod and clutch our weapons. \"Alright. One... Two... Three...\" The airports were so busy. These Americans were so loud and pushy. But I suppose this is a crisis, isn't it? A rental car was waiting for me outside. Nobody even checked my license. The keys were in the ignition. I only knew it was mine because it had my last name written on an index card inside the window. I start the engine and pull out of the parking lot. I pass a large mall, with the words: \"Mall of America\" on it. I had never heard of it. What makes it so great? Another big blue building with yellow letters spelling \"IKEA\" it looks more Swedish than English to me. I followed the signs leading me into the heart of Minneapolis. I started to look for the address written on the copied profiles that Mama had given me. 1712 Mount Curve Avenue, Minneapolis It is a big mansion with beautiful stonework. It definitely wasn't as big as our home in Russia, but it was very impressive. I park the rental car on the side of the street and climb up the gates between the house and me. I knock on the door several time with no luck. I push on it, and to my surprise it opens. The colorful interior of the house clashes with devastation. Furniture was tipped over and everything was a mess. Papers littered the floor. Weapons were scattered across the counter a note was left next to them. Dear Evangeline, Hansel, and Lumina, These weapons are for you. Take as many as you need. There are cars in the garage downstairs. Fire arms are in the back of the fridge. Don't ask... I went to meet Luffy at the airport. Lumi or Hansel... If you read this, please wait here. Be careful. Be safe. Stay alive. Love, Jessica/Mom I finish reading and grab the Emperor Katana lying on the counter. Then open the fridge. I pull a latch opening a secret compartment in the fridge. A gun rack appears and I grab the Model Governor with crimson tracing and laser grips. I swipe the holster belt off the kitchen table and make my way downstairs. The Marussia B2, which was clearly a gift from my Mama was my immediate choice. I pressed a button on the car to open the garage door. Bright light filled the garage. Here we go! Hehe Russia was a badass character in ZCCM the first, so I'm really excited to write for Evangeline! And everyone else of course. Uhmmm... I still want more characters if you haven't already done that!^.^ aaannd... Can't wait for next chapter, bye bye! ( )_( ) {=0 . 0=} (\")-(\")[Chapter 6] Hi! Sorry bout spelling mistakes, I swear one of these days I will actually use my computer. On with the show then!^.^ And so... Bright light founded into the dark, damp tunnel. On the other side was a room filled with expensive weapons and sturdy looking vehicles. The walls and floors were all white, any other furniture was made of steel. Except a red button sitting on a table in the center of the room. \"Wow. This is really cool!\" Phooka says cheerfully, checking out the table full of firearms. \"Yeah...\" I say, oddly mesmerized by a shiny axe. Two black little handguns caught my eye on the other side of the room. Smith and Wesson M&P; .40s, they were beautiful. And then... I saw it. The 2024 Viper. Black with a purple strip running down the left side. It was armored and still one of the most gorgeous cars I've ever seen. I open the door and sit in the driver's seat. \"Oh... My... God...\" I close my eyes and sigh happily. \"Are you sure this is the best choice?\" Phillips asks me through the window. I pop one eye open, \"It's a fucking Viper.\" \"You'll need something sturdier.\" I close my eyes and press a button I had noticed earlier. The outside of the car shifts and changes so that the car is safely protected by its gorgeous armor. \"It's. A. Fucking. 2014. Viper.\" Phooka hops in the passenger seat. \"Oh. You're coming with?\" I ask surprised. \"Sure! It'll be fun! Plus there's safety in numbers.\" She laughs. \"Alright.\" I say, starting the car. \"Well, good luck! Try not to die.\" I tell Shelby and Phillip. \"Thanks for the help!\" \"Hey wait a minute! I don't think you're taking this seriously enough!\" Shelby yells. I press the button to open the doors to the outside world and speed off, waving behind me to Phillip and Shelby. I have been driving for a very long time. I haven't seen anyone in hours. I haven't heard from Mama or anyone else. Only me... Only silence... And then two headlights appear in the fog. What's this? Someone else? I flash my brights and the car slows down just as I do. To my surprise it is quite and expensive car, just like mine. Do all Americans have cars like these? \"Wow, it's really nice to see someone else still living around here!\" A girl with dark hair jumps out of the car. \"Yeah. It's a rarity.\" The driver steps out. With her long dark hair and fierce eyes, she was unmistakable. This was Luminous Starr. \"You're kidding!\" Lumina laughs. \"That's crazy.\" \"It wasn't supposed to be funny...\" I say quietly. \"Don't be offended.\" Phooka lays a hand on my shoulder. Wow, Americans really are dumb. Who would have thought that the daughter of such a strong leader was this... Stupid. The Russian girl ended up following us after a long and funny conversation about this new apocalypse thing. We had been driving for quite awhile when we find the second vehicle of the night. A silver truck with a missing headlight. The car honks and we pull up next to it. The tainted window rolls down and inside is a boy with Snow White hair. And for some reason I recognized him, but couldn't think of where. \"Phooko!\" Phooka cries next to me. \"Phooka? Is that you?\" He stretches out of the window to see Phooka waving behind me. \"Wait. Why are you here? Who is she?\" \"Oh! This is Lumi! She's really cool. You two should be friends.\" Phooko and I traded glares. \"Anyways. I'm so happy I found you! I have been looking and looking. I don't know what happened but we lost each other. But it's okay because no I found you and-\" \"Phooka.\" Phooko says impatiently. \"Oh. Sorry.\" She sighs. \"I'm just so excited.\" \"I've noticed.\" He uses the same sigh. \"I have an idea! Why don't I ride with you, Phooko, and then we can follow Lumina!\" Phooka says bouncing up and down. \"Yes, Phooko, take the bouncy one.\" I urge. \"Fine. Get in Phooka.\" Phooko unlocks his truck. Phooka opens the door and runs around the side of the car, hopping into Phooko's truck. \"Onward!\" I say, leaving the others in the dust. At around noon the next day Phooko's truck broke down. We were in an old city with no (living) tenants. \"If there's a gas station or mechanic we can fix it ourselves.\" I say. \"It doesn't look like there's anything for miles. We could tow it but...\" \"You really should have picked a better car, Lumina!\" Phooka smiles. \"It's a fucking 2024 Viper!\" I hiss. \"Need any help?\" We all turn as we hear a strange voice. A young man with dark hair and contrasting eyes and skin walks up from behind a truck. How did we not notice him? \"When did he get her?\" Evangeline asks. \"We would love your help!\" Phooka says. Phooko crosses his arms and mumbles something incoherent. \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\" Russia says. I nod, smiling. \"Nice to meet you, too. My name's Logan.\" YAAAAAAAAAY I know you didn't think it was possibly but I spluttered out ANOTHER chapter... With two new characters! I think I'm writing too often now... Until we meet again... Auf Wiedersehen! {=+ - +=} (\")-(\")[Chapter 7] Hiiiii everyoooooone! I'm using a computer now!:D Yaaay! After getting acquainted and such, we were able to find the parts to load Phooko's truck onto Logan's. The empty town had proven to have no more than five (undead) residents left, and so we had to take care of that little problem. When we finally found a mechanic late the next day. We had set up a small camp and made a fire, seeing how the \"Mori's auto repair\" was in the middle of nowhere. It was dark and cold outside, we were all hungry, tired and homesick. Not to mention in serious need of a shower. \"Thanks again for the help.\" Phooko says rather reluctantly. \"Not a problem.\" Logan says. \"Hey would it be okay if I called you LT?\" Phooka asks. \"What? No! Why would you call me that?\" He asks. \"Logan. Tate. LT.\" Phooka says as if it's the most obvious thing in the world. \"How do you know my last name?\" Logan cries. This was all terrible confusing but really fun to watch. \"I saw your license.\" She smiles. \"How?\" He asks stepping backwards. He pulls a wallet out of his back pocket, searching frantically for something inside. \"Looking for this…?\" Phooka holds up the ID. \"How did you…?\" \"Here.\" She hands it back to him. \"Now I know everything about you.\" \"Why?\" He asks. \"Phooko gets really nervous around people he doesn't know, so I thought-\" \"Phooka that doesn't mean you steal other people's license. Or anything else for that matter.\" Phooko groans. \"Sorry.\" Phooka frowns. \"Is there anywhere we can find food?\" I ask, interrupting this little show. \"There's a town a few miles from here.\" Phooko says. \"Good. Let's go.\" I say, standing up and making my way towards the Viper. There's a loud crash behind me. \"Did everyone else hear that?\" \"It came from in there.\" Evangeline says, pointing at the mechanic shop. \"Impossible.\" Phooko says. \"We scoped this whole place out.\" \"Uhm… no… actually-heh- We didn't…\" Phooka says, nervously. \"I kind of just remembered that I forgot to check the bathroom.\" Phooko sighs impatiently. \"It smelled bad…\" \"I'll go check it out.\" I say. \"No, I've got this.\" Logan says. \"Thanks. But really. I can do this.\" I argue. I give him the death glare. Logan backs off and I grab my axe from my back seat. \"Feel free to come in after me if I take too long.\" I open the door to the dusty old shack and snoop around. I open the bathroom door to find a rotting carcass. It had been torn open in the chest and had flies buzzing about it. Other than that I saw nothing out of the ordinary. I walk back outside and give them the thumbs up. \"That didn't take long.\" Phooko says, arms crossed. \"That's because there weren't any zombies, moron. Whatever that noise was, it wasn't anything that's going to hurt us.\" I shrug. \"Uhm… Lumina…?\" Phooka says slowly. \"There's something behind me isn't there.\" I say. \"Yup.\" \"Big, ugly, scary zombie?\" I ask. \"Pretty much.\" Logan nods. \"Let's go.\" I say, turning on the zombie and swinging the axe through its neck. Now if you know you're history (which I don't) you'd know that in old times executioners were used to decapitate people. In Hollywood films these executions were made pretty by making it only one blow to chop the criminals head off. This however is incorrect. It's kind of like swinging an axe through a tree (in my case a zombie's neck) as brutal as that is (but seriously this is a zombie apocalypse. If you didn't want brutal you should be reading My Little Pony fanfictions). Why do you think the French invented the guillotine? \"God damn.\" I hiss. The axe was stuck in the crook of my new pal's neck. \"RMMNNNGGG\" The zombie reported back to me. \"I know, I know.?\" I sigh, pulling back on the axe. \"I'm sorry but I'll have to finish killing you now.\" \"MMMNNUUU!\" He grabs the end of the axe and flings me backwards. I scream as the blade just nearly chops my face in half, landing in the dirt next to me. The zombie lumbers over me. Suddenly the head falls off and lands right next to me. I scream again and back away. The body falls and it reveals Logan behind him. \"You really should be more careful.\" He sighs putting the hunting knife away. \"I could have killed him myself.\" I glare at Logan. He offers a hand to help me up but I refuse it, dusting myself off. \"Well. Let's get going.\" \"Phooko and Phooka, you can ride with me.\" Logan smiles warmly at them. \"Okay!\" Phooka grins. \"Sure…\" Phooko huffs. \"Hey Eve.\" I say as we're walking to the cars. \"Hm?\" She looks at me like she's surprised I'm talking to her. \"Can I call you Evie?\" I ask. \"No.\" She says blatantly. \"What? Why not?\" \"It sounds too close to the Pokémon.\" _¶¶ _¶¶¶¶¶¶ _¶¶¥¥¥¥¥¶¶¶_... _¶¶¥¥¥¥¥¥ƒƒ¶¶_... _¶¶¥¥¥¥ƒƒƒƒƒ¶¶_... _¶¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ§¶¶_... _¶¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒ§§¶¶_... _¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒ§§¶¶_... _¶¶ƒƒ§§§§¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶... _¶¶§§§§§§§ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶§§§ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¶¶¶¶¶... _¶¶ƒƒ¶¶¶¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¶¶_¶¶... _¶¶ƒƒ¶¶_¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¶¶¶¶¶¶... _¶¶ƒƒƒ¶¶¶¶¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¶¶¶¶¶... _¶¶ƒƒƒƒ¶¶¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒ¥¥¥ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶###ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¥¥ƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶####ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥ƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶¶¶¶¶###ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¥¥¥#####¥ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶¶ƒƒ¶¶¶¶#ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¥¥####¥¥ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒ¶ƒƒƒƒ¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¥¥¥¥ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... ¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒ§§§§¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒ§§§§§§¶¶¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶§§§§§§§¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶§§§§§§ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶¶§ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒ¶¶ƒƒƒ¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ... _¶¶ƒƒƒ¶¶ƒƒƒ¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ§... _¶¶§§§§§§§§¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ§§§§... _¶¶§§§§§§§§¶¶ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ§§§§§§§... _¶¶§§§§§§§§¶¶§§§§ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ§§§§§§§§§§§... _¶¶¶¶¶¶¶§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§... _¶¶¶¶¶¶§§§§§§§§... _¶¶§§§§§§§§... _¶¶§¶¶§§¶¶ _¶¶¶¶¶¶[Chapter 8] Hi:3 it's meh birthday soon^.^ I'm sad... I'll be so old...),: lol just kidding. It hasn't snowed again, that kind of sucks. Today I got to do an extend in cheerleading... If you don't know what that is look it up... It's not special but it's fun. Oh! And our football team got first in the state sooo I get to go cheer at the metrodome!:D Sorry if I haven't gotten to your character yet. I will. I promise. Patience is a virtue. If I ever call Eve \"Russia\", it's an old habit, I'm sorry. Okay then... We ended up in Topeka, Kansas. Parking our vehicles at the closest grocery store, we prepared ourselves for what terrors lay ahead. \"Ready?\" Eve asks. We nod. \"Okay.\" She pushes the door open. Inside is an eerily quiet store. And out of the silence came a chorus of loud screeching. \"What the hell...?\" Phooko whispers. \"Get ready.\" Eve grabs her sword. \"Oh I'm ready.\" I grin, grabbing my axe. The first few round the corner. I slice through them as if I were some professional. The rest of the group was hacking and slashing as well. I see one ugly little fuck grab Phooka and I chop his hands off right there, finishing with a final blow to the head. \"I think it's almost over,\" Logan says. I knock a shelf over in my attempts to breakfast free from a particularly large zombie. \"Finally.\" Phooka breathes. \"Food!\" I leave the scene at once to go find some. \"This should do.\" I say to myself, pulling up to a cute and quiet house in a friendly, happy looking neighborhood. I step out of the car and walk to the door. \"This okay?\" I ask as the others arrive. \"Doesn't matter.\" Eve says. \"A-are you sure I'm not intruding?\" Logan asks me. \"Yes,\" I sigh. \"After all, you did help us. The least we could do is help you.\" \"Thank you.\" He says. \"Just don't tell anyone I'm really a nice person.\" I say, busting through the door. \"My mom taught me how to do that.\" \"Yeah! Way to go Lumina!\" Phooka cheers. I push through the door and look around inside. There were no shoes in front of the door, no rotting smells. The first thing I do is find the garage and look inside, no vehicles. The chances of anyone left here were slim. I walk back outside and grab grocery bags out of the car. It was eerie how quiet the neighborhood was. It was a ghost town. I rush back inside, not wanting to be alone out there anymore. I set the bags down on the kitchen counter and turn a stove top on. I find a pan inside the cupboards and fill it with water. I peek outside while I wait for it to boil. No playgrounds or kids toys. Just a small garden and lush grass. I pour spaghetti into the bubbling water. Then start another pot full of tomato sauce. Phooko was snooping around the house and through the cupboards. I had to chase him out of the kitchen when he started to get in my way. Logan was in the living room watching the news. I don't know where Eve and Phooka are. \"LumiLumiLumiLumiLumiLumiLumiLumiLumiLumiLumiLumiL umiLumi.\" Never mind. Phooka says my name with each step she takes the down the steps. \"Yes?\" I ask. Calmly setting the table in the dining room. \"You have to come see this!\" Phooka says excitedly. Eve walks down behind her, \"After dinner, alright?\" I say. It's as probably the best food I've had in years. Not that it was particularly good, but the fact that we hadn't eaten in a while had really made it good. Everyone else seemed to agree. \"What did you want to show me?\" I ask, putting the dishes in the sink. \"Oh that's right! Come on!\" I follow Phooka upstairs and into an attic. The house seems so normal from the outside view, but this attic made it all different. There were maps and charts and computers. Rows of firearms and shelves of weapons. Im proud to say I'm an American. \"They must have been keeping track of the virus all this time.\" Eve says. \"I'll see if I can learn any information off of this.\" \"Good plan! I bet Phooko would really like to take a look at this stuff, too!\" Phooka says running down the stairs. There's a loud thud followed by an, \"I'm okay!\" From the bottom of the stairs. She had tripped and fallen in her haste. I make my way back downstairs and turn on the gas fireplace in the living room, laying on the rug in front of the tv. \"You look like a cat.\" Logan says bluntly. \"I'm a bunny. Get it straight god dammit.\" I shoot back at him. We watch a news reporter on the screen. So far it appears as though the disease has not spread outside of America. \"Damn.\" Logan hisses. \"What?\" I ask. \"It made its way to Canada. I have a friend there.\" He sighs. \"Oh really? Who was it?\" \"Bryce James.\" He says. \"Hmm... That sounds kind of familiar.\" I say thoughtfully. \"There are a lot of people with the last name James.\" \"Yes but he lived in Canada...\" I argue. \"There are a lot of people with the last name James who live in Canada.\" \"Shhh, I'm watching the news.\" I shush him. The reporter was British, the reason being was probably because no one showed up for work the day they realized their boss was a zombie. Thankfully, America has decided to react better to this kind of crisis then last time. Rather than shutting down all ways of communication immediately and let the virus spread like a cold during flu season, they've selected a healthier nation to keep in contact with yet distance themselves to stay safe. Let's just America has somehow become less of an idiot this time around. I'm sorry to all you patriotic souls out there. Okay then... See ya soon! {= * . * =} (\")-(\") Iunno if you can always see my word art or not but whatever...(: _.'a / .-',_,..=-=-==-'` ` ` / /-/-==-=-' (.-.` | |'../-'=-=-=-=-'  | _,_,_.'  .'_`  / _.-  '._.'/ / | / /'  ;-.  ((='-;) (,_/(,_/[Chapter 9] Hi everyone! I'm sorry I've been very busy lately. Tomorrow is my birthday!^.^ that's all I hafta say.(: Oh wait!- back on the ipad. So sorry for mistakes. I open my eyes to see bright red numbers on a digital clock. It was three in the morning. Something was downstairs. I roll out of bed, grabbing the axe beside the door as I go. I'm not sure who is in the house right now. We come and go as we please. I creep down the stairs and around the corner, duck behind the kitchen counter. On the other side was a silhouette. It was a male form, I knew Logan had left last night to find a gun store, and this guy was much to big to be Phooko. I turn to flip the lights on and ready my axe as he blinks in confusion. His eyes settle on my glare. \"We aren't going to make this a problem, are we?\" I ask. The poor soul just stares at me like a deer in headlights as I give him my scariest glare. Someone's descending the stairs... \"I would run if I were you.\" Phooko says calmly, not looking up from his phone as he passes into the next room. \"Wh...what?\" The guy says, very confused. \"That look she's giving you. Run. Move at a speed faster than walking, never having both or all feet on the ground at the same time. Run far, far away.\" Phooko says with a very smartass-like tone in his voice. \"I'm sorry... I was just looking for food. I didn't realize there would be living people here.\" He apologizes. He had an accent. \"Scottish?\" I ask. \"No, Irish actually.\" He says. \"Oh,\" I nod. \"Well...\" That awkward moment when you have to kick the person that's breaking into your home out of your house. \"If you were looking for food why didn't you go to the grocery store? It's a few blocks from here.\" Phooko asks, returning to the kitchen. \"Why are you even up right now?\" I ask, slightly annoyed. \"I didn't know there was a grocery store.\" He answers. \"If you're from Ireland why are you here? It's safe there.\" Phooko continues his interrogation. \"I'm a foreign exchange student.\" He responds, looking a little terrified. \"What's your name?\" \"Joshua O'Connor.\" Joshua backs against the counter. \"Age?\" Phooko starts to get in his face. \"Seventeen!\" Josh cries, cowering. This was almost humorous. \"Well I have to say, Josh...\" Phooko says calmly. \"This is starting to turn me on a bit.\" \"Phooko! Down boy!\" I hiss. This was turning into a mad house. \"Stop scaring our guest.\" I say sweetly. Joshua looks so frightened that he's about to pee his pants. I grab Phook by the ear and lead him back to the stairs. \"Off to bed with you, you creepy mutt.\" He growls in protest but it seems to sound more sexual than threatening. \"Gross.\" I sigh, returning to the Irish child. \"I'm sorry about that. Phooko's a little... Socially awkward.\" I kneel down in front of him and pat his head. \"It's okay. He's not so bad as those zombies.\" Josh sighs. \"If you want you can stay here tonight, we have enough rooms.\" I say hesitantly. I didn't want to babysit any others, but I felt like this one could hold his own. \"Really? That'd be great. Thank you.\" He stands up brushing himself off, lending me a hand as well. \"Oh... I have a dog.\" \"A what?\" \"A dog.\" \"Is that some kind of Irish slang?\" \"No.\" \"You have... A dog...?\" \"Yes.\" \"... I love puppies! Where? Where is it? I want to see it!\" I say bouncing with excitement. Josh watches me with a raised eyebrow. \"It's in my truck outside. I'll go get her.\" He says, exiting out the front door. I take a bag of chai tea out of the cover and heat water over the stove. Josh returns with a chubby looking dog. It was so cute. \"Hi baby!\" I say, kneeling on the floor and petting the dog. \"Meet Amy, Amy meet... I'm sorry what's your name?\" \"Lumina.\" I say not really caring about anything else but this adorable little dog. \"You're easily distracted aren't you?\" He asks. \"Huh?\" I blink looking away from the dog. \"You're water is going to burn.\" \"Oh god damn it!\" I cry running back to the stove. \"I'll show you to your room in just a second.\" I say turning off the heat and removing the pot. Sorry that wasn't a very interesting chapter... Sorry Joshua... I just needed a character for Phooko's target... Sorry... I thought it was funny... Sorry... It was totally worth it. Okay love you readers/fans/everyone see ya! ( )_( ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 10] So lately I haven't been having very good ratings… and I'm wondering if I should just stop writing this story… I don't know. I'm kinda hyper right now. But not... actually I'm just really bored. And when I'm bored (oh and im tired) and tired my mind becomes very. . . creative. This morning we left the house for once and for all. It was time to move on. Towards what we weren't really sure. The news reports had stopped coming in. Which meant either the disease had spread outside of America or the connections were lost. We'd never know. Our cellphone services had ended. What was left? Get the hell out. \"You're on night watch. Good luck.\" Phooko says as the others head inside. We were in a fancy hotel. I was supposed to keep watch outside the room. Why me? What horrible thing did I do to deserve this? \"Right, thanks.\" I say with a sufficient amount of sarcasm in my voice. \"Did you want me to stay with you?\" Logan asks. \"Nah, I got this.\" I say, hugging my rifle and trying to be brave… Ha. \"Room 587 if you need me.\" Josh hands me a room key. \"Thanks.\" I smile. Eve looks at me, shakes her head, pats mine and walks away. What was that supposed to mean? And that was it. I was alone. A quiet hallway, zombies could be roaming behind any corner, hungry for their next victim, which could very well be me. No. I shall kill whoever dare lays a tongue on me. Nein! I have the power to return this country to its natural state. I will outlive this I will. Creeeeek. Oh god! I'm going to die! Calm down Lumina. It's just one of your friends. It's just- Uuuuuuuuuuuggmmmmm. I scream and run down the hallway, rounding the corner, down the stairs into the kitchen and- Wait…. Why am I here? \"Hello?\" I call out into the quiet kitchen. I had gotten to the bottom floor without any recollection of how I got here. No reply. So let's back track. I was keeping guard outside the rooms… Failed that. Heard some noises. Got freaked out. And must've run down here. So much for being brave. \"Is anyone in here?\" I ask into the empty space. I don't want to walk all the way back up alone… But now that I think of it, my only other choice would be to bring a little zombie friend… and something about that doesn't seem very appealing. I turn to exit the kitchen when something doesn't smell quite right. Is that… smoke? Hm. Weird. I walk back to the fifth floor to see Logan sitting in the hall. \"Welcome back.\" He nods. \"Thanks.\" I smile. He nods again and returns to the book he's reading. \"Do you smell that?\" I ask, immediately interrupting him. \"No.\" \"Smell harder.\" I demand. \"Oh wait…\" He looks up. \"No I don't.\" He returns to his book. I take the book from him and through it across the hall. He reaches into the bag next to him and pulls out yet another book. I sigh and sit across the hall from him. I sigh. We should really go find a place to take new clothes from. These are dirty and bloodstained. Logan looks up, eyes wide. \"I smell it now.\" \"Ha ha, very funny.\" I roll my eyes. \"No I'm serious. It's smoke. Oh god Lumina, what did you set on fire?!\" He cries. \"Nothing!\" I hiss. A door opens. \"What. What are you making all this racket for.\" Josh groans. \"He started it.\" I point at Logan accusingly. \"Fire!\" Phooka rushes out of her room. \"Calm down.\" Phooko says already out of his room. Josh's dog is barking. Eve has her gun pointed at the source of all the noise. Chaos has begun. \"Everybody just… calm the fuck down!\" I yell. There's a sudden silence. And then the building starts to moan. \"What's…\" \"The building's collapsing. We need to get outside.\" Josh cuts Phooka off. \"Grab everything that's important.\" Logan commands. \"No time. We need to get out now.\" Eve says. We take off towards the stairwell. As we reach the doors, we hear blood curdling screams. \"Get ready to kill some sons of bitches.\" Josh says, his accent thick. \"Yeehaw!\" I grin, grabbing my axe that was strategically equipped to a makeshift sash. I think for a second as we sprint down the stairs and put the axe back. \"You know what this calls for? Logan hand me that hat in your bag.\" \"What hat?\" He asks as if this was the most outrageous question ever asked. \"The one in your bag.\" I repeat as if this was the most obvious answer ever given. Logan reaches into his bag and pulls out the cowboy hat I was asking for. \"Why….. how is this in here?\" \"I put it in there. Thank you.\" I say snatching it from him and placing it on my head. I unzip my jacket just as we reach the bottom floor and pull out the two pistols I kept inside. I turn to face the horde as they crowd the hallway behind us. Running backwards and shooting (I am just that skilled) I try not to trip over the others. \"Damn it's hot in here.\" Phooko says, swinging at some of the undead with a baseball bat. \"Die… Die. Die! DIE!\" Josh says bashing one poor zombies face in repetitively. I lay a hand on his shoulder. \"Josh, I think that's-\" I shoot an oncoming zombie, \"enough.\" \"Sorry…\" He says, coming to his senses. \"It's all good in this hood.\" I smile and turn to whack one upside the head with my left pistol. \"Let's get outta here!\" Phooka says. Amy seems to bark in agreement. \"For once I agree with you.\" Phooko says rushing us out of the lobby of the hotel. \"Where's Eve?\" Josh asks. \"Over there.\" I point. The Russian was races past us. \"I would run if I were you.\" \"You are running, and you aren't me.\" I say sassily. Suddenly there's a loud BOOM. And the floor shakes. \"We need to run.\" Logan pulls me out of the hotel as the others are already far ahead. What an eventful night. I have… no idea where my mind went with this. I'm really tired. Goodnight^.^ ( )_( ) {= # _ # =} {\"}-{\"}[Chapter 11] Today I am visiting Phoenix, Arizona. It is so warm here, I love it. \"Well...\" Josh sighs as we drive away. \"That went well.\" \"That was not my fault\" Logan says. \"It wasn't anyone's fault...\" Phooka says. \"Well actually...\" Eve starts but is cut off by the glare she receives from all of us. We had just raided a small warehouse, and ended up blowing the place up, along with our cars and everything in them. Now we were riding in a bus, Josh was driving and we were all exhausted. I shut the light off above me and lay across the two seats. \"Try to keep it down would ya?\" \"No promises.\" Logan grins. I ignore him and shut my eyes. Click . \"Hm?\" I hum as I open my eyes. I look up to see Phooka was driving now, but everyone else was asleep. The early sun was barely peaking over the horizon. Out of the corner of my eye something moved. The floor...? No, a board acting as the floor, covering a luggage compartment. A head covered with red hair pops out. A girl crawls across the floor and I watch confused as she makes her way toward Phooka. As she is about to pass me I stick my axe out. She looks up, shocked. \"Where do you think you're going?\" I ask, still a little sleepy. \"Uhm... I... \"Logan!\" I yell. Logan's eyes pop open a few seats away from me. \"What?\" He growls. \"Take care of this for me.\" I point at the girl and go back to sleep. Rays of sun fill the bus with a pleasant feeling of rejuvenation. We aren't moving anymore but we're stopped outside of a gas station. I look around and see that I'm the only one here. I sigh, stretch and sit up. No one was outside. I get out of the bus and walk into the gas station. \"Hello...?\" I ask walking in. Something whizzes past my face. \"Get down!\" Eve yells at me. \"Was that a bullet?\" I ask, not moving. \"Did someone just try to shoot me?\" \"Move, Lumina!\" Phooka hisses. \"I swear to god if someone just tried to shoot me-\" Eve grabs my leg and pulls me behind the cash register. \"Let's play the silent game.\" Phooka whispers, smiling. She the proceeds to turn and shoot at whoever was attacking us. I sigh, sick of this and dare to stand up. \"Everybody just stop!\" I yell. Surprisingly the shooting stops and all goes silent. \"Okay, it's clear we all got off on the wrong foot here. Let's all be civil, since the population is already dwindling on little to nothing, and shooting each other isn't going to do any good for us.\" The room is still for a moment and then everyone comes out of hiding. A boy and two girls are the only ones I don't recognize. The boy takes off his hat and bows his head. \"My apologies, miss.\" The girls look like they could be twins, both had the same dark red hair. Although one was clearly older than the other, and she had much shorter hair than the younger one. \"We either part ways now or help each other out.\" I say. \"You decide.\" The boy looks at the two girls and they nod. He turns to me and smiles, \"I think we can work some'n out.\" \"Great. My name's Lumina.\" I shift my axe to my left hand. \"This is Kelly,\" He gestures to the girl with the longer hair. \"And this is Rose.\" He points toward the older girl. \"I'm Bennett.\"He shakes my hand. \"It's a pleasure.\" \"Welcome to the team.\" I grin. Sorry if it's short. I'm suffering jet lag... I'm tired... I don't even know if I spelled jet lag right... Goodnight(-｡ -; {= - o - =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 12] I've been pretty busy lately, that's why I'm not writing as often. Snow is everywhere..-_- Oh and I guess I had a complaint about not adding the character creators so... If you want me to just ask... With a please and thank you would be preferable. Kelly was created by lolperson2 \"So you came here from Texas?\" Phooka asks Bennett, who's strumming an acoustic guitar. \"Yes.\" He says not phased at all by her question. We're sitting by a fire in the middle of the desert. I was sandwiched between Josh and LT who were bickering over who would win in a fight between some Russian mafia guy and a Marvel character. The Russian girl and Phooko were playing with some device that looked like it required more brains than I could handle. I'll stick to the Galaxy S10 thank you very much. \"Are you two twins?\" I interrupt everyone's conversations. \"No.\" The two red haired girls answer. \"Sisters?\" It surprises me when Bennett asks this. He must not have bothered asking. \"No, we only met recently after the apocalypse began.\" Rose says. \"Pfft. Besides I could never be sisters with this weirdo.\" Kelly jabs her thumb at Rose. \"Weirdo? Isn't that a little immature?\" Rose raises an eyebrow. \"Says the girl who dresses like an emo ten year old girl.\" Kelly scoffs. \"Excuse me?\" Rose cries. \"Hey... Girls...?\" I say noticing something move behind them. \"Yeah and I bet your different eye colors are just fake!\" The younger of the two points her finger accusingly. \"Ladies.\" I try again \"Grow up! This is my real eye colors and it's not like you would know anything about being real with your fake boobs.\" Rose snaps. \"You might want to turn around.\" Logan says noticing the thing behind them. \"Or run.\" Josh says. \"At least I'm not flat.\" Kelly hisses. Ouch. \"I am not flat you uncultured shit!\" \"Please turn around right now, there's a zombie behind you!\" Phooka cries out. Both girls stop insulting each other and turn around to see two glowing eyes behind them. They both scream in unison as the zombie grabs both girls' necks. \"That's one big zombie!\" Phooko says grabbing a gun. \"It makes a girl wonder.\" I say picking up mine. \"Wonder about what exactly?\" Josh asks me. I lay a hand on his shoulder and sigh theatrically, \"You'll understand one day when you become a women.\" And run towards the large zombie dragging away my new friends. \"The hell is that supposed to mean?\" Josh calls after me. \"You'll understand someday when you're older.\" Logan smacks the back of Josh's head as the follow behind me. \"What's the plan, Lumina?\" Eve asks catching up to me. This zombie was rather fast. \"Same as usual.\" I shrug. \"And that is...?\" \"There isn't one.\" I grin. Always gotta keep em guessing. Phooko tackles the son of a bitch with no problem (surprisingly) but hits his head hard when he lands. \"Don't you dare hurt Kelly!\" Phooko says a little dizzily. \"Or Rose.\" Rose adds. \"He must've hit his head pretty hard.\" I whisper to Eve who raises an eyebrow at me. \"What?\" \"Are you hurt, my flower?\" Phooko asks Kelly who also raises an eyebrow. \"No thank you for your concern, though.\" Rose says her voice dripping with sarcasm. \"I'm okay.\" Kelly says. \"Then... With this dying breath... I confess-\" and then Phooko passes out. \"Well that escalated quickly.\" I smack Logan upside the head, \"You aren't cool.\" Logan winces and rubs the spot where I just hit him. \"Do you always have to be so harsh?\" Josh asks. I smack him as well. \"Is he dead...?\" Kelly asks. \"No.\" Phooka sighs. \"He's just being-\" \"An uncultured shit?\" Rose asks. \"No more like a-\" \"A cockalorum?\" \"Yes.\" Phooka nods. \"Who wants to carry him back?\" Her response is a crowd of youth slowly inching away from the scene. \"Fine. I'll get him.\" She begins dragging him by his feet through the sand, bumping his head on a stray rock every now and then. I'm sorry I'm too tired to go on. I hope you all liked that... I really don't know where any of that came from haha goodnight! ( )_( ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 13] Okay. I am sick today and bored so y'all are lucky I'm writing. Oh and let's get one thing clear. Minnesotans do not have accents. I am getting sick and tired of hearing this stereotype. (If you think this you are an ignorant fool) The only Minnesotans who have accents are either really old. From way, way, WAY north Minnesota... Like in Canada. Or the ones that were born in Norway. Okay but I do not have an accent. My neighbor doesn't have an accent, my teacher doesn't have an accent and my horse does not have an accent. SO STAHP THINKIN VE ALL HAVE ACCENT! oh and I'm not punishing anyone by encounters with zombies... This is just what happens in a zombie apocalypse. . . Zombies. We're sitting in one of the caves in a Papago mountain. The small caves in the rock made a perfect place to hide and stay for the night. There isn't a town too far from here, so the next morning we would need to get food and medicine. Half of the group has been sniffling and coughing, and Phooka even came down with a fever. \"Hang in there kid.\" Bennett says to her, handing her a bottle of water. She smiles but says nothing, which is odd for her. \"We need to think of a plan.\" Eve says. \"For what?\" I ask, drawing pictures int the sand with a stick. \"To get out of the country.\" She coughs. \"Why?\" I ask eyeing her carefully. She better not get sick too. \"Because it's pointless just sitting here.\" Her voices rises but is stopped when she starts coughing violently. I open the cooler and hand her a bottle of water. \"You already know there's no where else for us to go.\" I say darkly. Lately there's been an ominous vibe around us, probably because we're starting to realize what's going on here. \"There are the other countries...\" She stops when I glance at her, the fire shadowing her face. We know the news reports have stopped, we know everyone else is facing what we're facing. There wasn't hope left. It was just going to be running... Constantly running. Unless we managed to kill all the zombies at once. Which wasn't very likely. \"This'll pass.\" Rose says quietly. \"You think?\" Bennett asks her. \"Yeah. Just like it did before.\" \"It didn't just pass before.\" Eve shakes her head. \"Somebody actually did shit about it.\" \"Yeah but look at us. We're just a bunch of useless kids! We can't do anything about this.\" I huff. \"Useless kids were exactly what saved us last time.\" Eve sighs. \"What?\" I ask. \"Yeah. A group of teenagers. There were about... Eleven or twelve.\" Eve nods. \"And you know who lead that group? Your mother. And my mom and my dad found the cure. So how impossible is it that we can't do it again?\" \"We aren't them. That was a fluke.\" I cross my arms. Eve starts coughing again. \"You should get some rest.\" Bennett says softly. \"I think I'll do just that.\" She says standing up and moving to a deeper portion of the cave. Now it was just Bennett, Rose and myself. \"You need to start thinking a little more cheerfully.\" Bennett says. \"I know.\" I sigh. \"We're getting out of this one way or another.\" Rose nods. I don't quite understand what she means by this, but decide not to ask questions. The fire crackles in front of us, silence hanging in the air like a bear about to attack a poor little bunny. I wonder if my parents are still out there, still trying to make it. If my dad and mom have found each other yet. Minneapolis' POV \"God damn it.\" I hiss trying to pull the bag out of the plane. I know it's a large bag but it's completely necessary. The bag was now stuck between the door and me. I give it one final tug as it pops out and sends me to the ground. I land on my butt in the mud. This was just not my day. The plane that still has streams of smoke coming off it was completely useless to me now. I'd just have to walk the rest of the way. Apparently I'm the only survivor, or the only one who's woken up. Hopefully the other passengers would wake up before the plane explodes or the zombies fine them here. Whatever. It's not my problem. \"Having fun, Minne?\" Kory smiles smugly. I walk through him and continues dragging the bag along with me. \"I would help but my body is useless these days.\" He says with a fake frown. \"You're useless you unsalted slug.\" I say picking up my pace. He appears in front of me as if he thinks he's going to stop me. \"Oh come on, you know you love me.\" I stop and sigh, \"What's it going to take for you to leave me alone?\" \"Well... Y'know...\" Kory's eyes wander to my cleavage. \"Fuck off.\" I continue walking. \"Have you gotten fatter since I last saw you?\" Kory asks. I ignore him. This is the only way. \"And is that a grey hair I see?\" He goes to pluck it from my head but his hand passes right through me. He sighs and walks with me. \"How's your husband?\" \"We'll find out soon enough.\" I huff. I look over at him and notice he's become slightly transparent. Good. \"You really should have gone to that shrink.\" Kory says. \"Oh no shrink could've kept you away, sweetheart.\" I laugh. \"It would have taken a priest performing an exorcism to get you out of here.\" I tap my skull. \"For the last time. I'm not a ghost, I'm you.\" He sighs. \"Nice try, buddy.\" \"No, seriously. I'm just the memory you have of Kory.\" He says. \"Then where's Emmett?\" I ask smugly. Kory's eyes droop. \"He left after you fell in love with Luffy...\" \"And Buffalo? What about her? Or Texas, or Fairbanks-\" \"Stop!\" He yells. \"Stop... I miss them, too. Okay?\" I sigh and grab my cell phone out of my pocket. I tap the button and the screen lights up. \"Damn, no service.\" \"You look like big foot right now.\" Kory states. \"Thank you.\" I nod slushing through the mud some more until I come upon a highway. It stops raining and I sigh thankfully as the sun appears from behind the clouds. \"So where are we?\" Kory asks. \"West Berlin...\" I say taking in my surroundings. \"Ah, welcome back to Germany my friend.\" \"Glad to be back.\" Kory grins. Okay so I know that last part is a little weird if you haven't read the first ZCCM buuuuut I don't wanna spoil it for anyone. So if you don't wanna go back and read all of Zombie Candy the First just message me and I'll explain. Okay:3 Toodles! ( )_( ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 14] So the truth is I'm super bored. Like beyond bored. If you wanna read my other stuff that not on fanfiction, search \"TheFierceBunnyDragon\" on watt pad or \"Jesi boo\" on quotev.(: \"So we need a lot of medicine.\" Rose says as we drive down the highway in a jeep. Everyone else was asleep. Bennett was driving and I was sitting in the back with a gun, ready to kill. \"Yeah and food.\" I say. \"We need to find fresh food.\" Bennett reminds us. \"Are you sure the others are going to be safe when we just left them like that?\" Rose asks. \"Yeah. They'll be waking up soon, and if not they have Amy.\" I shrug. \"Amy's that dog right?\" Bennett asks. \"Yeah, Logan's dog.\" \"She's pregnant. She'll be having puppy's soon.\" Rose says. \"Those poor dogs.\" \"Right.\" I nod. We drive past a ranch and suddenly we hear high pitched screaming. \"Pull over here.\" \"Got'cha.\" Bennett drives into the ranch and we hop out, looking around. Another scream, \"Get out! Get out! Get out!\" \"There!\" I whisper pointing outside. A girl is threatening to hit a guy with a cow prod. \"Let go of me!\" Another voice yells. I walk out in the open with my arms raised. \"What's the problem here?\" \"This oaf won't leave me alone!\" The girl sprawled on the ground says. \"I'm trying to get you out of here... And I'm not an oaf!\" The guy growls. \"These two freaks won't get out of my farm!\" The second girl with cow prod says. \"Okay, okay, calm down everyone.\" Bennett says. \"Get these two off my farm. I'm sick of people. This zombie apocalypse is the best thing that happened to me.\" The cow prod girl says. I look around, their were healthy animals everywhere, but not one person. No neighbors for miles. \"Get this idiot to leave me alone.\" The other girl says. \"Get this girl to stop stealing my stuff!\" The guy says. \"Okay. You two come with me.\" I say dragging off the girl and the guy who didn't seem to like each other much. \"Have a nice day, miss.\" Bennett tips his hat to the animal lady as we leave. \"Get in.\" I command. I grab my gun and stand in the back as Bennett drives us out of there. We drive until we reach a town and finally a grocery store. \"What're we doing?\" The girl asks. \"Grocery shopping.\" Rose answers, loading her gun. \"You need a gun to get groceries?\" The guy asks. \"You must be new to this.\" Rose sighs. \"To survive, we need food. For zombies to survive, they need humans. Zombies stand in the way between us and the food. Guns kill zombies.\" \"Makes sense, maybe grocery shopping is a better idea then stealing.\" The guy glares at the girl. Right. \"Wait here.\" I say as Rose handcuffs the two to the Jeep. The three of us run into the grocery store, kill some bitches and return to find the two uncuffed and fighting again. \"Alright.\" Rose says. She smacks both of them with the animal girl's cow prod. \"What the hell where did you get that?\" I ask. \"Where do you think?\" She asks pulling the two back to the Jeep. \"When did you have time to steal that she-\" I stop. Rose raises an eyebrow. \"Never mind.\" \"So what're your names anyways?\" Bennett asks loading the food into the car. \"I'm Mason.\" The guy grunts. \"My name's Lina.\" The girl sighs. \"Perfect. Now you two can be friends so we don't have a horrible drive back.\" Bennett starts the Jeep. \"Drive back where?\" Lina asks. \"Oh.\" I laugh, \"You thought we were it? Oh hell no, there's a whole hoard of us.\" Minneapolis' POV \"Luffy!\" I scream into the phone. \"Jesus Christ women! I'm not deaf! But I will be if you keep this up.\" He mumbles. \"Whatever. Just come pick me up, would you?\" I sigh. The highway scene was getting a little old for me. \"I'm sorry sweetie I'm trying. You know how work is.\" He coos. \"Tell that god damn project manager of yours that Jessica freaking Starr is in the middle of-\" I look around, \"Nowhere.\" \"Miss Starr!\" I hear the project's manager voice on the phone. \"Cut the shit, Reaves. I need someone to pick me up immediately.\" I growl. \"Sorry Minneapolis, but we're currently low on helicopters. How about I send Ophelia in instead?\" He's sucking up to me because he knows I could shut his little project down any second. \"Thanks. Tell her to bring-\" \"Yes, yes I know the skunk.\" Reaver says. \"See you soon.\" I grin. Okay... There ya go... Bai! {= ¥ - ¥ =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 15] Hey friends. I've had a busy week so I'm sorry. Okay…. LEGGO! \"Move it! Let's go!\" Eve yells at us as we slowly move our things out of the cave and down the mountain. How we got it up there in the first place I'll never know. \"Yeah, hurry up ladies!\" I yell at the four guys in front of me. Mason turns his head to glare at me. I smile back and hand him a heavy bag to carry. \"Like that's going to help me move any faster.\" He says. \"You'll go even faster if I decide to kick you off the side of this mountain. Mason sighs and takes the bag. Behind me Phooka was cheerfully trying to convince everyone that this wasn't so bad. She was right, it could be much worse. The hot sun beat down on us as we carried are things to the cars. The jeep and two trucks were waiting at the bottom of the mountain. Thankfully there weren't any zombies around because I'm not sure I'd be able to handle the smell of their rotting flesh baking in the sun. Oh, and that was one of the horrible things that I've noticed lately, the zombies are skin are finally starting to rot and it's disgusting, as well as those who can't hunt down enough food will start eating themselves. \"I'm driving.\" I say grabbing the keys out of Rose's back pack. \"Over my dead body.\" She hisses. \"We can make that happen.\" I grin pulling my axe out and cradling it fondly. \"Where are we going?\" Phooko asks. I shrug. Everyone else starts to look at me. \"What?\" \"You don't know where we're going?\" Logan asks. \"No. Why does everyone expect me to know? Doesn't someone else have an idea?\" I ask feeling a little desperate. The clouds start to close the sun out of the sky, which finally gives some relief from the heat. \"We could try…\" \"Ireland?\" Josh cuts Phooka off. \"Yeah! Ireland what a great idea!\" She sings. \"Alright. I guess it's time we find an airport.\" I sigh. \"If you're anything like your mother we're not letting you fly.\" Eve says. \"What? Why not?\" I ask. She hands me a piece of paper with a picture of my mom and her name on it. She points to the section labeled as \"side notes\" and I see in bold that she is considered a \"extremely danger pilot.\" \"You know we own a private jet, right?\" I ask. \"Have you ever seen your mom fly it?\" She asks. \"No.\" \"That's why.\" She snatches the paper and returns it to a folder, packing it back in her back pack. I was standing on the outside of the jeep, Bennett shouting orders at me while driving. Behind us was a running pack of zombies. The clouds which had earlier been a saving grace had become another problem as the rain from within soaked the inside of the jeep and ourselves. \"Now pull that tarp over!\" Rose yells. We were taking turns driving and had just stopped at a gas station to switch when an ear piercing siren had rung out and attracted the infected. Terrified we hoped into the Jeep again, as it started to rain. \"How do they keep running like this?\" I ask, my throat was starting to hurt from all the yelling we were doing. \"Who knows?\" Bennett mumbles which is almost impossible to hear between the cracks of thunder, the wind, the motor of the car and the zombies. I snapped the buttons that held the tarp to the car and crawled back in. The sound of the rain beat against it like a drum foretelling our inevitable doom. I know that was really short and I know y'all are probably mad that I haven't written in awhile, but I've been really busy with school and other stuff. Happy Holidays! ( )_( ) {= * . * =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 16] Happy holidays! I feel like you're all mad at me... I'm sorry. But it's time for me to get back on track. So, here goes the Christmas special! It may be a little early in the story, but who do you ship together? Let me know in the comments!^.^ \"Hello ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.\" I spoke into the microphone. \"Thank you all for joining us on our flight tonight, we're going to go ahead and prepare for take off, so if you'd please fasten your-\" \"Shut the hell up!\" A knife whizzed past my right ear. I blink once and continue. \"I'd like to remind you all that this is a family friendly airline, and that we'd like to keep the language to an appropriate level. All knives, shotguns, rifles, and other weapons should be stowed in the upper cabins. Please try to remain seated until we are flying safely in the air. Also remain seated if the seatbelt light is on. In the unlikely event that the plane crashes, the cushions of your seats can also be used as floatation devices. In the case of a power outage lights on the aisle will light up and direct you to the exit doors. If the plane reaches a high altitude, oxygen masks will be enabled. We are proud to be the first airline to allow electronic devices through the entire flight, as long as they are in airplane mode. We will be showing a movie during the time we'll be forced to spend together, so please, sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight.\" \"Ready?\" I ask my co-captain (Eve.) \"I'm only here because I'm afraid you're going to kill us all.\" Eve says blatantly. \"That's the spirit.\" I grin, steering the plane onto the run way. Feeling very exilerated, I pull the stick down as the jets get louder and louder. Suddenly the plane jolts forward as we lift off into the air. Behind me I can hear our passengers groan and complain, but that's just too bad. \"Hey... Eve... What's that?\" I ask pointing at some sort of radar. Green splotches were clouding the path ahead. \"That's... that looks like a storm.\" She says studying it. \"Like... a snow storm?\" I ask. \"Yes. That would make the most sense.\" She nods. \"Oh...\" I nod. Ahead dark clouds fill the sky. \"So... Is it safe to fly through?\" \"You know... that's a good-\" The plane suddenly shakes. \"Question.\" The plane shakes again. I snatch the microphone, \"We're facing some severe turbulance so if you could all just sit down, fasten your seatbelts and calm the fuck down I would really appreciate it.\" I flick on the seatbelt sign. \"You really think that's going to help?\" She raises an eyebrow. \"You never know with this crew.\" Mason says behind us. \"Move over.\" \"What are you doing?\" Eve asks. \"Gonna save us.\" He says while pushing me out of my seat. \"Ever land a plane?\" I look him dead in the eye from the floor. \"Nope. But I know how to crash one.\" He smiles. I roll my eyes and sit in the seat next to him. Eve and I exchange worried glances as the plane starts to nose dive. Ireland's sudden beauty is visible now that the clouds have passed. From the back of the plane you can hear Josh's voice, \"Oh! My sweet, sweet home!\" \"Prepare for-\" Mason grabs the microphone from my hand. \"Prepare for landing.\" He says. I glare at him, \"I thought you were too busy crashing to make an announcement.\" The plane continues to go downward but in a controlled manner. I'm surprised at how calm I am and at how quiet everyone else is. The ground comes closer and closer. Mason pulls up on the stick and the plane hits the ground for the first time. I wince as we bounce once... twice... three times and then it stops. Then there's a crashing sound. I open the door in panick to see everyone staring at me. \"Is everyone okay?\" I take a quick count of how many people there are. Everyone's here. \"Eve? Mason?\" I turn to them. Both nod. LT opens the emergency exit. I wait as everyone leaves the plane. I pop my head out and see something smoking. \"Oh god.\" \"Is everything out of the plane?\" I call to those who were already outside. They nod in unison and I run back inside. \"Get out. Get everyone as far away from the plane as possible.\" I tell Mason and Eve. \"Why? What's going on?\" Mason asks. \"Just go.\" I sigh, waving them away. They hurry out of the plane as I check around. I find my bag sitting on a chair and grab. The smell of smoke and gas mix in the air. And I run out of the plane, looking left and right. Everyone else was gone. The smell got stronger and stronger as I realize we had crashed in a junkyard. In my peripheral vision I see a spark. My eyes widen and I spot a fridge. I jump dive roll into it and slam the door. BANG. \"Dear lord where is that girl?\" Logan says. \"Has anyone seen Lumina?\" Lina cries. \"My mom's going to kill me...\" Eve sighs. \"Damn it.\" Josh shakes his head. They were all standing around the junk yard, the only light was a couple of flash lights and the blazing fire far behind them. That explosion could have killed any of them instantly, if they had been close enough. \"I swear to god if she's dead...\" Phooko mumbles. \"She'll be okay.\" Phooka comforts her brother. \"Hey guys...\" I say stepping around the pile of junk. \"I'm still alive you know.\" \"Lumi!\" Phooka says cheerfully. \"You made it!\" She says it as if I had shown up at a party, rather than surviving an explosion. \"You've got some black stuff on your face...\" Logan says. I raise my eyebrows at him as if to ask what he wants me to do about it. He sighs and throws a piece of cloth at me. \"Thanks dumbshit.\" I wipe my face off. I look at our surroundings, the only thing visible was iced over garbage. \"Look what I found!\" Kelly sings as Rose follows behind her carrying an old plastic Christmas tree. \"Would you look at that!\" Bennett smiles. \"My girls are so creative.\" \"We aren't yours.\" Rose knocks him upside the head after setting the tree down. \"I'll be right back.\" Phooko says and scurries away. \"Quick! Everyone leave!\" Josh says. Kelly appears behind him and shocks him with some cables. He cries out in pain but it doesn't appear as if it's injured him too badly. Kelly then proceeds to start a fire with the same cables. Mason pulls out a bag of meat and starts roasting it with a metal prod. \"Well... this is nice.\" I sigh, grabbing a bean bag shaped like Snorlax and sitting down. \"Isn't it?\" Phooka asks, looking at the sky. \"This place is disgusting.\" Eve says. \"The human race is disgusting.\" I smile and close my eyes. \"Guys! Guys!\" Phooko yells. I pop one eye open to see him carrying a car battery and... lights? \"Look what I found!\" \"A car battery and some Christmas lights... that's... awesome?\" Logan asks. \"Yes.\" He grabbed a pair of wire strippers out of his bag and went to work. He grabbed his screwdriver and did some other black magic stuff that I don't understand and suddenly the lights lit up. \"Way to go bolts!\" Kelly cheers. Phooko blushes slightly. \"Merry Christmas everyone.\" Lina says. I check the date on my phone and see that it is indeed Christmas. Okay everyone, I hope that makes up for not writing . DON'T FORGET TO COMMENT WHO YOU SHIP! Thanks! /!_/1 {= 4 . 4 =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 17] Based on stats, the next chapter may or may not be the last… so choose wisely. \"I'm freezing.\" Rose whines. I shudder in my furry, fluffy parka. The wind was nasty, and icicles were hanging from Phooko's nose. \"I swear it's never like this.\" Josh sighs. \"Suuuure.\" LT rolls his eyes. We continued to walk blindly through the blizzard. \"Hey do you see that?\" Lina asks pointing at flashing lights in the distance. \"Yeah, what is that?\" Rose asks. \"I think I see something moving.\" Bennett says pulling out his gun. I saw it too, something grey in the distance. Josh pulls his gun out. \"Let's go find out what it is.\" He creeps ahead and disappears. We all wait in suspense. \"How long has it been?\" Kelly asks worriedly. \"Thirty… maybe forty seconds.\" I say mockingly. She glares at me. \"It's a ski lodge!\" Josh says coming back. \"The grey figure you saw was smoke from the chimney.\" \"Smoke? Was anyone there?\" Mason asks. \"Not that I could see.\" Josh shakes his head. \"Let's go then!\" Phooka says cheerfully marching through the snow. It's fun to watch everyone trip in all over their feet that stuck in the snow, they kind of look like baby giraffes learning to walk. \"Move it people!\" Logan says, shoving everyone in his way aside. \"Hey!\" Eve yells. \"This is supposed to be a team effort!\" \"Yeah.\" Lina agrees. \"Warmth!\" Logan yells behind him. \"Selfish bastard.\" I mumble as I stand up and shake the snow off me. We enter the ski lodge where all is quiet but the crackling fire. Something bubbled in a pot above the flames, giving off an odd aroma. Muddy footprints traced back to a cluttered bar, where drinks were spilt and broken glass crunched under my boots. Splotches of red liquid stained the counter. But aside the from the horror movie scene, the view out the window behind it was utterly breath taking. The sun was slowly setting upon the mountains, making it even more beautiful. I forget about the current task at hand and go to the sliding screen door that led to a patio. I step out onto it, knowing it'd be brief since it was so cold outside but… I had to see… My foot slips on some ice and I fall forward. A long drop is just ahead of me as I realize the deck had been destroyed at the end. I had been so mesmerized by the view that I had completely missed the gaping hole in front of me. \"Good lord!\" I hear Kelly shriek from inside the house. I right myself again and run inside. \"What's the matt….er…\" I see before me a bloody body. A bite wound had been stitched on his upper right shoulder… but his insides had been cut out, leaving it to be an empty carcass. \"How the hell…?\" Mason says slowly. Phooko gets up close to examine it. \"This was definitely not the work of a zombie.\" \"Well no shit, Sherlock.\" Rose crosses her arms. \"So who did it?\" Eve asks. Everyone looks at the twins. \"What...?\" They say in unison. \"Well… you are definitely the creepiest people here…\" Logan says. Phooka and Phooko look at each other in terror. \"We'd never hurt anyone!\" They cry and hug each other. Lina sighs, \"I can prove it wasn't them. It was someone who was here before us.\" She walks over to the body. \"Our shoes are all still wet, it would have left a muddy trail. Which in fact there is right here.\" She points to the foot prints leading in and out of the room. \"But these, closest to the body, are dry.\" \"So? It could have been Josh when he came here ahead of us.\" Phooko says. \"Objection!\" Josh cries. \"He's right, but there's no way he could have dissected this whole body in the small time he was gone. Plus, what's his rationale?\" Lina asks. No one had an answer. \"Maybe… he's a crazy scientist?\" Kelly asks. \"Not likely.\" Lina shakes her head. \"But someone else might be.\" \"So you're saying it is someone here.\" Eve confirms. \"Not one of us. And they're not necessarily here right now… but yes, someone had been here.\" Lina nods and gets away from the body. \"There's no use in worrying about it now.\" Logan says. \"Yes there is! There's a crazed killer on the loose!\" Phooko cries. \"Not necessarily.\" Mason says. \"They probably have already left, or died. They were playing with zombie blood from the looks of it.\" Something clicks downstairs. I tiptoe down as quietly as possible, but the last step lets out a creeeeek. I walk out to the entryway where the fire was still burning. The door is wide open. And in front of it was a man who held a long knife in one hand, and a bottle in the other. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" And I leave you with a small suspense. The next chapter is based on how many reads I get, and reviews as well I suppose. Until next time my lovelies. ( )_( ) {-OwO-} (\")-(\")[Chapter 18] Alright… I have made my decision… \"What the hell are you doing here?\" The man in the door way asks. It's not like he's surprised but rather annoyed. I just look at him with what I imagine to be bulgy eyes. \"Look I know I'm gorgeous but could you please not stare at me like that?\" He says, tossing a bag into the corner of the room. \"Lumina what are you-\" Logan stops when he sees the man in the doorway. \"Oh I see you have friends.\" The man sighs. \"No she doesn't.\" Bennett says coming into the room. \"She doesn't have any friends.\" I don't know why but I feel somewhat insulted. \"Bennett, this isn't the time to be an asshole.\" Bennett just smirks. The others pile into the room as the man starts to take off his coat and shuts the door. \"Well it seems I'm a bit outnumbered. No matter, I'll just have to adapt.\" \"What are you going off about?\" Rose asks. A gleam in the man's eye showed something vicious behind it. \"Nothing. Nothing at all.\" \"This guy obviously isn't stable.\" Kelly whispers to Rose. \"Stable and has amazing hearing… rather handsome I might add.\" He says looking into the mirror above the fireplace. \"So tell me, what brings you all here?\" After hours of questionable conversations and unintentional bonding, we sit in the ski lodge's sitting room. Warmed by the fireplace, we had been avoiding the one subject crawling on everyone's mind. Or so I assume. Who was this boy? And why is there a dissected body upstairs? Eve, who is surprisingly warm to this young man is sitting in a chair across from him. She looks ready to interrogate at any second. \"So, might we have the treasure of knowing your name?\" The boy looks puzzled before fixing his glasses and smiling, \"Of course, my name is Felix.\" Lina steps in seeming suddenly fascinated, \"Anything else we might like to know about you?\" Felix tips his head thoughtfully. I can't think of one thing I like about this guy. \"Well before the infection spread to England I was a senior in high school…\" The room suddenly gets very quiet and eerie as Eve obtains a certain aura that makes the atmosphere around her stiffen. \"Have any hobbies?\" Just as she asks, the same vicious look comes across Felix's eyes. \"Why yes, I do.\" I shiver. \"What would they be?\" \"Well isn't obvious..?\" He asks and relaxes into his chair. With that, the atmosphere returns to its original state. \"I love to ski.\" \"I knew it!\" Eve cries. Both of them were lying. It wasn't hard to see… But then again, the others had already turned to each other to continue unrelated conversations. Logan, Lina, Josh, and Eve were all fast asleep on the floor of the kitchen. Phooka, Phooko, and Kelly were passed out in the living room. Mason, Rose and Bennett in the room I had just left. I can't help but sneak around the house even though it's the early hours of morning. As far as I know, everyone else is asleep. But not a single hair on my body trusts Felix. I don't know why the others are so calm about it. I felt the gun hidden under my sweatshirt and stepped outside onto the patio that had almost sent me to my death earlier today. \"Evening.\" I jump when I hear a voice from beside me. Felix was sitting on the edge of the deck's railing, smoking a cigarette. \"You know smoking is bad for your lungs.\" I say acting as though he hadn't scared me at all. \"It's hardly even vapor. It's one of the new ones that came out before the infection. And I'm trying to quit.\" I lean against the railing, \"Scientists haven't proven those are entirely safe.\" He grins mischievously, \"I like to experiment.\" I study him after he says this. This whole time he's been staring off into the distance as though I'm not even here. And somehow… the way he talks about experimenting and science reminds me of my parents. And I wanted to push him off the railing and send him falling to his death. \"I wouldn't if I were you.\" He says as I've barely reached my hand out. \"Who knows… I could be of some importance.\" \"How did you…\" \"I've study the human body and mentality for quite some time now. It was only a matter of time before you reached out and pushed me off this railing.\" He says as if there were nothing simpler in the world. I eye him cautiously, \"You're definitely not normal.\" He laughs, \"No one is normal. And if it was your dream to be the perfect normal teenage girl, then allow me to be the one to dissect and pulverize those dreams.\" \"You're a cruel man.\" I say. \"Truth and cruelty are synonyms, unfortunately.\" He sighs. My mind tries to wrap around what he's saying when it catches a key word. \"So it was you.\" I say. \"What was me?\" He asks mildly. \"The dead body upstairs.\" He chuckles darkly, \"Oh, you saw that? Just another of my experiments I suppose.\" \"That's horrible.\" I say. Felix stops laughing and looks at me very seriously. \"Did you ever think that maybe he was already dead before I even found him?\" Of course. Why hadn't I thought of that? They were all so clouded in fear… and I was so nervous… I never thought of… \"I'm sorry.\" I say whole heartedly. He smiles but his eyes don't. Something about Felix bothers me. I just don't know what. \"Alright,\" Mason sighs dusting off his gloves. \"The snowmobiles are up and running.\" \"Are you sure you want to stay behind, Felix?\" Kelly asks. We had never discussed Felix's experiment. Somehow the others seem to have forgotten already. Maybe all the death was becoming normal. \"No, I have my experiments and everything I need here.\" He nods. \"Bye Felix!\" Lina and Eve wave to him. He waves back as we head leave. I turn to wave to him as well but he had already disappeared inside the warmth of the resort. The snow had begun to fall, and with the help of the wind we weren't able to see much. I was already freezing behind Eve who was driving. With only Phooko to give us directions, the rest of this journey seems pretty much hopeless. Something black appears in the rear view mirrors and seems to be closing in on us. \"Eve! What is that?\" I ask loudly so she can hear me. \"It looks like…\" \"It's Felix!\" Phooka cries. Eve slows the snowmobile down as Felix catches up to us. I turn around so that I can face him. \"What are you doing?\" I call. \"You forgot your axe!\" He yells back. Shocked, I check my bag and sure enough it's not in there. \"You're a life saver.\" I tell him. \"It's no problem. You guys look pretty lost anyways.\" He shakes his head and reaches out to hand me my axe. I snatch it and hug it like a lost teddy bear. \"Thank you.\" I breathe. He grins and drives to the head of the pack to lead the way. Okay, so obviously my decision is to continue the story because I seriously couldn't just give it up like that. I'd miss you all too much!^.^ I hope you enjoyed. I actually just found out I'm going on a ski trip next month so hopefully there aren't any dissected bodies anywhere(: ( )_( ) {= ^ - ^ =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 19] I have a half hour before my next final and it's a grammar final so I'm not too worried…. We're standing outside a small train station as we wait for Phooko to finish tinkering with some control panel. It's still cold here but not as bad as the mountains were. I'm sure the others are as starving as I am. \"Phooko, could you please hurry it up? We're dying over here.\" Mason sighs. \"Hurry it up, boy.\" Bennett says. There are some clicking sounds and Phooko finally returns from the shelter the control panel was contained in. \"What were you doing anyways?\" Kelly asks. \"The train here is run entirely on a set of magnets, with no human intervention at all. In order to run it I needed to restart the train, which took quite a bit of effort.\" He explains dusting of his pants. His face is smudged with grease and he looks like an idiot. We watch as the platform starts to vibrate and a speeding train starts to decelerate in the distance. It slows down just in time to stop in front of us and let out a sigh of exhaust. The doors open and a computerized voice welcomes us. The inside of the train was well kempt and had wide windows to look out. The trains in America looked nothing like this, and I feel a little disappointed in my country. \"The doors are now closing.\" The voice says. Everyone is too busy looking around to notice the voice, so I count how many of us there are and relax when I see no one has been left behind. The train jolts forward and I fall backwards into Felix who seems to be standing without any problems as the train accelerates forward at an unnatural pace. He looks down at me and sighs, \"Bloody Americans. Sit down if you can't bare to stand.\" I glare at him as I right myself. \"Don't insult me with that British slang of yours.\" Felix laughs, \"If I didn't I wouldn't find myself nearly as sexy.\" He walks past me and steps into the next car. \"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\" I cry after him. I wonder around the train aimlessly as time ticks by. Although time has become nothing more than a mere memory, it still nice to make a reference to it. \"Howdy.\" Bennett waves as I walk into the dining cart. He and Mason were sitting at a table playing with a deck of cards. \"Hey.\" Mason nods. I smile and lean against the table on the other side of the aisle. Two beers sat on the table between the two men. \"Where… did you get those?\" I ask. \"There's a kitchen in the next car. Had quite a few selections to choose from.\" Mason says. Bennett mashes his eyebrows together in concern and looks at me. \"Ain't you a bit young to be drinking.\" I glare at him, \"I don't want the beer I'm looking for food!\" \"There are quite a few boxes in there, to me it'd make sense if they contained preservative filled food.\" Mason mentions but I'm already halfway to the kitchen. As I step in my jaw drops as I see a mountain of food. Boxes of Oreos, root beer, muffins and Cheez-Its. Wooden crates full of fine wines, expensive champagnes and beer filled the shelves. I can almost feel my eyes sparkling over the voracious spread. I nab a box of Oreos and a box of Cheez-Its and stuff to bottles of root beer in my pockets as I runs from the kitchen, past Bennett and Mason and scurry back to the room with the large windows. I sit down on a couch and relax since I can finally stpp protecting my food. \"You seem to be in a hurry today.\" I fall off of the couch when I hear Logan's voice. He, Lina, and Eve were sitting across from me. \"Where di you come from?\" I hiss grabbing my food again. \"We've been sitting here the whole time.\" Eve says flatly. Lina raises an eyebrow, \"She was in such a hurry she even jumped over that couch.\" Logan squints, \"What do you have in your hands?\" \"Nothing.\" I lie, moving backwards. \"Is that...\" \"OREOS!\" Eve cries out, tackling me. \"They're mine.\" I growl and try to make a run for it. \"She's hoarding food!\" Lina yells, also tackling me. \"Your face is hoarding food.\" I say. The door slides open as Josh, Phooka, and Felix walk in. \"What is going on in here?\" Josh asks. \"Lumi's hoarding food and Eve and Lina are trying to take it from her. Although its quite probable there's another source of the food.\" Lina and Eve stop immediately. Then in unison they smile widely. \"Where's the food?\" \"Yes, Lumina, where's the food?\" \"The kitchen...\" I say slowly. The two trolls scurry away. \"Well that was... interesting.\" Phooka smiles. I watch the sun start to set as I subconsciously munch on my Cheez-Its. I had managed to find a way to hook my phone up to the train's speakers in order to play music in the window car. And after a small quarrel with Bennett over choice of music, Joe Hisaishi's Bus Stop was playing, giving off a peaceful aroma to the car. Bemmett glares at me from the corner of the room, but of course I have no choice but to ignore him. The sky was a rainbow of colors. The car itself is filled with pinks, oranges, yellows and purple from the descending sun. This was the first real bliss I've been able to manage since this journey began. Felix walks into the car and sits in the chair to my right. \"Why is it thst you wanted to go back to England?\" I ask him after a few minutes of silence. \"I seem to have... forgotten something when I left.\" He says doing his signature glasses fix. \"What would that be?\" I ask, no longer afraid to ask him questions. \"Friends... two siblings.\" He says thoughtfully and looks out the window as well. Wonderful. More people, more death. Guys! Guys! I got a hundred percent on both my English finals! Woot! Don't forget to send in ships. Well auf weidersen! {= ¥ - ¥ =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 20] So unfortunately today my boyfriend and I broke up. It's a shame because I really liked him. Oh well. Err... Also another issue... BattleGames, you may not have noticed that I was already using Reaver for Minneapolis' portion of this story... So he can't really be dead... My apologies. Still want your ships, if you can even think of any. Also if you're a owner of one of the characters I suggest you let me know one way or another that you're still reading... For the good of your character of course. How did this happen. One minute everything was going smoothly. The next the train is derailed and the end of it is hanging off a cliff, clicking every time is shifts backwards. \"GO, go, GO!\" Rose yells in front of me. We're leaping through the cars with no time to stop. And then there was a groaning noise. \"Guys...?\" Kelly says slowly. \"I heard it, too. Just keep going.\" Mason drags her behind him. A door falls down in front of me and I stop, halting those behind me. Out walks a balding, grey skinned, old woman. The zombie throws a hand out toward me and a bald comes between the hand and myself. \"Next time pay more attention.\" Felix says walking around me. I stick my tongue out at his back which is running quickly away from me. The others, which consists of Bennett, Lina, the twins, and Josh. We jump onto the last car as the train starts to fall faster and faster as the weight adds on. Ahead there's a door open, leading to safety. Ahead of me Felix jumps out and I trip on the edge of the train. He grabs me and tosses me onto the ground. \"Thanks!\" I yell behind me as he and I run to away from the falling train. \"Help!\" I hear behind me. I whip around and am running back before I even know the problem. Phooka is hanging on to the edge of the cliff as the rain falls below her. I run back and shove Phooko back into Josh, grabbing Phooka's arms. \"It's okay.\" I say but am mostly reassuring myself. She starts to slip a little more and a slam the edge of my axe into the dirt, wrapping my legs around it and leaning downfall further. Finally I'm able to pull her up. And we sigh heavily as we watch the remains of the train set fire at the bottom of the cliff. \"Wow, Josh. You're really strong.\" Phooko says behind us. \"Please get away from me.\" Josh says pushing him towards us. Phooka laughs as she stands up and dusts herself off. \"That was a close one.\" I say. \"Yeah, but so long as I survived I'm okay. Thanks.\" \"No problem.\" \"So my two little trouble makers, let's try to catch up with the others shall we?\" Felix asks wrapping his arms around our shoulders. \"I would appreciate it if you didn't make physical contact with me.\" I say bluntly. \"Ah, but physical contact is what drives the human race.\" He nods. \"Well then. Let's find my lost friends.\" The first place we check is a large, old house. Mason kicks down the door and leads us inside, where the results of a fire sets the scene. Charred furniture and singed drapes are scattered around the house. The ceiling had smoke stains on it, while the atmosphere smelled greatly of a wood fire. Felix walks back out of the house, \"They're not there.\" \"What? How do you know?\" Kelly asks. \"I know everything.\" He says simply. I roll my eyes but start to leave anyways. If the man says they're not here, than they aren't here. \"Hey guys...\" Logan says slowly. I turn back to see his dog sniffing around the front porch. \"She probably just smells another dog. Let's go.\" Rose urges. \"No. Hang on a second.\" Felix walks back to the porch. \"Grace and Tom never had a dog. Their housekeeper was allergic to pets.\" Amy starts digging against the wood, which was rotting at the edge of the house. She whines as she does so. Felix walks over to the dog and pats her head, grabbing a junk of wood and tearing it away from the porch. He returns with a single, old key, the numbers 1495 inscripted on it. \"We're going to the Place Hotel in Manchester.\" Felix announces. Mason holds the hot wired truck door open for me and slams it behind me, making me jump. In the back seat sat Lina, Logan and Eve. Mason hops in the driver's seat and turns on the built in GPS system. We drive mostly in silence until Lina gets bored and starts bothering Logan, who in turn begins to bother Eve. Which of course causes me to whip around and yell at them, \"Shut it you morons or I will kick you out of this car and feed you to those ugly walking death traps!\" This of course causes them to end their little quarrel. Minneapolis' POV One month ago... \"Hello, Ophelia. How have you been?\" I ask as I sit inside the luxury sports car, noticing the sleek armor built around it. \"Not too bad. Work's been a bitch.\" She sighs. \"A busy time indeed.\" I nod, shutting the door. Ophelia steps on the gas and we fly forward. \"We're a bit short on time.\" She mentions. \"To be expected when Bradley is the one running things.\" I sigh. \"Right this way, Ms. Starr.\" A happy little attendant smiles after showing me to Bradley's office. The door slides open and inside sitting around an oval table is an eclectic group of people. A woman my age with long black hair sat next to an empty seat. On they're left was a man with dark hair and sparkling blue eyes. He sat calmly and payed little attention to me, as if no one had entered the room. A man in his late twenties sat on the other side of the table, unnaturally tall and curled hair. Next to him was the youngest in the room, I hardly recognized her after all this time. On her other side was Gilbert, my cousin in law. \"Glad you could make it.\" Bradley says who's sitting at the end of the table. Something pulls at my heart when I realize there are a few people missing from the table. I drag a chair across the room making quite a bit of commotion and sit beside my husband who was opposite Bradley. Determined to hide the little emotion I had in me, I peck Luffy on the cheek and cross my legs, ready to get down to busy. \"I'll be taking it over from here, thank you Bradley.\" I say calmly. \"As expected.\" He sighs heavily. I shoot up from my chair and slam my hands down on the table. \"Who here has missing children?\" I demand. Rosalie, the Russian with black hair raises her hand. Then, slowly, Bradley, Nick, and Gil raises their hands. And then my idiot husband does, too. \"Not you, you oaf. I know our children are missing.\" I smack his head which was getting way to close to my ass. \"Does anyone have any idea where they could be?\" I ask. \"Evangeline is almost certainly with Lumina.\" Rosalie says, I was so used to her fast speaking it didn't even bother me that it was nearly incomprehensible. \"My children are likely safe at home with our maid.\" Bradley crosses his arms. \"But that's only an assumption.\" Ophelia then walks in the room and takes a seat in the empty chair next to Rosalie. It goes quiet as I start to think. After awhile, I open my mouth hesitantly, \"Well, my suggestion is that we find them.\" Again it's dead silent. \"What do you all say? Who's up for another round?\" I grin. The shock in the room disapears as it is replaced by like grins. You get 'me boss! Texas says somewhere in my mind. I hope you know what you got yourself into. Kory huffs. \"Oh, I do.\" I say. Everyone's so used to being crazy that they don't notice me talking to myself. \"Hallucinations coming back, dear?\" Luffy asks me. \"It seems so.\" I sigh. \"It seems so.\" Weeeeellll I hope you enjoyed! See ya next time on Zombie Candy CHAINSAW MASSACRE! ...the second. ( )_( ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 21] The door creaks as we enter the building silently. It's already dark outside and all we have for light is our flashlights. \"We'll go in groups of two.\" I announce. \"Lina and Eve you check out the kitchen. Logan and Mason take the first, second, and third floors.\" I look around and continue. \"Rose and Bennett, try the basement. Kelly and Josh go to the fourth, fifth and sixth. And Phooka and Phooko go to the seventh, eighth, and ninth.\" I look around making sure everyone understood. \"Felix and I will check the room number that the key is inscripted with, and the floors above and below it. Meet back here in three hours.\" The groups head off in said directions as the lobby becomes silent. \"Just couldn't get enough of me, could you?\" Of course the idiot next to me had to interrupt that silence. \"No, I don't trust you.\" I say going to the elevator. We wait as the sound of the elevator gets louder and louder. \"That's weird.\" I say at the same time Felix says \"That's odd.\" \"The elevator is moving even thought he power is out.\" I say. \"Perhaps someone...\" \"Shut off all the lights to make it look like a loss of power?\" I question. He nods as the doors slide open and we step inside. \"Shall we check the room first?\" He asks. \"Sure.\" I press the button for the fourteenth floor. \"The people who managed this hotel were superstitious.\" \"Why would you assume that?\" He asks. \"The thirteenth floor is missing. So instead of going to room 1495, we'll be in room 1395.\" I explain. Felix's skin turns a little pale. \"You aren't scared of ghosts, are you?\" I ask, a little shocked. \"I've heard a lot of things about this hotel.\" Is all he says as we exit the elevator. Buzz bzzz I grab my phone out of my pocket and see a text message from Kelly. Nothing on four but a few unwanted zombies. Heading to five now. I put the phone away without replying and look up to see Felix staring at me. \"What?\" I ask. \"Through all of this and you still keep your phone? Looks like someone had an interesting life.\" He sighs. \"I keep it so I can contact the others when I need to. And just because I liked my phone doesn't mean I was boring!\" I hiss. He shrugs, \"Doesn't matter to me who you used to be.\" I sigh feeling a migraine forming. Either Felix is really getting on my nerves or something bad is about to happen. We walk as the light from the moon outside and our flashlights guide our way. I stop as a shadow passes the light. \"Uhm... Did you see that?\" I ask Felix. \"Don't try to scare me, Lumina. It won't work.\" He says. I stick my tongue when he uses my full name. \"I'm not I just saw... Never mind.\" I sigh. We continue down the hall and come upon 1495. It was the only door that had an actual key hole on it. Felix sticks the key in and... Third person The Place Hotel: Basement 11:24 pm \"What is that awful stench?\" Rose asks Bennett as the two scour the basement together. \"Couldn't tell you.\" He shrugs. Rose looks around, her hair had started to grow after all the time that's passed since the world had been under distraction. Hard to find a good salon these days. \"Wait...\" Rose pauses. \"I know that smell...\" Bennett raises an eyebrow at her. Rose continues to walk forward without saying anything else and runs her hand along a vault door. \"The only way to get through that door is explosives.\" Bennett grins seeming very excited at the idea of blowing something up. \"Or I could open it for us.\" She says leaning her ear against the metal door. The stench was definitely coming from inside. The Place Hotel: Kitchen 11:34 pm Lina dives under a counter as four zombies moan on the other side. Eve has already shot six of them down. Lina turns and shoots one in the neck, it falls to the ground and she wipes the beads of sweat off her forehead. Eve hops onto the counter opposite the one Lina was hiding under and sits on it casually as she shoots down the rest. \"Nice work.\" Eve says. She turns on the sink next to her and splashes water onto her face. \"If there were anyone in here, we would have found them by now. Let's go meet up with the others.\" Lina suggests. The Place Hotel: The Sixth Floor 11:56 pm Kelly drags her gun against the wall, intentionally trying to make noise that will call out any hidden zombies. Josh sighs and takes the gun away from her. \"Give it back!\" She cries. Josh holds it above his head to where she can no longer reach it. \"Stop making so much damn noise.\" He says. \"Excuse me for trying to help.\" She crosses her arms. \"That's not helping. That's only making it worse.\" Kelly huffs, \"The more we kill, the safer we are.\" Josh gives back her gun and starts walking away. \"Hey! Where are you going?\" Kelly yells impatiently. \"You can't just abandon me here!\" Josh returns and comes face to face with her. \"Do you realize that each one of those zombies we kill is someone who could have come back when we find the cure?\" \"Yeah but...\" \"Just because you want to be extra careful is to selfish of a reason for you to go ending those possible futures.\" Josh says. This was probably the most serious he's ever been about this. Kelly takes a step back. \"L-look I didn't mean-\" Josh raises his gun and shoots just past her head. There's a thump as the undead falls behind her. \"Try looking out for someone other than yourself sometime.\" The Place Hotel: The Seventh Floor 12:06 am Phooka giggles as Phooko scans the area with some device he probably created. \"Silence, Phooka.\" He hisses. \"Do you really think there are ghosts here?\" She asks totally ignoring him. \"Yes. Why else would I be doing this?\" Phooko sighs as if his sister were a heavier burden on him then he was to her. \"I really don't think all this is necessary.\" Phooka smiles as she looks around. The halls had already been filled with night vision cameras, motion detectors, enhanced audio recorders, and thermal cameras. \"Research is always necessary.\" Phooko says. \"Well okay...\" Phooka says. \"I think it's safe to head to the next floor now. If anything happens down here I'll be notified on this.\" Phooko points to his radar. Phooka nods happily in agreement as the interesting pair take the elevator upstairs. The Place Hotel: The Second Floor 12:55 am Silence. It was as if there had never been any life on the past two floors. Mason and Logan walk along side each other in the darkness of the hotel. A clock ticks somewhere nearby. A shadow crosses the path of their flashlights' shine as Logan's light begins to flicker. \"What the hell?\" He asks as he hits the flashlight with the palm of his hand. \"When has hitting something when a battery dies ever worked for America?\" Mason asks. \"We're not in America, Mason. We're in England.\" Mason sighs heavily. The clock chimes one o'clock making both men jump. The clock was much closer then they had anticipated. There's a creaking noise, then the sound of a door shutting. \"You heard that... Right?\" Mason asks slowly. \"Yes.\" Logan says shakily. There are two very high pitched screams that seems of get closer and closer and... Thump. Something knocks Logan to the ground as the screaming ends. \"Oh hi, Mason. How are you?\" Lina says smiling. \"I'm so sorry.\" Eve says to Logan with a rush of embarrassment. She had fallen on top of Logan when she ran into him. \"It's okay.\" He says standing up and helping Eve onto her feet as well. \"That's very sweet and all but why were you ladies screaming?\" Mason asks. \"There were moans coming from the doors and what sounded like chains rattling against the floor.\" Eve rubs her head. \"Then something crashed behind us and we heard a scream. And that's when we found you guys.\" Lina sighs. \"We'll go check it out with you.\" Logan's as to Eve. She smiles and leads the way. Lumina's POV The Place Hotel: The Rooftop 1:23 am \"We have a little while before the others get back to the lobby.\" I say sitting on the edge of the roof. \"I'm almost positive there's something more progressive we could be doing right now.\" Felix says sitting next to me. \"Sometimes it's nice to just take a break.\" I sigh. The city (or what was left of it) was lit up but not to it's full potential. This would be an amazing view if it weren't for everything else going on. \"I suppose you could be right.\" Felix nods. \"I'm always right.\" I look at him very seriously. \"Always.\" \"You're entitled to your own wrong opinion.\" He chuckles. \"Where do you think they are?\" I ask. \"Hmm?\" \"Your friends.\" I add. \"If I knew I would have found them and have left you by now.\" Felix says quite bluntly. \"Well that was insensitive.\" I glare at him. He laughs again, \"Only if you care.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" I ask. \"If you didn't care about me, that comment wouldn't have bothered you.\" He says fixing his glasses. \"I care about everything.\" I say quietly. \"That's a lie.\" He says. Another insensitive remark by Felix. \"How so?\" I say through clenched teeth. \"It's not humanly possible.\" He says. \"You're brain would be overwhelmed. You wouldn't be able to handle it. You would be so over stressed that you're entire body would shut down and you would be unstable.\" \"Alright fine... Maybe I don't care about what happens to me. I don't know.\" I say grumpily. \"Also a lie.\" Felix mutters. \"I have to protect everyone else. So long as I do that, it doesn't matter what happens to me.\" Felix stands up suddenly and raises his right hand, \"Then I promise that I will protect you until this apocalypse is over.\" I think about this for a second. \"No you don't.\" It was my turn to be laconic. \"What?\" He asks looking a little hurt. \"People don't keep promises. Especially big promises like those.\" I say with dull expression. \"Well then...\" He says sitting back down. \"I guess you can be a bitch about it if you want to.\" \"Who the hell are you calling a bitch?!\" I cry. \"So what you saved my life a couple of times? Doesn't mean you can call me names.\" Felix laughs and you can actually see the smile behind his eyes. I sigh and stick my tongue out at him. \"Maybe I'll just push you off this ledge.\" I threaten. \"You won't as I will not push you off.\" He says. \"Uh huh...\" \"I, Felix Bell, promise I will never push you off this ledge.\" He says. \"It's a start.\" I laugh. \"So... Felix Bell, huh?\" \"Yes, that is the name I was born with.\" \"Has kind of a ring to it, doesn't it?\" I suppress a smile. He bursts into laughter and wipes a fake tear from his eyes, \"That was bad.\" \"I know.\" I smile. The Place Hotel: Second Elevator 2:02 am The elevator suddenly stops as Phooko and Phooka press against the corner, cowering. \"Who could have stopped it?\" Phooko cries. \"Shhh... It'll be okay.\" Phooka says. The doors slide open to reveal Josh and Kelly. \"Oh god.\" They say at the same time. \"Josh?\" Phooka looks up at them. \"Kelly!\" Phooko jumps away from his sister to hug Kelly. Kelly tases him and he falls to the floor. \"Oh-oh what are you two doing here?\" Phooka asks. \"Ow...\" Phooko moans as the doors close. \"We got Rose's text.\" Josh shrugs. Phooka stand up and straightens herself. \"We were so scared... This hotel really creeps me out.\" Phooka laughs nervously. \"But then we found you.\" Phooko says dreamily. \"That's... Gross.\" Kelly takes a step away from him. The doors open again and Phooka and Kelly step out. \"Come on, kid.\" Josh lifts Phooko from the ground by his shirt and drags him out of the elevator. \"Oh, Josh.\" Phooko says still in his dream state. Josh drops him and continues on without him. \"Wait! Don't leave me! I'm sorry!\" Phooko calls after them. Please if you're still reading and you have a character let me know as soon as possible. Send in who you ship if you haven't already. Bye for meow. /1_/1 (\")-(\")[Chapter 22] Hai guys. Uhmmm... donno what to say... oh I know. If you dont start telling me your still hefe ima start killin yo characters. Jay... you will thank me. You will get on your hands and knees and kiss the very ground I walk upon after this chapter. \"That smell... it has to be blood.\" Felix says as he comes to the door of the vault. Of course he would know. \"I agree.\" Rose sighs. \"I'm about to open the door... prepare for what's inside.\" Amy starts sniffing around the wall and starts whimper as she backs away. The door opens with an eerie creek. We all take a step back as the smell suddenly gets stronger. Lina turns away ready to puke as Mason tries to calm her down. \"Damn it.\" I say covering my mouth. Felix readies his machete. Eve is the first to step inside to examines the room. A tub of blood sits in the center of the cellar, slowly swirling down a large drain. \"Even this is a little much for me.\" Felix shakes his head. \"Oh... hello.\" We all turn. Felix's POV Lumina is bent over covering her mouth as the smell inside grows stronger. Eve is the first to venture in and I walk in after her, curiosity taking over. Then I hear this strange voice, and I'm not certain whether it's one within my mind or if its embodied. With relief, I see that everyone else has turned towards the source to. A girl steps out of the dark. My eyes are directly pulled to her rather... large breasts... The girl was indeed beautiful although but I couldn't really avert my eyes. God damn these adolescent hormones... GOD DAMN THEM! Lumina's POV \"Who the hell are you.\" I growl. I don't want more people. This girl needs to leave. \"We're here for the same reason you are.\" Another voice says as she and a boy step into the light. \"To survive.\" He says. \"We came here a long time ago.\" Grace says as she lounges on a chair in the lobby. \"We left after our house set fire.\" Tom adds. \"Then we found Jasmine. She said she's lived here forever.\" Grace says. \"I have.\" Jasmine tells us. \"At first we thought she was a ghost.\" Tom sighs. \"Then we found out she's just really creepy.\" Grace nods. This comment doesn't seem to bother her in any way. Logan crosses his arms, \"We need to get out of here.\" Eve nods, \"I have a question first...\" We look to her. \"Is this hotel really haunted?\" This was the question on all of our minds. Maybe Jasmine could gives us the answers. And I had to agree with Tom and Grace... she definitely looks like a ghost herself. \"No.\" She says weaving a hand through her black hair. \"But... all those noises...\" Kelly says. \"It's not haunted.\" She repeats herself. Phooka and Phooko switch looks. Some sodt of creepy twin telepathy or something. \"I was looking all over for you two.\" Felix mumbles. Grace looks up at him, \"Oh Felix, we never left.\" \"We were waiting for you.\" Tom says. \"But you never came.\" Grace finishes. \"You're right.\" He removes his glasses and runs a hand through his hair. \"Your father gave me specific instructions and I failed to follow them.\" \"I'm going to bed.\" Mason says interrupting them thoughtlessly. \"That's an amazing idea.\" Lina agrees. \"See you tomorrow.\" Phooka and Phooko say together. \"Yeah...\" Josh says quietly. Our team slowly disapears somewhere within the hotel. Logan, Eve, Bennett, Felix and the three new kids were the only other people in the lobby. \"Will... will you walk me to my room? This place creeps me out.\" Eve asks Logan hesitsntly. He shrugs and they enter the elevator silently. I feel awkward seeing as I only knew Felix and the tension in the air only makes me feel like I'm intruding. \"I agree with the others. I'll be taking my leave now.\" Jasmine says as she walks ip to Felix... getting a little too close. \"Next time don't make me babysit your kids.\" She hisses. \"I'll be sure to be more careful next time.\" Felix says with an hint of mocking in his voice. Jasmine smiles slightly and enters the stairwell, flipping her tesla gun in the process \"What about you? Are you going to leave, too? Felix asks acknowledging me for the first time. I shake my head, \"I'm staying down here in case any unwanted visitors come in.\" \"I'll stay with you.\" Felix suggests. \"Fine by me.\" I shrug. \"I think I will, too.\" Bennett says. I had forgotten he was standing there. \"Goodnight everyone.\" Tom and Grace wave and enter an office to the right. Things around here were getting pretty weird. I pop one eye open... then the other. I had fallen sleep with my axe on the floor next to the chair I was laying in. A light in the hallway flickers. Bennett and Felix were both fast asleep. I get up and look around. The sun would be rising soon, any second now. But that light continues to flicker and it bothers me. I grab my axe and walk down past the sleeping boys. A spider crawls on the wall, and a mouse scurries to the other end. This place definitely hsd some bad upkeep. There's a few clicks, something thst sounds like a generator turning on. The only thing at the end of this hall was an old door. I walk towards it and grab the handle but it wont turn. I turn around and see a face in mine with long red streaks down it cheeks. I step back and gasp. When I open my eyes again it's gone. \"Just my imagine...\" I say to myself. I did have a terrifying fear of darkness... I walk back to the lobby and sit down in the chair. I pull a blanket out of my bag and wrap up in it, trying to get comfortable again. When that doesn't work I stand up again. Most of the couch is left unattended, just one corner of it was occupied by Bennett's feet. I tip toe over to it and lay down, but when I realize I don't have enough room, I take action. I sit up and lean forward. Now to just gently move Bennett's feet and- Foop Bennett's feet hit the floor really hard sending him off the couch. I roll over and cover myself with the blankets pretending nothing had happened. A sudden barking woke me up within the next few hours. Cold sweat was dripping off my forehead and I sat up with a start. Felix is leaned up against the edge of the couch and Bennett was still fast asleep on the floor. I was the last one on the couch... Does that mean... I won? \"Wake up.\" I nudge Felix. Then get up and try to wake Bennett up carefully after the accident last night. \"Bennett...\" I say lightly. \"Bennett?\" He doesn't move so I do the first thing that comes to mind. \"Oh my god! Somebody help! Rose is dying!\" I scream in his ear. Bennett jumps up and looks around then glares at me when he realizes I was lying. \"Nice one.\" Felix high fives me. \"Amy is barking.\" I announce. \"And you want us to...\" \"Bark along with it?\" \"No.\" I say. \"I want to go check it out.\" We walk up to the next floor and see that there is paper scattered all over the floor. A door is hanging slightly off its we walk inside. \"Well... Shit.\" I say not know what else to do. A star within a circle made of salt lined the floor. Someone had tried to summon some sort of spirit... And it hadn't gone right. I don't know how short/long this is because I'm not using word sooooo... Hope you enjoyed. Ships, review, favorite... You know the drill. ( )_( ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 23] Thanks for all of your reviews, I appreciate them so much. Sorry that sometimes it takes me awhile to get to things. \"Well aren't you an interesting specimen.\" Felix says as he concludes tying down the subject. The half human things just let's out a groan that sounds equivalent to an exhausted sigh. \"There, there.\" Felix pats his arm. Lina, Jasmine, Mason, and Phooko were the only others in the room. The rest were next door waiting for the arrival of Amy's puppies. For some reason the idea of watching birth seems completely undersirable... Where as watching a zombie being dissected is much more intriguing. \"He was just walking around when we found him. Logan and Mason woke us up when they went to check on Amy.\" Lina explains. \"And he didn't react when he saw you?\" I ask. \"Nope, not at all.\" Lina shakes her head. \"Why were you in the same room as them anyways?\" Phooko asks. Lina and Mason switch worried glances and Mason says, \"We were checking out this weird pentagram thing and the girls got tired and fell asleep.\" \"Seems legit.\" I nod. Phooko gives me an unaproving look. Felix scratches his head, \"It might help to know his name. Maybe give him some sort of memory?' \"It's Drew.\" I recall. Felix raises an eyebrow. I shrug slightly. \"I went through his stuff.\" \"You're a nosy little mouse, aren't you?\" He asks. \"I'm too loud to be a mouse.\" I retort. \"Only when you want to be heard.\" He smiles to himself, the smile that bothers me because you can tell something terrifying is going on up in his head. I've seen it too many times before. \"What else do you know about this guy?\" Jasmine interrupts us. \"He came here to perform some sort of ritual. He had been bitten nearby and used the little black magic he knew to heal himself.\" \"How do you know that?\" Phooko asks. \"He kept a journal.\" I say. \"Unfortunately it seems he was unsuccessful in his attempt.\" Felix's grin widens as he speaks, \"Unfortunate for him possibly. As for me...\" He glances at me and sees the unamused look on my face. He sighs andclears his throat, \"On with the dissection then.\" It's obvious that he's holding in a great amount of excitement. I step out of the room for a bit to wonder the halls. It was quite peaceful during the day when the large windows cast evening light onto the walls. I step into the room with the pentagram. It was a wasted attempt, failed because things like magic don't exist. I sit down across from the pentagram and on the sill of the window, reaching into Drew's bag and pulling out the journal. He seemed to be pretty intelligent, much like myself. Even in his second life he appeared to have a basic idea of his surroundings. Which is more than what I can for the rest of the dead. I read through his entries and find nothing to be particularly more intruding then what I've read. Only the last entry, the one were he mentions some gibberish about removing darkness seems the slightest bit important. I glance up and something catches my eye. Some of the salt had moved, just the slightest bit. It hadn't been that way when I entered the room... Not even when I sat down. \"Hel...lo...?\" I say a little confused. With no response I shrug and hop down from the window, setting the book on the nearest chair and leaving the room. I hear excited voice from inside the room where life was entering the world. I peak my head inside to watch as my acquaintances gather around a make shift pen where Amy and her pups were fast asleep. \"It's... So... Cute!\" Kelly squeals. \"I want that one! Wait no, I want that one! Oh... but then that one would be lonely... I want them all!\" Phooka cries. \"Their adorablness is just so... Wow.\" Rose blushes. Bennett laughs next to her. Even Eve is looking a bit intrigued by the puppies while Logan looks at them from behind her. And then Josh leans against the wall in he corner of the room with his arms crossed, looking quite proud of his best friend. With strong will I remove myself from the room and escape back to the dissection room where I am safe from their cuteness. Drew is trying to sit up as Felix pushes him back down, \"No.\" And fixes his glasses as he continues to write something down on a clipboard. Grace and Tom walk into the room, Mason looks at them as if they were extremely unwanted visitors. Grace shuts the door and runs to Felix, \"I think I know why the spirits are here.\" Felix takes a step back, \"Spirits?\" Tom sighs looking exhausted, \"The noises. She calls them spirits .\" Grace looks upset, \"But they are, Tom! I'm telling you...\" \"Whatever you believe, but I disagree.\" He shakes his head and looks to Jasmine. \"Can you put some sense in this girl? Please?\" Jasmine shakes her head, \"I'm afraid I agree with Grace. Contrary to what I said last night... I have been noticing some strange presences lately.\" Mason and I groan at the same time, \"That is so stupid.\" \"Wow. That's spooky.\" Lina shudders. I sigh and glance at Felix, \"You're a man of science, aren't you? You really believe in this bull?\" \"Science has nothing to do with this.\" He argues. I sigh seeing where Tom's exhaustion is resonating from. \"The thing that's been calling the spirits is the pentagram!\" Grace says. Drew's eyes light up a little and his head snaps unnaturally in Grace's direction. He lifts a rotting hand and points toward her. \"Te... Te... ay... M-mon...\" He stutters. We all take a step back in shock. Felix writes it down on his board. \"Te...aymon...\" Is there something more than the lumbering zombies out to get the group? Has someone else been calling upon evil spirits other than Drew? What will happen to Amy's puppies? Does Drew actually understand what he's saying? Find out next time on Zombie. CANDY. CHAINSAW. MASSACRE! ( )_( ) {= 0 o 0 =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 24] Sorry for the wait. No one will be eating any puppies... Please let me know if you're still reading have you not already. Everyone here is crazy to be completely honest. We've all lost it. We're running out of fresh food. And everyone is sick of each other. The only good thing is all the new puppies. Fluffy scratches my arm as I read through the journal left behind by Drew, trying to make sense of his jumbled words. I throw a rat bone across the room and Fluffy goes to fetch it. I had grown to like this room, it just feels so serene sometimes. Fluffy returns and sets the bone on top of the sentence I had been reading. \"Genius.\" I say sarcastically, removing the bone. That's when I see it. A zombie rushes forward toward Grace as it goes for her arm. Kelly defends her but is too slow. The zombie slashes her with it's long, mutated nails. \"Shit!\" Kelly hisses. Josh rushes in and chops at the zombie's head with a blade. It sticks and blood starts spraying out of it's neck, splattering onto Josh, Mason, and Rose. \"That's disgusting.\" Rose says wiping the blood off her face. \"Allow me.\" Bennett strides over and wipes her face with his shirt. I roll my eyes as Josh finishes off the zombie. \"Thanks for the help.\" He says sarcastically. I I look around the room and realize Felix and Tom aren't even in here and I had wasted my time by checking. \"Hey.\" Mason says to me as he wipes the blood off himself. Not all of us have a Bennett in shining cow skin to take care of us. \"Hi.\" I respond taking in the scene in front of us. Grace and Kelly were starting to argue as Josh Phooko comes in with a med pack. \"Haven't seen you around much lately.\" He says. I nod, \"It's nice to keep to myself sometimes.\" \"Not all of us get that opportunity.\" Mason sighs. I shrug, \"You can always try.\" He nods again and turns to me. \"So we've been talking...\" \"We?\" \"Just some of us... and we think it might be a good time to get moving again. We've been here, what... two weeks?\" He asks. \"Has it been that long?\" I suppose I have been distancing myself from the others quite a bit lately. \"Something like that.\" \"Felix wants to stay here until he finishes his work.\" I say. \"So let him.\" He shrugs. I turn to him with wide eyes, \"We can't just leave him here!\" \"Why not?\" He asks. \"Are you kidding?\" I laugh nervously. \"Sorry we're not doing that.\" \"Fine by me. As long as we can get out of here soon.\" He shrugs. \"I'll see what I can do.\" I say and exit the room. What was his problem? \"Hey. Where've you been?\" Lina asks me as I enter the \"lab.\" I ignore her question and get straight to it, \"Demon.\" Tom looks up, \"What?\" \"What Drew was trying to tell us, Daemon which is latin for demon.\" I say. \"Took you long enough.\" Felix says not looking away from his little project. \"I didn't see you coming up with any explanations.\" I place my hands on my hips. \"That's because I'm busy with this. Really, Lumina, it seems like a pretty smooth translation.\" He shakes his head. \"Sorry, I guess I'm not as smart as you.\" I say sarcastically. Drew lays on the cot looking quite comfortable for something so dead. Actually… he was looking a little less dead then the last time I saw him. How was that… \"I've been trying to replace his skin. There might be a way I can get the blood to circulate through him again… I might be able to revive him.\" Felix says as if reading my mind. \"That's great.\" I mumble. \"Yeah, except he's really starting to stink up this place… and so is Drew.\" Tom says, smirking a little at his own joke. Eve sighs, \"He hasn't left this room for four days.\" \"I know all of us are a little slow on hygiene but come on!\" Lina cries. \"Shower. Now.\" I demand pointing toward the door. Felix shakes his head. \" Now. \" He doesn't budge. I pull my gun and put it to his head. \"Fine!\" He exaggerates and leaves the room. \"Thank you!\" Tom says gratefully. I sit on one of the only chairs that wasn't occupied by junk. \"Unfortunately the others are pushing to leave soon.\" I say as the door shuts. Drew's eyes roll to the side of his head. \"Depending on your situation, you'll be accompanying us.\" I say to him. He gives some sort of grunt of understanding. \"Is it going to be too much for us to join you?\" Jasmine asks as she enters the room. \"Sorry… I overheard from outside.\" \"Wait… Jasmine I don't know if that's such a good-\" \"Tom… this isn't your decision. Actually… it's Felix's.\" Jasmine sighs. Drama… this is the reason I had taken some time off in the first place. \"Felix doesn't own us.\" Tom hisses. \"Tom… don't talk like that.\" Grace says also entering the room. \"Is it getting stuffy in here?\" I ask to no one imparticular. \"It's rational for us to go with him.\" She says quietly. \"Then you go.\" Tom huffs. \"But... Tom!\" Grace cries. \"Hey guys, what's going on?\" Logan asks entering the room while holding a puppy. I'm pretty sure it's name was Jr. \"There are way too many people in this room.\" I sigh. And it slowly gets louder and louder as everyone starts arguing. Then the door opens once more. Felix cleans his glasses with his shirt and looks up, his wet hair dripping. \"What's… going on in here?\" He says slowly. A small dog runs up behind him and he picks it up, \"Hi, Bones.\" \"Okay… Everyone just shut up for like three seconds!\" I yell loud enough for everything to come to an abrupt end. \"Thank you…\" I breathe. There were too many people… to many problems…. to many dogs. \"If you would all just do me a little favor, please.\" I say lightly. \"Choose between staying here with Tom… or going with me.\"[Chapter 25] I'm sorry that it's been so long. I was on vacation. I'm actually a writer for a low budget anime so I've been busy with that, too. I pack the last of our things inside one of the trucks and turn around, sighing heavily as I do so. It's a beautiful day. Spring is finally warming up the atmosphere and a feeling of new life fills the air. Which is good because we live in a rotting world. \"You're not actually going to keep that thing as a pet... are you?\" I hear Eve ask with disgust. \"Why shouldn't I?\" Felix asks. Eve looks at him like he's just made rhe most ridiculous comment ever, \"He's a danger and he's gross.\" She makes a note of his peeling, grey skin. \"Well that's just cause I haven't finished fix'n him up yet. Look at him!\" He shoves Drew into Eve's face. She steps back and looks at Felix with no expression. \"Who could say no this face?\" Drew let's out a strange groan and drools on Eve. She wipes it off and pushes Felix and the friendly zombie away. \"To be honest I think it might be good to bring him with.\" I say, stepping into the conversation I had just been observing. \"What?\" Eve cries. \"It'll keep felix busy. We have something to test vaccines and cures on, and we might even be able to save him.\" Felix grins smugly. \"Told you.\" \"Everything's moved out.\" Kelly says. Phooko runs up behind her. \"We went through the whole hotel.\" \"Good. We'll leave as soon as everyone gets their asses out here.\" I say. I breathe in the fresh air and smell the spring in it. Ahh... lovely. \"I've cleaned up all of the things rhat could be attracting any bad spirits.\" Rose says walking over with Bennett following like a puppy. \"That's good.\" Eve says. Lina runs over to us and starts danxing around energetically, \"We finally get to leave!\" \"Who knows, maybe we'll actually accomplish something this time 'round.\" Bennett says. \"We can at least hope.\" I say. The others make their way iut of the building. You see after the little dispute with staying and leaving, everyone sided with me. Thomas was forced into coming with, so we hot wired another vehicle and got all our things ready to go. \"Yeah... I won't miss this place.\" Logan shakes his head. He starts the truck and I sit in the passenger seat. I look in the rear view mirror and notice something glowing read as we drive away. The hotel had gone up in flames. Rather quickly if you ask me. I wonder if there really was something haunting that place... Ring around the rosie Pocket full of posies Ashes, ashes We all fall down Rind around the rosie Pocket full of posies Ashes, ashes... I wake up with a jolt and look around me. A light was flickering, but that was expected for an underground maintenance room. The dim light made the room more ominous than it should be, and I felt like my nightmare was coming slowly coming true. I hear a ripping noise and snap my head up. Mason was leaning against the wall on the damp floor reading a book. He eyes me and then lets his eyes drift back down to the page. \"Nightmare?\" \"Yeah.\" I breathe. \"I dont see why you have them.\" He mumbles. I raise an eyebrow, \"Huh?\" \"You're already living one, princess.\" He says sounding a little annoyed. I gaze ar him a little longer than looking down to my hands. Long gashes went up and down them from all the zombie slaying. It every now and then they burned with an amazing pain. I jump when Josh stirs in his sleep to my right. Two dogs lie under the same blanket on his side. I can't believe we've been able to take care of those little things and not lost any. It's amazing we haven't lost ourselves. I stand up and walk to the door which was held shut with a bar. No zombies would be finding their way in here. \"You aren't really thinking of going out there, are you?\" Mason asks behind me. I look over my shoulder at him, \"I think I'll be okay.\" I pick up my axe that was leaning against the wall and lift the bar. I push it open and look around outside, it was damp and dark. The same dim lights lit the subway system, giving it an eerie loom. I walk up the staircase making sure to avoid any lingering zombies. It was still dark here as well. Street lights lit the sidewalks of early England and I puff out a cold breath of air, zipping my sweatshirt up. What I really wanted was a midnight snack. And the best way to do that was raid a nearby store. Which, in a group, seemed like an easy task, but alone was nearly impossible. Maybe I should have brought someone with me. Phooka, Grace or Felix would have been more than happy to go. But for some reason I just don't feel like dealing with the others now. Perhapd I could just go rogue until things get back to order. No. That's a stupid idea. I'll get myself killed thinking like that. I scale the side of a building to get a better view of the city. Yeaup. There was the perfect little grocery store just on the other side. Once on the ground again, I stealthily cross the street to the store. Assuming the alarm would sound, I grab mu axe in my right hand, and gun in my left. I kick through the glass of the door. \"Come out, come out wherever you are.\" Immediately a ringing noise sounded out. I hop inside and grab a pack of oreos and two cans of monster, stashing them in my backpack. I swing it back around my shoulders. And turn to see some gruesome lpoking thing missing an eye. \"Out of my way.\" I kick it back and fire at it's head upon impact. Only to see there were to more behind it. \"Oh, you have friends.\" I jump over the metal bar of the door and through the broken glass. Shooting at them as they crowded behind me. As I aim at the head of what appeared to be the last one close enough to do some real damage, I'm tackled from the side. the gun fires sideways and I curse. The bullets hits the gas tank siding the store perfectly. my eyes widen and I shove the damn thing away as I run to the building as the explosion broke out, sending me flying onto the sidewalk, my head landing on my backpack. I look around dizzily, an annoying ringing in my ears. The store was in flames but no zombies were coming near me. Oh hell. Am I dead?! \"Get up.\" I hear a voice beside me. Felix is standing there with a gun at his side. I stand up feeling the blood rush to my head. \"Thanks for the help.\" I say with incredible sarcasm. He pinches his glasses, for some reason extremely annoyed, \"They're scared of fire. So you're lucky.\" \"I would have been fine.\" I say stubbornly. \"Alright! He found her!\" Lina says excitedly. Phooka, Eve and Josh follow behind her. \"Oh good, you've made it a party.\" I roll my eyes. \"Come on, let's go back.\" Josh says. And so we do... Well just another chapter of awesomeness... I'm sure I'll find some kind of a plot eventually... ( )_( ) {= 0 . 0 =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 26] I know there are no excuses... Blah blah blah I'm sorry. Let's just get on with it. \"Fluffy!\" I call to my trusty steed. He gallops over to me and flops into my arms. I pet his head and hold out a rag to his nose.\"Go find 'em, boy.\" Fluffy runs off past the residue of broken down city and I follow him carefully. We had what we came here for and it was time to leave. \"Where, exactly, are we going?\" Kelly huffs as she trudges along in boots soaked with mud. We had just escaped a disgusting swamp full of rotting bodies and bugs with an overwhelming blood lust. We were scaled head to toe with war wounds of the nasty creatures. \"When we get to... Wherever we're going... I'm going to bathe in calydryl.\" Mason says not as jokingly as he should have. \"Look at the bright side.\" Kelly nudges him. \"Your feet are dry.\" \"So what have you in that bag?\" Tom asks Felix. He had been carrying a brief case around that he had acquired in the last town. \"The key to world domination.\" Tomr raises an eyebrow. \"What do you need for that? The world's yours, take it. We don't want it anymore.\" \"Actually that was a joke.\" Felix says clutching the bag tighter. \"What I have is a bit more important then ruling Earth.\" \"Well, what is it? We're dying to know, we are.\" Grace begs. \"It's a bit hard to explain. You'll see when we stop.\" Felix nods. \"Speaking of that where are we stopping?\" Rose asks with sudden interest. We had been walking for hours. We were tired, faces covered by dirt, and starving. But what was new about that. \"I'm desperate for a change in shoes.\" Kelly whines. \"Should have worn boots like the rest of us.\" I point at my feet and almost trip over them while walking. \"There's really no reason not to.\" Jasmine says. \"Who are you trying to look good for?\" Phooko asks. \"The zombies?\" Kelly turns a new shade of red and socks Phooko in the arm. \"Look!\" Phooka jumps suddenly. She points toward something in the distance. The sun blinds me for a moment as I look to where she's pointing. A long sandy beach surrounded the surface of water. It was really a beautiful sight. Everyone rushed to it, the dogs barking after their owners as they ran, kicking off their shews and socks. It was finally spring and the warm air made the atmosphere so wonderful. The boys threw their shirts off as they touched the beach. Finally something positive, some sort of joy and happiness. Suddenly something grabs me from behind and Felix is dragging me to the beach. He swiftly throws off my shoes, making a point of how much they smelled. He stops at the water'ss he face, grinning. It takes me to moment before I realize what he has in mind. I give him my family's world famous death glare, but it's too late, I'm already sailing through the air and before I know it, I'm plunging into the cool water. I emerge from the water and sputter. Felix's eyes are wide as are the other spectators as he realizes the horrible mistake he's made. \"I'll kill you!\" I scream as I scramble out of the water and on to the beach and chase him down. \"I want to stay here... Forever.\" Rose says quietly as we sit on the beach. We girls were wearing only bras and shorts, as the guys wore their boxers. We knew each other all too well, things like this didn't matter anymore. Bennett sighs and looks at her with sad eyes, \"You know we can't do that.\" Phooka smiles but only slightly, \"We could.\" But her words are nothing more than mere comfort. She knew as well as the rest of us that we couldn't stay here. \"Maybe someday... When this is all over. We can come back.\" Lina suggests. It was a fun thought to entertain but... \"You think that'll ever happen?\" Felix asks only to me. I shrug slightly. \"It's funny. I feel like... Even if someday this does end... Will still all be together, somehow.\" Phooka says softly. The cool ocean breeze blows in as the sun starts it descend to the bottom of the horizon. I shiver and Felix takes his sweatshirt off and wraps it around my arms. \"How did this happen?\" Mason asks breaking the short silence. Eve raises an eyebrow and looks at him quizzically, \"A disease spreads and people die.\" Mason shakes his head and looks up at the waves rolling in on the beach. \"I mean how did we end up together. How did we manage to keep us all alive. What makes us the ones who are survivors?\" Deep. \"And it's weird how even through all this killing, all the deaths... We still find times like this go have fun and we fall in love doing it.\" It's hard not to miss the quick glance he gives Lina. She doesn't seem to notice, though. \"It's just life.\" I say a little quieter than I expected. \"It's what happens.\" \"It'll be weird,\" Josh says, laying on his back as Amy comes to lay down by him. \"If things go back to the way they were.\" \"But good...\" Phooka says. Josh gives her a quick, faint smile. We sit in silence a little more. What Mason said was right. It is strange how fate has fallen into place. It makes me wonder if when all is said and done... Will Bennett still love Rose the way he does now? Or is his a night in shining armor approach just a facade, and Rose is just a convenience? If that's the case... I'll hafta kick his left ass. \"That's right!\" Kelly shouts suddenly. \"Jesus, you could scare wake the dead with that kind of voice.\" Logan jumps. \"Already taken care of.\" Jasmine reminds him. Drew mumbles something incoherent from where he lays. We had to tie him up to a post so he would do anything stupid and try to go in the water. Felix said his skin would fall off if he did. \"You never told us what's in the case.\" Kelly says. Felix nods and looks thoughtfully at the waves. Then he looks to the brief case sitting by our belongings and clothes that were set out to dry.\"Like I said, it's a bit hard to explain.\" And right now it was a bit hard for me not to fan girl over him. He wasn't wearing his glasses and he looks (admittedly) kinda hot with wet hair... Not to mention he had a nice body. I mean he didn't have a six pack but... It was getting there. \"So you can save us?\" Tom asks suddenly. \"Huh?\" I accident say. Oh crap, I had daydreamed through his entire explanation. \"I'm not going to repeat myself, Lumina. You should try listening sometime.\" He says clasping his hand over my head. I swat it away and glare at him. \"Yeah, like I'd listen to you.\" \"He thinks he has the cure.\" Bennett says. \"What?\" I gasp. Why didn't he tell me? \"Not the cure... Just something to help make it.\" He corrects Bennett. \"Actually Phooko and Eve were the ones who helped me figure it out. There are some pretty smart people here.\" \"That's great and all but-\" Logan is cut off by the sudden frantic moans of Drew, and barking of the dogs. \"Shit!\" Eve hisses as she stands up, grabig a knife out of virtually no where. \"How. Do you. Do. That!?\" I cry. \"We've got more important things to worry about.\" Josh says putting his arm out in front of Phooka. Wait. What. I look around and realize we had mostly been sitting in pairs. When did this happen? When did all this romance start? When did- Wait. I was sitting by someone... Shit. As I'm lost in thought, I do not realize the oncoming zombies as the approacht he beach. I wonder briefly if it was Kelly's loud screams hat attracted them, or maybe they had only just found us. \"Damn it, Lumina!\" Felix hisses as he jumps out in front of me. Saving me from an infected. \"What's wrong with you today? Could you pay attention just for one?\" \"...huh?\" I say slowly. He sighs and hands me my axe. \"Ooooh. Now that's something I understand.\" I take to the chopping of the zombies. \"Ah, shit guys, just... Shit!\" Lina growls suddenly. She bends over a wounded leg and sucks in quick breathes of air. \"I'm out guys... I can't. \"It's okay, I got her.\" Mason says, helping her over to the area where all our things were. It was safe there. \"Of course you do.\" I mumble as I turn to meet two, dead, drooping eyes within sagging sockets. I like out a small groan of disgust. It coughs up some blackish-blue blood onto my face as the blade of my axe meets what's left of it's rotting stomach. It's gender was indistinguishable, and I'm thankful that I'm not one of them. The beach that we had shared some of our greatest memories on had now become a blood bath. The zombies bled into the water, mixing it to turn the edges of the waves a dark purple. I try to check on Lina, but I don't have time to spare. There were few left. \"Watch out!\" I yell at LT who's already halfway under my blade. This suddenly becomes \"The Matrix\" as he bends back and I dive over him placing my blade in the zombies shoulder, and follow it through by kicking it away. I topple backwards onto Logan, who shoves me off in a heartless manner and rushes at the same zombie. He stabs his blade through it, and I bet it'd be super awesome in slow motion. \"Good work.\" He says as we share on of the most epic high fives ever. \"That's it.\" Tom breathes. \"They're gone.\" \"For now.\" Grace says. I hope this makes up for the few weeks I missed. Love you all! Thanks for reading! ( )_( ) {=^ . ^=} (\")-(\")[Chapter 27] On time this week. Will be ending soon.(: The rain drums against the tin roof with an eclectic melody. I had been trying to sleep with no luck, as usual. It was early in the morning, my phone blinked, telling me it was slightly passed four in the morning. Giving up, I roll onto my side and stare into the darkness. A rusted oven sat atop a hard wood floor. The kitchen still smelled of the meat we had killed and fed on the night before. We were lucky to have a couple of hunters in our group. A map of Europe plasters the wall. Indicating we reside currently in Belgium, and not far from France. I still wonder how long it's going to be before we can return to the way things should be... If ever. I stand up and pull a sweater that had been resting on a nearby rocking chair. The house smells of old people and must. Conveniently, an old umbrella leans against the wall. I grab it and open the door, shutting it with a soft click behind me. \"Mornin'.\" Bennett greets me as he observes the scenery. It was just a dense forest. Suddenly I hear a scratching sound against the door and I jump. I look inside to see Fluffy scratching against it, and let out a relieved sigh. I open it and Fluffy trots out into the rain. Artwick was already playing in the mud when Fluffy decided to join him. \"Good morning.\" I finally respond. The rain was slowly starting to let up. \"I have a feeling...\" Bennett says slowly. \"That it's going to be a beautiful day.\" Minneapolis' POV \"Go faster.\" I demand. The truck stays at the exact same speed and I start to get frustrated. \"Lufias.\" \"It's dangerous to go any faster.\" He sighs. He was exhausted and upset. He puts up with a lot, and he has my respect for that. \"I just want to find them.\" I shrink into my seat, worried about my kids. \"I know.\" Luffy says, looking over at me with a small smile. \"We will.\" We come upon an old trailer park, it looks somewhat familiar. \"You know where this is. You've been here before.\" Emmett urges in the back of my head. Thinking about it pains me but I try anyways. I feel as though Luffy won't know the answer. That it'd be a waste to ask... \"Of course...\" I say to myself. I see Luffy look at me out of the corner my eyes. He's used to me talking to myself but he always listens, just in case it's important. \"I'm the only one left...\" \"Of what, babes?\" He asks softly and ruffles my hair. \"They're all dead...\" I cringe, pulling my chest to my knees. \"Not all of them. Think harder.\" Kory says. Although it hurts I dig further. \"No. Russia was there.\" I remember. Luffy picks up his phone and dials someone. It rings for awhile before being picked up, I can make out a female voice. \"Rosalie, can you help me?\" Luffy asks quietly. \"Jessica's talking about being the only one left and mentioned you.\" \"Yes. We came here once, a very long time ago. Everyone we came with is now dead. You shouldn't be worried. I'm sure she'll be fine.\" Rosalie answers. Of course I'll be fine. I always am. \"I feel like ever since this started again, it's been getting worse for her. She's not that stable anymore.\" Luffy says with a sad tone. \"It's bringing up old memories. I'm surprised we all aren't going through this. I guess her's are a little more traumatic.\" Rose reassures him. \"Thanks.\" Luffy says before hanging up the phone. I smile at him and lay a hand on his arm. \"I'm still here.\" I say. \"That's all that matters.\" Luffy smiles back. We exit the truck and I study the park. Most of the trailers were rusted over. One in particular caught my eye. The same set of satellite dishes still sat there today. \"I know you never met him...\" I say to Luffy. It was only us here, the others were somewhere else in search of their own families. \"And that may be a blessing. But this is where Kory used to live.\" \"Die in combat?\" My husband asks. I nod, \"More or less.\" The sound of an engine starting carries through the wind. My head snaps in the direction it comes from and Luffy and I head toward it. We sneak behind a trailer and peer out upon a group of four boys. The oldest has to be in his late twenties. A whip is strapped to his belt, and scars line his muscular arms. He has dark but clean hair, contrasting from the rest of himself. We move to get a better view and lay in the long grass upon a hill. Another boy leaned against a truck, a bandana wrapped around his upper arm. Whether or not it conceals a wound I am unable to tell. The third boy works on the engine of the truck, the same age as the boy with the bandana. About seventeen. Young people are the most likely to survive through these apocalypses. The reason being I am unaware of. The last boy is no more than eight. He holds a shot gun that dwarves him. My heart sinks knowing that he's been deprived of a childhood. He's been turned into a child soldier by force, in a war in which there is no winner. \"Hey!\" The bandana boy yells. The car engine gets louder as another truck comes into view. A girl gets out from the bed of the truck. She has familiar dark, curly hair and tan skin. And from the driver's seat... \"My son.\" Luffy breathes. \"That's my son.\" He starts to scramble to his feet but I have to do everything in my power to keep him down. \"Idiot.\" I hiss. He glares at me, demanding answers. \"See the way those boys are just standing around?\" I ask. He nods slowly. \"They're guarding something. If you go out jumping and screaming like that, they won't hesitate to kill you.\" \"What do you suppose we do?\" Luffy asks in an apologetic voice. He got mad at me and he knew he shouldn't have. I think for a moment. \"I may have lost my marbles, but there's one thing I've still got.\" I say standing up. I pop a few buttons on my shirt and let my hair down. After all these years, I still look twenty-three, and I'm proud of it. \"Let the others know. Wait here.\" The youngest boy spots me first and yells to the bandana boy. He looks up and sees me aiming his gun, then slowly lowering it. The boy working on the car starts to look up, but hits his head only the hood. And the oldest is just a little mesmerized. It's probably been awhile since they've seen a pretty girl. \"Should I shoot?\" The youngest asks without lowering his gun. \"No...\" The oldest says. \"Just wait, Junior.\" Junior pouts but puts down his gun. \"Hi there.\" I say with a smile. If I could just keep it together for the next ten minutes, is be good. \"Hello...\" The three boys say confused. \"Oh god.\" Mine says. \"Who the hell is she?\" The girl asks. Jealous? The boy sighs. \"My name's Jessica.\" I say to the oldest and hold out a hand. \"... I'm Lucas.\" He says. \"I'm Levi.\" The one who had hit his head says, still confused, \"I'm Logan.\" Says the guy with the bandana. \"What can we do for you?\" Levi asks, collecting himself. \"I'm looking for something...\" I say slowly. Levi and Logan switch glances and look to Lucas for instruction. Lucas clears his throat. \"I'm afraid we can't help you.\" \"Oh I think you can.\" I say, inching closer, trying to buy more time. \"I.. Uhm... You have to leave.\" He sputters. The. I hear it, the quick chopping of air. \"Hansel?\" The girl asks impatiently. \"That's...\" \"I won't be leaving here without my son.\" I say with pure confidence as the helicopters and trucks appear behind me. The boys jaws drop. \"My mom.\" Hansel sighs. Review please! ( )_( ) {= ' w ' =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 28] Hello everyone, how is your week going? Snow is finally melting here! The car was warm from the sunlight that shines in, although it was hurting my eyes. With less than five hours of sleep on me for the past two days, I'm hardly able to function. My head pounds with the desperate need for sleep. \"If you're that tired then go to sleep.\" Rose says as if it were that simple. \"Can't.\" Is all I reply. Lina, who has gotten the most sleep in the last week was put in charge of driving. Rose, Bennett, and Tom were in the back. Bennett had dozed off a couple of hours ago, and continues to annoy us with his constant snoring. Even Rose is getting kind of tired with it. \"Make it stop.\" Tom begs. I shoot him a glare. I wasn't going to deprive Bennett of his sleep even if it was bothering me. I'm not cruel. \"Can we stop at the next gas station or something?\" I ask Lina. She nods with a small smile. \"Sooo... What's going on with Mason?\" I ask. Lina's eyes widen a bit but she continues to look forward down the road. \"Nothing.\" She says. I raise an eyebrow and look at here until she continues. \"Just a friend that's all.\" \"Oh. I see. So you friend zoned the poor kid.\" I nod in understanding. \"No, no! That's not it at all! I just don't think...\" \"You know he's a little old for you anyways.\" I say thoughtfully. \"Well I... I don't think age is all that important in times like these.\" She says furrowing her brow. \"It's also a terrible time for a relationship.\" \"I think it's an excellent time.\" I blurt without thinking. \"Wha...?\" \"You never know how long you're going to last out here. So it's best to just do everything you can before it's too late.\" I say. Lina looks at me with a concerned face, then looks back to the road and the look disapears. \"I guess you're right. I never thought of it like that before.\" I nod. \"How is your leg doing?\" I ask her. I look over to see it was still bandaged. Fluffy stirs in my lap but doesn't wake up. The poor thing is tuckered out just like I am \"It doesn't hurt as much anymore, and the swelling has gone down. I'm just glad it's not infected.\" She sighs. \"I have to thank Mason for that.\" We arrive at the gas station. I leave the others to go find the restrooms, which are located in the back of the store. The mirrors are rusty, and it smells as if someone had just sneezed several times. That was how most zombies smelled, with the mixture of blood and decay. I check each stall with my gun in my right hand. To my surprise they were all empty. Usually people that got infected while in the stalls never could figure out how to get back out. I guess nobody died here. I laugh a little at the sight of myself as I wash my hands. My hair was in a ponytail but sticking up all over the place, face covered in dirt and a little smudge of blood on my nose. My shorts are ripped and I have healing scabs all over my arms and legs. I look like a true warrior, for sure. I wash my face off, drying it with the paper towels and look at myself on more time. As I do, I notice something has changed in the background. One of the stall doors that had just been open was now closed. \"Hello?\" I say feebly. I give a mental face palm and step closer to the door. \"Is someone in here?\" A stuttering moan came from inside. I scrunch my face up and take a step back. But... What if they weren't a zombie. What if they needed my help. The sound seemed slightly human... \"Are you okay?\" I ask knocking lightly on the stall. It opens at the light touch and a women, half decayed and half alive sat bent over the toilet. She turns and looks at me slowly and I back up again upon seeing her face. She looks at me for a few seconds before letting out a wild, earpiercing shriek. She jumps at me and I run screaming out of the bathroom. The others stare at me from outside, shocked. I run past them, screaming, \"Don't just stand there, do something you lazy fucks!\" I run past them again, but the thing only chases me. And damn is she fast. \"Lumina!\" Phooka cries as she gets out of the truck that had just pulled in. She and the others rush out to gather with the other people sitting there and watching. \"Why won't one of you shoot it?\" I cry as I run dilapitated circles around them. \"It's too fast!\" Grace calls. Behind me, I hear my dog start chasing the witch, barking after it. It still does nothing to phase her. \"Lumina! listen to me!\" Jasmine says. \"Okay!\" I say impatiently. My lungs start to hurt. \"You have to get to the highest point possible.\" She says. I give her a funny look as I run past again, \"What?\" \"Just do it!\" She yells. I check my surroundings quickly. \"It has to be somewhere she can't get to.\" \"Are you sure she won't come after you?\" I ask. \"Positive!\" She says. I nod and remember something my brother taught me before he became a delinquent. I hop onto the hood of one of the trucks, running as fast as possible and. Climb onto the top, hurling myself to the roof over the gas station, tucking and rolling. The screaming zombie cried out once more, trying to find a way to get to me. But before she can suffer any longer, Josh puts her out of her misery. I jump down from the roof as Felix catches me. I sigh, an ache rising in my rib cage. He brushes my hair back and kisses my forehead lightly. I stick my tongue out and the romantic gesture. And he chuckles deep in his chest. \"Thanks Jasmine. You saved my life.\" I sigh. Although I still don't like her that much. \"I did what I had to.\" She says before returning to her truck. I sigh and look back to Felix. \"Would it be alright if ride with you?\" I ask. He nods and escorts me to the truck. We ride in the back as Logan and Eve talk up front. I'm even more exhausted now, but it seems impossible to sleep. The sun starts to disapear behind the horizon, the warm air along with it. Felix looks out the window quietly while I save my game of pokemon on the game boy my mom had given me when I was little. I carried it everywhere. \"You didn't save me today.\" I mumble. Felix looks down at me as if he were shocked that I had said anything. \"I'm sorry, I thought you didn't want me to save you anymore.\" He says wiping some dirt off my face. As he does so I notice something in the front seat. There are two hands interlinked and I smile to myself. We are all so strange. \"Do you see that.\" I whisper in his ear. He nods with a grin and pulls me closer to him. I hate it, but I like his warmth. I like the safety I feel and the What the fuck. I look past him to see something behind the truck, sitting in the bed. A face appears in the window and I hold back a scream. Drew peers in giving a goofy grin. I don't think he knows why he's smiling. But it's still pretty funny. I laugh a little and return to Felix, noticing something covering his wrist. \"What's this?\" I ask, pulling up his sleeve. A scaly, purple and green skin runs along his forearm. My jaw drops a little as I observe it. He doesn't say anything, which bothers me. My fingers longer over the scales, not knowing if it's safe to feel. \"Go ahead. It won't hurt you.\" He says stiffly. I run my fingers along it. It feels like snake skin and I wonder what on earth it's from. \"It's an early stage of decay.\" He sighs. \"I was able to stop the spreading for now.\" \"How long has it been there?\" I ask him. How had I not noticed before? \"A few weeks.\" He shrugs. \"I was being careless. I didn't treat a bite the way I should have. It's my fault.\" I look at him, not knowing what to think or do. So I do what I do best. \"You bastard!\" I hiss at him. He looks at me, shocked, and grows even more confused as I proceed to hug him tightly. \"You're such a jerk. You should have just done what you were supposed to! Now you're going to leave me here to deal with these things. You're not supposed to die. You're the one that's supposed to rescue me. But you had to be all selfish and go die like a coward!\" \"Everything alright back there?\" Logan asks. \"She's just tired.\" Felix says. And like the little bitch I am, I cry into Felix's shoulder until I finally fall asleep. Sorry:P kind of a cheesy, lame chapter, but oh well. Comment, favorite, follow.:3 ( )_( ) {= - . - =} (,,)-(,,)[Chapter 29] Sorry for spelling errors. I used my phone this time so it wasn't easy . The rain drums against the roof, the muggy feel of late April fills the lab. I sit back in my chair studying the ceiling as Tom hisses under his breath. A small drop of watered down acid touched his hand, and probably left some sort of burning sensation. I have done it myself many times before. Drew moans sleepily across from me. He and I had been deep in conversation, or what little of it we could have. He was growing more and more intelligent each day. I could see it in his eyes when he'd understand something. They'd light up, and look a little less dead each time. Even his skin was staying in place pretty well. I commend Felix for his good work. Rose and Kelly were talk while drinking coffee in the kitchen right off the lab, Kelly's loud laughter echoed through the room. A clock ticks somewhere, annoying me. The sterile white room adds to my boredom. Eve, Lina and Bennett were discussing some sort of mathematical equation, and what it might mean. It doesn't sound very fascinating, so I choose to ignore it. Grace, Josh, Jasmine, and Phooko were eating at the small table in the corner of the room. It's not very sanitary and a little disturbing how comfortable they are eating around toxins such as these. Toxins that Felix was freely toying with, like some sort of child and dolls. He smiles to himself every now and then, seeming very intrigued by his own research. Phooka and Mason are playing a game of chess, although both look like they have no clue what they're doing. Logan has joined Tom and Felix in their studying of the soon to be cure. And I sit here on the couch, staring at the ceiling, while history is in the making. I decide it's about time I do something. I stand up and walk over to the kitcgen and open the refrigerator door. I pull out a can of spam and some bread that had somehow survived until now. I lay tge bread down on a napkin and layer spam slices, government cheese, and mustard onto it. Then I pull up a chair next to Rose and Kelly, and take a bite into that beautiful sandwhich. Yeah, tons better than footprints on the moon. Fluffy hops on the chair next to me and tries to take a bite of my sandwich. I smack his nose and he looks ashamed of himself. \"So...\" I say to no one in particular. \"We were just talking about how nice it is to be back in America.\" Rose says as though being in anotger country had made a difference. \"Good to be home.\" Kelly agrees. \"I suppose...\" I say quietly. We had only arrived yesterday. It is a ghost town for as far as I can see. Even in the city, there don't seem to be any survivors. I stand from my chair and grab my jacket that was hanging near the door. \"I'll be back before it gets dark.\" Is all I say before exiting. The streets are full of debree, and it seems the best way to pass all of it would be using a bike. I approache the nearest motorcycle and recall what I learned in an auto engineering class in freshman year. I successfully hotwire the bike and it starts without a problem. With nearly a full tank of gas, I hop on the bike and see what I can remember about riding one. It seems as though it was the only house untouched by chaos. It stood tall and full of pride as if it had one a great battle. I enter through the front door, where furniture was toppled over as if someone had been in a big hurry. A family portrait hangs sideways on the wall, the frame cracked, almost like it is showibg the sudden seperation of each member. On a mantel, a picture of an estrange group of people lined up outside a military base lays. I walk through the halls to find the room I have been looking for. A secret door, that at first glance appears to be a cabinet for towels and bed sheets. But it turned to reveal a tunnel that lead to a pristine, sterile room. Everything was neatly in it's place. Which leads to the conclusion that my family has not come back. And are likely dead. I suck in a deep breath and search through the files lined on a shelf. Hepatitis, Meningitis, Pokerus, Malaria, H1N1... CoproSomnera. I pull the folder out and open it to the first page that holds a sketch of a human in the early stages of infection. The next page is a sketch of how the average zombie brain works. I skip through to see if I can find what I'm looking for. Finally I come upon a page... \"I'm back.\" I say to the quiet room. Felix was fast asleep in one of the chairs, while the others ate silently. \"We're having soup tonight.\" Lina says. I sit down at the table and we eat in silence. When the last person is done, Mason pulls out a deck of cards and deals them. We play a quiet game of Texas Hold 'Em while I wait to show Felix what I found. Finally we hear shuffling as Felix appears at the doorway. He looks slightly confused and seems to take his time. Eventually it seems to dawn on him that he's supoosed to be doing something important, and he shuffles back to the lab. I follow him in hopes that he'll be awake enough to understand me. I hand him the folder and he flips through the pages. He furrows his brow and looks at me, \"What is this?\" \"It's research my mom did during the last apocalypse. I thought it might help you.\" I shrug. \"I don't think it will.\" He sighs, setting the book down. \"But thank you.\" \"But... she wrote in the cure...\" \"That may have stopped the original infection, but these zombies are immune to whatever cure was used in the past, otherwise the outbreak would have been contained.\" Felix explains. I sigh, my hopes being burtally destroyed by Felix's words. \"That's strange...\" He says removing his attention from his work. I follow his gaze to a set of tvs displaying images of security cameras. I don't notice anything to interesting about the footage until he adds, \"The wind must've really picked up on just that one side of the building.\" He's right, the debree was flying around everywhere at a fast pace. A female voice behind us speaks up, \"I wonder what is causing that...\" Eve says. Just a few chapters left. (: ( )_( ) {= × - × =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 30] Hello everyone!C: \"That's strange...\" He says removing his attention from his work. I follow his gaze to a set of tvs displaying images of security cameras. Debris was flying around violently, but only in the camera set to the west. \"I wonder what is causing that...\" Eve says. I notice a silhouette move quickly past the screen, and I walk quickly to the door. \"I'm going to go check things out.\" I say leaving them, and passing by the next room to grab my axe. The potential threat of another human worries me more than any zombie… In times like these people turn into monsters. They've lost everything, and nothing is going to stop them. Felix was right, there was absolutely no wind out of the south entrance. It was only a little chilly, seeing as it was around late April. In Minnesota it's lucky to be this warm so early in the season. A steady chopping sound came from the west, a slight breeze following it. I figure it was the best way to go, but with great vigilance. I hide behind a silver generator, and watch as a scene unfolds before me. The wind was created by a large helicopter, and another was landing next to it as a group of people dressed in black escaped it. Some of them wore gas masks, others wore doctors masks that only cover their mouths. One of them, however, wore nothing to hide his identity, and I recognized him. Not at first, but after I see his vivid green eyes I know. I have to save him. He's been taken hostage to find out all of our parents' secrets, and that's why they've brought him here. He needs my help. I quickly scale the side of the building, using the pipes, ledges and ladders. As soon as I manage to pull myself over the last ledge, I peer over the edge, and unload the rifle that hung carelessly around my sash since last fall. I scope the scene, the laser pointer grazing the crowd. When suddenly one of them yells, \"Get down!\" It was a woman's voice, shrieky and unstable. One of the braver ones peer up at me from behind the fountain that decorated the west entrance. They pull off the gas mask and my heart pounds heavily in my chest. \"She's definitely your daughter.\" Another man's voice says as my father stands up. I raise one eyebrow as my eyes grow wide, my signature look of surprise. \"I have never been more proud.\" He says. I let out a sigh of relief before pausing, and pointing my gun again. \"Who the hell are these people?\" I demand. \"Lumina would you put the goddamn gun down?\" Hansel cries. His piercing eyes glower at me, looking annoyed and slightly worried. \"Wait.. you aren't being held hostage?\" I ask lowering the gun. He shakes his head slowly. And I put the gun down. The people remove their masks and I sudden recognize all of their faces, though I had never met them before. They were all in the picture that has been on our mantel since I can remember. With a sudden feel of trust and warmth, I hurry down from the roof. \"Hey, what have you been up to all this time?\" My dad asks embracing me, as well as my mom and brother. \"I can only imagine.\" My mom says. \"Sorry to interrupt… but have you by chance seen my daughter?\" I harsh, russian accent asks behind me. I don't even have to ask before I know she's talking about Eve. I turn to her and nod eagerly. \"And Jasmine…?\" A southern man asks. \"My kids… have you seen them?\" Another man asks. And then two more… \"They're here.\" Is all I can say back. \"They're here, they're all here.\" I smile widely and I lead them into the building. Inside, the only light comes from the large elevator, in which we take up to the third floor, where my mother's office and laboratory is. Inside, my friends are waiting cautiously in the lounge. They look a little confused as the others follow me inside. \"Dad?\" Grace is the first to break the silence. Her and Tom go carefully to their father, and suddenly the whole group is in a family reunion. I smile to myself until I see the outliers. Rose, Felix, Logan, Josh, Lina, Mason, the Phook twins, Kelly, and of course Drew watched with sad, longing eyes. And my uncle, Gil watches as well. My cousins aren't here, and they aren't with him. \"There's still hope.\" My mom smiles slightly to Gil. I look back to the group and notice Logan, Mason, the twins, Felix, and Kelly are gone. \"Rose? Can you watch over Drew? Lina and I are going to go look for the others.\" Rose nods. \"We are?\" Lina asks as a I drag her out of the room. We first check the lab, which is unsuccessful. I hate playing hide and go seek with these guys. It makes me nervous. We go to the elevator, and the first number that glows in the dark is 12. Someone is on that floor. We ride up and look around. We first check the kitchen and lounge. Then we roam the halls, listening carefully. There's crying from the bathroom. We hurry in, and see Kelly leaning against the wall. \"Careful.\" She whispers and looks toward the first stall. I carefully round the corner and peer in. A zombie looks to the wall. I shoot it, relieving it of its misery when Lina's voice catches my attention. \"Lumina.\" She says in panic. I turn, and see that Kelly's stomach is bleeding profusely. I cuss beneath my breath and know the only way that I can help her is by finding Felix. \"It's a bite.\" Lina says. I nod and tell her to stay with Kelly. A sickening feeling starts to grow in my stomach. If they others are hurt, too... oh god. What if Felix is hurt? Who is going to save everyone? No one else knows how to perform surgeries. A grunt followed by the sound of impact is heard from up the staircase. I slowly make my way up, and see Phooka throwing knives at an expensive looking painting. \"Good to see you've finally broke character.\" I say, watching her jump at my sudden appearance. She had been too caught up in her anger to notice me. She sets the knife down on the table and smiles as if to recover herself. \"Sorry I...\" \"Be thankful you have Phooko. I understand it's hard. But it's better to think about what you have rather than what you don't.\" I say making my way past her. \"The others are downstairs. I suggest going back to them before you end up like Kelly.\" To my surprise she doesn't ask any questions before scurrying away. I walk upstairs to the fifteenth floor, a floor consisting of only cubicles with three computers in each. Every square foot of this floor was held by these offices except a small gap in the very center the crosses the path I'm currently on. I decide to see where it leads, and end up in a small room with only a metal door on the other side. It was really a strange room. The walls are a deep blue, and the whole ceiling was just one big light. The only thing in the room is the intimidating metal door. I decide to open it. The walls are lined with artillery, the world's most classified weaponry was kept in here. I smirk to myself and look around. It seems like it goes on forever. And then I see something out of the corner of my eye. click. I stiffen and risk blinking. \"Put the gun down.\" I whisper, not as strong as I had hoped for. And we'll just have to see what comes next. Yay! ( )_( ) {= ' . ' =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 31] As we finish up the last few chapters, I'd really love your feedback, but if not, it's cool. If you have any last requests let me know as well. \"Put the gun down.\" A shaking hand points the cold tip of the gun to my head. Slowly it moves away, the room is silent except for his heavy breathing. \"Do you know how it feels?\" He demands. I sigh, such a cliche line. \"Yes.\" I say. \"But… you have your family… they're down there, waiting for you.\" Phooko says examining the pistol in his hand. \"Yes and so is your family.\" I try reasoning with him the way I reasoned with his sister. I knew it wouldn't work. Phooka was an optimist while her brother was a pessimist. But it was worth a shot. In a gruesome manner, Phooko moves the gun to inside his mouth. I see that reasoning is no longer going to work, and that I was going to have to deal with this by force. Smiling to myself, I see that the safety is still switched on the gun. I grab his his hand and pull it away from him. He gasps, and tries pulling the trigger repeatedly. For as smart as Phooko is, I would have assumed he would turn the safety off… \"I'm really sorry.\" I say before decking him. He slumps to the ground and I let out a sigh of relief. I drag him out of the artillery room and into the office. I grabbed a pen and sticky note and wrote down a note to the others on it, and stuck it onto Phooko's forehead. After that I shove him in the elevator and send him down. Only Mason, Felix, and Logan remained. Something moans from within the janitor closet as I pass it. And then footsteps upstairs. I sprint up to the end of the hallway and up the steps to the sixteenth floor. My ax is ready, though at this point I'd much rather use my gun, it was too late to switch now. \"Lumina!\" It's my brother's voice, and I'm relieved. \"Hansel… you scared me.\" I say. He smiles when he sees me and we walk down the hall together. \"Who are we looking for?\" He asks. \"Three guys,\" I answer in a hushed voice. \"Felix, Mason, and Logan.\" The floor creaks as we walk, making the building seem less stable for each floor we went up. \"It goes up to the twenty-first floor, unless we've already passed them, they're up here.\" By the time we reach the eighteenth floor my stomach has tied itself into worried knots that seem as if there is no chance of untangling them. \"Do you hear that?\" Hansel asks in a deep, hushed voice. I nod slowly as we look around the corner. Logan sits in the center of the lounge taking deep breaths in. His legs are folded and I'm surprised by all of this. Logan is probably one of the most normal people still alive, and now he's gone bat-shit crazy. And to make it even more disturbing and flat out weird, he takes in a particularly extensive breath and let's out a deep, rumbling laugh. He's fucking laughing. Hansel and I switch concerned glances as he laughs again, each louder and more energetic than the last until he's rolling with laughter. He regains his breath and begins to calm down, returning to his previous, somewhat less delusional state. Hansel and I back away slowly into the staircase. The next few levels are unsuccessful. As we reach the twenty-first floor, I realize my hope is vanishing, and it may be that we won't be able to save Kelly. Even if I do find Felix, she's lost blood an incredible speed. The least we can hope for now is that she can continue her life as a zombie. Hansel looks around and then to me with a fearful gaze. \"I'm sorry Lumina… they aren't here.\" This floor was unlike the others in a way that was beautiful and unique. It was glossy and full of beautiful decor. A fireplace sat in the middle. A balcony lined the entire outer wall of just this floor. Outside you could see the whole city. It reminded me of something… \"Hansel… wait here.\" I say opening the sliding door to the outside. Against the wall was a maintenance ladder. I climb it, taking my chances… what was there to lose? \"I thought I'd find you up here.\" I say to Felix who's sitting on the edge of the building. \"Lumina?\" He turns to look at me. I must have made an unusual face because he immediately stands up, his voice frantic, \"Is something wrong? I was going to come down in a little while.\" \"Kelly got hurt. She's losing blood and I don't know if she'll make it.\" I say worrying about all the time I've wasted so far with the others. It felt like ages ago that Lina and I had found her slumped against the wall like a broken doll. \"Was she bit?\" Felix asks walking towards me. \"I don't know… I couldn't look it was…\" I press my lips together remembering the gruesome sight. \"It's okay. Let's go, we can still save her.\" He says pulling me. The sound of a motorcycle from below fills the silence. Felix and I switch glances and go to look over the edge. \"It's Mason!\" I cry happily as I recognize him right away, even from up here. \"Did he disappear too?\" Felix asks. I nod explaining that most everyone had decided to give me a panic attack. \"Alright come on.\" I say. My foot catches a utility cable and I trip, feeling gravity push me backwards in slow motion. \"Felix.\" I'm not sure if I mouth it or if the words actually come out. The blood is pulsing in my ears and stars fill my eyes. His hands grip my wrists tightly, making them feel like they'd fall off any second. I clung to the side of the building with my eyes shut tight. He doesn't let go even though the pain is killing me. He just stares at me in shock as I open my eyes again. \"Help.\" I beg. I remember the first time we met. When we were sitting outside the sky lodge on the ruins of the deck. We both could have sent the other to their death, no liability, no consequences. But we both chose to trust the other, and neither of us took the chance. It's as if he can't hear me. Would he… would he let me fall? \"Help me.\" I whisper again. He blinks twice and looks behind him at the cord. \"Can you hang on by yourself for a second?\" He asks looking me dead in the eye. I nod slowly, though I knew I couldn't hold myself up for long. He lets go hesitantly and grabs the cord behind him. One of my hands slip in another very cliche fashion and my breath hitches. \"Could you hurry it up please?\" I beg. \"Lumina?\" I hear Hansel's voice from the rooftop. \"Oh shit.\" The two wrap the cord around my waist and pull me back up. \"Thanks.\" I breath. \"I'm going to go back downstairs. Are you okay?\" Hansel asks. I nod and he leaves Felix and me on the roof. \"Felix?\" I say as we begin to exit the rooftop. \"Yeah?\" \"Don't ever leave like that again.\" I mumble. It's quiet as we continue to walk. We reach the edge and I open my mouth again to speak, but am wrapped up in his arms. \"Eh…?\" \"Sh.\" He shushes me. \"What..?\" \"Be quiet.\" He mumbles into my hair. \"Why?\" I ask very, very confused. \"Because you talk too much.\" \"I almost died and now you're insulting me?\" I frown. \"Yeah.\" I start to step out of his hug but it fails. \"Don't move yet.\" \"Why?\" I ask, annoyed. Silence. He's so weird and random. I'm not used to this affection stuff anymore and I'm not entirely sure that I want to be. Felix is a freak. He's creepy and annoying and teases me. He's self centered and rude. He has a bad sense of humor and is too quiet sometimes. And he never says what he's really thinking. \"Because I love you.\" \"...Whaaaaat?\" I cannot seem to comprehend this. It is as if my whole world and everything I thought I knew… has just fallen apart. Sorry I made another cheesy, selfish chapter. I promise to make it up to ya as the end is near. (: Any last requests feel free to review or private message me. Or if ya have anything else ya want to say. ( )_( ) {' . ' =} ( )o[Chapter 32] I love all your feedback. (: To answer some questions: 1) I'm still not sure about a part three. It all depends on how busy I am this summer and next year. But it's possible. 2) There are a lot of relations between the characters of the first and second ZCCMs; Bennett is Nick's son. Eve is Russia's (Rosalie's) daughter. Jasmine is Jay's daughter. Tom and Grace are Reaver (Bradley's) kids. Lina is actually related to Lumina, Lina is Lumina's mom's brother's daughter. But since Kolton (Minneapolis' brother) disappeared after the first apocalypse, they never knew they were related. \"We need to save Kelly.\" I say as the cool breeze sends shivers up my spine. Felixs' sent stuck with me after I peeled myself away from him. We are running out of time. \"Right… Come on let's go.\" He nods as we hurrying down from the top floor. We make it to the lobby where Lina had been able to bring Kelly. She is out cold but still breathing slowly. Phooko had hooked her up to some sort of machinery. \"I'm not sure if it's helping much. But if she's still alive it must be doing something.\" He says. I don't know what happened to the previous Phooko who had been so upset he was ready to take his own life. His eye was swollen shut, and I feel a little bad about hitting him. \"I'll see what I can do.\" Felix says as he observes the situation. He pulled on a pair of latex gloves and began working on the wound. The room is silent as he injects a syringe into her arm. \"Hopefully this will stabilize the disease and will stop it from spreading.\" Phooko strokes Kelly's hair out of her face and whispers repeatedly that it will be okay. I have to leave before my heart breaks. This night had been so dramatic and it only grows worse with every passing hour.I lay down on one of the break room's black leather couches and slowly drift off. My nose burns with the smell of smoke, my lungs ache and my eyes snap open, immediately tearing up. The room was lit with fire and smoke, ashes raining down like confetti. I cough, and pull my shirt over my nose and mouth to try and breath. I crouch down on the ground and crawl out of the room, making it to the kitchen. \"Help!\" A familiar voice screams. It's Lina for sure. I run towards her voice and pry open the door. She tumbles out, hacking. I drag her to the entrance and take a quick breath of fresh air before running back in. A sudden loud outbreak of moans warn me that a horde is coming. I tense knowing that I have no weapons on me and dash back to the exit when I hear a room full of people trapped behind debris. I pull it away as fast as I can and Josh, Logan, and Mason burst free. Running to the lobby as the horde becomes louder. Before I can reach the doors myself, I remember Felix, Kelly, and Phooko were in the lab. I run with all the life in me towards the lab. Unfortunately it is in the direction the horrid sounds of death are coming from. The building is burning, the structure creaking and groaning in protest. I bust through the door to see that Kelly is gone but Felix is pulling Phooko out of the room. \"Let me help.\" I say rushing to his side. It's when I notice tears streaming down Felix's ashy face that I know something is further amiss. \"I couldn't save them. I couldn't save them from the damn zombies.\" He shakes his head. \"Felix we have to go now. \" I demand. \"I'm so sorry.\" He says to them. Now I hear them. I hear their screams on the other side of the door. We drag Phooko out as the building falls apart behind us. Felix collapses to the ground, Phooko's weight becoming too much as my muscles give out. Felix lays next to me with his crooked grin on his face. He slowly reaches his infected hand to my cheek and strokes it once before it falls limp. \"Will you tell me who?\" I ask, my voice hoarse. \"Eve, Bennett, Rose, Phooka, Tom, Grace, Jasmine, and Drew.\" The walls tumble down beside us as the horde breaks free. \"Who made it?\" Felix asks ignoring them. \"Kelly, Lina, Mason, Logan, Josh.\" I say staring up at the ceiling, gasping for breath. The infected closes in. They tear at our limbs with hungry impatience. I can't hear my own screams, but I know they're there as suddenly the zombies disappear, as if they've vanished into thin air. And I watch as Felix is taken away from me. I turn and reach for him, desperate to keep him here. I don't want to be alone. I'm dragged away as well as the ceiling and smoke fade away, the pain disappearing.[Chapter 33] \"Oh bloody fuck!\" Tom yells. He's finally woken up. And there are loud beeping noises as nurses rush in and out of his room. I watch from a chair placed by the window on the other side of the hall. I had only woken up a few days ago. My head throbs as I turn back to the window, looking at the blossoming flowers on the tree outside. \"Lumina?\" My doctor asks as he pops his head in the doorway. I look over to him only slightly acknowledging his presence. \"You have an appointment with Mr. VanDyke. Are you ready to see him?\" \"Send him in.\" I say with a wave of my hand. Dr. Kipke leaves and in comes a man in a suit with slick, black hair and a brief case. \"Hello, Ms. Starr.\" He nods to me. This man was the kind of person I knew I couldn't trust. But I noticed a scar ran down the left side of his face, and realized he had been a victim as well. I smile slightly as he sits in the chair across from me. He takes a folder from his brief case and opens it up handing a few papers to me. \"I'll need you to sign these. The first one states that you are still a living, healthy citizen of the United States. The second is to release you from the hospital. The third is giving us the right to send you back to the US.\" He says going a little too quickly for me to handle quite yet. I'm still recovering, this was a difficult experience to go through. I notice there is still another paper sitting at the bottom of the pile. I look it over and am confused upon reading it. \"That's the paper that will officially enter you into the league.\" \"What league? \" I ask finding the statement sort of strange. \"So your mother never told you.\" He breathes a single laugh. \"The survivor league. The specialized hall of fame for surviving the zombie apocalypse. Jessica created it years ago shortly after the first. It was designed in case another outbreak ever occurred. The woman is smarter than Tesla sometimes, I swear.\" I stare at him awkwardly trying to take it all in. \"Just sign the paper.\" He says. I give the paper a questioning look, then sign it. He stands up to leave when I stop him. \"What did you say your name was again?\" I ask. He turns and smiles a little, \"Columbus VanDyke.\" I give him a strange look knowing that I had heard that name before, but I don't get the chance to ask before he walks out the door. Later in the day after physical therapy, I roam the lunch hall looking for a good spot to sit, so far, of all the people I had met during the zombie apocalypse, I was the only one anywhere near being ready to leave the hospital. And I was only aware of two others that had woken up, but both were still bed ridden. \"Mind if I sit with you?\" I hear a male voice ask. I look up to see Logan in all his bed haired glory and don't hesitate to hug him. \"You're okay.\" I breathe a sigh of relief. He smiles and sits across from me at the otherwise empty table. \"From what I heard, there's only a twenty-two percent chance an infected won't make it.\" He says. \"The cure is only to rid the disease, nothing can be done if the patient is too near death.\" \"Do you know anything about the others?\" I ask. He smiles a little, \"I was able to go check on Eve, she's still asleep though.\" My eyes widen a little, \"They wouldn't let me see Felix, I just assumed that mean we couldn't see anyone until they were out of treatment.\" \"No, I've already gone to see Tom and Jasmine.\" He says slowly. I tilt my head slightly before pushing away my tray and standing abruptly. I dash towards their rooms. I had memorized which ones everyone was in, Tom being the one closest to me across the hall, and Jasmine on the next floor. I go to Tom's first since it's closest to the cafeteria and burst through the door. \"Lumina?\" He raises an eyebrow as I squeeze the life out of him. \"Ow…\" He winces. His shoulder was bandaged up and I feel guilty for hugging him so tightly. He smiles a little as I start to leave his room. \"Where are you going?\" \"Jasmine's room.\" Tom reaches over and grabs a small vase of two daisies. \"Take these up then, will ya?\" I raise an eyebrow wondering where the fuck my flowers are but realize it's not a big deal and run upstairs. A doctor sat next to Jasmine taking her temperature. She acknowledged my presence by glaring at me in the most dreadful way. \"These are for you.\" I say through clenched teeth, setting them on her nightstand. \"Oh how nice, a present from the devil herself.\" She says sarcastically. \"And I thought I'd be meeting her sooner.\" Jasmine looks at the doctor's clipboard. \"Guess I won't be dying anywhere in the near future, though.\" I eye her suspiciously as she goes back to conversing with the doctor. Before I leave I turn and say, \"Even if you hate me, I'm happy you're alive.\" She ignored this and I left the room when a loud siren rang out. I looked around as nurses and doctors scrambled to a single room. I had hear beeping and seen lights flash when people die, but I had never heard this particular sound. \"We're losing him!\" I hear one of the nurses say as they pass me. I follow them carefully down the hall and peek my head inside. It was a shared room. Both boys. The one who was surrounded by nurses had dusty black hair, a stubble growing on his defined chin. I couldn't place where I knew him from, but I had seen him before. The second had light brown hair and was already awake. But he didn't seem able to move much. I recognized him as well. How had he survived? I watched him die. I… \"Gray…\" I sigh relieved. A nurse turned only just noticing me and ushered me away. I sigh remembering the day of the outbreak. Gray and I had fled the school. He was killed alongside the highway, and I hadn't thought much about him since. I go back to my room feeling exhausted. The day had already been so eventful and it was only twelve o'clock. I lay down on my bed and turn on my book. The screen lights up and I swipe it's pages slowly as I fall asleep. Creek. Creek. Oh shit. I open my eyes trying to get accustomed to the darkness. Something falls and there is the sound of glass shattering onto the floor. I stand up cautiously looking for my axe, my gun, anything. With no luck, I resort to tackling the filthy monster. We fall to the ground him letting out a loud huff and trying to resist. \"Lumina for god's sake!\" It cries. I pause. \"...Felix?\" I ask into the darkness. \"Yes?\" His deep, raspy voice asks. I blink seeing his outline start to appear. I rest my head on his chest and sigh. \"Hello…?\" \"You're alive.\" I say. \"Look I know I have a hot body but could you please get off of me?\" He asks. I slide on the floor and sigh. Something tugs at my hair and catches it, stinging my skull. \"Ow!\" \"Sorry.\" He sighs. \"I don't know how to control this thing yet.\" I raise an eyebrow, confused. \"What?\" \"Turn on the lights.\" He says. I move off of him and reach up to the flick the light switch. At first I don't notice anything different but then I see gleaming light under his long sleeve. He pulled the sleeve up to reveal a shiny metal arm in place of his usual, human arm. I touch it lightly as if it were made of glass. \"Does it bother you?\" I ask. \"Are you kidding? This thing is awesome! My childhood dreams are fulfilled. I am now a cyborg!\" He grins but it doesn't reach his eyes and I can't help but hug him. \"I knew when I used the beta that I wouldn't be able to get rid of the infection. The supplement would only hold the infection in it's current stage. The cure wasn't able to reverse the beta's effects.\" \"But…\" \"It was that or die, Lumina.\" He smiles again. \"I told you not to use my full name.\" I sigh. \"I think I've broken that rule a few too many times for it to still be in place.\" Felix tilts his head as if trying to provoke me further. \"Your good looks don't make you an exception.\" \"They do.\" \"Whatever.\" I huff looking back at the door. \"How'd you get in here anyways?\" \"Through the air vent.\" He says although I can't tell if it's sarcasm or not. I don't know why but suddenly I'm hugging him very tightly, and if he dares to dismantle me I shall be very upset. \"What'cha doin' there?\" \"I'm hugging you.\" \"Yes, but why?\" He asks. \"...Cause.\" \"Cause why?\" \"Because I can.\" He sighs heavily and pinches his nose, \"I see this is going to lead me into an endless spiral of interrogation so I'll just end it here.\" He leans forward, covering my hands with his when suddenly a loud set of alarms go off, causing us to jolt back. Felix's glasses fall to the floor and I smack my head hard against the wall, the shattered glass from the vase he broke earlier cutting my left hand. I let out a hiss of pain as the door bursts open, breaking Felix's glasses. \"Fuck.\" He says looking down at his broken glasses. Dr. Kipke and one of the nurses were standing in the doorway. \"There you are!\" The nurse said. She had a beautiful dark skin tone that made her piercing blue eyes stand out in the oddest way. \"Lumina if you don't mind, I need to speak to you for a moment.\" Dr. Kipke says. I look at him and raise an eyebrow. What could he possibly need me for so late? I stand up and dust myself off and drag Felix behind me until the doctor stops me and says, \"I don't need him. Just you.\" He says. I hold onto Felix's arm a little longer but then let go. I'm taken down a long, dark hall with hardly any patient rooms. \"Where are we going?\" \"My office.\" He says. His behavior is much different than it usually is during the day. It's probably just been a long day, sick of seeing people die. \"Have a seat.\" He says pointing to the worn down chair. He leans against his desk and pulls out a couple of papers. \"I need you to sign these.\" \"What…\" I started but realized it was a certificate of death. \"But… I just saw her this morning.\" I stare at the name that began to blur in front of my eyes. Jasmine Broadbent lined the top of the page in cursive. I run out of the room and down the hall, not sure if it's the right way or not. I end up in a large, empty room that I had never seen before. It was so strange that I couldn't even figure out what it would used to have been. I sit down on the window sill to see if I can get it open. It's sealed shut, and I start to realize exactly what branch of the hospital this is. It was this was the mental health portion. \"Lumina.\" I hear a voice behind me. I turn and see a familiar boy standing there. It was the boy I saw earlier that had caused all of the commotion. He slumps against the door frame, his head tilted against it. \"Do you remember me?\" He asks. His skin was ghostly white, and for a moment I wonder if he is just that. A ghost. His voice echoed and his posture wasn't very lively. \"Because I remember you.\" Was it someone who had died and I had forgotten about long ago? Or was I finally losing it? I take a step forward to get a better look, \"I don't…\" There's a brief cracking sound a puff of dust coming from the ceiling. In one quick movement, the ceiling breaks, and I'm pushed backwards out of the way. \"Damn it, Lumi.\" The boy says with a smile, his bangs swooped down so they weren't completely covering his eyes anymore. And that's all it took; seeing those warm, chocolate brown eyes. \"Drew?\" I raise an eyebrow. \"There ya go.\" \"But you're… uhm…\" \"Living? Yes. I am. And it's never felt so wonderful.\" He says joyfully. \"Come on, I'll take you back.\" He gets up and brushes himself off before offering me a hand. \"Thanks.\" I say as he pulls me up. \"You're the first I've seen.\" He mentions as we walk. \"Huh?\" \"Of our group. I haven't been allowed to see anyone so…\" He trails off. \"Why are you here then?\" I ask suspiciously. He grins at me but doesn't answer. Damn zombie. Or… human… whatever he's still a zombie to me. \"Don't get lost again.\" He says before disappearing. I sigh heavily and return to my room, shutting the door with a soft click behind me. This was supposed to be the last chapter but unfortunately it has grown a bit too long for that. So now there will be two last chapters….. ( )_( ) { = ' . ' =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 34] Oh god. Oh god this pain. This… it shouldn't be here. Everything is supposed to be okay now, right? So why is this happening? Why am I here? I wake up in a cold sweat with one big gasp of breath. The hospital is silent, the sun filtering in through the window makes a serene atmosphere. Unlike other mornings there is no beeping, no running, no screams of pain. Just silence. The door opens and shuts with a soft click. A nurse sets a tray of morning tea and breakfast on my bedside table and then leaves without saying a word. Today is my last day in the hospital. \"Good morning.\" Logan nods to me as I sit at our table. It had grown to four other people now and I was happy to see my friends are doing well. \"It'll be no time before we're back at home eating our usual rubbish.\" Tom says poking at Grace who just smiles in return. I hadn't told anyone that I'd be leaving them after today. I figure that it'll be better for them to find out rather than for me to make a big deal of it. \"What about you Lumina?\" Tom asks. I look up from my food, confused as to what he was talking about. \"Where are you going to go when we are released?\" Grace adds. I think about that momentarily. \"Home possibly. The last time I was there it seemed mostly still intact.\" \"I'll be moving to Italy.\" LT says a little distant. \"Why's that?\" Felix asks. \"I have a friend that'll be living there.\" Logan smiles slightly then returns to his food. \"I might move to the US.\" Felix mentions as he takes a drink of his orange juice. \"Oh cool.\" I say. A moment passes before I realize what he just said. \"Wait what.\" \"I'd like to try living the american way for once. It might be fun.\" He says. Grace and Tom look even more upset than I do over this. And that's saying something. \"Where are you going to go?\" I ask slowly. \"I was thinking Minnesota. Preferably the Minneapolis area…\" \"What for?\" I ask annoyed. \"I hear the college there has a pretty good science program.\" He shrugs. \"College?\" I ask surprised. \"How old are you anyways?\" \"I thought you already knew.\" He raises an eyebrow. The lunchroom doors open and a familiar girl strolls in and sits at our table. \"'Sup?\" She nods, taking my apple juice. \"Morning Rose.\" Felix smiles to her. She smiles back as if it were nothing. \"Glad to see you're back with the living.\" Tom nods. \"Trust me,\" She states, \"I am, too.\" \"We were just discussing our plans once we leave the hospital.\" \"Probably go find some members of my dad's old mob. Things are about to get really boring around here and I'm going to have to find something that'll spice it up again.\" She nods. \"Sounds good.\" Grace smiles. \"Send me a postcard.\" Logan says. \"Will do.\" We talk for awhile longer as everyone else slowly clears the room for the appointments and such. None of us seem to have anything going on so there was no big hurry. \"It looks like we have a funeral to plan as well.\" Grace says quietly. We had all been avoiding the topic until now. \"I'll take care of it.\" I say. \"No, I can do it.\" Rose offers. \"Funerals have never really bothered me for some reason.\" \"Thanks.\" I sigh, relieved. There's a knock on my door while I'm watching the news, the only thing that was really working again. \"Hey,\" I hear a girl's voice. I'm able to recognize it instantly. I shoot up out of my chair and dash to the door. \"Lina!\" I cry, happily embracing her. \"Yay! I'm so happy you're awake!\" She sings. I let go of her and look at her closely. Something is different. She looks… clean. \"How long have you been out of the hospital?\" I ask amazed. \"I was only here for one night before they let me go. I didn't have any infections or terrible wounds so I was out before the rest of them.\" \"Them?\" I ask. \"Mason and Josh were able to leave right away, too.\" She smiles. \"They put us up in a hotel down the street so we could visit you whenever we felt it. Unfortunately we've just been so busy trying to help out and get everything back in order that we've hardly found the time. But here I am! Oh, and these are for you.\" She hands me a small bouquet of wild flowers. \"Picked 'em myself.\" \"Thanks Lina, it's nice that you're visiting.\" I say relieved to see someone from the outside. And her clothes were so bright and colorful as if they were brand new. \"Don't mention it. But if you don't mind, I'd like to go visit the others while I'm here. Take care.\" She calls as she leaves. The room is suddenly very silent. I realize just how strange it's been being alone. Before, there was no privacy, no loneliness. I was constantly being bothered about something, whether it was useful or not. But now it is just too quiet without everyone else. I wonder... will life always be this way from here on out? \"Good evening, Lumina.\" I was expecting Dr. Kipke when Felix's doctor entered the room. \"Where's Dr. Kipke?\" I ask, concerned. \"He's just in surgery right now. He won't be able to see you off, but he says to wish you the best.\" She smiles setting a stack of clothing on the foot of my bed. \"Here, new clothes courtesy of the hospital.\" \"Thanks…\" I say taking the woven red sweater and black leggings. \"What month is it?\" I ask seeing as the outfit seemed a bit too warm for the middle of summer. \"It's early October, but it's still a little chilly out there.\" \"I see…\" I say slowly. So much time has passed, more than I had assumed. It's been about a year now, hasn't it. \"Thanks for your help. I'll be in the lobby in a minute.\" I say to the doctor. She smiles politely and adds, \"There will be a taxi waiting to take you to the airport.\" I'm left alone to change and just stare at the wall for a few minutes. Why couldn't I stay here and wait for the others like Lina? What will happen when I go home? Will my mom and dad and brother be waiting for me? Come to think of it… I don't even know where they are. knock knock. \"Lumi?\" A small voice asks. \"Oh, hey Drew. What's up?\" I ask as he enters the room. \"Are you really leaving today?\" He asks fidgeting with his fingers. I nod once and smile. \"Aw… I was hoping you'd stay with me for a while longer.\" He sighs. \"It's okay. We'll see each other again.\" Although I'm not so certain myself. \"I've only just really met you, though. It seems like a shame to see you go so soon.\" I find myself hugging Drew really tightly cause I've realized how confusing life/death has been for him lately. That's got to tear a person apart, right? I wait outside in my new clothes with my curly hair running down my right shoulder. The night was warm for so late in the year, and it was no problem to wait outside of the lobby. I set my bags down on the sidewalk and wait for the taxi to show up. The doctor said that this was the only taxi showing up tonight, so I wouldn't have to worry about any confusion. The streets appear pretty empty, so I suppose there won't be any traffic. I feel a sudden presence to my left as a puff of smoke appears and then slowly fades. \"Leaving so soon?\" Felix asks leaning against the wall. \"I thought you would have given up smoking by now.\" I say, making it obvious that the act bothers me. \"Only occasionally.\" He half smiles as he steps toward me. \"With so many grand exits I'm surprised you managed to keep this one on the down low.\" I punch him playfully. He winces because it's his bad arm but smiles despite the pain. \"Sorry.\" I say sincerely. \"Always are.\" He ruffles my hair. Dark spots began to appear on the pavement. \"Hey, you aren't crying are you?\" \"No, I think it's starting to rain.\" I say looking up into the sky. A particularly large droplet falls and splatters onto my eye. \"Looks like this is your ride…\" He says as a light blue car pulls up with bolded black letters on the side. \"I'll see you later, I guess.\" I say to the man who was once a stranger, no a murderer in my eyes. The boy who bothered me to no end, who made every day a living hell and lengthened it until I thought it'd never become night. \"Lumi…\" But a long day just means a longer life, doesn't it? And I've always known how much I've hated the loneliness of a quiet room. So who cares if I'm a little annoyed? It's good to be challenged sometimes! This boy saved my life, and became my best friend. Something about him I just… \"Lumi.\" He repeats himself. I set my bags in the car and look him dead in the eye to make sure that my message would finally get across this birdbrained asshole. \"It's Lumina.\" I say. His smile stretches all the way across his face. He picks me up and swings me around and I have to hit him multiple times before he sets me down. \"I… uhm…\" I trail off not knowing how to say this… \"I love you.\" Felix says testing that boundary again. Last time he had done that, shit went down. And that shit is not something I'd like to repeat. So in order to not repeat history, change must happen. \"I love y-\" I can't even finish my god damn sentence without Felix interrupting me with his stupid kissing! For the love of god stop being such an ass all the time! And there's one more thing… \"How the fuck old are you anyways?\" I demand. He smiles and shoves me inside the taxi. \"Soon.\" Is all he says before shutting the door and waving me off. I turn to face the back window and flip him off as he waves with a goofy grin on his face. I can't help but laugh a little as he disappears in the distance. I know the ending wasn't all that great, and there are a lot of questions unanswered… but you know what that means right? Right. ^w~ ( )_( ) {= ' . ' =} (\")-(\")[Chapter 35] It had been a beautiful morning so far in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The sun shines brightly, finally thawing the city after such a harsh winter. The dramatic change in temperature had everyone in high spirits. And the nearly eighty degree weather pastes a smile on her face. Lumina Starr, visiting her hometown on a business trip was spending her last day humming along the streets before returning to Scottsdale. She had stopped by the farmers' market on her way to work at her mother's office. She had come to discuss the future plans of the Arizona headquarters, before building was finished. \"I'll take a pound of strawberries and three star fruits.\" She says to the elderly woman at the cash register. The woman smiles, a scar lining her neck. Lumina knows what a struggle it can be to revive one's life, and adds. \"And a loaf of this bread, please. What kind is it?\" \"Cucumber herb.\" She says adding the loaf to the bag. \"Ten dollars and twenty cents please.\" Lumi hands her fifteen dollars and tells her to keep the change. She steps back to turn away and knocks into someone. \"Oh!\" She turns around to apologize. \"I'm so… sorry…\" She recognizes her old friend's face immediately. \"It's been a long time.\" Felix says quietly in his deep english accent. \"It's been…\" \"Three years?\" He ends my sentence for me and takes my bag from me to carry. \"Where are you going?\" \"I was actually on my way to my mom's office. Care to accompany me?\" I ask although I believe he had already made that decision. \"I don't see why not.\" He smiles warmly. The two walk down the street making small talk occasionally. They walked slowly as neither had any particular time they had to be anywhere. Both minds were too focused on the question that was bothering them both. \"Felix…\" Lumina says quietly. \"What's up?\" He asks paying more attention to the beautiful day. \"What happened after I left the hospital?\" She inquires. Felix sighs heavily and stretches before he proceeds with an explanation. \"It was… boring, to say the least.\" He watches the ground as he walks. \"It was so quiet sometimes that it was maddening. And as soon as everyone came back… It was time for me to leave.\" \"The last time I saw them was the funeral. I feel like, well, it's just been too long.\" Lumina say as the office doors become visible. \"Then do something about it. Where have you been? We've waited for you to find us again.\" \"I'm sorry… what have you been doing all this time?\" She asks in attempts to change the subject. \"I've been taking classes at the U of M here. I've been studying neurology this past year.\" \"Are you planning to go into the science field of ZCCM?\" Lumina questions. \"ZCCM?\" Felix asks with confusion. \"Zombie Care, Conflicts, and Medicine.\" She explains. \"Oh, yeah. I've been thinking about it for awhile, actually. I'm going to work at STARR research labs.\" He nods. \"So in other words you're going to work with me.\" \"Precisely. And what have you, Lumina, been up to all these years?\" He asks. \"I moved to Arizona, skipped college and landed a job at STARR. I've been designing the Phoenix headquarters ever since.\" She smiles as we reach the doors of the research labs. \"When is your lunch break?\" He asks before I can say anything else. \"I have meetings until twelve.\" She mentions. \"I'll be here.\" He winks in a cheesy fashion and she rolls her eyes. That boy is something else. Eight months later \"That's it. Everything is ready.\" I smile at all the work I had accomplished. The house was all decorated and ready for everyone to come over. I didn't expect many people, just a small crowd. I couldn't see myself without them any longer, this life is too quiet. Felix is sitting on the couch fiddling with some sort of object that resembles space junk. I figure it's best not to ask what it is or even how he found it. If it proves to be important, he'll explain later. \"You know, I think relationships are lame.\" He says without looking away from the cube like object. \"Says the fiancé.\" \"No, no, hear me out. I like you. Grown quite used to you actually. The word love comes to mind. But I'm saying other people. Why do some people pointlessly flaunt themselves towards others that they hardly even know.\" \"I'm not seeing how this is relevant.\" I say confused but not very. \"It's not.\" He says simply. \"But I could never imagine marrying someone I had only known for a few months.\" \"Yeah, remember how much we hated each other when we first met? I must have been such a pain back then.\" \"What do you mean back then?\" He asks chuckling but smiling to let me know he's joking. \"You've always been a sore pain in the arse, that's for sure.\" I punch his good arm lightly. The doorbell finally rings and in comes the first guest. \"Lumina!\" A cheerful voices sings. It's Phooka, no doubt. She hugs me tightly and then rushes to Felix. \"Where's Phooko?\" I ask. \"Huh?\" She turns to me confused. \"How the heck should I know?\" As my brain tries to process the fact that the twins are not only separated but not sure of the other's whereabout. And then she drops another heavy load on me. \"Josh will be coming in a little bit.\" Wait so she knows where Josh is but not Phooko. \"We drove separate,\" They usually drive together? \"He just was waiting for his sister to arrive to watch the kids.\" \"K-kids...?\" \"Well yeah, of course. Jeremie and Savannah.\" She says like I'm supposed to know these kind of things. \"Don't you remember all the christmas cards we've sent?\" I think back to the pile of mail that my personal assistant had yet to sort through. I make a mental note to scold him once I get back to work. \"Oh, yes of course!\" Felix buds in. \"I think Lumina and I were just so excited to see the kids, we were surprised you hadn't brought them.\" The doorbell rings again, I'll have to thank Felix later for covering me. I go to open it as a flood of old friends enter. Nearly four years later and it seems as though hardly anyone has changed. Phooka and Josh were married two years after returning home. They had two children, Savannah and Jeremie. They live in Eastern Texas with two dogs, Amy and Clifford. Phooka had decided to become a psychiatrist and counselor. Her cheery attitude made it easy for her to communicate with patients, and they trusted her advice. Josh became a veterinarian. This way he could work with animals almost as great as his dear Amy. The two still have a long future ahead of them, seeing as neither are that old. It makes for an adventurous lifestyle in the end. Mason moved back home to Wisconsin. He lives in a large cabin on Lake Winnebago. He has one dog named Parker. He lives alone. But he is often visited by Lina, who's sometimes annoying presence manages to keep him company. With the lack of excitement in the world as of late, Mason likes to keep his adrenaline up by riding his dirt bike through the less inhabited parts of Neenah Wisconsin. Lina on the other hand has been keeping up a very interesting life full of experiences. Her somewhat intimidating appearance and height has put her in the career of modeling. Although she spends most of her time away from the studio she doesn't necessarily hate her job. She owns two houses, one in New York City and the other in Menasha, Wisconsin. She adopted a four year old girl from Japan named Naomi. When she found out that Mason had moved to nearby Neenah, she couldn't help but take Naomi to meet him. Since then Lina has visited him regularly whenever she's in town. Eve, after settling things with her family back home, and finding her biological father, Nel, moved to Italy. She lives in the city of Venice, with the convenience of the city at her doorstep. She decided to become a writer, to tell the world of her unique experiences during the apocalypse. She has one cat named Kiki, a tabby cat with a very lazy personality, much like Eve herself. To avoid becoming a cat lady, Eve tries to spend most of her time outside of her home, and rents it out to her room mate. Logan, Eve's room mate, had decided to set out on a long journey to find his family. After many months of searching, he was able to find his two younger sisters. Neither parents were able to live through the apocalypse. After returning home to Italy, the quiet and inverted Logan found himself finally talking about his past, as it seemed it was the only way to escape it. Now he works as the owner of a weapons company that is popular all throughout Europe, and trying to work with STARR to open up a new branch in the US. Phooko and Phooka had finally separated for the first in their lives after returning home. He was only able to escape Kelly for so long before he found himself actually missing her. And now he's stuck with her. But he's happy this way. He's been able to start his own engineering and technology business, which is working hard to make the future as bright as possible. Kelly resides with Phooko in Tennessee and their three children. Who happen to be triplets. What once was double trouble is now triple trouble. Levi, Lacey, and Lucy, two girls and a boy, are know for the polar opposites. Kelly works at home as Phooko's assistant, and a part time comedian. Rose and Bennett live in Las Vegas, as promised, Rose was able to reconnect with some of her Mafia friends. The mobster's daughter was able to build an entire empire. Rose may be the badass of the century but she still has a heart of gold. Her and her husband, Bennett had a large wedding that was as traditional as it gets. They now have one son named David. There's never a dull moment in their home as David had adopted his father's humor and his mother's courage. It makes for an interesting family to say the least. Tom lives in England as a professional soccer player. Sports weren't the main priority during the revolution after the apocalypse, but Tom and a few colleagues managed to get it back in business. It was a way for everyone to feel at ease, as if things were back on the right track, and for now they are. But people make mistakes, and Tom was prepared for another disaster at any moment. Grace is a doctor in Brazil. Her real home is in Hong Kong. She travels between the two places quite a bit, so she decided it would be best to get a pilot license and buy her own jet. She's married to a Swedish man named Otto. They've adopted two kids from Brazil, and live happily in their multicultural home. Drew lives as a born again car mechanic in Little Rock, Arkansas. He prefers the quiet life along the river where he can fish with his friends and… who am I kidding? He freaking died and came back to life and you think he's just living quietly as some boring mechanic? No! He lives in Las Vegas and works alongside Rose and Bennett. Drew is one classy mother fucker, the type of guy who spends his casual wednesday night in a tuxedo gambling at the nicest cassino. He lives in a large mansion just outside of town. Single and with no children, Drew definitely is not living any sort of \"quiet\" life, he's living it to the fullest. And as for Felix and I. We live in our small mansion in Scottsdale, Arizona. It was once owned by my great grandmother, or at least that's what my mom says. Felix and I plan on getting married next month, although the thought sickens and revolts us both. Labels are not what either of us want, but it was taken upon my mother to have the ceremony anyways. Oh well, at least it will be an experience. Even with all these things going on around us, it is still difficult to forget the past, maybe even impossible. People cope in their own ways, for some, it is only to forget and act like nothing ever happened at all, for others, memories are what keep those alive that failed to live. So much happened in such little time. The events changing our lives forever. We can only hope it never happens again.[Chapter 36] Hi everyone! Just your friendly neighborhood zombie killer here^.^ (It's a reference) Just wanted to say I've had quite a few requests to write the third and final book for zombie candy. so without further wait, I have posted Zombie Candy Chainsaw Massacre: The War. But before you panic and go searching for the third book, I would like to inform you that it has moved from Zombieland to the Walking Dead category. Thank you all for your love and support! ( )_( ) ( ^ . ^ ) ","Summary":" Well hello there(: Still accepting character submissions, just starting now.(: Let's face it. Histo"},{"Movie":"Zombieland","Title":"Zombie Candy Chainsaw Massacre","Author":"DragonFlow3r","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8431988","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I woke up with my face to the cracked tar. My whole body ached, I had burns all over my hands, and red streaks running down my arms. There was only darkness to my left. I turned my head slowly to the other side, seeing the smallest glint of light. Until I realized I was being crushed by something extremely heavy. I pushed up with my arms, supporting more than just my weight even though I couldn't feel my legs. I manage to get whatever had been covering me off. It turned out to be a mattress with parts of my apartment building on top. Oh, now I remember. My apartment had caught fire during the mayhem of our city's end. There was some infectious disease, and everyone was trying to flee the city. The sun was so bright, it blinded me at first. And as my vision grew clearer, I found myself to be completely alone. Not one person was around. Normally these streets were filled with busy workers, gang members, and homeless people in need of spare change… or alcohol. Smoked still escaped what was left of my apartment. I look up, and see the fall I had just survived. The room I had on the third story of the building was completely demolished. Dismantled bodies lay motionless everywhere. I briefly wondered how they had lost these body parts. A fire doesn't do that… Then I remember my parents, we were supposed to leave just before the fire killed them all… So I was alone then. I think of who I could go to at this time, who do I know who hasn't already left? Emmett. Emmett was still around… Or was, how long have I been out? For the fire to have burned out already, how long was I gone? I hear a terribly gurgling sound behind me. I turn and look to see the police officer who lived in the apartment across from us. \"Rafael?\" I ask. A closer look, and I realize there's blood dripping out of his mouth. Did he realize this? \"Are you okay?\" He takes an awkward limp closer. There's a dead kind of look in his eyes, and you can still see the burns on his face. I back up, wounds like that would kill a person immediately. He keeps the limp up, and gets a little faster with each step. As it finally dawns on me that he is no longer Rafael Majors, the officer who lived across from us, and now some sort of monster, I turn and run. I have to think about where to run to. If there was even the slightest chance that Emmett was still around, he would know what to do. He always knew what to do. I ran down the street, with now two of the monsters chasing after me, I tripped over a crack in the road as I turned the corner onto Hastings St. And almost pause and gawk at the site before me. The city was absolutely in ruins. I see there are more than just the two monsters behind me. There are flaming cars on both sides of the street smashed into more exploded cars. Buildings destroyed and signs smashed. I push myself to the next block, that was where Emmett lived next door to a coffee shop. I opened the door to his home and slammed it as the monsters behind me crashed into it. Somehow a laugh escaped me at the sight. \"Emmett!\" I yelled, \"Are you here?\" No response. I run upstairs to find to blankets covering the outlines of bodies. My hand flew to my mouth before I could scream. I calmed myself, then went to Emmett's room. He would have to have something I could use to get away from here. Anything. I check in his closet, his drawers and even his desk. Nothing but garbage. Then it hits me. I kneel down and check under the bed. I pull out a chest and smile, shaking my head. Only Emmett… I try to unlock the chest but it won't budge. I think, if I were Emmett were would I hide the key? On a key ring. I check the place he normally left it. It was gone. That was strange. I searched the rest of the house, but no keys. I then take to a much more simple task, and grab the knife he kept under his pillow… and he wonders why he stabs himself in his sleep… I jam the knife into the key hole and the chest flips up. I had hit the jackpot. I clipped on the belt kept in the chest, and slid a revolver into one of the holsters, then a few of his Molotovs and went on my way, but not before a thought hit me. I turn, and remember the axe kept hidden behind his mirror. I grab it, and escape the building, but not before leaving the flowers growing in the window sill on the bodies. As I'm leaving the building, I realize there had been a piece of paper stuck to the door. I tore it off and read it. Zombie Apocalypse. Leave the country now. Safe zone: Omsk, Russia/ update: September 11, 2012. That was the day our city had been demolished. This was Emmett's handwriting, what happened to him? Was he one of the bodies under the blankets, or did he try to escape? And how was I suppose to survive? That was the exact moment, I decided I wasn't going to give up, whether I died trying or not, I was going to make it to Russia. Sorry I didn't get any of your characters in this chapter. I will try my best to get one or two in the next one. If anyone still wants to send in some characters feel free to. I will try to update my next week or sooner. Thanks for all your entries! /1_/1 ( ' . ' ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 2] I'm so happy I got to update before I thought I would! WOW! 78 views I feel so special! And thank you for all your wonderful characters! And to answer anyone who was curious, yes I was thinking about Blood on the Dance Floor when naming the last chapter. I suppose I have to put a disclaimer on that now. No, I am not in anyway associated with BOTDF or Dahvie Vanity. OBVIOUSLY. All better. After finalizing my decision, I began to wonder. Was I really the only one left? Surely out of the millions of people in the country, I was not the chosen one… country… or could it be the entire world? Of course, not everyone is as lucky as me and had passed out under a mattress for who knows how long… There had to be some irony in that. It became a concern, now that I was outside, in broad daylight just walking cotton candy to the zombies, that I did not in fact have a vehicle, or any experience on how to drive one unless you count a golf cart(Which I had drove into a pond anyways.) It also became clear that I was not going to make it all the way to Russia by foot. And as I spot the coffee shop in which I had spent more time in then my own home, I briefly remember the owner… His son… His son owned a Suzuki motorcycle, black and cyan… I had always wanted that bike… And if I were lucky… I make my way to the other side of the café. There, sparkling in the sun like a gay vampire, was my bike. I decided to name it Jasper on the count of my dead brother, whom was shot during the demolition of our city… Also because of the gay vampire BUT THAT IS OF NO ONE'S BUISNESS. Of course, there was no one to make it their business. I started to feel so alone… But I had Jasper… and the molotovs. SOOOOOOOO many molotovs. I smile to myself. I may be zombie candy, but I'm a hot tamale. I'm not going down without burning something. By that night, I had reached Lacrosse, WI. It felt so strange, my phone hadn't buzzed once that day. It wasn't like I expected someone to update their Facebook in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, it's just… I was so used to seeing a new message. And now that I hadn't had one in over seven hours… I felt like I was the only person who existed. And I thought I'd have to really get used to this being alone thing… Until I heard the sound of a chainsaw. VVRRMM VRRRRMMMM VVVVRRRRRRRRREMMMMMMMMMM! Now. I couldn't be sure. But. I'm pretty sure you'd have to be the world's smartest zombie to be able to start a chainsaw… or the clumsiest. So, just to be sure Albert Einstein's corpse was not revving this beautiful death machine I heard, I peer around the corner of a park building to see who it really was. A HUMAN. A LIVING. BREATHING. INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEING! THANK THE LORD! Although… one of the male species would have been better. Better luck next time. \"Excuse me…\" I say quietly, but realizing you can't hear anything over the chainsaw, I shout, \"EXCUSE ME! YOU ARE NOT A ZOMBIE SO IT WOULD BE NICE TO TALK TO YOU!\" A disfigured head is thrown, and the chainsaw stops. And here comes the golden flipping goddess with a chainsaw and guts. \"I am certainly not a zombie… all though I could have mistaken you for one.\" She squints her eyes. Oh lord no. \"We aren't in high school blondie, let's not act like it. So what's your name?\" I ask, resisting the greater urge of taking that chainsaw and chopping her head off with it. She laughs. \"Like I'm going to tell you my name. \" An awkward moment passes, she tips her head and her face brightens. \"Hi!\" I give her a look. \"Where'd you come from?\" I look behind me, wondering if there was another person, but realize she is in fact talking to me. \"Minneapolis…\" I answer hesitantly. Why the sudden change in moods? \"I'm from Buffalo.\" She smiles. \"Where are you going?\" \"Russia…\" I say, peering behind her. Something moved. \"I hear it's safe there… stay still.\" I pull out my revolver and just as the zombie comes out from hiding, shoot him right between the eyes. \"You got a good aim with that gun of yours.\" She points out. Duh. I move over toward the zombie. Peering at it carefully. It's arm twitched and I shot it again. \"You should really shoot things twice.\" \"Thank you.\" I say, but not meaning it. \"What's your na-\" \"No time for names!\" I say as I see a hoard of zombies rushing toward us. \"I'll give you a ride, come on!\" We run to the motorcycle, and as I am still learning how to handle it, we shake from one side to the other, until we get on a straight path and away from the zombies. \"Where's the nearest airport?\" I ask as we get on to the highway. \"North Dakota.\" She answers. I groan. OK! Character number two! Hope you are happy with miss bipolar. Oh look BOTDF again. Sorry. Anyways I'm excited for the next chapter, hopefully there will be more characters… I already know who comes in next but YOU better hope for more characters… you will all just love our little North Dakota! And who knows who else(: Until then… /1_/1 ( ' . ' ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 3] HEY! Super early update, I know it excites me! Sadly it is back to school this week): But between math and science homework I will to my best to write more. Okay… here it goes! North Dakota was the absolute last place I wanted to go. I mean no offense, but the place became a dump after the flood there. And there's nothing to do! Even though we aren't exactly on vacation, Hawaii would be my first choice. I hoped the airport there would still have a working plain, I'm pretty sure people there were trying to evacuate the same time we did. I would just die if we had to make the trip back to St. Paul for the airport there. The other reason I didn't want to go to North Dakota is because a lot of my family used to live there. A lot of Emmett's, too. That's actually how we met…. I think about this all as I'm supposed to be paying attention to were I'm driving, but honestly I couldn't care less if we crashed. Miss bipolar had been having a conversation with herself for the past one and a half, and every few minutes would ask me how I felt about whatever debate she was having. But I was the third party, the I don't give shit party. I had been driving all night… and all morning. As much as I needed sleep, there was no way I was letting this psycho take control. I can already see her arguing with herself whether or not to take a right or left, and we end up in between… in a tree. \"Bismark.\" She stated as we passed a sign. \"Great.\" I half smile. \"Only another hour or so.\" \"You realize we can go faster? I mean, we are the only people out here, and you don't have to put on a blinker every time you switch lanes!\" She exclaims. I look down at the switch I had just flicked, and flicked it off. \"Sorry… I had just started driver's ed.\" I say, quietly. It's true, I had really just started before the crisis. It was a new school year… It was supposed to be a great year, but little did I know there wouldn't even be a school left to be in. Bipolar starts humming to herself. An hour later, faster than I figured, we were at the gates to the airport. \"So this is it.\" I breathe, getting ready to fly an airplane for the second time in my life. \"Have you done this before?\" Buffalo asks. \"Once…\" I kick at the gate, and since it didn't budge, I began to climb it. I realize I haven't seen a zombie since we stopped. \"Well… did you crash it?\" She asks as she drops off the top of the gate, landed on all fours. \"No.\" I say bluntly. I'd most likely be dead, if I had. \"Well then… don't crash this one.\" She pulls her hair back into a pony tail as we start walking towards the nearest jet. I grab a latter and roll it with us over to it. Once inside, I walk into the cockpit and turn on the engine. \"Everything's set.\" I mumble, turning on some switches, pressing buttons. I was planning to go to an aviation college. I look back and see that Bipolar has just given me a face in response. Here we go again. \"Christ! You'd think you'd be smart of enough to actually get us there and back!\" \"I am. I am getting us there and back.\" I say, recognizing the familiar, yet arrogant tone. \"I'm not letting you fly this death trap!\" She snaps. \"Alright.\" I say. \"Get off then.\" Though I was a little reluctant when saying that, because it was nice having someone to talk to… even if there emotions changed more than a pregnant women dealing with her mother who has menopause. I look over to my right and see a roll of duct tape. I look back at the babbling Buffalo, then the tape again. I should really be concerned that there's a roll of duct tape on a plain I was about to fly from north Dakota to Russia, but then again… silence… Ten minutes later, it is noiseless. Buffalo is duct tape to a seat in first class and I am getting ready to take off. But as I'm about to move the plain away from the gate, I hear muffled screams. What now? I walk back to first class to see why she's freaking out again. Her eyes are wide, she's now silent, and sitting completely still. \"What?\" I hiss. Nothing seemed to be wrong. Her flicker over to the side and back. \"What?\" I say again, but obviously she can't respond if her mouth is taped up. \"AH-A!\" \"You're a little late on the intro.\" I say emotionlessly, as a girl pops up from underneath Bipolar's seat. She shoots her pistol and I jerk my head out of the way as it whizzed by my ear. \"What the hell?\" I yell. At this point, I'm angry, Buffalo is freaking out (which is pointless), and the other girl is laughing hysterically. \"Sorry.\" She says in a heavy Russian accent. Sorry? \"I mistook you for a flesh-eater. I'm from Moscow, Russia,\" Oh Really? \" I came here because there are apocalyptic signs in our country. People are going crazy, trying to eat one another. It is… chaos.\" Sorry? \" I came here because I heard it was safe. But it seems you are trying to escape exactly what I am.\" Okay bitch I'm still not over the fact that you almost killed me. But wait… so it's not safe in Russia either? DAMN YOU EMMETT. Okay, that leaves me with one question… \" Yeah, you don't happen to have a guy with you, do you?\" I ask. Bipolar looks at me weird, I just shrug. And mouth \"What?\" to her. \"Uhm… no…\" She shakes her head. There's a brief silence between us. \"But!\" Yes, Yes? A man yes? \"I did see this boy… he was running, just down there a few minutes ago.\" She points out a window. \"And he was alive…?\" I urge. She nods. I bust the emergency door down and hop out the side of the plain. \"I'll be back!\" I call over my shoulder. I run after the footprints left on the pavement, mud not blood. He's still human. And into the airport. The footprints lead into the men's bathroom. Well this could get awkward . I stand outside the door and wait, since there were no other footprints leading out. After awhile I get impatient and call into the bathroom. \"Hello?\" I yell, not really thinking about zombies at the moment, who would respond faster than the guy. \"Is anyone in there?\" There's a few gunshots, then footsteps. \"Hi, it's so nice to meet you I'm- EMMETT!\" I recognize him immediately, even though his hair is longer, and he's got wounds running up and down his arms and his face. I'm trying to be mad at him, but I'm so relieved to see him that I end up hugging him. \"Off…\" He pushes me back with the tip of his gun. \"I thought you were dead!\" I say defensively, and cross my arms. \"You missed me.\" He smiles smugly. \"Did not.\" I look away. \"You came after me.\" I don't like where this is going. \"Go screw yourself up a pole. Come on, let's get out of here. I have some… friends… waiting for me.\" I have a hard time saying friends, I don't like getting to attached to people. We argue all the way back to the plain, were I find Russia and Bipolar just as I had left them. \"Guys this is-\" \"Dakota.\" Emmett interrupts me. I shoot him a look. How dare he. \"Dakota…\" I say through my teeth, \"this is um…\" I realize I had never learned Bipolar's name and hadn't had the chance to really meet Russia. \"Buffalo and Russia.\" I blurt. Oh well. He got a fake name why doesn't everyone else? \"I'm Minneapolis… by the way.\" Okay! We have four character's now! Yay! I'll try to get more in next time, sorry to those of you who haven't gotten in yet. I promise you will. See you whenever! /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\"([Chapter 4] Three times in one week! Woot! I'm on a roll… Oh and 101 views! I'd love it if people would review more… and more characters! They don't even have to be main ones.(: With Emmett around, I became a little more self conscious. He always made me nervous even before the abomination of our country. But Russia and Bipolar continued to do what they did best… create chaos. I could hardly handle Buffalo at first… but with Russia around, the whole world will go to ruins. I'm so happy I found Emmett when I did, because otherwise I would have gone insane. \"Are you okay?\" Emmett asks after I find some pain medication for the headache I was getting. \"Fine.\" I shrug, not looking at him. \"Hey, so… what's the plan?\" Buffalo comes into the pilot cabin. \"Well… I guess we could just hang around here 'til morning…\" Emmett says thoughtfully. \"I'd like to keep moving.\" Russia says, joining us in the already cramped space. We all look at her as if she were crazy. \"No.\" I shake my head. I needed rest, and I hate to say it but with Emmett on board, I could finally get some rest. I'd be to scared with Russia and Bipolar around otherwise. \"You can always leave.\" Emmett adds. Russia gives somewhat of a disappointed face and goes back into first class. \"We'll leave in the morning.\" I call back to her. Buffalo nods and disappears into the bathroom. Emmett and I sit silently. I keep my eyes locked on the other planes outside, not wanting to make eye contact. I sense him looking at me though, and I expect him to say something but he doesn't. I had been mad at him the day we were supposed to leave. He had promised me something and didn't go through with it. \"I'm happy you're still… you.\" Emmett says quietly when the first class lights turn off… Russia must have gone to bed… I ignore him. \"I came back to find you… I couldn't. Where were you?\" I laugh a little, \"I was under a mattress.\" He gives me a questionable look. \"I jumped… from my floor.\" \"How… how did you-\" \"I don't know. But no one bothered to come save me.\" I shoot him a look. \"I didn't…\" He trails off. \"You could see the smoke. You were close enough.\" I shake my head in disbelief. \"You know if I could… I would have come to help you.\" Emmett sighs. I don't look at him. I can't stand to see his pathetic face right now. He left me when I needed him most. He abandoned me. I stand up abruptly, and walk out of the cabin. Out of the plane. \"…Minneapolis!\" He yells after me. But I ignore him and continue to walk around outside. I know it wasn't safe, but I couldn't be cooped up with them anymore. Not Bipolar, not Russia and especially not Emmett. After a little while, I hear footsteps. \"Leave me alone.\" I say, figuring it was someone here to bring me back to the plane. When there isn't a response, I turn. A pilot… a zombie pilot. I reach down for the revolver… I left it in the plane! And the axe, too. My eyes widen. The zombie was standing in my way. If I didn't move quickly, it'd be over for me. I was afraid if I yelled for help, other zombies would come. So I try dodging the pilot and sprint to the plane. This couldn't be happening! \"ARRGBLARGLLL…er…\" Was basically the noise that escaped him. \"Yeah well… I don't like you either.\" I say… which is pointless I don't speak zombie… I feel something latch on to my foot, and turn to see the zombie has clamped onto my ankle. \"Ay! Get off me!\" I kick at him but fall to the ground. I manage to kick him off but with no time to get back up as I crawl wildly back to the plane. But the pilot attacks me again and I have to kick to keep him away. \"J-MINNEAPOLIS!\" Emmett yells, jumping from the plane. My hand reaches out to him, mainly because it was a psychotic idea to jump from that height. I see Russia and Buffalo peering out of the door of the plane as Emmett comes to my rescue. I give one finally kick and force the zombie off, and pick myself up and start towards Emmett. He shoots twice, and the pilot is down, squirming slightly, then is still. \"Are you okay?\" Emmett asks me as I start to calm down. \"I-I'm fine…\" I breathe. Emmett and I push the ladder back over to the entrance of the plane, and go back into the cock pit. \"Are you sure everything's… okay?\" He asks again when Russia and Bipolar had gone to bed. I look at him… I didn't know what the expression was, but it must have worried him. \"Come on, what's wrong?\" I feel the sudden sting of tears in my eyes. No. No. I would not, could not break down in front of Emmett. Not in front of anyone. Ever. I gripped onto the side of the chair. But Emmett expects an answer. \"Everyone's… gone.\" I just barely say. And by the way Emmett's staring at me, I almost think he didn't hear me. \"I'm still here.\" He half smiles. When I don't reply, he adds, \"I know it's hard, but we can't do anything about it.\" I feel my lips start to tremble, and automatically my hand flew up to my mouth to cover it. \"What's wrong? Are you gonna be sick? Do you want me to-\" But he shuts up for a second and I can't tell why. Then I realize my vision was blurred and oh… I was crying. GREAT. Emmett was completely motionless. It was an all around awkward moment. Really, we kind of just sat staring at each other. Sorry I didn't have the chance to include anyone else in this chapter… also I apologize that it was all dramatic and stuff. I will try to get more in next time as usual. Thank you all for the support! /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 5] Hai! So I'm pretty much obsessed now with my own story. I don't know about you guys but… yeah. Alright. New character in this one! Yay for… life. Quite possibly the weirdest night of my life, I woke up in a state of confusion. Immediately I was wondering where I was, what were the flashing lights and sounds, and then I remembered the airplane... At first it seemed like everything was as it was before. And then I remembered the apocalypse. Oh yeah, we're in that mess. I crawled out of the cock pit and into first class. I see Russia, hanging upside down from one of the seats. It was confusing, but I really didn't want to know. Everything about these people I got stuck with was just… weird. \"Wake up.\" I poke at her with a cane that had been left on the side of the door. \"What?\" She wakes up, and slides off the seat, landing with a thud. \"Couldn't you be a little more kind about it?\" \"No.\" I say, and walk to second class. I look through the seats but couldn't find Bipolar anywhere. I'm about to give up and look somewhere else when I hear this crashing noise. I reach for my axe and turn around. An overhead bin was open, and I expected to see a bunch of suitcases spilled out onto the floor, but instead a squirming Buffalo. \"Rise and shine.\" I say, turning to walk away. Last but not least, I had to wake Emmett up. I move into the pilot's cabin again and kneel down next to him on the floor. I touch his shoulder softly, and bring my lips down next to his ear. \"WAKE UP, FAT ASS!\" I scream. I laugh as he flips out and knocks a bunch of stuff over. \"What the hell?\" He yells back. I smile and shrug. He frowns, \"You think I'm fat?\" \"No.\" I answer. \"Then… okay.\" He sighs. I win. \"Come on, we're moving.\" We all end up outside the gates of the airport, not knowing what to do next. I slide my hand across the smooth surface of my motorcycle. The thought of parting with it had made me so sad. \"Well… I'm not gonna fit four people on this motorcycle, so you guys go figure your own problems out.\" I rev the bike. \"I suggest going down to the car rental and finding something there. I'll meet you all down there. Come on Emmett.\" He looks at me uneasily, and then gets on the bike. I drive over to the car rental office, where, hopefully, they held all the car keys. I decided to leave Emmett there to wait for Russia and Buffalo, while I took a look around. Once I realized there really wasn't much to see except a bunch of dead bodies and some not so dead bodies that needed to be dead, I headed back to the car rental. It seemed that Russia had found a fast little mustang. \"Alright then, you people ready?\" I ask, pulling up next to them and motioning for Emmett to get back on my motorcycle. Russia nods, and pulls out of the parking area. They follow us down the highway for quite some time. I'm really not sure where I'm going, and the only thing I'm really paying attention to is the gas tank. And the reason I know what time it is, is because Emmett keeps offering to drive. But I wasn't tired, not really. More dazed then anything. Finally, about the fourth time he asked, almost at the begging point now, I checked the meter for how much gas we had, and noticed we were almost out. I pulled into the nearest gas station, and leaned against the pump as it filled gas into the bike. \"Are you sure you don't want me to-\" \"Go ahead.\" I toss Emmett the keys lazily. He looks down at them then nods. I guess I was kind of tired. \"There's a gun shop down the road.\" Bipolar says as they pull into the parking lot and start to fill up, too. \"Alright.\" I nod, and hesitantly wrap my arms around Emmett as he starts the bike. \"Stop smiling.\" I scold him. He laughs, then drives down the road to the gun shop. I get out, and pull out a flashlight. You never really knew when the lights would work or not in these places. The door screeches as we enter the deserted building. The lights are on, but no zombies seem to have responded to the sound of the door. I found an assortment of really cool knives and swords, and gazed over them. \"Hey Emmett!\" I call. When there was no response, I looked around. \"Emmett?\" There was a wooshing noise then everything went black. \"Hey… Hey!\" I hear an unfamiliar voice say. My eyes flicker open. A girl with extremely red hair and piercing aqua eyes stood with a gun pointed toward me… she was… upside down… What? I look to my right and see Emmett, with his hands tied behind his back, his mouth taped and his feet tied to the ceiling… now I see. I swing toward him, and his eyes open. \"Alright. What's your deal?\" She asks. I'd answer but my mouth is taped so I just stare at her. \"Oh!\" She takes the tape off my mouth and it leaves a burn. But it didn't cover the pain in my neck. \"Our deal?\" I ask incredulously. \"What's your deal?\" \"You first.\" She points the gun at us again, I realize it's not really a gun, but was a dart gun… \"You shot us with a dart gun?\" I yell. \"I'll do it again if you don't answer.\" She says, but it was quite obvious she didn't really know how to use the gun. I began to work at the knot binding my hands together. \"Well, princess, if you haven't noticed yet, there's a zombie problem out there.\" I nod toward the door. I briefly wonder what happened to Russia and Buffalo. \"We just happened to survive whatever the hell started it. So if you wouldn't mind, we'd like to get back to doing just that. Surviving.\" \"No.\" She shakes her head. I give her a look, and the knot is untied. \" No? \" I ask, working on the other knot holding my feet to the ceiling. I see Emmett doing the same. \"I think it may be in your best interest, if you…\" I trail off as I haul myself to the floor. \"If you just let us go.\" I say, grabbing my axe, I see her eyes grow big. Emmett is just behind me. \"Alright.\" She nods, and steps out of our way. \"Have a nice night.\" I smile, and lead Emmett out of the store. Russia and Buffalo are just pulling up. \"Where have you too been?\" I hiss. There's some orange glow back from where the gas station was. \"We had a little… problem… with the pump.\" Russia looks away. \"I needed a new lighter.\" Buffalo says defensively. \"That doesn't mean you use it when we're dealing with gasoline!\" Russia yells, her eyes shift from me to the steering wheel. \"You blew up the gas station?\" I ask. After I didn't get an answer, I walked over to my motorcycle and start it. Emmett gets on behind me. I'm just about to pull out when I hear, \"WAIT!\" I turn to see the girl from the shop running out after us. \"Can I come with you?\" She asks. I sigh, I really didn't want the responsibility of another person. \"Yeah, sure.\" I nod toward Russia's car, and continue out of the parking lot. Hope that was good, sorry if I don't update for awhile, I've got a lot of stuff going on right now. Soo… until next time!(: /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 6] I'm soooo sorry. It's just really really hard to update with school and everything. But anyways if anyone would like to send in some more characters… yknow… go for it… \"Are you sure you don't want me to-\" \"Ask me one more time, and you will wake up in the ditch on the side of the road.\" I threaten Emmett as the sun starts to peak out above the horizon. The morning was cold, I was cold. It seemed like we had been driving forever. But it had only been a few hours. \"Where are we going anyways?\" \"I don't know…\" He yawns, half asleep. Apparently asking to drive was just habit now. \"Where do you want to go?\" \"Hey pokey. I need your brains, wake up.\" I saw, jabbing him with my elbow. \"Eh..?\" He yawns again. I sigh and start swerving all over the road. He yelps, \"Ah! Hey watch it!\" He says as he rights himself on the bike again. \"Watch yourself.\" I grumble irritably. I was never a morning person… especially when I wasn't the one just waking up. \"What was that?\" He says in a sort of seductive voice, bringing his face closer to me. I shove it back with one hand. \"I need you to tell me where we're going now.\" I repeat myself. I wasn't dealing with his bullshit, not now. \"I'm not entirely sure…\" \"What do you mean you aren't sure, we have to go somewhere!\" I argue. \"No we don't…\" He tries the sexy voice again, then apologizes. \"Go flirt with one of the other girls,\" I say, turning a blinker on so they know which way to turn, \"I'm not in the mood.\" \"But I don't-\" \"Fuck Emmet! Fuck!\" I'm too tired to use my own sensor anymore. \"I really think you should let me drive.\" He says again, but this time awake. I groan, angry, but haven't decided to kick him off the bike… yet. \"I need to know where to go.\" I sigh. \"I think I might know someone… chances are they're still alive… If they haven't done anything stupid yet.\" \"Who?\" I ask, hiding my hope. \"His name… is Kory.\" Hours later, we arrived at a small little trailer in Jacksonville, Alabama. The dead silence made chills run up and down my spine. \"It's like a graveyard here….\" I whisper to Emmett. \"Yeaup. This is the place.\" He walks up to the door. He pushes it opens and gestures for me to go first. I shake my head. Uh-uh. No way. You first. I thought. He rolls his eyes and walks in. And reluctantly, I follow. \"Emmett?\" I could recognize the voice anywhere. \"Is that you?\" Jock. \"Wow! Bro! I really-\" I attack the jock. I hated them. HATED. \"Woah!\" Emmett yells pulling me off him. I straighten and brush myself off. \"Sorry, I seem to have forgotten how to act around people.\" I say, then hit Kory over the head with the back of my axe. \"Je- Minneapolis!\" He scolds me as Kory drops to the floor. \"What? Now he'll have to come with us.\" I shrug, dragging him by his feet out the door. Russia, Ginger and Bipolar are waiting outside. I shove Kory in the back seat next to Ginger, not feeling so bad for her if he wakes up… In fact, that should be pretty fun to watch… \"I saw a store down the street… seemed like it would have some edible food…\" I trail off, looking at Emmet for his agreement. He answers with a shrug. \"See you there.\" I smile to the girls and Kory, then get on my oh-so-precious bike and speed off… I still didn't like that trailer park. We waited in the parking lot of the grocery store, chewing on beef jerky and waiting for Kory to wake up. We reasoned that if he didn't on his own in a matter of time, I would be the one doing the honors. But to my heartbreak, he woke up on his own minutes later. \"What… Who are you?\" He grumbled. Maybe he's forgotten he's a jock along with who we are. \"We're-\" I was about to tell him something great and wonderfully untrue when Emmett interrupts me. \"This is J-Minneapolis, Buffalo, Russia and uhm… I'm sorry I don't know-\" \"Texas.\" Ginger says crossing her arms. \"But…\" \"Texas.\" She says again. \"Oh- Okay. And you remember me right?\" Emmett says slowly. Kory nods. I was truly curious… \"We need to know where to go. I thought Russia was safe up until just a few days ago…\" \"Antartica…\" Kory says with a lot of sarcasm. \"Nowhere in the United States… More likely South America or even France… Something like that. I'm sure Australia would be pretty safe, too.\" \"Where do you want to go?\" Emmett asks turning to me. \"It seems like these guys will follow you anywhere.\" Emmett nods to the three girls glancing between us and Kory. \"I don't know… I mean… what do you want to do?\" I ask. As he's about to answer, Buffalo shouts, \"Yo! Let's just get out of here!\" \"France it is then.\" I shrug, looking at Emmett for his approval. He shrugs and gestures to the motorcycle. \"Closest airport's a few miles west.\" Kory says. I give him a look. \"That way.\" He points in the direction of the sun. I nod and start the bike. France… Well I hope that makes up for all the time that's passed. Sorry/: So… See you soon! Maybe… /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 7] Hello Again^.^ I'm just writing away during science class… I wub technology… LAWL get it? This was now my third attempt at murdering Kory, we had the information, time to dispose of him. Obviously he wasn't as bright as Emmett had thought he was. If he were, he would have never told us where to go… \"What are you doing?\" I heard a whisper behind me. \"Emmett? You're supposed to be sleeping. Go back to bed, you're dreaming…\" I trail off with excuses as to why I'm awake myself. But it's too late, his eyes flicker to the axe in my hand and back up to me, and it's obvious he's figured it out. \"Really? Again?\" He asks. I think he was getting used to this… \"I can't stand him Emmett. It's either this or the zombies.\" I shrug. Emmett just laughs. What part of this is humorous to him? \"Please?\" I beg. In the dark I just barely make out him shaking his head, especially with his black hair… \"Would you two shut up? Some of us need our sleep.\" Ginger hisses, but I'm not exactly sure where she had decided to fall asleep. \"Sorry.\" I whisper. There's silence again, and I look back at Emmett. He holds out his hand, and I expected to pull him up, but he pulled me down next to him. I felt uneasy being so close to him. He was like one of those dogs that if you got to close, they'd bite hard. \"We might need him.\" Emmett says in a hushed voice. \"Not worth it.\" I mumble. \"Could be…\" He says thoughtfully. I see light starting to escape the horizon outside the window. If I was going to kill Kory, it would have to be soon, while he was still asleep. I planked on my elbows to get a better view outside. Not long before the sun would be visible… \"No.\" Emmett holds be down before I can even attempt getting up. It's like he knows… I consider what would happen if I did, resist Emmett right now. I would most likely lose, waking up everyone in the process. On the other hand it could probably end up in a different, even more unfortunate way, with me grasping a knife, inches away from killing Kory, but yet Emmett is there… on top of me… holding me down. I shudder at the thought. Then sigh, \"Alright then. I won't kill him… for now…\" \"Thanks, hon.\" It takes me a second to realize what he said, and I shoot him a look. \"Never. Again.\" I say through my teeth, then get up and tiptoe past the rest of the group –group hah!- and sneak into the bathroom. If only airports had showers. Especially after being that close to Emmett… I splash some water on my face, and as I'm about to attempt fixing my hair, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. The last time self saw self was long before the apocalypse had even started. Before Emmett left before… before everything. The last normal thing in my life was three months prior to know… or at least I think. It all started in the middle of history class, one very interesting Thursday afternoon… \" Alright class, please open your books to page 467. We will be reading about Roman farming and culture, you may want to take notes to study for next week's test.\" My old history teacher, Mrs. Wimber said. We were about halfway through the second passage, when possibly the most life changing thing I have ever heard rang out through the school. \"Good afternoon Blake Academy students.\" Often our principle, Mr. Warner had done the announcements, but his voice was never this shaky. \"We will be giving an early release today. Your parents will be notified, prepare to evacuate the school by sixth hour. Now I knew something was up. I looked around and saw smiling faces, but then Mrs. Wimber's expression caught my attention. Never had she seemed so concerned. I knew, knew so well nothing was right at the moment. First, other than Mr. Warner's voice, was his choice of wording. Evacuate was something new. Second, there had been no snow, or tornado warnings that day. Third, we had one hour to leave. If I had known that would be my last visit to the school, I would have taken a different course of action. I did not only make the mistake of saying goodbye to a few friends but also I left without saying goodbye to my very most favorite teacher. And that in itself is something I will never forgive self about. By the time I got home, all I really remember was Emmett showing up, explaining everything to me. Then, all we were sure of was there was a virus, but not that there was anything untreatable, or extremely cannibalistic about it. All he could tell me was that he had to leave, and suggested I did the same with our without the rest of my family. I told him he was crazy and this would all pass over. I didn't see him after that. I assume he left, until the whole city started to fall apart. And I realized what a mistake I had made. I should have trusted Emmett… We went to downtown Minneapolis, just to get tested for the virus. Once we were clear, we were free to leave. But my mom was stupid. She wanted to wait until I passed over. She wasn't using common sense, she never did, and my cousin and I tried to explain to her that we needed to leave, but as usual she wouldn't listen. In just a small while, I was ready to leave by myself. I had to go back to the clinic and get retested, but other than that I was ready. When I went to the clinic, I waited in line for hours. As I came closer and closer, I saw this one guy. He looked incredibly sick. His face was pale, there were dark circles under his eyes and his dark hair was unkempt. We got to talking, and soon I knew his whole life story. As it continued it only got worse. His parents were dead, he was abused at home and lots of friends had passed since the beginning of the whole tragedy. And now he was using whatever money he had left to get tested, so he could go with the girl he loved and try to make it out alive. It was so heartbreaking, I started crying right there in line, in front of all those people. Tough little me, broken by a sob story. But it was all true… so terribly true… and as we were up to the doors of the clinic, I saw myself in the shiny reflection of the outside of the building. Me, with tears streaming down my face because of a sad story, standing next to this strong, but broken down guy, who the story belonged to. My lip was trembling as I remembered all these things. It was so stupid of me not to trust Emmett until it was too late. And even worse, I still didn't trust him. I hope you people loved it.(: up to 397 views! For me that's a lot. :3 Can't wait 'til the next chapter? Me neither. Catch you laters.^.^[Chapter 8] Hi Everyone! New character today! Still excepting more… really, it's okay… 427 views… new record for me! :D So with Kory still alive, Ginger being well… silent and distant as she was since the gun shop, Russia and Bipolar being… Russia and Bipolar, and Emmett's constant flirting caused by lack of sane girls, the whole waiting period was disastrous. We had been trying to contact someone in France for days now, but we haven't had any response. And Russia was in fear that if we didn't have clearance first, we'd get shot down out of the sky. Which, with all other factors, would be a pretty tragic way to die at this point. And also, if you've ever seen, heard, or been near me while I've flown a plane, you wouldn't necessarily want to be on board when I did. But of course being the only one out of our little team who just happened to have the skill of flying, was just unlucky… for all of us. Further more, if we were even able to make it to France, what would become of us then? Take a few French classes, blend into the society by eating croissants for every meal and pretend that the ruins of America is merely a small factor of the past, and there is absolutely nothing to be done about it? Or would we pretend this whole ordeal never happened, and move on into a new life? Unlikely. It wasn't like we could just forget all the family members lost, people killed and let's face it, all the people we be-headed. I'm pretty sure none of us ever would. Especially those of us who had to kill our own brothers and sisters… \"Minneapolis…\" I hear Kory's voice behind me, while I was searching through one of the airport's computers in the control room. \"What dipshit? I'm busy.\" I say trying hard to focus on what I was looking at, but it was merely impossibly with all us going on… not to mention the Hollister boy's strong perfume slowly suffocating me. \"You're never going to find it that way. Here, let me try.\" He says. I hesitate, but move out of the way to let him ruin whatever I was doing. \"See, you have to run the search under… and it has to be specific as to… Now just-hmm… no, that can't be… There!\" A list of numbers comes up on the screen. It was old technology but I could figure it out. \"I've been trying to find the list of codes for hours. How'd you find them?\" I ask in awe. \"Guess I'm just magic.\" He shrugs, and leaves me to my work. I sat back down at the computer, and ran a scan on the ones I thought may be important to opening the gates, doors, and plane controls. This may be old stuff, but they sure had high powered security in this airport. All of them seemed to still be in use, so I picked up the pencil and notepad laying over on one of the desks, and flipped through the pages for a clean sheet. But while I was searching through the pages one in particular caught my eye. I had noticed all the handwriting in the booklet had been in cursive, this had been in plain print. Second, it had been written in ink, the rest had been in pencil. Third was the many ink blotches stained on the paper, and there was no pens around. And then there's the actual words written on the page. They were different routes for Australia. And little notes on the side about where the outbreaks. France being one of them. So then I scanned all the computer's files on Australia, since it was no obvious we would be traveling to France now. Two hours later I emerged from the cramped little room to find myself alone. I figured the rest of them were wondering the airport somewhere, and decided to make the best of being alone for awhile. I strolled over to the lost and found, and got a hold of an lost I-pod and some really nice headphones. I had noticed earlier that one of the gates had a really nice view of the city, so I made myself a nice little lounge chair (it did involve a little axe work, though…) and put on Pandora and drifted off to sleep. Two hours later I woke up a little after sunset. Everything was the same as it had been when I fell asleep, which concerned me since A: This was the middle of the zombie apocalypse. Where are all the zombies? B: Normally Bipolar, Ginger, Russia, Emmett and Kory would have been making some sort of disastrous, life threatening event by now. So I looked around for a little while, but with no sign of anyone, went back to \"base.\" Where I found Russia half asleep (one eye peeled for danger I guess) and Emmett reading a magazine. \"Where have you guys been?\" I whisper yelled in my attempt to keep Russia asleep. \"Where have you been?\" He also whisper yells. \"Looking for you guys.\" I whisper. He rolls his eyes and pulls me away from the gate so Russia could sleep. \"I can't find Kory, Buffalo or Ginger anywhere.\" Emmett says worriedly. \"Maybe they're having a-\" \"Not the time.\" Emmett covers his hand over my mouth. I reaaally hope he's washed that in the past 24 hours… \"We need to find them.\" I nod silently. He goes back to grab a shot gun, I pull out my axe from my make shift sling around my shoulder. \"So you go that way, I go this way?\" I ask. \"No. We'll stick together.\" He shakes his head. Oh I always hated the idea of being alone with him. We walk around for a little while. Weird, how we barely saw any infected the whole time. Only a few that Emmett would immediately shoot at without thought, which put me on edge. Then we heard something. I look up to find an ugly half flesh have I don't even know chowing down on some leftover body parts. After a few seconds, it occurred to me that this could be one of our little team. And I held in a shriek. With a sigh, Emmett shoots the thing and turns to me. \"You alright?\" He asks, a real sincerity in his voice for once. I nod slightly, and just walk around the whole scene. Then something comes running up to us. At first I think it's just another zombie, but I realize by the way its walking it isn't. \"Are you… they're…Come quickly!\" Says this blue eyed girl as she turns to run the way she came. Emmett and I look at each other and both run after her. We slide down the escalator rails into the luggage carousels. Where it was quite obvious where all the infected had gone off to. As I watched the zombies circle around something as a horde, I noticed every few seconds one or two would drop, and not return back up. Then I realized that was most likely Kory, Buffalo and Ginger in the middle. So Emmett, blue eyes and I ran through the see of zombies, killing them as we went until we reached the very center. Within a few minutes (or that's what it had seemed cause it was really a half hour) only a few zombies survived. We cleared those few off and headed back upstairs to \"base\". \"So what's your name?\" Emmett asks the blue eyed girl. The way he asked it suddenly made me really angry. But I told myself \"Hey, if it gets him away from me for awhile, then so be it.\" But that hardly changed my mind. The girl just looks at him though. At least this one was quiet. Her and ginger should get along just fine this way. \"Or… where did you come from?\" She's a little hesitant, but then responds, \"Fairbanks… Alaska…\" Emmett nods attentively-damn him- and we all sort of collapsed once we get back. \"Whose this?\" Russia asks, just waking up. \"Fairbanks.\" Buffalo answers sounding the least bit sane. Russia gave her untrusting look, but with no other choice, went back to reading some biography. I wanted to tell Russia how much I agreed with her, but for some reason I actually kept myself from doing something rude. \"So what was your home like? Family? Friends? What's your story, come on?\" Emmett asks, lounging in a chair. \"Well uhmm…\" She starts quietly. \"Kill anyone close? Mom? Dad? I did that… Pets…?\" He interrupts her. Oh just shut up and let the poor girl speak, Emmett. \"Please… stop asking me questions…\" I hardly hear her say. \"Wha-\" \"JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!\" She yells and walks away. \"Geez.\" Emmett sighs. This was very satisfying. \"I'll go make sure she's alright… well… y'know.\" Kory stands up. \"Oh yes Kory. We know. \" He shoots me a look. Obvious it was his intentions as I had assumed. But still the fact that I had angered him was satisfying. I turn to Emmett once he leaves, \"You can't just start drilling people like that. I know you don't really care about what happened, but it might be hard on other people.\" \"What do you mean? It's just what is. It's not my fault if your cousin/brother was shot. Or your mom died in a fire… or whatever happened to her… Things happen! Who cares if their gone. All that matters is that we're still here.\" At this point I'm so angry at Emmett I just turn and walk away. I see Ginger stand up also, shake her head at him and walk away, too. \"What is with everyone today?\" I hear him say. SOOOOOOOOOOO was that just awesome or was it awesome! I think I have all the characters in now, so gimme more. Some dudes would just totally be chill if you catch my drift… narrrrllllyyy…. Sorry… Anyways, hope to see some new character submissions… Until next time! /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 9] So I want to apologize, I just noticed something a little off about my story… I have been covering up everyone's name… except for Emmett who I have been using freely throughout… so a small error. Sorry 'bout that one. Around 5:00 am, we were finally ready to leave. Everyone was quiet ever since the night before and it's drama. I went back to the control to grab all the information on controls, codes and routes we needed to make it to Australia. This is also about the time I realize I had never informed the rest of the group on our slight change in plans. So I gradually make my way back to see everyone packing up the few supplies we kept, and hesitantly announced, \"France is no longer safe, we're going to Australia instead.\" They all just kind of look at me. I'm pretty sure they were all shocked that someone was actually talking, since the only sounds that occupied the airport that morning were a few from the infected and some throat clearing and other gag noises from us. We boarded ourselves onto the plane. The dead silence was just to unusual. And really uncomfortable. I was so used to the whiny cries of children, that guy who doesn't want to shut off all electronic and cellular devices, and the woman who just talks way to loud, that they awkward shuffling of feet and the clinging sound that came when two of us would touch knives was strange and repelling. I suddenly wanted off the airplane, I wanted out of this cruel life and I wanted to be as far away as possible from reality. And I only knew one way of doing that. I look up at Emmett with the sheepish, but puppy-like eyes that I rarely used, but quickly turned away. NEVER. AGAIN. But it was too late. Emmett saw the eyes. I look down, cringe, and wait for whatever mayhem was to come. But it doesn't come. I look up, and Emmett isn't even looking at me anymore. I was shocked. He was fidgeting with some computer used to measure something… I don't know. But he was smiling. I saw the smile. It was that smug, sexy, knowing smile only he could pull off. \"Emmett… are you ready to go?\" I ask slowly. The smile slowly shrivels into a thin line, and he looks up at me, his overall face is serious, but his eyes were shining with delight. \"Emmett.\" \"Oh, yes.\" He says, switching off whatever he had been playing with earlier. \"Are you?\" I nod, concerned about his reaction. It was going to make for a long trip. I sit down in the pilot's chair whatever, and start the plane's engine. Step one- complete and still alive. Oh lord, now step two. Two hours into the plane ride, I see the silly smile on Emmett's face again. Out of the overall nineteen and a half hours of this flight, I figured one of three things would happen. 1: Emmett's face would freeze, and he would be stuck with the smile forever. 2: He would soon get tired, and he would have to stop smiling. 3: The idea that brought the smile will present an opportunity to actually happen… and it will. My favorite was plan 1… but since that would be kind of creepy having Emmett smile like a deranged clown all the time, option 2 was a little more likeable. 3 was not going to happen. I was sure it would not happen. I would make sure it did not happen… then it happened. \"So… you gave me the look.\" He says after what was probably a good hour of the horrific smile. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" I say pretending that I needed to actually focus on things outside the plane… not hitting the… clouds. \"Oh I think you know. But if you really don't… I could familiarize you…\" He says leaning towards me. I refused to meet his eyes. \"Boy sit your ass down.\" I say. \"Let me fly for a bit.\" He ignores me. \"No.\" I shoot him a look. Damn… those eyes. \"Please, you need a break.\" He already knew I had given in on some, unspoken brainwave we had. He tips his head to the side, before I sigh. Then he practically picks me up out of the seat as we trade places. \"The lever there controls the-\" \" Please.\" He gives me a look. \"I know what I'm doing.\" Which was a lie. But I didn't have enough energy to argue. So I am embarrassed and outmost disappointed to inform you, that I soon fell asleep on his shoulder. A million things wrong with that. \"Promise me you will never put me through that again.\" Emmett says the moment I wake up. Half panicked half still asleep. \"huh…\" I moan. \"I hardly know how to fly this damn aircraft, and you just fall asleep and let me do it anyways?\" He exaggerates… then continues, \"And also. You put me through the misery of watching you sleep on MY shoulder, and being a good and honest guy, did not lay a hand on you. No matter how much I wanted to brush your hair out of your face or put my arm around you or-or- or hold you in any way! That is unfair. Completely and utterly unfair.\" He rages. I feel the immediate need to argue. \"You're the one who said you knew what you were- what?\" I ask… did he just say he… Emmett taps the dashboard awkwardly. Fidgeting as usual. \"Emmett…\" I don't look at him yet. But I want to see his face so bad that it takes all my strength not to look at it. One of the hands that were fidgeting slides over to mine. I am angry and glad all at once. I was mad that Emmett had left me in the first place, but happy to know that time healed things. Maybe it could heal our world before time itself runs out. And there is nothing left of our strange and mysteriously little Earth. I look up, with the puppy like eyes of course, and see Emmett's got that stupid smile again, as he practically attacks me. Thanks to whoever said that this story needs a little more romance. How's that? Need more. Fine. I'm not too sure everyone else will enjoy my dark and twisted mind, though. So let's keep it at that. I do dearly and truly and sincerely apologize that I have not written in so long. I have betrayed the loyalty I have to you my fans and I will do my best not to let that proceed to happen in the near future. Love always, your author. /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 10] HAI! 800! I'm so excited! Sorry 'bout that last chapter… but requests are requests. X I can feel your heart beating to the beat of my drum. Oh what a shame that you came here with someone. So while you're here in my arms. Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young. I had no clue that planes had iPod jacks. It made the flight a little more pleasant. Especially since it filled the awkwardness between Emmett and I. Y'know… until that last song turned on. I quickly hit the skip button. NO MORE-.- The others had practically trashed what remained habitable of the plane. There was some sort of party thrown there… and it had only been a few hours. I look over to the controls, just in need of something new to see, but it was no use. I couldn't stop thinking about how we were all screwed. But I had to give the others something to hang on to… A little bit of turbulence. There'd be a storm soon. I look over to the screen with temperatures and other weather stuff. The windshield was rising at some sort of rapid rate. I claw at my own hand nervously. I didn't want to have to land tonight. Maybe we could just fly straight through the storm before anything to problematic came. I turned the plane a little to the right as some rain popped up on the screen somewhere below us. No big deal as long as we were so far up. More turbulence. My nails dig into my skin a little more. \"Oh!\" I exclaim as the winds pick up, and the plane is pushed along with it. This wasn't supposed to happen… Emmett's staring at me. I can feel the icy cold gaze from my side. I turn to meet his eyes, but now he's gaping at the screen. I look down to see the begginings of something that I didn't want to- \"Minneapolis!\" Emmett shouts, as the plane shuts down and we're suddenly falling. I hold in a scream as we start the descent of ten thousand feet. Plummeting straight down. No. No. I grab Emmett's arm. No, pierce his arm. This is not the way to die now. I stop thinking for only a moment before Emmett is shaking me and asking me what to do, begging me to fix it. Subconsciously I grab the stick. Pull up. In my absence, the plane has restored power. The lights are on again, but we're lurching upward at a sickening speed. But I feel nothing. I automatically hit another lever. The plane is almost spinning now. Spiraling out of control. But somehow I know I've complete control over all that is happening. I can get us to the ground safely. I hit something else, and now we're gliding downward. Not like it should be, but better than before. I hit something else. A popping sound. Oh the wheels, why would I do that? The next thing I know, we're on the ground… no.. in the ground. We've plowed a nice little plane sized line through the Arlington Cemetery. HOW THE HELL DID WE LAND IN WASHINGTON DC? \"What the hell was that?\" Texas almost destroys the door to the cockpit. ****no cock jokes**** I don't exactly answer so much as just stare out the front of the plane. I realize the music on my iPod is somehow still playing. I snatch it and unplug it from the jack. Doing all I can to avoid eye contact. \"Minneapolis.\" I hear Bipolar come in. Someone else is behind her… It's Kory… Well for the most part, everyone was okay… in the plane that is… Not too sure about the many infected people outside… But whatever, just axe work. There was no point in sitting around, so everyone packed their crap up and stood by the emergency exit. \"I swear I've seen this somewhere.\" I say examining the exit. \"What do you mean?\" Kory says about to open the door. \"Wait!\" I yell as he's about to kick it down. \"What?\" He yells. \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" I say quietly. He rolls his eyes and kicks the door down. We all pile out, and for a moment it's quiet. But then we're all covering our ear from the alarm coming from the plane. \"OOH… now I remember.\" I say recalling L4D2. Secrets be secrets, I was a gamer. Everyone glares at me as something starts moving in the distance. About the size of a… oh it's a horde. \"Fuck!\" Emmett yells. \"Let's move!\" Russia says. Coming out of our stunned daze, we all hopped off the side of the plane, running the opposite way of the horde, which by the way, tracking us down pretty fast. We ran through the graves, guns firing axes and knives swinging. Yelling and odd phrases escaping the crazy ones… oh right that's all of us. And then, I see Fairbanks stop up ahead, her mouth wide in awe. Gaping at something she sees. Then I see it. Out of the ground… Slowly crawling up… Our first undead zombie. \"Holly shit!\" Kory grabbing his shotgun as Theodore Roosevelt escapes from the ground. I'd like to know how he did that… \"Guys… Run.\" I almost whisper. Cause there's not enough time to make sure he's dead, while all the rest are only a few yards away. Kory opens his mouth to argue, but closes it as he sees just how close the horde is. \"Come on!\" It's Fairbank's voice coming out in a squeak as we all sprint out of there. I grab the revolver out of its holster and start shooting. But obviously none of our efforts are enough. There were just too many. And I was truly about to give up, when Emmet yells, \"Up here!\" And we look up to see a ladder leading to the roof. We scramble up like scared mice. And again start shooting. Eventually Texas runs out of ammo, and has started throwing knives… I briefly wonder where she acquired them, but realized I was coming onto a problem of my own. The revolver's ammo was almost completely gone. There's no way I could use my axe now, and those were my only two options. \"Here.\" Russia holds something out to me during my panic. It was a black bow. Okay. Where did she get THAT? \"What on earth do you expect me to do with that? \" I ask grabbing it anyways. She shrugs and hands me arrows. I sigh angrily and start shooting them They worked nicely… But nothing like the axe. Still, when the last zombie fell, I was still holding the bow in my hand. \"Thanks,\" I breathe handing Russia the bow back. She smiles a little, taking it. Then Emmett comes over, scanning for more. But none were found. \"I've been meaning to ask you… How'd you find these?\" He smiles smugly, grabbing my axe. I just smile in response. He knew exactly how I found them. \"It's been a long day.\" Kory says to us all. \"We need to find somewhere to rest,\" He looks at me, \"And find more ammo.\" Since when did he become leader. Alright guys. There you go. Until next time… /1_/1 ( + _ + ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 11] Hi everyone! 900! Well 903… new character^.^ And yes, if you have any characters please keep submitting or just reviewing cause I'm just a lonely panda without my feedback… lawl. Longest. Trip. Ever. I thought tiredly as we made our way through the city of Washington D.C. I was exhausted, we were all exhausted. No one talked, no one had enough energy to do anything but fire off a gun every few zombies. Zombies…. Gawd their need for brains were just contagious. I mean seriously you see all the rotting corpses munch'n on another rotting corpse and you think: Wow, that's attractive. I wish I could be THAT sexy. Not only did I long for sleep, but also clean clothes, some form of hygiene (even s measly stick of deodorant at this point) or socialism with people who did not drive me into insanity every thirteen seconds (I am keeping track.) But no, we just had to keep moving… I was starting to get annoyed. There were absolutely no gun stores in this place. But… of course not, too easy to assassin the president. And then… it hit me. \"GUYS.\" I screamed. They all flipped out and stared at me. \"The White House would have guns… wouldn't it?\" \"First of all it's Whitehouse .\" Kory says. \"What? That's what I said.\" I give him a look. \"Yeah, but you capitalized it in the wrong place.\" He adds. \" What ?\"I asked… what had he taken? \"Never mind.\" He shakes his head. \"So anyways, wouldn't they have guns?\" I ask. \"Yeah, probably.\" Emmett smiles. Aha. I was the smart one now. We grab a map from a souvenir shop and head in the direction of our president's former residence. It wasn't really all that long of a walk. I mean, you wouldn't really expect the leader of our nation to live next to apartments (sexy apartments according to some advertisements) but really he was quite close. The house was completely abandoned, even the security gate was left hanging open. Someone had left in a hurry. I push the gate open. We walk in easily, absolutely no one there, no rotting corpses, no zombies. As if it had never been touched. All too weird for my taste. \"This is way too creepy.\" Texas said once in the house. It was like a museum almost. \"Agreed.\" Russia nods, taking her time going around corners. \"Anyone know where we're going?\" I ask looking around. I hear a clicking sound behind us. \"I might.\" I turn to see a pale skinned (pretty emo looking) guy. Oh, lord. *arherm* quick interruption If I may (of course I may I'm the author) Uhm… if anyone has any problems with their characters… please, now is the time to let me know. Okay? Okay. Tanks… \"Not another one.\" I groan. He's holding a crossbow, which would have been the click, and giving me a weird look. I realized then that the group had abandoned me. Thanks guys. I pull out my axe, \"Weaponry. Now.\" I rest the axe over my shoulder and grab the revolver with the other hand challenging him. \"And I suggest you make the correct decision. But he just laughs and turns. UGH… I asked for people who DIDN'T annoy me. I return the revolver, to grab my cell phone. (Yes, still got that.) And call Emmett. \"Hello?\" Emmett answers with a serious question in his voice. \"Thanks for leaving me. Found a new….. friend- \" \"Oh no.\" \"And he knows where the weaponry is… I think. He's a modern Reaver.\" I say referring to another of my many video games. \"Reaver?\" \"Crazy, medieval, gun guy.\" I sat flatly. \"That Reaver,\" I hear a smile in his voice. \"What?\" I ask. \"Memories. Where are you?\" \"I don't know. Oh I see you.\" I wave to him. This was so normal… I put the phone away as the others join me behind uhm… I'll just call him Reaver for now. \"Reaver, eh?\" Reaver asks not turning to look at me. I shrug even though he wasn't looking at me. \"Just take us to the killing stuff.\" This is when he looks back and notices the group of people following. Despite the startled look in his eye, he turned nonchalantly, ignoring them. We stop in front of a metal door, he punches in an access code on a tablet and the door opens. I could sense that Kory was fuming with jealousy without even looking. It was beautiful. So many … Who used this room? \"They plan for the strangest things.\" Reaver shakes his head. \"What was this for?\" I ask, curious. \"What are we doing now, eh?\" Reaver counters. Right. National emergencies starting with Z and ending with ombie apocalypses. \"So where are you from?\" I ask, I could tell… something was a bit off about this one… not quite… American. \"Canada.\" He shrugs. I snatch the gun and point it towards him. \"Everyone back! It's a beaver!\" I yell. Reaver lifts an eyebrow. \"Back.\" I hiss. He simply pushes the gun aside. \"I am in no relation with Justin Bieber, now please, take your stuff and leave.\" He sighs. \"This house has like… what? Thirty rooms, find a different one!\" I argue, but put the gun away. \"I'm afraid the access code is needed to leave the room as well.\" \"Oh,\" I say dumbly. After retrieving the few things I needed, and wanted, we left the room, then explored a little more without Canada on our tail. We went through some serious rooms, like ones you wouldn't even imagine in a house. The whole thing was pretty mind blowing. \"Hey,\" Emmett nudges me as we're watching some of the group bowl. Yes, a bowling alley. But I was too tired, in fact, I was practically a zombie myself at that point. \"you look pretty tired.\" \"Gee.\" Is all I have the energy to say. \"You want to go find somewhere to rest?\" He asks. Too tired to be suspicious, I nodded, and I leaned on him the whole way down the hall. \"What about Reaver?\" I ask, sleepily. \"Hm? Canada?\" He asks. I nod. He shrugs. Wonderful talk we were having. I'm pretty sure I'm so tired myself, that's probably the reason I'm writing about it. Hah… Okay well let me know what you're all thinking about this… or whatever… ._. /1_/1 ( . ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 12] So…. I got bored… so… here… \"Why me?\" I complain staring out the window. \"Because you're awesome?\" Emmett tries, smiles, fails. \"Eff you.\" Not even in the mood to swear. \"Well they're not that bad.\" Emmett tries again. CRSHHH… \"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?\" I say 180ing in my seat. We had \"borrowed\" a tour bus. And now a light lay half hanging off the ceiling. I glare at Canada and Kory in their seats. AMIGAWD. Have I seriously been calling him Kory this whole time? Alabama. Whatever the hell. Canada had decided to come with us, since he nearly destroyed half the white house after a run in with a particular past president *cough Obama*and well let's face it, no one wants karaoke nights with Obama drama lama zombie. Not even Reaver. Alabama and Canada shift uneasily in their seats. \"It's Kory!\" Alabama says. \"What?\" I asked, obviously he was on those drugs again. \"No, I'm not on drugs, you keep calling me Alabama well I'm Kory. Okay?\" He fumes. Seriously what is this boy talking about? I reach for the Advil resting on the seat next to me. \"No.\" Emmett says taking one hand off the wheel (oh yes, he was driving.) \"You've had enough.\" I groaned. \"But Alabama gets drugs.\" I pout. \"Kory!\" –from the back of the bus. \"Why can't I?\" \"I'm not on drugs!\" also from the back of the bus. \"Shut up, Alabama!\" I yell. He sighs. I win.:3 \"Guys.\" Bipolar says, suddenly. We had been in the bus, quite awhile... \"We should make a music video.\" And as crazy as it sounded… we all groaned. \"It'll be fun!\" She protests. This is what happened: Reaver's iPad was used to record the worse rendition of Gangham style… ever. And there was a lot of dancing in the tiny bathroom on the back of the bus. Enough said. \"Are we there?\" I ask Emmett. \"And where is there, exactly?\" He raises an eyebrow only half looking at me. \"I don't know.\" Or something to that. \"Where did you want to go?\" He asks me. I think….. \"Does it really take you that long, what's with the extensive dots?\" Kory says. Dots? I ignore him. \"Hm… Maybe… let's go to…\" A smile spreads all the way across my face. Emmett realizes his mistake, and I can almost hear him begging me in his mind not to say it. \"Germany.\" I hiss. \"Oh, fuck.\" Emmett sighs. YES! \"Germany?\" Russia hisses in the back. \"You got a problem with that, communist?!\" I give her another death glare. I was getting good at that. She cowers. \"That's right.\" I smile. \"Canada, where are we?\" \"Indiana.\" He answers, looking at his iPad. I never understood why he had such an old weapon but such new technology. \"Perfect.\" I grin at Emmett. \"Airport, please.\" He reaches for the Advil. Ten Minutes later… \"Hey, can I see-\" \"No!\" Reaver turns his back to Kory, who is trying to take the iPad. \"But…\" Kory says sadly. \"Nu.\" Reaver does some sort of face. Great. \"Gimme the frik'n iPad!\" Kory lunges for it, falling into the next seat. Fail. \"It's mine.\" Canada stands. Kory reaches for it, Reaver holds it above his head and glares down with one eye peering at him. \" I SAID NO .\" His voice is almost demonic. So dramatic. \"Guys…\" I groan. But they continue. \"I was here first.\" Kory whines. What a winner. \"It's my iPad.\" He counters. \"I just want to look!\" Reaver shoves him away as he reaches again for the tablet. \"Sit down! Both of you!\" Bipolar says. They ignore her, too. \"Would you just chill out, you have enough stuff.\" Canada shakes his head. \"But not that.\" Kory whimpers. They start fist fighting. Oh lord. \"Just give it up you're never going to-\" \" ENOUGH.\" Dark auras and unpleasant feelings fill the bus. Russia is giving the most evil stare I had ever seen. Even I was scared. Both Reaver and Kory sat without a word. Thanks goodness. But then Reaver shoves Kory and Kory falls out the window… which they broke. Oh, sweet karma. \"Emmett, stop the bus we lost one.\" I say missing quite a bit of enthusiasm. He sighed and pulled over. The door swung open and Kory stepped on, his hair messed up and his varsity coat full of grass stains (Oh no!) And he scowled at Reaver. Hehehehe… \"I'll kill you!\" He started. \"I'd like to see you try.\" Canada said with a wave of his hand. Kory rushed toward him just as he stepped aside, letting Kory run right into the bathroom door. Kory, obviously a dip shit, charged him again. \"Uhm… guys?\" I hear Fairbanks whisper of a voice (just think of Fluttershy…) \"uhm… could you maybe… stop… please?\" Kory looked back before running into Reaver's outstretched suitcase. (Damn that would've been good to see.) And stopped, nodding without another word. THANK GOD FOR FAIRBANKS. The airport was only a couple more miles, and the bus was finally silent. I leaned my head against the window, and thought silently. What a shitty bus ride. And brief memories of a school trip to Dc had flooded through my eyes. What I wouldn't give to go back to that. But then again, I never really did anything but stare at a computer screen all day, do homework, maybe eat once in a while and sleep. So it wasn't anything compared to this. Or the… family… I had gained, now. Family… Nope never had one. Didn't really know what one was until I visited Emmett's house for the first time and gee was that a disaster. Emmett looks over at me and smiles, I realize I had been staring at him. Oops. I always stared at the weirdest things when I daydreamed, making people uncomfortable… Probably why I don't have a lot of friends in the first place. \"We're here.\" Emmett says, pulling the bus to a halt. I smiled. Germany, here I come. ****Announcer voice**** So you're about to learn about Minneapolis's huge obsession with Germany… And hrm… things are truly stirring up between the group. What's to become of Emmett and Minneapolis 's awkward on off romance? What's going on with Kory and Fairbanks? Is Bipolar really Bipolar? What is up with Russia's creepy evilness? And will Kory and Reaver ever stop fighting? Probably not but find out anyways next time on Zombie. Candy. Chainsaw Massacre! … Seriously so bored… /1_/1 ( * . * ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 13] :P It's early. I love how there are more people out of the country that read this than in... Especially Indonesia… If it were to say that the airport was crowded… I would be completely correct. Absolutely and completely correct. There were about twenty people (real people) we found. Now, no, I have yet to over dose on that Advil, but this is what happened: \"Which gate should we go to?\" Kory asks standing next to me. We had broken into yet another airport control room, and I was going through the list of what gates had planes in them still. \"It looks like thirteen... That's odd.\" I look closer at the list. The last airport all of the flights had been canceled before the outbreak. \"What?\" He asks. \"It shows there's still an outgoing flight. It's the only one in this entire system.\" I say thoughtfully. \"Maybe it's just a mistake.\" He shrugs. \"All flights public airports were shut down exactly fifteen hours before…\" I thought of the burning building again. \"Fifteen hours before anything even happened. The only way to get in and out was through the city, and that was hard enough.\" \"Again, maybe there was a mistake.\" But I'm still annoyed by Kory, so of course I'm not going to listen. \"It's not like we're short for time or anything, we could go check it out.\" I shrug. Kory sighs in defeat, \"Fine, whatever.\" I print out the list, and we head back to our little base. \"Move everything to gate 13, leave everything you don't need behind, and everything you do need, don't forget.\" Russia says once I handed her a copy of the list. After her little moment the other day on the bus, I trusted her to be able to move the group as a whole, so it was a little off my shoulders. Kory and I turn to walk to the gate that has an outgoing flight, when Reaver stops us. \"Where are you going?\" I look at the sheet, \"Gate 25…\" \"Why?\" Why was everyone so nosey? \"There was something odd about it on the computer. That's all.\" I sigh. \"What kind of odd?\" He asks. \"Like, flashing on the screen odd. Now either find out, or go away.\" I shake my head. Both were silent until we reached the last corner, good choice. \"Guys if anything's- Oh, my god.\" I whisper. There was a whole group… about twenty people or so. Impossible. \"Charlotte.\" Canada says. We both look at him and he's staring at a little girl sitting in the corner. \"You know her?\" Kory's raising an eyebrow. He nods only half there. \"My little sister…\" He makes his way over there before getting stopped by two big guys with zero big weapons. Oh god. \"I need to get through.\" Reaver said, harshly. \"No one gets through without an ID.\" The one says. I've taken down zombies bigger than him, pretty sure I could get through without some identification. \"That's my little sister.\" He tries to push past them, they don't budge. I sigh, this was pathetic. \"Excuse me.\" I push Reaver aside. I see that Charlotte is now looking back at us. \"We need to see someone, so I strongly suggest you move out of my way, or you will be moved out of my way.\" Both men laugh. I shake my head, feeling sorry for them. I grab a pen in my pocket, no not a pen, but something like one… I click the button, curious what it did, or if it worked. A metal evolved from the pen, molding around my hand like a glove. \"Siiiiiiiiccckkkk.\" I smile at it, then turn to one of the guys and pick him up by his collar. \"You will move.\" And I throw him across the room. \"Do I really need to deal with you, too?\" I ask the other one. He's already grabbed a katana (yes a katana, even funnier, he's Asian.) and tries slicing me in half. Well he fails cause I turn to the side, missing it. \"Oh, I see how this is.\" As he swipes it again. \"Tisk, tisk, you must really learn you're manners. I expect you to take me out to dinner or something before trying that.\" I hear both Kory and Reaver laugh before the two of them start fighting… again. \"Listen, tiny-\" \"Speak for yourself Bruce Lee, where not judging by size here.\" I interrupt him. No one gets comebacks but me. \"Just go back to wherever you came.\" He shakes his head. I shrug, giving a look of defeat, and turn to walk away. Then, once I hear his sigh of relief, turn and claw his face. \"I got the claw!\" I laugh and kick him down, standing on his chest. \"Now you really look like Bruce Lee.\" The clawing had left three big gashes going down the side of his face over his eye. I was jealous, it looked kind of cool. \"Reaver!\" I yell trying to get him out of his little fight. \"CANADA!\" Oh, you know I mean business when I use real names. He looks up, seeing little Brucey on the ground. \"Charlotte!\" He runs over to her. He barely gets a smile out of her. She was pretty scared. \"Let's get out of here.\" \"You aren't going anywhere.\" Oh Christ what now? I turn to see this green eyed German (how do I know it's German, the accent) girl standing behind me. \"Excuse you, who do you think you are?\" I'm going to be the most anti-social person ever after all this is over. \"That is nothing to you, you will leave the girl.\" She says, arms crossed. \"Uh no, we will not leave the girl.\" I say, copying her accent. \"I think that should really be up to her.\" The Asian guy says. That's right… I was still standing on him… huh. I shrug. The German girl turns to Charlotte. Another damn name without a state god dammit. \"I… want to go with you.\" She looks at me. Woot! I win! \"Fine. Where are you going, anyways?\" She asks, a little nicer now. \"Germany.\" I say flatly. She gives me a look. \"Well, we'll be seeing you all later. Sorry about our… disturbance.\" I see that the one guy I threw was still unconscious. I step off the Asian and turn to leave. As we're almost out of seeing distance (not really though) I hear, \"Wait!\" \"What?!\" I ask, annoyed. \"I'll go with you.\" The German said. \"Thanks for asking so nicely.\" I say but let her come with. Not like I was going to say no, now. Currently thinking of publishing this… nah. Oh well, hoped you enjoyed it, thanks for all the character submissions. Asian guy was my idea though. Just picture Bruce Lee. :D Until we meet again- Wait now I wanna do my announcer thing again: THINGS AREN'T GOING SO SMOOTHELY FOR THE GANG, ANYMORE. WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW THAT CHARLOTTE IS IN REAVER'S HANDS? IS MINNEAPOLIS JUST JEALOUS OF THE GERMAN GIRL… BECAUSE SHE'S GERMAN? WHO IS THE ASAIN? WHEN WILL RUSSIA EVER LEARN WHAT KARAOKE IS? FIND OUT ON THE NEXT… ZOMBIE. CANDY. CHAINSAW MASSACRE! I really do enjoy doing that. /1_/1 (O . O) (\")-(\")[Chapter 14] Hello dear Fanfictionites! Yesterday was my birthday!^.^ Anyways, sorry for the lack of updates. Well, I could almost say that the plane ride was… uneventful. I mean maybe if you were any regular person, who hadn't just witnessed the zombie apocalypse, the destruction of your entire lives and your only companions are a bunch of nut jobs than yeah, you could say our plane ride was definitely a ride. But for someone who has been through all that and is coming close to being used to the people on board the aircraft, than you would have no reason to be enjoying any particular part. Except for the silence. Which I believe is a full on first for us. Bavaria, the German girl, suggested we need a team name. So I said no. End of story. I'm a dream crusher. Then, Bipolar thought it'd be fun to play hide and go seek in the plane… guess how that turned out? But the most best, best part of all, was when Russia shut both Reaver and Kory up, after almost causing our deaths at a very high altitude. NOT TODAY CHILDREN. \"We'll be landing in about uh…. Fifteen minutes uh… it's mostly sunny-uh… partly cloudy, about 60 degrees uh…. I hope you enjoyed flying with uh… Zombie airlines, your one stop shot for getting out of the country…. Uh.\" By the time Emmett clicked off the loud speaker I was rolling on the ground laughing. But it'd probably be better if I were landing the plane instead… anyways. Emmett's perfect imitation of a captain sent tears running down my eyes, it was so funny. \"Emmett… Emmett… oh my god… where did you pick that up…?\" I asked in between laughs. \"Well, y'know. This ol' guy's got enough pleasures up his sleeves.\" He said flexing a muscle. I ignored the fact that he used the word pleasures . \"So this is it.\" He says looking out at the landscape. \"Yeah, hey maybe you should be helping me land this thing.\" I nudge him, suppressing a smile. He gives me the most bewildered look. \"What? Just because I can fly a plane, do you expect me to land one? That little stunt I pulled in DC was a crash may I remind you.\" I give him the most dead serious look I think I've ever used. \"But…\" He starts, but it's too much. I start laughing to a point where I absolutely could not breathe. \"Hah! You should have seen your face!\" He frowns, \"Very mature. Now land the plane.\" I smile innocently then pay attention to actually getting the plane on the ground. Hah… oh that moment was precious. We landed easily. Not much too it. Unless you forget to let the wheels down first, then you're kind of in trouble. But I didn't! So we landed pretty safely. Well I mean, you know… it was a little bumpy but… \"YOU CRASHED THE PLANE AGAIN!\" Kory's face is pure red. \"Well… I wouldn't say crashed…\" \"Above all that, you crashed it into the airport.\" Texas points out, her red hair blowing in the wind making it look like her head was on fire… hehe. \"Again… wouldn't say I crashed it.\" I say quietly. \"That might have been the only way out of this country!\" Bavaria seemed to have been stuck on leaving here before we even got here. \"What if there were people in there?\" Reaver, mouth hanging half open. \"It was more like dented…\" \"It's possible.\" Russia doesn't rule it out. \"Not even dented really…\" \"They might have had a cure!\" Bipolar says. Hadn't noticed she changed back to schooly-preppy-annoying-bitch girl. \"More like scratched…\" \" And it's cold!\" She adds. I hear Charlotte whimper, and realize the only people not talking right now were her, Fairbanks and Emmett. \"Alright. Anyone else want to yell at me?\" I look directly at those three. No response. \"Great, then let's at least fix one problem by going inside. \"It'll be cold in there too! You smashed through all the windows!\" Bipolar says. \"Not all of them.\" \"Guys, lay off her. None of you could have even flown the plane.\" Emmett says, laying his arm around my shoulders like a shield. Didn't work. \"Oh how hard could it be?\" Kory asks. \"Minneapolis, it's not that we're mad it's just-\" \"No I'm pretty sure we're mad!\" Texas interrupts Canada. \"Guys-\" Emmett tries. \"You killed our last chance of survival!\" Bipolar screeches. When will she change back to that confused mental patient we all know and love? \"WELL WHAT IF SHE DIDN'T?\" Fairbanks had decided to speak up now. Well, thanks. \"We don't know for sure if the small damage she caused had any impact on this place. So what if a few gates got ruined. There may not even have been people there. It's not likely thinking we haven't seen anyone else here. And so what if she made a small mistake. It's not like you all haven't! So just stop, okay? Isn't what we're all going through bad enough?\" She shakes her head. Wow. \"You alright?\" Emmett asks low enough for only me to hear. I smile and nod, \"Of course,\" I was used to the yelling anyways. No different from before everything changed. \"They'll calm down eventually.\" He whispers into my hair. I almost puke at the thought of him being this close but hey, the comfort was a little necessary considering my current stress level. That's when we hear the clicking. Click, clop, click, clop… Almost like a horse… almost like… \"Welcome.\" Half smiles a blonde-gray haired lady. Wrinkles covering most of her face, but besides had strict and serious blue eyes, was a small and wearing a suit. I soon see the source of the clicking, high heels. We all stare at her. \"I'm Charlotte. I work with the VKG das Volks Katastrophe Gesellschaft. Or in America the NDC, the National Disaster Corporation. \"They have a corporation for that?\" Emmett asks. She ignores him, \"I'm sure you've had a long day. Please, follow me to our head quarters.\" She pivots and clicks off. We kind of all just stand there, still confused. Then follow her. \"So when did this start… y'know, here?\" Kory asks Charlotte. \"The disease began to spread approximately two and a half months ago.\" She answers, not turning to face him as she talks. \"So you've had time to prepare. How many survivors are there? Are you working on a cure? Do you know how this start-\" Charlotte stops walking, stopping us in our tracks. \"I suggest you keep any further questions to yourself, and your mouth shut.\" She says, her accent heavy with German. Kory nods, I think she may be scarier than Russia. Charlotte takes us down an elevator, then takes us down a long, damp hallway. And then down an even scarier mine elevator- like thing. Where we end up in an underground room, filled with equipment, light, and survivors. \"Welcome to VKG Headquarters.\" Charlotte says. Hey okay so I'm sorry if Volks Katastrophe Gesellschaft aren't the right words, I had to use google translate so you guys probably feel my pain. Anyways hope you enjoyed it(: /1_/1 (=T _ T=) ( \" )-( \" )[Chapter 15] Hi… I'm really not sure if anyone's still reading this, but whatever… \"People!\" Texas had said-no screeched. \"Well at least she recognizes her own kind.\" Kory rolls his eyes. Texas shoots him a look. There were so many people, I actually started to get scared. \"So… this is where everyone's been… this whole time…? Reaver asks. \"This is so weird.\" Bipolar says. \"Strange.\" Russia nods in agreement. \"How have you been hiding this?\" Emmett asks ***Oh Christ, I just realized there are two Charlottes… okay, I will fix this…**** Selma. \"Well, no one really pays attention to broadcasting when the world is having a crisis.\" She answers. \"Yes, they do.\" Kory says, annoyed and a vein sticking out of his neck. \"Well. I guess that makes sense.\" Emmett shrugs it off. \"No, it doesn't.\" Kory hisses. No one really paid any attention to him. \"Either way… I'm listing you as group 103. Go sit against that wall until I can send a representative to explain further. Have a nice day.\" She nods and clicks away. \"I don't like this.\" Reaver shakes his head. \"For once, I agree with you.\" Kory nods. They glare at each other. So much for bonding. We sat down by the wall like we were told, other strangers speaking all sorts of languages sat around us. A guy speaking French came over to us. He got really close to my face saying things I didn't understand. Emmett shoved him back and put his arm around me protectively. The man walked away. \"I'm scared, Emmett.\" I burrowed my face into his shirt. \"No, you're not. You're not used to it is all.\" I look up to see him smiling. \"Shut it.\" I stick my tongue out at him. I was always anti-social, even before everyone turned into zombies. \" Obviously these people aren't used to interacting with others anymore… or maybe never were…\" Emmett nods at an old man with a long beard and hair trying to lick his foot. \"Hm… I suppose so.\" It was kind of hard to be around so many people in one place. \"Hey guys… I don't like this place.\" Kory comes and sits by us. \"Yeah, I get that.\" Emmett shakes his head, \"But for now let's just see what happens, they've got everything under control.\" \"But what if they don't? What if someone already is infected, they just don't know it yet, and everyone else gets it. It could happen.\" Kory argues. \"It won't, they know what they're doing.\" \"Fine. But when it happens…\" Kory walks away, before exploding with anger. Probably for the best. \"Don't let that scare you…\" Emmett says to me. But I wasn't even thinking about that… I was more concerned about how long we would be down here. For a few days? Hours? Months? I was so made. I'd never be able to see my flipping country again. (Neither will Bavaria for that matter… although she didn't seem to fond of the place anyways…) Maybe wouldn't even make it back home… But really home was never the place I wanted to be anyways. So what difference did it make? And somehow through everything my iPod has managed to survive this whole journey. So I took it out of my pocket and started listening to it. And the sweet sensation of music overload brought me back to a much, much simpler time. Two years prior to the announcement at school. I sat in the band room, a place I visited three times a day during school. Sometimes more at night. Well… now was one of those times, like when I was too afraid to visit home. To afraid to see my mom and brother fight, too scared to walk alone through the city. Or even see Dustin, who had been my best friend since we were toddlers. Dustin lived in the same apartment building as me. In my darker days, his parents were my foster parents when we moved to the Us and my mom was only able to take care of my brother… Later, when my mom and brother moved into the apartment building, it became Dustin's habit to go from apartment to apartment through the stairwells and whatever. We free ran the rough tops of the city for one we were older, too. We grew up together, hung out together, and at one point in time, were together. But that's another story. Anyways, half the lights in the room were off, and it was winter, so it was already dark outside even though it was only six o'clock. But that's Minnesota for you. I sat at the piano, staring at the keys, not really all there. I was thinking only about the next key I'd strike, the next time I'd strum the bass in the corner, or trill on my flute. I was a virtuoso… or at least… my teachers called me. But that would change tonight. It would all change. Well for me at least. Maybe everyone else's lives would go on as planned. But mine would stop. And suddenly I'm standing on that same roof top. (The one that would be destroyed in a few years) and I'm preparing myself for whatever would come next… some sort of mixture of pain and relief I guessed. I swung my legs over a ledge and- \"What are you doing?\" A voice from behind. I gasp, almost going forward. \" I'm uhm…\" and before I can even think of what I'm going to say, before I turn and before I rack my brain for who would be up here, he says, \" Don't do it. No one's going to want to clean that mess up.\" He walks over to the ledge beside me, face hidden beneath dark hair. He looks down, studying the fall. \"And from here, you'd probably land in front of the door way, maybe falling on someone.\" He looks at me, face completely serious. Also a face I didn't recognize. But despite the circumstances, I was about to crack up laughing. I moved away from the edge, \"So… you're new here?\" \" Yup, just moved in.\" He peels a strip of duck tape off of him as if for proof he'd been unpacking boxes. Then sits back down on the ledge, as if it were nothing, as if the fall were only a few feet. He pats the area next to him, but I hardly move. \"A second ago you were about to jump, and now you're too scared to go near the edge?\" He raises an eyebrow. So challenging him, I sit down. And we end up talking there, past midnight. \" By the way,\" He says, his feet dangling over the ledge. His sweatshirt draped around my shoulders, since it was so cold. \"my name's Emmett.\" \"Minneapolis?\" Russia is waving one of her hands in front of my face. I take me ear buds out and look back at her, trying to remember what just happened. \"The uh,… representative is here… we're supposed to go with him.\" \"Right…\" I say, and stand up. As we're walking down a long, damp hallway, finally clear of all those people, Emmett elbows my rib cage. \"How long do you think this will last?\" Oh so big bad Emmett has gone down in size since he realized WE ARE NEVER LEAVING THIS PLACE! \"Don't know…\" I sigh. Don't know… Well… I'd have to say that was quite good myself. (:: AAAANNNDDD (for mainly my fun and possibly your humor…) WILL REAVER AND KORY'S FUDE EVER END? WILL FAIBANKS EVER TALK? WHEN WILL RUSSIA HAVE HER NEXT DEMONIC STARE DOWN? AND WILL EMMETT AND MINEAPOLIS EVER FIND HOME? STAYED TUNED FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER IN ZOMBIE CHAINSAW MASSACRE, WERE YOU MAY OR MAY NOT GET ALL THESE ANSWERS… PROBABLY NOT. /1_/1 (=^ . =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 16] HIIIIIII! Thank you to mein Deutschland, my UK(thank you for all your Beautiful British Boy Bands with Bad hair), my Canadian-ay, my bust-a-move Brazil, my Le French, and Italian(ma-ma-mea) readers. It means a whole lot to me. Don't take my stereotypicalness the wrong way. Liebe you all. I never realized it until now, but it is who is there for you in the end. One thing about suicide is… at the last moment, there are two ways you can go. You can pull the trigger, or you can drop the gun. Either way, you're always thinking the same thing. You start thinking about everyone in your life. Every memory, every love every… I don't know. Just everything. And the weird part is, when you think there's absolutely no one left to miss you, that you are just a waste of space in this world, that very last second, you realize there's someone. But it's whether you decide to forget them, or overlook them or not. And when all is done and over, your death still has effect on people. The ones you never knew loved you, that neighbor who waves to you down the street, the sad, guy at the morgue that never had a family. Yeah, you affect them. What I'm getting at is, whether you die by fault or by your own decision, you die. And someone will be affected by that. And when you think about it that way, it hurts your heart. And this is all running through my mind while we walk down the musty hallway. Emmett's close by my side (as usual) and we're keeping our distance from the rest of the group. Of course, it didn't matter, because we weren't talking. I was so deprived of sleep and lost in my own world that I really couldn't form words of my own rather than waiting to be spoken to. It was pointless, I mean no one was talking really, except Reaver and Kory. Of course, they were arguing about some political crap that (at this point) didn't even matter. FINALLY. We came to a iron door. Whatever lay inside, must be pretty important. Not that you could be totally sure of that, though. This place seemed pretty much filled with false hopes. It was basically an office. A desk, computer, chairs, filing cabinets. But it didn't feel office-y. It had more of an end-of-the-world vibe to it. So not as welcoming as it should have been. \"Alright, I have paper work for you to fill out and then I'll put you on the waiting list for a dorm-\" \"A waiting list?\" Texas' voice, high with outrage. \"Yes, I don't believe I stuttered. Now if you will all fill out one of these,\" He hands me a packet with small text filling about four pages… front and back. \"We can get you all settled into a dorm sooner.\" \"Just one dorm? For all of us?\" Russia asks, her eyes wide behind glasses. \"Yes, we don't have enough to give you each your own. So on the front page, we need your first and last na-\" \"I'm out of here.\" Reaver says standing. \"Yup, me too.\" Texas agrees. \"As well am I.\" Fairbanks says quietly. I get up, too. No way was I going to sit in this place any longer than I had to. \"If you'll kindly show us the way out…\" Emmett says to the guy. \"I'm afraid I can't do that.\" He shakes his head. \"It is against our policy.\" \"Fine. We'll find our own way out.\" He reaches for the door handle, but it doesn't turn. He kicks the damn thing and it falls to the floor with a clunk , swinging open. We run down the hall with the creepy representative guy on our tails. It was like he had been brain washed or something. We turn the corner. And there, there was what we had been waiting for. Eleven other representatives stood in our way. Each wearing creepy smiles, their faces pretty much the same aside from their eye and hair colors. They were, as I suspected deep down, all clones. \"How the fu-\" \"No time!\" I cut Kory off leading the group in the opposite direction. No mistakes now. Not this time. \"Hault!\" A thick German accent says. \"What is it now?\" I groan, thinking it was Bavaria. But really, it was Selma. She was holding a cow prod. \"We can do this one of two ways. You can go back and wait for your dorm, or you can become zombie food.\" She swings the prod back and forth. \"Zombie…candy…\" I correct her quietly, awkwardly shifting backwards. And at that she throws the cow prod towards us, making a beautiful arch in the air towards Bavaria. Electricity flying, and at the last second, she turns and it hits a representative in the face. We jump back, and all of the clones fall limp to the ground, including ours. \"Wooooh!\" Reaver shouts shoving Selma aside as we follow him. What luck. And you'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, some psycho lady trying to kill you with a cow prod and her evil representative clones. But that's not it. Because that's that one thing about life: It just isn't fair. To a point where, even after all you've been through, karma can't just kick in yet, and let you jinx something like oh, maybe… Saying everyone will turn into zombies, leave, come back and find everyone has turned INTO ZOMBIES. Not fair. No, not fair. \"Ho-ly-shit.\" Kory says in some sort of weird southern accent. He was a mix between a jock and a redneck, and I just now noticed. \"That's my line dumb-fuck.\" Reaver shoves him over. Heh. \"Guys, guys, more important things!\" Texas says, as we gaze out upon our zombie friends munching on some sad not-so-surviving survivors. \"Let's just try getting out of here before they notice.\" Emmett suggests. So we start creeping along the wall until we get to the entrance of the building, and just down the hall was the elevator back up to the airport. We run down the hallway, seeing as it was empty. And then finally the elevator. Bipolar presses the button. \"Please enter code.\" A mechanical voice said through the elevator, than in various other languages. \"Shit uhm…\" Kory starts going at the number pad, while we waited. Then, this happened: \"Access denied.\" Guess who. \"Oh… sh-yit .\" Guess who. \"You dip-shit!\" And guess who. \" Stop fighting you dumbkoffs or I'll bite your fucking heads off.\" Me. Silence. Then an alarm. \"Way to go!\" Texas is now yelling at Kory. So I think we're all pretty angry at him by now, even Fairbanks. \"Kory. Get the code.\" Emmett hisses through his teeth. \"They're coming.\" Bavaria says. \"The whole hoard,\" Russia adds. Bipolar revs her chainsaw. I pull out ol' axe-y. \"Okay. Let's do this.\" Fairbanks actually speaks up. And then the first of them come. Tripping over each other, like one huge bloody mess. Some were already rotting, all though I'm pretty sure that started before they turned into zombies. Either way, they were gross. Most of their hands were reaching into thin air while they ran towards us. Their eyes were dead, most were missing body parts, and they were making a horrible stench in the room. \"I got it!\" Kory says as Bipolar has sawed off three heads. My axes chopped down quite a few zombies as well. \"Let's go then!\" Texas rushes him. \"He still has to call the elevator!\" Bavaria growls. And then there's the wooshing sound. And everything's in slow motion for a second as we rush onto the elevator. The doors start closing, as Kory is rapidly hitting the close button. And there are hands trying to pry it open, but in the end, the hands and other limbs fall to the floor. \"Well… that was close.\" Kory says. We all glare at him. Well… I hoped you enjoyed that one. Finally the have escaped the underground survival camp, but what will come next? FIND OUT ON ZOMBIE. CANDY. CHAINSAW MASSACRE! /1_/1 (=- . - =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 17] Hmmm… None surprisingly, the airport was absolutely deserted. This was becoming quite normal, in a way. Killing, silence, killing, yelling, arguing… killing. But none of this was what any of us expected… well except Emmett… and Kory… and probably Canada… But besides them, this wasn't exactly what we pictured as the end of the world. I always thought it would be like it had before we came here, buildings on fire, planes crashing everywhere, dead people… but then I met my first monster. And axe met with hand and monster go bye-bye. They chewed the wrong piece of candy. And it was amazing how lucky I was, that I had Emmett still… well anyone in our group. The fact that we were all still alive was unbelievable. But I didn't want to jinx that… \"Anyone have a plan yet?\" Charlotte actually talks, her voice sending a shiver up my spine. \"No.\" Emmett shakes his head. \"Bloop!\" Bipolar has obtained some sort of fish personality… I didn't quite understand that one. \"I've got nothing.\" Texas shrugs. And for once, Kory is silent. This worried me. \"To Australia then?\" I ask quietly. Everyone groans. \"No more flying!\" Reaver begs. \"No more crashing is more like it.\" Texas mumbles. \"You try it and say that.\" I point at her accusingly. She shrugs like it's nothing. \"Well… we're in Germany…\" Emmett starts. Bavaria seems to come into the conversation at this point. \"We could just have some fun…\" Emmett shrugs. \"Maybe we should just go to Australia.\" Bavaria interjects. \"We're just going to keep running and running…\" Russia shakes her head, frustrated. \"Maybe not.\" Bavaria says, but there's not a whole lot of sureness in her voice. \"Well somebody think of something!\" Kory bursts out. \"Why don't you think of something you flat assed llama!\" Reaver yells. What does that even mean? \"You almost got us killed!\" Emmett is out of his cool zone and raging. \"Killed? You're girlfriend almost got us killed!\" Texas' face is red. \"I'm not his girlfriend.\" I say flatly. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Emmett asks, offended. Oops. \"Wait, what?\" Reaver is about as confused as everyone else. \"Shut it squid face!\" Kory snaps. \"You shut it toe licker!\" \"Thank you.\" Kory smiles deviously. \" EW !\" Charlotte screeches. \"Gross, dude.\" I shake my head. \"Bloop!\" \"Buffalo, not the time.\" Russia says. And we all start arguing. \"Guys…\" \"Fuck you! I don't need this shit!\" Kory. \"Watch it!\" Me. \"I thought we had something special!\" Emmett. Desperate. \"Let's just get out of this country!\" Bavaria. \"Guys…\" Fairbanks. \"No, you're wrong!\" \"Don't tell me what's right and wrong!\" \"You just left me there!\" \" Left you there? I saved your fucking life! If I had just left you, you'd have jumped! But you know, maybe I shouldn't have stopped you!\" The whole room get's quiet. And all eyes are on Emmett. \"Guys!\" Fairbanks is pointing at something. The window, we look out. And in our argument, a crowd of tiny little dots had appeared. Scratch that, not dots, zombies. \"wunderbar.\" I sighed. And went towards the escalators, everyone following. \"Only one way out of this mess.\" I pull out my axe, going for an epic moment. \"Technically there are two…\" Bavaria ruins it. Thanks. \"Whatever.\" And I make my slow yet epic descent down the escalators. This wasn't what I had planned. My first trip back to Germany. Never expected it to turn into this: a drop into death. There were so many zombies down there, I honestly didn't know if we'd make it back. There was no turning back now… literally I had destroyed the other escalator when crashing the plane. \"Are you sure about this?\" Reaver asks, Charlotte clinging to him. \"Yes.\" I lie. No. \"Let's do this!\" Texas whoops. \"I will enjoy tearing them apart limb from limb.\" Okay, that's about the scariest damn thing that I've ever heard Russia say. \"Let's kill some zombies.\" I smile, pleased at my team's cooperation. And so the fighting began. And you know what? It lasted about ten minutes before all zombies were completely dead, motionless and unable to come back from the dead again. \"Well. That was a lot better than crashing another plane.\" I say pushing my hair out of my face. \"I preferred the plane.\" Bavaria glares at me. No one else talks but rather gasps for breathe. \"That was fun!\" Charlotte jumps up and down. Oh it's when you see those young kids so excited to chop a zombie apart that makes my day… \"No kidding.\" Texas breathes. \"What next?\" Kory asks. \"We go somewhere, do something, I don't know.\" Emmett shrugs. \"Why don't we go look for survivors?\" Russia suggests. We all look at her, obviously she hasn't just seen enough \"survivors\". \"Yeah, we need more members to our little zombie fighting club here.\" Texas shakes her head, hands on hips. \" Well. \" Bavaria says. \"Let's just do something!\" \"Okay, let's walk this way then.\" And our journey began, across the great parking lot of the airport. Long and perilous, we were growing scarce of food and water. By the time we reached the last gate, Kory was practically crawling on his hands and knees, one arm stretched out towards the light. \"I see it.\" His voice is raspy, dehydrated. \"See what?\" Texas asks, red hair glowing in the radiating sun. \"The light…\" \"You dumb-shit that's just a street light.\" Reaver kicks him in the kidney. \"Oh the pain.\" Kory flops over onto his back. \"Kory,\" Fairbanks smacks him, \"Get yo' ass up.\" We all laugh. \"Okay.\" He jumps up. And we begin to realize that the street light we have discovered, meant we had crossed the whole parking lot. Finally. \"Into the city we go!\" Emmett shouts victoriously. \"Keep it down.\" I shush him, laughing. I think we were all pretty delusional at this point. \"On word ho!\" Kory says. He misused the word. \"Mush!\" Reaver kicks him again. Kory howls. I couldn't stop laughing, my stomach hurt from it. \"Mush!\" It's Emmett this time, riding Kory. I had fallen to the ground laughing. \"Guys… stop that… be serious…\" Bavaria laughs. \"Bloop!\" We all laugh harder. \"This… isn't safe!\" Russia says in between giggles. \"This is perfectly safe!\" Emmett says his eyebrows arched. \"I gave him a muzzle see.\" And he wraps duck tape around Kory's mouth. Click click. Total silence now. We've all heard that sound way too many times not to recognize it. Slowly, and as one, we all turn around. \"Oh shit.\" Emmett says. Surprise! New character! But y'know if anyone wants to send in more character I would just love that. Really… it's okay. Seriously. And new readers from Belgium, I thank you for your Belgium waffles. And Australia… you guys have… well you guys are cool. JK Thank you all! Until next time… /1_/1 (=$ . $=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 18] Herrmmmm…. How would you guys feel about reading about your characters on actual paper? Three shadowed faces belonging to a skull attached to a body, hands holding weapons (shotgun, dual pistols and a rifle.) We stared back, knowing that they had the upper hand. One of them was obviously German (blue eyes, blonde hair and all,) one with brown eyes and short brown hair, and the third was black with deep brown eyes. All three were males. FUCK YEAH! \"Tropfen das waffe.\" We didn't move… mainly because no one had any clue what he said except for Bavaria who was slowly setting her hatchet down. \"Didn't you hear the man? Drop your weapons !\" The black guys yells. \"Gut,\" the German guy turns to the black guy, \"ist es sicher?\" \"Ja.\" \"Alright. You obviously don't belong here, so why are you trespassing on our territory?\" Oh, so the German guy speaks English. Could this get any more confusing? \"We were trying to get away from those crazy-assed National Disaster people.\" Emmett explains. The brown haired guy laughs. \"What?\" Emmett asks, an edge to his voice. \"We've been trying to stop them for weeks!\" The German guy says. \"Having that many people in one place cannot be healthy for anyone… or safe.\" The brown haired guy says with the slightest hint of French to his accent. \"Yeah, they're zombies now.\" Kory huffs. The German's face goes pure white and his eyes kind of bulge, then go back to the cool, calm features from before. \"Them bitches deserved it.\" The black guy says… he was definitely from America. \"Come with us,\" The German guy says, his voice is different from before, but I can't really tell how. My friends look at me for confirmation. I shrug, thinking what's the worst that could happen… then I remember exactly what could happen. They're secret hide out ended up being a shed in the back of the German guy's grandparent's house. Which, in this scenario, you'd think they'd find a waaaay cooler place to chill. But whatever. \"Our crib,\" The black guy gestures his hand over a bunch of screens and other electronic stuff. A lot like Kory's place, actually. \"Sick stuff, dude.\" Kory says, getting a closer look at some of their stuff. \"Ay!\" The black guys smacks Kory's hand with his gun. \"Sorry,\" Kory sighs. I sit on an old couch next to Emmett, and he throws his arm around my shoulders comfortably. \"So, you guys' have names?\" Emmett asks. \"I'm Hugo,\" The French guy introduces himself, \"This is Darious and Neap.\" Darious = black guy, Neap = German. Got it. \"I'm Minneapolis, this is Emmett, Fairbanks, Texas, Russia, Reaver, Charlotte, Bavaria, Bipolar and Bavaria.\" I say, tiredly. \"Anyways, this is twenty times better than the last place.\" Kory sighs. \"Like I said, there's no way it's safe to put that many people in one place.\" Hugo yawns. Neap's face is shadowed, but I can tell he's thinking something. Grieving. He stalks back outside and I follow him into the cool night. \"Who was it?\" I ask him. I had followed him into a heavily wooded area, going against my fears. He wouldn't hurt me… yet. He turns, slightly surprised and then his face is calm again. \"A friend,\" Is the only answer I get. Well that's helpful. I'm about to give up when he adds, \"Her name was Lilly.\" And so I learned the story of Lilly, which was quite similar to Emmett's and mine. It almost hurt to hear it be told by a different voice with a different perspective. Emmett and I had never really talked about it… \"Let's go back.\" I say to Neap, \"It's getting really cold out here.\" And he almost smiles as we turn and head back to the garage, where I returned to my precious Emmett and tuned into the conversation between Kory, Reaver and Hugo. \"If Steve Jobs were still alive, he would have found a cure.\" –Reaver. \"Jobs isn't even related to the infection, dip shit.\" –Kory. \"Obviously Edward Jenner would have.\" –Hugo. \"All you crack-as are gay.\" –Darious. \"Whatever man.\" –Kory. Kory waves this away and sits on a nearby crate. The room loses its feeling of tension. \"I missed something.\" I yawn. \"A lot, actually.\" Emmett says, pulling me into him. I rest my head on his shoulder. \"Need… sleep…\" \"Then sleep.\" Emmett half whispers. \"I can't.\" I argue. I was keeping everything as sane as possible, not enough time for sleep. \"I'll watch, you sleep.\" He demands. And so I do… I wake up in the same room, just in a different place. I was now lying on the floor of the garage, but on multiple blankets and pillows. There's a weight on my side and I turn to see Emmett sleeping on the job. Or… laying on the job. \"Hi.\" He smiles, his face lit by a blue glow. \"Where is everyone?\" I ask, still tired. He points, and on the other side of the garage everyone else is fast asleep, including Darious, Neap and Hugo… way to go Emmett! \"You puff out your cheeks when you sleep.\" He smiles wider. \"What?\" \"You look like a hamster. It's cute.\" He laughs. I hit him with the pillow lightly, even though I would usually whack his ass off if I wasn't trying to be quiet. \"I think you've said something like that before.\" I shiver, still cold. \"C'mere.\" He pulls me back to him. \"Go to sleep.\" \"I'm okay.\" I yawn again. \"Please?\" I didn't know why he wanted it so badly, or what his (evil) intentions were, but now I was definitely not going back to sleep. \"No.\" I say, but starting to get more and more tired. He sighs, shutting his eyes for a minute, then opens them, and says something. But I don't hear it cause I'm already falling asleep again. \"What?\" I barely ask. He smiles and kisses my forehead. And then back to dreamland… I'm sorry it took so long. I really have been trying to get this up earlier. As usual, review, comment, whatever. Happy New Year and stuff. /1_/1 (=' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 19] Hi guys! Thank you for all of your support. Hello Iceland, Malaysia!:) Two days later we are ready to explore a little more. If we ever needed, we were welcome back with Hugo, Darious and Neap, but they weren't going to come with us. It was a good thing I hadn't gotten attached to any of them… I was already in fear I was getting quite comfortable with my own group. \"You have everything you need?\" Neap asked me, hauling the last crate of water onto the back of our newly acquired truck. \"Yeah, thanks.\" I smile, hooking the orange bungee cord around itself. He nods. \"I'm gonna miss you white folk up'n here messin with all my stuff!\" Darious cries, hugging me. I shove him away awkwardly. \"Yeah, come back anytime.\" Hugo smiles. \"Right.\" Bavaria says opening the truck door. \"I call shot gun.\" Kory yells. \"Over my dead body, butt-face.\" Reaver shoves him. \" Mature ,\" Russia mumbles. Kory shoves Reaver back, and they fall to the ground, throwing punches. \"Someone's going to lose an arm someday.\" Texas comments, observing them. \"What can you do?\" Fairbanks shrugs. I stop watching them and turn back to the guys. \" Anything else we can do?\" Neap asks. \"No,\" I shake my head. \"It's been fun, though.\" I had never practiced goodbyes. \"You have all our numbers. Call us if you need… see you around.\" Neap gives me one last hug, and something happens. I notice something different about him. When he pulls back, I can see something in his eyes… \"We should get going.\" Emmett sneaks up behind me, his arm snaking around my waist. \"Yeah,\" I breathe and turn and wave as we walk to the other car. A nice little viper. Oh how Ich liebe das auto. \"Let's roll, babe.\" I kiss Emmett and start up the engine, skidding out of the driveway, onto the highway. \"I'm bored.\" I whine after two hours of speeding, and we were almost on an empty tank. \"Let's stop somewhere, then.\" Emmett shrugs. \"Fine,\" I pull into what appears to be a theme park of some kind. \"What's this?\" Emmett asks, taking a pair of sunglasses off he had found at a gas station awhile back. \"I don't know,\" I stop the car and get out, taking in the view of this place. I read a sign, Phantasialand. \"Well, what are we doing here?\" He asks. \"I was going to see if they had directions to the nearest zombie horde. What do you think we're doing here? I ask. He glares at me. \"Let's go.\" We wait leaning on the car for sometime while we keep our eyes out for the others. Finally a blue Silverado and green Charger pull in. We wave them over, which was unnecessary seeing as we were the only car in the parking lot. \"WOOT!\" Bipolar screams jumping out of the Charger before it even stops. \"Can we switch cars after this?\" Kory asks me, pushing Reaver aside. Reaver decks him. \"It would be nice to have a little change, if that isn't too much trouble.\" Reaver adds as Kory falls to the ground. \"Leave him,\" Texas nudges him with her foot, than looks toward the sun, shielding her eyes with one hand. \"His tan was growing weak anyways.\" I shrug, they had to deal with themselves right now. I didn't feel like babysitting today. We got lucky, Brühl had been evacuated as well as our city had been, so there were no stragglers in the theme park. We wandered through, it was an odd place. With a few rides, and a lot like Disneyworld. But it was nice to just walk around and take in the cool, late autumn air of Brühl. \"You alright?\" Emmett asks me as we walk alone down one path leading away from the center of the park. \"Fine.\" I sigh. \"You miss home…\" He pulled me over to another ride, a Ferris wheel… how cliché. \"I do.\" I say, sliding into one of the seats. \"One second,\" he kisses me then turns to the control panel. He presses a few buttons, his face lit by the glowing fake-town around us. He came back to the cart. \"My legs ache.\" It was true, walking like we had… ouch. \"Are you tired?\" He asks, resting his arm around me. \"Yeaup.\" I hear something in the distance, the air stiffens… something wasn't right. \"Did you hear that?\" I ask Emmett. His eyes are half closed, and we were now at the top of the wheel. \"No…\" He yawns. \"Emmett, I'm serious. Get up.\" I shove him. \"What… what?\" He asks, looking down. \"There,\" he points. I look and see it. More zombies… wooh. \"Okay… get us down from here.\" I say shakily. I feel Emmett's muscles tense. \"Oh… see… I don't know how to get us down any faster than we're going.\" He says slowly. \"Oh, my god. Okay here.\" I push past him to the door. \"What're you…\" \"Grab my hand.\" He stares at me. I unlatch the door. \"Take it.\" I urge. The others were in danger, there wasn't time. \"No.\" He shakes his head. \"I won't let you, it's too dangerous.\" UGGH EMMETT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT? \"Fine.\" I hop down onto one of the moving bars and brace myself against it. \"Are you crazy?\" Emmett yells down at me. I think about that. \"Yes!\" I leap across to another bar, and hang there. Then I pull myself up. Almost there. \"Be careful!\" He scolds me. I swing over to another bar, than wait… wait… drop down and land on my feet onto the last bar. Look at me, I'm a cat. \"Come on!\" I yell up to Emmett. \"No!\" \"Emmett just-\" My foot slips, I lose my balance, and I feel like I'm plummeting down through the air before my hand catches a bar. Phew. \"Jesus Christ! I thought you were dead for sure!\" He yells. Thanks. I twist and drop onto the ground. Oh thank god. I turn, wave to Emmett, and run toward the horde. Axe in hand, as usual. One regular zombie horde later, and we're sitting quietly over funnel cake as a group. We didn't talk, we just sat around our make shift fire, and ate slowly. It was all pretty nice, until \"I saved your life. You should be thanking me.\" Kory says to Reaver. \"Go die in a hole.\" Reaver shakes his head. Kory raises his hand and forms it into a circle, then lowers it towards his crotch. \"Gladly,\" He smiles. \"You're a pig.\" I say through a mouthful of funnel cake. \"You're easy.\" \" Da faq ?\" Did I just hear that? \"Hey!\" Emmett gets up. Everyone else is silent. Except Reaver. \"I'll kill you!\" Reaver yells at Kory, who is on the other side of the fire. \"I'd like to see you try.\" Kory laughs. \"Good.\" Reaver bolts over the fire, and lunges toward Kory. Both go sailing into a corndog stand. There's a crash as the whole thing collapses. Then silence. I walk over, and look down. Three heads pop up. One: Reaver Two: Kory Three: Black hair, blue eyes, tan skin. \"Well… you found me. Here 'ya go.\" He hands me a stuffed bear. Redneck… Oh my god, it's the spawn of Reaver and Kory. \"My name's Jay.\" Everyone just stared at each other, I broke the silence. \" Another one?\" NEWZZZ CHARACTER! OK SEEYOOOUUUZZZZ! /1_/1 (=P.P=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 20] Hi peeps! Is that the term they're using these days? \"Peeps?\" I need to pay attention to the latest gossip… don't I? Menu of Today's Complaints: For starters, we have a lovely pair of frozen hands, complete with dry, itchy skin. For the main course, they have prepared a nice trio of redneck/Canadian idiots who fight constantly. And with a side of zombie hordes every few minutes. Then for desert, there's babysitting ten hormone filled, uncontrollable, and socially in need of help teenagers, all bared with weapons that have all ready killed hundreds of zombies! And maybe if you're lucky you'll get some after dinner coffee to warm your insides… which are currently freezing to death. Can you tell it's been a long day? \"Hey.\" Nudge. \"Hey.\" Shake. \"Hey.\" \"WHAT DO YOU WANT ?\" I hiss at Kory. He cowers, and I sigh. \"Sorry,\" I breathe. \"It's okay. You're not that scary.\" Jerk. I ignore him. \"So what do you want?\" I ask. \"I was wondering how many bags of frozen hamburgers we had left.\" Kory explains. \"Why does it matter?\" I ask him, rubbing my hands together for warmth. He shrugs, \"I was thinking about cooking some of them in a little while… if they ever get back with the fire wood.\" He jerks his head in the general direction that Reaver and Emmett had gone about two hours ago into the woods. \"I hope they didn't get eaten by wolves.\" Jay raises his eyebrows. \"Well… darn shame if they did.\" He adds. ****If you get that joke then I hope you are laughing your ass of right now**** I shiver, from the thought of them being eaten alive, and the cold. \"We'll wait another hour for them… if not, we'll send a search party… I'm pretty sure that one talks to wolves.\" Kory's looking at Bipolar. True 'dat. \"Are you keeping a list of what's been eaten, what hasn't?\" Texas asks Kory, walking over. Kory looks up, \"Yeah, make sure the others know you're not supposed to eat anything without talking to me first.\" He jabs a thumb into his chest. \"Right…\" Texas walks back over to where the other girls are huddled… geez I'm an outcast even when the world is ending. \"Got any squirrel meat?\" Jay asks. \"Excuse me?\" I ask. \"You ain't ever had squirrel meat? Aw, you haven't lived a day in your life.\" Jay shakes his head, disappointed. \"Sorry,\" \"One time, my friend Pete, he tried to jump off a roof into a garbage can and-\" \"They're back.\" Kory cuts Jay off. \"Oh, good. They aren't wolf food.\" I get up from the log I was sitting on. \"That's all right I'll tell you another time.\" Jay mumbles. \"Got wood people!\" Emmett raises to branches above his head. No one laughs. \"Took you long enough.\" I glare at him. \"Sorry,\" He hugs me, \"I will warm you with the power of my hugging!\" I push him away, \"No, you will warm all of us with the magic of fire. Go.\" I point at the meek pile of fire wood that somehow took them three hours to collect. \"Okay,\" He kisses my cheek and returns to the task at hand. \"Anyone else notice… that it's cold.\" Reaver asks, attempting to make a neat stack of branches. He didn't succeed. \"That's what normally happens in winter.\" I sigh. \"Nuh-uh!\" Texas says, the other girls following her to circle the soon-to-be fire. \"Yeah, unless you've only experienced summer.\" Fairbanks argues. Did she just… talk? \"It's never this cold.\" Texas shakes her head in disbelief. That's when we all realized, Texas lived in Texas. \"Okay… so who here has not experienced winter before?\" I ask. Jay, Texas and Kory raise their hands. \"If it's only twenty degrees now… Oh, boy.\" Emmett winces. \"It gets worse?\" Texas' mouth hangs wide open. \"Much.\" Russia answers her. Kory groans. Texas crosses her arms. And Jay is quiet… I'm starting to like this kid. \"Get used to it.\" Emmett nods. \"Wait 'til it snows!\" I clasp my hands together and waddle excitedly. This would be great. \"What.\" \"Fire, chop, chop. Move it.\" I kick Emmett. Him and Reaver finally get the fire going… with a little pyrotechnic explosion-y help from Jay… \"So tomorrow… we find some warmer clothes, yes?\" Russia asks. \"Yeah, that sounds good.\" Kory nods. \"And maybe… shelter.\" Bavaria adds. \"Also a good idea.\" Reaver says, \"Maybe even a better one.\" He looks at Kory, knowing this would trigger something… anything. \"Whatever…\" And for a second it seems like Kory's going to pass up a fight when, \"Clothes are more important.\" \"Are not.\" \"Are, too.\" \"Prove it.\" Reaver raises an eye brow. \"Oh, how about deer meat?\" Jay lights up, I don't think he was aware of the argument brewing in front of him… \"No.\" Kory and Reaver say at the same time, then glare at each other again. \"Guys, not around the fire.\" I shoo them away. \"Yeah, not around the fire, Kory.\" Reaver sits back down. It's becoming clear that Reaver is the smarter of the two. \"You get back up you coward!\" Kory's face starts to burn bright red. \"Those sound like fighting words to me.\" Reaver observes, calmly. \"They were!\" Kory bursts. Reaver was totally doing this on purpose. \"The lady said not to fight around the fire, so I'm not going to fight around the fire. Now please, sit back down.\" \"Thanks, Reaver.\" I smile. \"Don't mention it.\" He smiles back. Kory was still looming over him. \"What?\" \"Get up and fight.\" Kory growls. \"We've been over this.\" Reaver waves him away. \"Fine.\" Kory actually sits down. WOAH. \"So continuing with whatever we were talking about…\" Bavaria changes subjects. \"Plans for tomorrow,\" Charlotte reminds her, quietly. \"Right. Anyone know where the nearest mall is?\" \"The mall ?\" Kory, Reaver, Emmett and Jay all asked at pretty much the exact same time. \"Yes, dumb-nuts, the mall.\" Texas glares at them. They all groan in sync. Well at least the agree on something. The sun had finally set, and it was increasingly cold outside. Nowhere to sleep tonight but under the stars. \"Well… I'm going to go to bed if we're waking up early.\" Emmett says, rolling onto his side, reading my thoughts. \"Right on.\" Bavaria agrees. A few others lay down, away from the fire. I shiver. \"Goodnight.\" Emmett says, hugging me. \"Night.\" I sigh. That was a REALLY boring chapter… I know, I'm truly sorry. But I will write soon… Until then… /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 21] I am SO sorry. I know it's been forever… It was early, too early for whatever day of the week it was. We drove down the highway in silence. The truck rattled as we went along the gravel road. It was clear everyone was exhausted, because it was dead silent. I sighed, looking away from the window to Reaver, who was driving. It was him, Emmett, Kory, and Jay in this one van. And if Reaver and Kory were within a mile of each other and there was no fighting, something really was the matter. \"Hey,\" Emmett said in the backseat. \"Take the next right.\" He says looking at his map he picked up at a gas station a few miles back. \"Okay, thanks.\" Reaver huffed. What was up with these guys? \"Can we stop for food soon?\" Kory asks. \"Sure.\" Reaver says. My jaw dropped. \"Wake me up when we get there.\" Jay yawned. I turned around to look at them, no one was killing eachother… yet. One hour later we pulled into the parking lot of the mall. It wasn't huge or anything. But it was something. I could already see what appeared to be a sporting goods store. We could get warm clothes there. \"Hey… Minneapolis?\" Fairbanks asked hesitantly, coming out of the front of the store as I was walking in. They had gotten there first. \"Yes?\" I ask, axe in hand. \"Uhm… I don't think swimming suits are going to save us from the cold…\" \"What?\" I ask, pushing past her. The store wasn't as I expected. I was dumb and didn't think about. The store wasn't ready for winter, but just ending summer. Since the stores here must've been shutting down in the middle of September. \"No…\" I hissed, scanning the racks for any signs of warm clothes. \"We're so screwed.\" Kory sighed. \"Shit, man…\" Emmett sighed. This mall was our only hope. \"Okay, okay. Normally stores get ready for seasons early, right? I'm sure one of these have winter stuff.\" Texas reasoned. \"Okay, split up. We'll all take different sides of the mall. Russia, Texas and Kory, go to the East side. Fairbanks, Emmett and Bavaria take the West side. Bipolar and Reaver, come with me We'll take the North and South sides… Hey, where's Jay?\" I ask, realizing we were missing one. Everyone shared nervous glances. \"Oh! I know.\" Kory speaks up. How reassuring. \"We forget to wake him up. He's still in the car.\" Kory has a moment of pride, then realize this is a bad thing. \"Oh.\" \"Okay, you go get Kory.\" I (reluctantly) toss him the keys. \"Fine.\" He turns and walks off his own way. \"Bipolar go with Texas and Russia, I think Reaver and I can manage.\" \"What?\" He asks confused. \"Pay attention.\" I sigh, and start walking toward the South side of the mall. Somewhere in the middle of the parking lot… \"God, it's cold out here.\" Kory says to himself. The parking lot is quiet, minus his complaining. He continues to walk until he reaches the truck. He wipes the frost off the window with his hand and looks inside. Jay was still sleeping, he never even realized the group had left him. Kory unlocked the truck and opened the door. \"Wake up.\" He shoved Jay off the back seat. \"Hey!\" Jay shouted, waking up, mid fall. \"Come on, the others are already inside.\" Kory pulled Jay out of the car, and the two began their long trek across the parking lot… Near the southern end of the mall… \"Do you really think there's a store with what we're looking for?\" Reaver was the first to break the silence. I sighed. Thinking about that. \"It's worth looking for.\" Is all I say, tightening my grip around the axe. We walk quietly through the entrance of a clothing store. If anything we could restock on food. I'm wandering around the shoes when Reaver catches up with me again. \"Y'know something?\" \"What?\" I ask, trying to see if they had any boots. \"I don't think you're as strong as you act sometimes.\" He picks up a box of hiking boots and shoved them under his arm. I grunted in response. \"I mean it. Not in a bad way, though. Sometimes you just try to be strong for everyone else. Cause obviously you're the leader here, but you try really hard. I don't know. I think you should take a break for a while.\" He grabs a bag from behind the counter and shoves the box in it. \"What are you getting at, Reaver?\" I look up at him, one eyebrow raised. \"Let me take charge. Just for a little bit. Please?\" \"Why do you want to be leader? It's a lot of pressure, and a lot of work.\" I sigh, finally finding a pair of boots with fur on the inside. I grabbed a bag as well and shoved them in it. \"I like to be in control of things.\" He shrugs. \"And to give you a break.\" \"How do I know I can trust you. I mean, no offense. But I'm letting a lot of lives be trusted in your hands.\" I start looking for something else, a coat possibly. \"I don' t know. Really, I can't think of anything. But you can. Please?\" He asks again. I give up on the whole coat business and grab a relevantly warm looking sweatshirt. I think about what he's saying. I'll finally get to rest and kick back. I could still be in charge of Reaver… It could work that way. What could go wrong? \"Okay.\" I say. Reaver smiles, and we leave the store. Back in the parking lot… A large horde of zombies were chasing Kory and Jay as they made their way to safety inside the mall. They ran and ran. Finally they made it into the doors of a department store connected to the mall. They locked the door and searched for items to defend themselves. Half an hour later… Kory and Jay are twelve feet from the door, staring at the crowd of zombies pounding on the glass. Jay was sitting on a plastic tricycle, flame thrower in hand. Kory was armed with a baseball bat and a hockey mask. Remote control cars were lined up with explosives, and Kory had rewired them so they were all controlled by one remote. He held the remote in his hands and took a deep breahe. \"Ready?\" He asked. \"Ready.\" Jay answered. Kory shot the lock open, and the horde entered. To be continued…. MUAHAHAHAHA:D[Chapter 22] 2,000! Countries I have never even heard of are reading this… wowzers. Hey!:) If you're unhappy with the story, please, LET ME KNOW. \"You… You are both idiots.\" I sigh, wrapping gauze around one of Jay's cuts… caused by Kory, of course. He winced a little as a slapped tape on it. \"No, he's the idiot.\" Kory says. \"Dip shit.\" Reaver mumbles. \"Fuck wad.\" Kory sneers. \"Yarn suckers.\" Jay glares at them both. He received confused glances. \"Stop fighting.\" Russia sighs, unwrapping a candy bar. We were sitting in the middle of a gas station, surrounded by snack foods and various things no one needed. Or you didn't think you needed, until you face a zombie apocalypse \"Okay, you should be good now.\" I smile, putting away the medical gear I picked up at the mall before this all happened. \"Good?\" Jay asks, glancing at the gauze. \"You won't lose your arm or bleed to death or anything.\" I clean up the little shards of glass I pulled out of his skin. Those poor idiots. \"We need to get going soon.\" Reaver says, checking the clock on the wall. I held my tongue, as much as I'd like to disagree with him. \"Why?\" Kory asks. He was still very unhappy about Reaver becoming leader. \"Because, it's not good to stay in one place for too long. You could get attached.\" Reaver sighs. \"What's so wrong with getting attached?\" \"When you get attached, it's harder to lose.\" There's this look in Reaver's eye, and I see it in Charlotte's, too. \"What if you lost one of us?\" Texas sniffs. I cringe. \"I'm not attached to any of you.\" He lifted his back pack over his shoulder and grabbed his gun that was lying on a chair. He began to walk out of the station, when he adds, \"Let's move.\" We were packed and moved out of there in under fifteen minutes. I was once again shoved into the van with the guys. I never really understood though, why they could hate eachother so much and still choose to ride in the same car. \"I think Minneapolis should be leader again, I like her more.\" Kory has not gotten off this since we rescued them from the store back at the mall. \"No.\" I yawn. \"Fine.\" Kory says. It's surprisingly quiet for the next few minutes. I close my eyes, relieved of having to drive anyone for a while. It's been nice, not having to take care of everyone every second. The there's a crash. It all kind of goes in slow motion, the car comes to a dead stop, there's a ripping sound, and then a breaking sound. I realize those were the noises of a seatbelt and the windshield. I think Reaver is swearing. And then the whole world dissolves. I'm being dragged across a cemetery. This is the first thing I realize when I come to. And immediately I believe I'm dead, because this was what I imagine would be the groups' sad attempt at burying me. But something about this was a little off… Oh yeah, I was alive. \"Oh!\" Texas looks at me. She and Fairbanks stop dragging me. \"Thank you.\" I brush myself off and stand up. \"Where's Emmett?\" \"It's interesting how you're not worried about Kory and Reaver and Jay as well.\" Texas smirks. \"I am.\" I look behind me at the truck. It sat there., smoking, it's windshields destroyed. Four bodies lay next to it. \"Holly cow!\" I run over to them. There were shards of glass everywhere. Reaver had gone straight out the windshield, as I had. \"We pulled Kory, Emmett and Jay out of there.\" Russia explains. Now I saw that they were moving slightly, breathing slowly. Except Reaver. \"What's wrong with them?\" I ask. Though the answer was right in front of me. \"Kory passed out, Emmett messed his arm up and Jay's just sitting there, I don't know why.\" Bavaria explains. I looked at them… someone was ,missing… \"Where's Charlotte?\" I panic. \"She's over there.\" Texas pointed at a graveyard on the side of the road. I couldn't see Charlotte through the mist, but I trust that she was there. \"Go take care of her, I'll help these guys.\" I examine one of Reaver's wounds. There was a long gash from his forehead to his cheek bone. I went to the truck to grab my back pack full of medical supplies. It was deathly silent, the fog had set in pretty thick. I took out some rubbing alcohol and prayed it wouldn't scar. \"I'm sorry.\" I whisper to the motionless (minus his breathing of course) Reaver. Then I glance back at Jay, Kory and Emmett. I think Jay was sleeping. I finish with the gash and check for more injuries, but find none. Then, walk over to Emmett. \"You okay?\" I ask. I touch his arm and he winces in pain. \"Just fine,\" He says somewhat sarcastically. I look through my bag for something to prop his arm up with. \"How about you?\" \"Okay.\" I do the best I can to make a cast out of gauze, which sadly was the only real medical supplies we had. \"You don't look okay.\" Emmett raises an eyebrow. \" Thanks .\" \"No, I mean,\" He laughs, \"I mean look at your leg.\" \"Huh?\" I look, there are tiny little pieces of glass stuck to/in it… Then one large shard of glass protruding from my calf. How did I miss that? The pain finally catches up with me, and I cringe. Then try to ignore it and finish with Emmett's arm. \"Here,\" Emmett brushes the stray glass on my leg, then grabs a tweezers out of my bag and starts picking out the small ones emerging from my skin. I close my eyes once the blood starts streaming down my leg… \"Take these,\" I open my eyes again and Emmett's handing me a bottle of pain relievers. \"Thanks,\" I dry swallow them and close my eyes again. I want to scream every time I hear the small clink, clink of glass hitting the pavement. Then it stops. I open my eyes again, and Emmett is carefully studying the last and biggest piece of glass. \"This… might hurt… slightly.\" Emmett sighs. I'm about to ask him why when there's an agonizing pain in my calf. And a blood curdling scream is escaping my mouth. \"I'm sorry.\" Emmett throws the shard of glass, but he looks more amused than sorry. \"What the hell was that? Jay is walking over to us. He sees the blood gushing from my leg and nods in understanding. I think I may have woke everyone up, because even Reaver was walking over, startled. Emmett starts working on the wound and I think I'm going to pass out. \"You idiot!\" Reaver yells at Emmett. \"You don't just rip glass out of someone's skin. That just makes it worse.\" \"I didn't see you doing anything to help.\" Kory's now here, and a fight is more than obviously brewing. \"I didn't see you doing anything, either.\" Jay steps in. \"Would you all just shut up?\" Emmett asks impatiently. \"You shut up!\" They all yell at once. Then the three start to kill each other. Pfft. Guys. I see something coming from the fog, and it's Texas, her face seems a little panicked. \"What's wrong?\" I ask her, starting to get up, but then realize I can't. Emmett shakes his head and sighs. \"We can't find Charlotte.\" Texas' face is one of sheer horror. \"What?\" Reaver stops fighting for a second and looks at her. \"We-When we went back to talk to her, she was sitting on top of a head stone. Then we thought we saw one of you guys, so we went to go get you, but there wasn't anyone there. So we went back, but when we got there, Charlotte was gone.\" \"Gone? What do you mean gone?\" Reaver is very unhappy about this. \"Vanished. Poof. No sign of her, whatsoever. This place gives me the creeps, let's find her and get out.\" *ahem* WILL MINNEAPOLIS EVER BE ABLE TO WALK AGAIN? WILL THE GUYS EVER COME TO AN AGREEMENT? WHAT WILL THEY DO WITHOUT A THIRD CAR? ARE THERE OTHER UNDEAD CREATURES OUT THERE OTHER THAN ZOMBIES? WILL THE GROUP EVER FIND CHARLOTTE? FIND OUT NEXT TIME ON ZOMBIE! CANDY! CHAINSAW MASSACRE![Chapter 23] S'up people! :D I really don't have much to say… Reaver's mouth hung open wide as everything started to sink in. Charlotte had just vanished into thin air, with no trace at all. Paralyzed for only a second, Reaver looks for something to say. \"You lost my little sister?\" There was no emotion behind it, just a hesitant silence that followed. \"I… I didn't lose her…\" Texas says in a small voice. \"Move.\" Reaver pushes past her, walking towards the cemetery. \"I'm sorry.\" She calls, and you can see the slight shake of his head as he disappears into the fog. I sigh, and limp in the general direction he had gone. An uneasy task thanks to the thickness of the air. When I do find him, we walk in silence. \"What do you think happened to her?\" I ask him. \"I… don't know. I don't want to know… I just want her to be safe.\" His fists are clenched, jaw tight. I felt bad for him, worse for Charlotte. \"Where do you want to start looking?\" My head is starting to hurt. \"Anywhere… I don't care.\" A weak leader is one that makes irrational decisions based on emotions. We continue to walk until we here muffled voices. \"What was that?\" I ask, startled. \"Huh?\" Reaver down at me, obviously not listening. \"I heard something… someone.\" I whisper. Something flashes in his eyes, and he's grabbing his crossbow. I glare at him for making so much noise in doing so, and I crouched behind a headstone. \"You don't suppose—\" \"Shh!\" I hiss. \"Vat do you vant me ta do Vith da girl, boss?\" The voices get louder as they come closer. This one was a bit Norwegian. \"I don't care! And be quiet! They could be anywhere, looking for her.\" Another voice, the boss. \"I'll leave 'er 'ere den.\" The Norwegian voice answers. They voices grow softer as they argue about a shortage on food. I pop up from behind the grave, but Reaver pulls me back down. \"What?\" I growl. \"Let me go first, it could be dangerous.\" He insists, and crawls out from behind the stone. I roll my eyes. I wait, somewhat worried when he doesn't return for fifteen minutes. Then, as I'm resting against the stone a head pops out of nowhere. \"It's safe!\" He says joyfully. \"You scared me.\" I say flatly. \"Good.\" I follow him towards a building, probably for the people who water the flowers in the spring. It's eerily quiet. And now with the danger of others survivors, we have to keep out for more than one enemy. \"Where is she?\" I ask. He doesn't answer, but starts peeking into random rooms. We try about four until we reach one with a sign saying Manager . Reaver tried the door knob. \"Locked,\" He states, looking around. \"Give me one of your hair pins.\" He instructs, studying the lock. I have to think about what he's asking. Through everything, I've managed to completely forget about what a hair pin even is. \"Okay,\" I pull one of the few left in my hair out and hand it to him. He tries the lock again. It takes him a while, but finally the knob turns and there's a click. \"Charlotte?\" Reaver asks softly, checking around the room. There, on top of a shelving unit, tied up, was Charlotte. Her eyes were wide. And they shifted over to the other side of the room. Our gazes slowly followed, and saw why she was so afraid. \"Oh dear lord.\" I sigh, grabbing my axe. One big ass, steroid infused zombies slowly turned around, one arm broken. He let out some sort of groan. Reaver readied the crossbow. Aiming right for his head, the zombie's right eye disappears in a flash. \"He's still standing.\" I breathe, amazed. \"Not for long.\" Reaver says, determined. He grabs a machete out from the inside of his coat, and rushes toward the zombie, slashing the arm that wasn't broken. The zombie flings his arm toward him. Reaver falls backward, clutching his side. \"Damn, that's one strong zombie.\" He gasps. I carefully beeline for the giant zombie, strike him with the axe, and dodge an arm as it flies toward me. And for a few minutes I'm in, out, in, out. Until finally the zombie falls. I pull Charlotte down from the cabinet, and rush over to Reaver. He's breathing in short gasps, face contorted, laying awkwardly on the floor. \"How bad is it?\" I ask, kneeling beside him. \"I'll live.\" Is all he says. \"Is he going to be okay?\" Charlotte asks me. I nod, sighing again. The amount in which I sigh has greatly increased since this all started. \"Can you stand up?\" I look toward the door, suddenly remembering the Norwegian and his boss. \"Probably, we need to get out of here.\" He rolls onto his other side, and makes his way onto his feet. We find our way out of the building, and try to figure out where we had come from. As we navigate our way through the fog, we hear voices. \"She's gone, boss!\" The Norwegian. \"What do you mean gone? The zombie get her?\" The boss asks, clearly annoyed. We quicken our pace. \"No, I mean she's not 'ere!\" \"What?\" The Boss yells. We're nearly running, or there's me who is limping/skipping. \"Those bloody thieves! When I get my hands on—\" And we're at a full sprint, running and jumping past graves stones. Finally we meet the road again. And run in the direction of the truck. \"Get in the car.\" Reaver yells, shoving everyone into the two vehicles still working. I quickly made a count… we were all here. \"What? What happened?\" Fairbanks looks scared. Jay starts to pull out his sword, but I quickly tell him there's no need. \"We just need to run.\" I tell him. I explain it to Emmett what's happening, he nods and pushed half the group into one of the car while reaver and I take the other. Somehow I get stuck in the driver's seat. \"Drive!\" He yells, jumping in. I fiddle with the keys, the stick, everything. I had never driven anything but that motorcycle and the plane. \"Go!\" He urges me. I shove the stick into drives and hit the gas pedal. Then immediately break. A large figure stands in front of the truck. \"You kids are screwed. \" So suspenseful, I know. Hope you enjoyed… until next time… /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 24] JESSIE HANSEN I LOVE YOU! Sorry it has been so long… uhm… new character today!:D I sat, holding my breathing, staring. The truck was silent. We were all statues. \"You're not going anywhere. Not alive at least.\" The boss licked his lips. Shot gun in hand. But then I remembered our situation. Okay, let's do some simple mathematics. Two cars… Approximately twelve young adults versus a Norwegian and what appeared to be a fat Italian holding a gun. Now it might just be me, but it looks like we could win this one. \"Move out of my way, butt-tard!\" I yell out the window. Reaver shoots me a look. Seriously am I the only one seeing our chances of beating them? Before he could even answer, in fear of him shooting me through the windshield, I hit the gas and we rushed forward. I never saw if he got out of the way in time or not… We drove awhile, with the other car right behind us. It was silent, still. I think everyone was just a little freaked out. Then Russia spoke up. \"Where are we going?\" She asks, peering out the window. \"I'm… not really sure.\" I say, slowing down. I didn't want to drive anymore. \"We'll get out for a bit, walk around, then Reaver,\" I turn to him, \"You can drive.\" I stop the truck and we get out, stretching our legs. It was just a small dirt road, I wasn't even sure where we were anymore. There was only farmland in all directions. \"Hey do you guys see that?\" Bavaria says, squinting to see something in the distance. \"No.\" Texas looks as well. \"I see it.\" Fairbanks says, quietly. \"I think it's a farmhouse.\" Bavaria adds. \"We should go see if they have food.\" Jay says. After a few minutes, we get back into the vehicles and head off in the direction of the house. To put it simply, the house was huge. At least from the outside. But this only made things more complicated. The bigger the building, usually the more zombies inside. We all stare at the door, waiting for someone to be brave enough to open it. Without hesitating, Jay walks inside. Careless to whomever or whatever lived or did not live inside. \"Jay!\" I hiss. He turns around, \"What?\" \"Be careful!\" He shrugs, and goes inside anyways. We follow him. \"Holy shit!\" I hear him yell as I creep around the corner. \"What?\" I panic. He starts laughing. There's nothing there. I jab him in his rib cage with the back of my axe. \"Ow.\" He says, and I can't tell if it's sarcastic or not. Emmett comes behind me and pushes me forward into the living room. There's a short silence, then we break off into groups. Me, Russia and Bipolar go up a stair case into a third, then second level. Russia scans the ceiling of the third level hallway, she grabs a latch. \"I think this leads up to an attic…\" Russia observes it. \"Hey!\" I jump to the noise in all of the silence. We all turn and see Jay at the other end of the hall. \"Come 'ere. We found someth'n.\" We follow him down the stairs into a living room where Bavaria and Fairbanks were standing awkwardly. It was easy to see the room was decorated for country living. Old, blue couch, wooden rocking chair. Coffee table with a white lace cover and a wood fire. But it wasn't quite perfect because of the tragic scene in the center of it all. A guy, hard to tell his age, knelt down beside a body that appeared to be drowning in its own blood. My stomach tightened in knots. His light brown hair covered most of his face, but it was easy to see he was so caught up in his own mess that he didn't even notice us. Suddenly I felt invasive. Instead of doing what I should have (backing the hell off and leaving him and this house alone) I walked over to him and laid my hand on his shoulder. He whipped around. Fear almost stabbing me with his eyes. I then realized, he could kill me, right now. But suddenly his glare melted, and his face looked sad and his whole being disheveled. He dropped the kitchen knife he was holding and stood up slowly. \"My name's Nick. I'm from Duluth. A couple months ago my parents and I moved out here for my dad's job… But then this whole virus thing happened and… I had to kill them.\" He explains. We all nod silently. \"Oh my gosh! Guys! Check out this cool sword I found.\" Jay walks back into the room with a (okay it was pretty cool) sword. \"Jay-\" I start \"It's got- see this blade here and-\" \"Jay.\" I try again. \"And it's so shiny I just-\" \"JAY IT IS NOT THE TIME!\" I screech. He stops talking. \"Uhm… So, Sorry you had to see… that. But… what can I do for ya?\" Nick asks, his face brightening. \"Uhm… we…\" I start. \"We would appreciate some food.\" Jay barges in. Way to go redneck . \"Sure.\" Nick says, to our surprise. That was waaaaay easier than any of us expected. Russia, Fairbanks, Bavaria and Bipolar all follow Nick to the kitchen while Jay and I look around for the others. \"That was really rude.\" I hiss at him as we are walking through the house. \"Sorry.\" He says, lowering his head shamefully. \"Tell that to Nick, not me.\" I cross my arms. \"Sorry, Nick.\" He says to no one in particular. I put my head in my hands. \"Everything okay there?\" \"You… you are just too much to handle.\" I complain. \"What? How? I practically take care of myself. Feed, clean...\" \"That's not what I mean… It's everyone. It's just too hard for me to keep track of all of you.\" I say quietly. \"Minneapolis… you don't have to watch all of us. Nobody gave you that job. We just figure since you seem to like be'n leader 'n all we let you have yer fun.\" He nods, then stops walking. I stop, too. \"Found 'em.\" We meet the others back in the kitchen. Nick (thank god) had food sitting on the table. Without a second though, we all started eating. And as we did, I began to wonder how Nick had done it. Sat there, staring at his dead (I think it was his mom) parent, who he had killed. And then got right back up and helped some strangers out that just walked into his house. But then again… isn't that what we all did? Well… that's that and what's dead is dead. Which is a lot of people. So stay tuned… Because it's gonna get JUICY :3[Chapter 25] Still wouldn't mind some reviews… Happy March!:D It turns out Nick isn't really a bad guy. I mean, no one ever said he was. And the whole killing his own parents thing was strictly survival. So he wasn't a horrible edition to the team, as long as he could take care of himself. It's Saturday night (yes for the first time in a long time I'm actual aware of what day of the week it is) and we just left Nick's house. It wasn't as quiet as it normally was. There was actually conversation amongst us… It was almost scary. \"I would have been just fine without ever meeting you.\" Reaver tips his head up. \"Oh come on,\" Kory elbows him, \"You know you're life wouldn't have ever been the same.\" \"You're right.\" Reaver sighs, pushing him away. \"And that's probably for the best.\" \"Honestly,\" Russia mumbles. \"Well, love, you know you couldn't live without us.\" Reaver says in a mock British accent. \"You suck at accents.\" Russia shakes her head. \"Oh, do I? Vittle Girl ?\" He's know trying a Russian accent. \"Get out.\" I point towards the window. Reaver smiles, I shake my head. \"You just don't know how to have fun.\" Jay says from the front seat. We acquired a new vehicle since leaving Nick's, so we weren't as squished as before. \"I'm pretty sure I know how to have fun.\" \"You're wound up tighter than Michael Jackson's face lifts.\" Kory observes. \"Ouch,\" I roll my eyes. \"Now, now children.\" Reaver chastises. \"You're all freaks.\" Kory says. \"Shut it pork head,\" Jay glares at him. \"You shut it, you're so stupid you don't know sheep shit from cotton seed!\" Kory spits. What? \"That's lower than quail shit in a wagon rut!\" Jay says. Oh, dear lord. \" Stoooooooooop. \" I moan. \"You two are sooooo annoying. For once just shut up.\" \"Very well then,\" Kory sniffs. I look out the window, my eyes light up. Ah, finally! Civilization! Of course that civilization is zombie infested but what are ya gonna do? We pull over and everyone gets out. Things were going so well… \"No more farms!\" Bavaria sighed happily. We pulled out some of the food we had been storing for quite awhile now… I wasn't even sure what was still okay to eat. We sat by the cars on the side of a bridge, just before the city. I looked for a sign that might give us our location, but couldn't find one. So we sat there and ate. \"Did anyone hear that?\" Fairbanks half whispers as we're loading everything back into the cars. \"Hear what?\" Texas asks. The sound of metal scraping against pavement filled the air. We all turned from the direction we had originally come. I could just barely make out movement in the shadows of the buildings by the bridge. \"Oh my god.\" Emmett breathes, motionless. Shocked, he turns around slowly and looks directly into my eyes, \"Get in the truck.\" Even I'm paralyzed by the sight. \"Move!\" I yell. We hurry into the cars. Reaver started our truck's engine. I could hear my heart pounding in my head. At least thirty to fifty bloodied faces were after us now, jaws hanging wide open, drawling. Black, dead eyes focused only on us. Ready to devour. Then, the worst possible thing happened. \"We're running out of gas.\" Reaver says, looking at the gauge. \"Shit,\" I looked in the rear view mirror, the horde wasn't far behind us. The sound of their moans filled my head. I think. I think hard about our next move. I search for places to hide. I see a sign for a subway entrance. \"There! Stop the car!\" \"What? Are you crazy?\" Reaver's face is red. \"Yes, now stop the freaking car!\" I shout. He gives me a hesitant look and the truck comes to a halt. We open the doors, I hear them slamming in the background. The rest of the group's confusion as they're stopping their cars. But there's absolutely no time to explain. I crossed my finger (in my head) that this would work. We ran down the steps, the horde was growing, they were within reach now. A chainsaw started, that was Bipolar. A gun shot, screaming. It was almost all slow motion. I felt rumbling under my feet. Perfect. \"Just hang in there, everyone!\" I shriek. \" Sure! \" Kory hisses angrily. \"Stupid zombies!\" Texas wails, crushing a zombies head under her foot. I could hear it now. \"Step off!\" Emmett shoves one back and shoots it. \"GO BACK OFF IN YOUR OWN JACK YARD!\" Jay slices a zombie's torso in half. I could see light coming from the tunnel. \"Almost there!\" I yell, spinning on my heel to chop a head off with my axe. \"What are you waiting for?\" Bavaria pants, whacking a zombie with her hatchet. The subway train finally pulled in and the doors started opening. \"Get inside!\" I yell and we all swarm into the train. \"We've got to hold them off.\" Kory makes a clean cut. My little fighters. \"How much longer?\" There were tears streaming down Charlotte's eyes. \" The door's are now closing.\" An electronic, feminine voice informs us. \"It'll be alright, Charlotte.\" Reaver says, saving his little sister from an oncoming zombie. The doors shut, a few limbs remained in the doors. We all sighed with relief. \"Is everyone okay?\" I ask. They all nod. Everyone was there, it was going to be okay. \"Damn zombies.\" Russia sighs, sitting down. The train started to move, and we had to grab something for support. \"What are we going to do now?\" Charlotte asks Reaver, her tears drying. Reaver looks at me for an answer. \"Yeah, what are we going to do?\" Fairbanks whispers. I think about my response for a second. I really didn't know what was next. \"We survive.\" Is all I say. \"That's all that matters, is that each and everyone one of us outlast this. We've already lost everything else. But I will not let us lose each other. No matter how much you loathe one another,\" I look at Reaver, Jay and Kory. \"We are going to stick together.\" A few nods, but mostly silence. Just the rumbling tracks beneath us as the subway broke out of the tunnel and into the light. It went above the city and we could see the demolition Germany had endured as well. I held my breath for a second. Wondering if the rest of the world had suffered like this. And if there really was somewhere we could be safe. It's kind of a short, but action packed chapter. Sorry/: If I made any mistakes, it's cause I'm exhausted. So if you really want to, you can piss and moan about it all you want. Until next time, my dears… /1_/1 (=' . '=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 26] Hey guys… So… another chapter… yeah. We had to barricade the doors on the subway before we reached the next stop. There were lots of left over items from the citizens that used to live here. When I picked up a teddy bear lying on the floor, I almost cried. You could pretty much imagine everyone trying to escape as the people around them started to transform into brain hungry monsters. The fear they might've felt. And you can always imagine that one person that was prepared for this thinking fuck yeah! I told all you bitches this day would come! And on rare occasion, you could imagine that grandma who had the will to kill everyone that tried to eat her. Those were always my favorite images that came to my mind when searching through stuff. Until you found another one of those things that tugged on your heart. A family photograph, a lost toy, wedding rings, etc. \"How many more stops do we have?\" I ask Emmett, looking outside the windows of our train to see if we were going to be out of this tunnel soon. \"Two,\" He's looking at the map. By the time we got off the subway system, we'd be close to Poland. I was hoping there wouldn't be an airport to far from there, and we could get out of this dreaded continent. Not that I wouldn't love it if it weren't infested with zombies. \"After the next stop we need to get everything away from the doors, okay?\" I ask, thinking about getting new vehicles after we got out of the subway system. \"No problem.\" Reaver nods. Sure enough the next stop comes, and our barricades are once again put to great use. Through the window you can hear a zombie's head turn with the sound of the train, it must sense us inside, because it lets out a loud screech and tries to run through the door. Silly zombie, brains are for humans. The doors close, and the train shakes as it starts to move again. The guys start to tear down our make shift walls. \"Everyone ready?\" I ask, preparing my axe. \"You know it.\" Texas got her knives ready. \"Do you have a plan, Minneapolis?\" Russia asks, moving a suitcase away from the door. \"Always do,\" I lie. Improvising is more my thing. \"Alright, we're ready to move.\" Kory says, moving the last brief case. \"This'll be easier than herder chickens.\" Jay exclaims, examining his sword. \"Here we go,\" Reaver looks out the window as the train pulls to a stop. We were out of the tunnel now, in daylight. \"See any cars?\" I ask, trying to find some. \"Yeah, there's actually one with its door left open, maybe the keys are still in the ignition.\" Bavaria says hopefully. The doors slide open and we rush out of the train, a few zombies started to follow us. We made our way for a few of the cars left sitting on the street. I check all the doors that are closed. Texas, Fairbanks, Charlotte and Nick get into the car they found that was still open. The keys must've been in the ignition like Bavaria said, because it started right away. Emmett, Bavaria, Bipolar and Kory find another car. Now it's just Reaver, Jay, Russia and me. Finally we Reaver finds a shiny blue truck. We hop in and thank god there are keys in this one, too. Whoever owned this must've been in a big hurry. \"Everyone else got a car, right?\" Reaver asks me, shifting the truck into reverse. \"I think so.\" I nod. \"Alright, good.\" He runs over a few zombies and clicks it into drive. We make it safely onto a highway, the others join us within minutes. I heave a sigh of relief. Now just to find that airport. \"Let me know if you guys see a sign for an airport.\" I say. \"That was really close.\" Russia observes. \"Yes, it was.\" Reaver agrees. \"Sorry guys.\" I apologize. \"I still think you're wound up way too tight.\" Reaver observes. \"Tighter than a skeeter's ass in a nose dive.\" Jay agrees. \"What?\" Russia asks. \"Tighter than…\" Reaver tries to think of one. \"Guys, that's enough.\" I shake my head, annoyed. \"She's wound up tighter than the girdle of a Baptist minister's wife at an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast!\" Jay adds. \"Jay, shut up.\" I hiss. \"And busier than a cat covering up shit on a concrete floor.\" \"What does that even mean?\" Russia cries. \"It means she's got a lot on her plate.\" Reaver pokes me. I cross my arms. \"Hey, look at that!\" Jay points at a sign. Szczecin lotnisko. I wondered why this particular sign had caught his attention, when I see the little image of an airplane next to it. \"Can you get us there?\" I ask Reaver. He nods, and takes a quick turn onto an exit. We pull into the airport drop off and we all get out. The other two cars park behind us. \"Tell me you are not flying the plane again.\" Emmett says. \"Who's going to fly it then?\" I ask, not being able to recall anyone else with flying experience but myself. \"You mean who's going to crash it.\" Emmett laughs. I shove him. We walk into the doors of the airport very quietly. \"Be careful, now.\" Jay cautions. \" No. \" I say sarcastically. I see two dark eyes, than hear a thwack. \"It's alright. I got it.\" Fairbanks whispers. Right. \"Where's the damn control room?\" Russia asks, opening a door to reveal only a janitor's closet. \"It should be around here somewhere.\" Nick observes a map of the airport. \"Here.\" I open a door and it's filled with computer screens. \"I was right, of course.\" Nick nods. \"Watch it!\" Jay hits a zombie that rushes out from the door I had just opened. \"Them zombies can be slicker than a harpooned hippo on a banana tree.\" I head into the control room while Texas and Nick stand guard. I start sifting through some of the papers, but Nick's whistling distracts me. \"Shut up!\" I screech. \"Sorry,\" He stops. I then continue searching. Finally I find a delayed flight that had just made it to its gate before everything went wrong. It was going to Townsville, Australia. \"Here we go, everyone head down to gate G-17.\" I say, exiting the control room. We begin to make our journey from one end of the airport to another. A few zombies on the way, but for the most part it was too bad. Except Russia goes a little crazy and takes a whole bunch of emotions out on one particular zombie. \"Ain't no point in beatin' a dead horse…\" Jay says, then walks over to the deformed zombie, \"'Course can't hurt none either.\" He kicks it. \"Here's our gate.\" I say, pulling a lever to open the door. \"We'll be okay now, but remember to take out the pilots on board. \"Right,\" Bavaria nods, heading in first. The lights are dim, but it isn't terrible. Right away Reaver and Emmett kill what were once the pilots and flight attendants. \"Ready for takeoff,\" Emmett salutes me, I push him out of my way, smiling, and sit down in the pilot's chair. He heads back to check the rest of the plane for zombies. I sigh, exhausted. We haven't rested in awhile, not since the farmhouse. I leaned my head back and closed my eyes for a second. \"Told you, you have too much on your plate.\" I flinch at Jay's voice, he sat down in the chair next to me. \"Yeah, I know.\" I say, opening my eyes and turning on the engine. \"Hopefully we'll be safe soon, and I won't have to worry about everyone.\" Jay frowns, than pats my head and stands up, \"Don't worry too much about it. Just do all you can do and let the rough end drag.\" He leaves me alone to fly the plane. The sun's starting to set, and it's quiet for the first time in ages. I start to speed up as I find a clear road to takeoff on. I flicked on the seatbelt sign and smiled to myself. Then pushed the stick forward and the front wheels lifted us into the sky, the orange and purple clouds, streaked with pink blood. Hoped you enjoyed this chapter! If anyone wants to make me some Australian OCs I would be verys very grateful!:D /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 27] Hello freunds!^.^ I am currently working with a very cruddy typing software, so I can't bold or italicize (capitalization will replace italics) and I have no spell check. My apologies. Also, be sure to check out my new story \"Tales from the Nightosphere\" with your beloved redneck, Jay as my co-author. My hands hurt. I mean HURT. I mean, who the hell drives a freaking plane this long anyways? And seriously, we're not even close according to the radar-map-thing. And okay, maybe I should know a little more about flying a plane before actually flying one, but it wasn't like there was a \"Dumby's Guide to Flying\" handy. And worst of all, for the past twelve hours I have been listening to \"Minneapolis.\" \"Hey, Minneapolis.\" \"Hey, hey, Minnie.\" \"Yo, Apple.\" \"Mineapolis. \"Hello?\" \"Hey.\" Me: \"Jay, would you shut the hell up?\" \"And I thought I was keeping good company here.\" Jay shakes his head. \"Are rednecks even aloud to say 'yo?'\" I ask. \"There are plenty of gangster rednecks who say 'yo.'\" \"Gangster rednecks?\" I raise an eyebrow. He nods and stands up. \"'Course there are.\" And walks away. Thank god. Something beeped. I was scared to know what it was. I looked at the controls closely and found the source of the beeping was only a GPS-like-thing that was letting me know we had met a halfway mark. So... twelve hours left? Can I survive that? Chances are... no probably not. Especially not if- \"You're so stupid, you couldn't find your own ass with both hands!\" You'll never guess who. \"Hurtful.\" Kory clutches his heart, mockingly. \"It will be,\" Reaver mumbles. \"What was that, cowtail?\" Kory spins around, facing him. \"Nothing, don't fight.\" Reaver kicks his feat up and leans back in a chair. I press the button that appears to be auto-pilot and walk into first class. The group has gathered around the Kory and Jay, Reaver being a bystander for once. But it looked like Kory wasn't going to let that slide for too long. \"Why shouldn't we fight?\" Kory growls. \"Well first of all, we're limited on humans in this world, and I don't want the population to get smaller because you were being an idiot, as usual.\" \"I'M the idiot?\" Kory's face turns red. Reaver raises his eyebrows, \"Of course. Who else would qualify as such a low life form other than yourself?\" \"Stand up you dumb bastard, let's fight.\" \"I'll have you know that I had a great deal of respect for my family and my father. I'm afraid that calling me a bastard was not a wise choice on your behalf.\" Reave does indeed stand up. \"Guys... don't...\" Fairbanks says quietly. \"If you do, there will be punishment.\" Russia hisses. But it doesn't seem to stop them. \"Come now, you really wish to fight me after all the killing you've witnessed from me?\" Reaver asks one last time. \"Bring it, freak.\" Kory gets ready to charge him. \"Very well, I shall bring it.\" Before Reaver can actually make a move, Kory is rushing towards him. Reaver steps out of the way and hits him upside the head with a brief case. Kory is knocked out immeduiately, of course.\"My work is done, Minneapolis,\" It's the first time anyone seemed to notice my presence, \"you may resume flying the plane.\" I nod, and begin to walk back, when the plane suddenly shifts violently to the right. \"What was that?\" Texas screeches. Oh, no... \"Uhm... that's not good.\" I say, trying to make my way back. \"Why aren't you flying the plane?\" Bavaria's face is filled with horror. \"Uh...\" I don't really answer but focus on getting the plane back on it's original path. \"Everytime we fly the freaking plane, something bad has to happen!\" Texas is pissed. Whatever. I can fix this. \"Yup.\" I sigh as the whole plane shifts to the left. Charlotte starts to scream her head off and Reaver goes to quiet her. Kory is still passed out, so I laugh. \"What is so funny about this?\" Emmett asks me, his mouth gaping. \"Look at Kory,\" Both Emmett and Jay look, but only Jay laughs. Emmett groans and rolls his eyes as the plane starts to turn again. I throw myself into the cockpit and see the problem immediately. We were beginning to nose dive into the ocean below. Hmm... \"What are you DOING?\" Texas asks me while I'm staring out the window. Okay, to be honest, I was being a LITTLE derpy. \"Just uh... nothing. Not doing anything.\" I shrug, then hit a button. \"Do something to save us you freak!\" Bavaria is in the door now as we go forward. I glare at her, then push past the two and into first class. I thrust the emergency exit open and the life raft starts to inflate. I throw a bunch of the seat cussions out into the water and wait. Not that bad of a fall. The plane started falling forward. \"Hurry, get out.\" I say, not very urgently. Everyone stares at me, bemused. \"Get. Out.\" I repeat myself, this time very seriously. They rush themselves out of the door. The alarm from the door was starting to get on my nerves. After everyone was out, I jumped out as well. Falling wasn't my best technique. I was never into swimming, so I didn't really know how to dive, or whether or not diving would have been an apropriate way to fall in this scenario. And even worse, I didn't really know how to swim. So this should be... interesting. \"What the hell is wrong with you!?\" Emmett yells at me as we're falling through the air. \"Oh, lots of things.\" I answer, looking around. Not to much longer. In fact- I plunged into the cold, cold blue water. It swallowed me whole. I wanted to scream but didn't... couldn't. I. Hate. Water! The madness didn't end. I just kept going deeper and deeper. The light from the surface was growing dimmer. This wasn't a very smart idea. Really, it wasn't. But I was pressed for time. But who will blame me if I die? Soon, as I am running out of air, my surroundings grow fuzzy, I was far beyond terrified. Or far from. It was hard to tell. Then as all hope was lost, I was pulled back up to the surface. \"You are crazy.\" I don't really know who it was. All I know is that we made it onto the life raft, but remember nothing past that.[Chapter 28] Hello my dearies(; If you don't want the story to end soon… Then I suggest you let me know. If you want to imply that my last attempt at saving us all was quite risky and unnecessary, then I will rip your eyes out of their sockets and make them watch as I tear you apart limb from limb with my axe. Because that was the scariest hell I have ever put myself through, just to save a couple of dumbfucks. So I suppose you are probably wondering who saved me, who dies, what happens next. Well…. \"Holly hell.\" Reaver's voice. I start to open my eyes, not entirely sure we weren't all dead. \"You are one psychotic bitch.\" That's Jay, clothes soaked in water… along with everyone else on the life raft. \"How you feeling?\" Emmett asks me. I roll over onto my stomach and make a count. 1…2…3…7… 12… Yes, everyone was here. \"Everyone okay?\" \"Yeah, she's feeling just fine. Yes, we're all okay.\" Texas answers. \"I told you all that we would make it.\" Nick nods. Of course he did. \"Anyone know where we are?\" I ask the crew. Kory laughs, \"The middle of the ocean.\" \"How 'bout some helpful information, cudbucket.\" Jay shoves him. \"Does anyone have a compass?\" Reaver asks. \"Shouldn't you?\" Kory shoves Reaver. The raft starts to sway. \"Why would I have one?\" Reaver pushes him back. \"I think I'm feeling sea sick.\" Russia moans. \"Must you fight right now?\" Nick asks, with one eyebrow raised. \"Yes.\" Jay, Kory and Reaver all answer. Magnificent. \"We have had enough of your fighting.\" Texas stands up. The raft starts to rock back and forth… \"Sit down, we're not done.\" Kory says. They begin to fight, but no one really pays any attention anymore. Back and forth, back and forth… Finally the raft leans violently to one end. I get close enough to the water that I squeal. \"Alright,\" I stand up, \"We're tired, we're wet, we're hungry and we're cold. Tensions are high, I get it. But enough, sit.\" I grab Kory and Jay's shoulders and force them down with pressure points. \"OW!\" Kory hisses. Reaver's still standing, but all I have to do is glare at him and all of them obey to my every command. \"Good boys,\" I smile and sit back down. \"I do… have a compass.\" Nick digs in his back pocket and pulls out exactly what we've been looking for. \"I don't know anything about geography so, uhm… you go ahead and figure that out yourselves.\" I say, resting against the side of the raft. Which makes me feel a bit iffy being so close to the waves. \"Feeling alright?\" Emmett asks, scooting over by me. \"Uhhm…\" I don't really answer. He wraps his arm around me and I shiver. \"Are you still a hydrophobic?\" He asks, a scarily smug grin spreading across his face. He doesn't wait for an answer but shoves me into the water. I scream until I realize that only makes it worse and I can't breathe under water. \"Dude what the hell?\" Bipolar yells at Emmett, pulling me out of the water. \"It was funny!\" Emmett's laughing his ass off along with Kory. \"No, it wasn't.\" Russia helps me onto the raft as I'm choking up water. \"Oh, no, it totally was.\" Kory points and laughs at me. Once I catch my breath again I sit between Jay and Bipolar, on the other side of Emmett. I really didn't need this. And I was so cold now. \"You two should just… shut the fuck up!\" Fairbanks says. They both stop at once. No one talks, it's actually kind of eerie. \"Well… someone figure out what we're going to do!\" Texas says after a few minutes of silence. Reaver pulls out a pair of binoculars. \"I think… I think there's an island or something up ahead!\" He shouts excitedly. Everyone looks at me waiting for the next command. I point wimpily in the direction of the island and nearly pass out. An hour later we were on our way. \"This is the song of a drunken sailor-\" \"Do you want me to push you overboard?\" Bavaria asks Nick. Nick stops singing, then whistles to the same song. A wave flows over our raft. I pass out. So…. We're nearing the end… or are we? Don't forget to check out Tales from the Nightosphere by me and our beloved Jay! /1_/1 ( = ' . ' = ) (\")-(\")[Chapter 29] HIIII GUUYYYSS… Lasting another chapter… consider yourselves all pretty lucky. Within a day and a half, the raft with (thankfully) all of us in it washed up alongside the shore of the island. I jumped off the raft gratefully, putting as much space between me and it as possible. I then proceeded to sprawl out on the warm sand, which felt like soft, warm honey in the sunlight. I released a sigh of relief and looked to the group for further instruction. Oh wait… that's my job. \"Alright, freunds. Let's establish some rules.\" I say as they join me on the sand. \"As usual, I will be leader. Anyone who disagrees can go sit in the farthest corner of the jungle and sulk there until we shun you no more.\" \"But-\" \"You wish to disagree with her?\" Russia stands up to Kory, giving her the demon look of death. \"No.\" He cowers. \"Anyways… Somebody needs to find food. Someone needs to make shelter-\" \"So… Remote island means… no zombies?\" Jay asks. \"Someone needs to check for zombies. \" I add. People seem to agree and so I command them, \"go.\" I decided to follow Texas and Bipolar into the jungle. We walked around for a while, picking up fire wood on the way. \"Y'know… this really isn't so bad… I haven't seen one zombie this whole time.\" Texas says. \"I know… it's so boring .\" Bipolar sighs. \"It's almost like a vacation.\" \"Yes, a vacation from having fun.\" Bipolar frowns. I take their fire wood and head back to the beach. A snake crawled up my arm while I was walking, I pet it scales and let it hitch a ride. Then, out of nowhere, a hand flew past me and snatched the snake. The snake landed faraway and hissed and left. The source of the hand returned, swinging on a vine and landed in front of me. \"You should be careful about them snakes.\" Jay warns me. \"You took my pet!\" I hiss at him. \"Your pet was venomous and a danger to your health and survival.\" \"It wasn't hurting me.\" I mumble. \"Yet.\" He says, and follows me back to the beach. \"Isn't there a job you could be doing?\" I ask. \"Yeah, it's called rescuing you from the evils of nature.\" He shrugs. \"Cram it, redneck.\" \"Geez, you'd think you'd be a little more grateful, seeing as how I just saved your life.\" \"Saved whose life?\" Emmett asks as we exit the jungle and find the beach. \"No ones.\" I answer before Jay could. Emmett raises an eyebrow but shrugs it off. I leave Jay and walk over to Nick, who's humming while building some sort of shelter out of leaves and wood. \"What's uh… what's going on over here?\" I ask hesitantly. \"Ah, the fine art of architecture… all done by yours truly.\" Nick waves a hand in the air dramatically. Russia and Bavaria walk over, hauling a huge log. \"About time, ladies. Now, fetch me more wood!\" He demands. \"Yes, sir.\" Russia rolls her eyes and Bavaria grunts. \"You were saying?\" \"A simple please and thank you. Is that so hard to do? Be nice to those girls, and everyone else for that matter.\" I jab a finger top his chest and walk away. I find Kory and Reaver arguing over a pile of logs. I step atop of one of the larger rocks surrounding the logs and glare at the two. They stop mid argument. \"Boys, boys,\" I say, \"you're both beautiful . Now what's the issue?\" \"We can't figure out how to start the fire.\" I snort. \"I think Bipolar has a lighter… I mean she's a pyro, right? So why can't we just go ask her?\" Reaver turns to Kory. \"Because I can start this thing myself!\" Kory says heroically, then studies the logs intently. \"Okay, then start it.\" Reaver says, bored. \"Uhm…\" Kory moves one of the logs and they all topple over each other, destroying the neat pile they made. \" Nice.\" Reaver comments. \"It'd be helpful if you weren't BREATHING DOWN MY BACK THIS WHOLE TIME!\" Kory growls. \"Dude, I'm like… five feet away from you.\" Reaver says. Kory ignores him and goes back to the fire. \"Anyways,\" Reaver looks at me again. \"If you could see if anyone has a lighter or a match or anything. That'd be great.\" \"Sure, just… refrain from killing each other while I'm gone.\" I say and walk away. Charlotte and Fairbanks were sitting by the water when I found them, talking to each other. \"Everything alright?\" I ask. Fairbanks nods in response. I sit down next to them and throw a rock into the water. \"I'm hungry.\" Charlotte says. \"I know, Jay's looking for food or… he was supposed to be looking, anyways.\" I stand up, \"I'll go see if he's found something.\" \"Thanks!\" Charlotte says and I trot off to find Jay and Bipolar. The sun had finally managed to dry most of my clothing. So I was starting to warm up. I decided to leave my shoes out to dry by Nick's shelter, and let the sand's heat dry my feet. Then I had to find Jay, which could or could not be the hardest task ever. Along with Bipolar… who was probably going to create an even harder search. \"Hey,\" Emmett says, catching up to me. Oh yeah, he's still alive. \"Hi,\" \"What's wrong?\" He asks. \"Oh, nothing… just enjoying being lost on an island in the middle of nowhere.\" I sigh. \"Isn't this a good thing? Isn't this what we all wanted? It's safe here. We're safe. We-re-\" \"Alone.\" I end the sentence for him. He doesn't respond. We walk in silence, until he shakes his head and goes in a different direction without a word. In my mind a thought comes across… I've just lost my best friend. By the time I had found Jay and Bipolar, gotten the fire to start, and finally started to relax, the sun was already going down. I sat down by the fire and wrapped my arms around my legs. The rest of us started to slowly gather on the beach. Adding finishing touches to the shelter, and dropping off the last of the food. \"Everyone okay? Everyone here?\" Reaver asks instead of me. I kept my head down, tired and a little sad. \"Yup,\" \"Yeah,\" \"Freak.\" (Guess who that one was) \"Anyone hungry?\" I hear Jay somewhere behind me. I look back to see him holding multiple fish in both hands. Where had he managed to get all of them? Groans and sighs of relief come from everyone. He ties the fish to a stick placed above the fire with string from the raft. I put my head back down on my knees. Finally, things were coming together. In my mind I make a mental list of our whole group. (Yes, I often forget about certain people) Then I think of how we could get out of here. But it seems no one wants to leave. Then when I hear the last pair of footsteps, I look up. Emmett has decided to sit on the opposite side of the fire, though there was plenty of room over here. Fine, I see how it is. After about twenty minutes, Jay speaks up. \"Fish!\" He announces. The group cheers and grabs for the fish. I sigh, thankful. I really was hungry. Across the fire I see Emmett, his eyes on me. Then he quickly looks away. Well then, be that way. On the other side of the beach, we hear a crash. I look over the shelter had fallen. \"Oh sh-\" Yaay! Spring break chapter! Okay, hope you enjoyed. Remember, review or regret. :3 /1_/1 (= ` . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 30] What happened to my loyal fans? What happened to my friends? What happened to- Day 3 of the Island… If a pig is killed in the middle of the jungle, does anyone hear it? Yes, the poor souls who killed it do. And it was a very unappealing squeal. You could say some of us have lost our minds, and by now that's no surprise. And you really know it's bad when Bipolar suddenly starts to make a little sense. \"If we spend any more time on this island those two are going to go completely mad.\" She says as her, Reaver and I are sitting on the beach, watching some turtle pop up above the water, then back down and up once more. I look over to see who she's referring to. It's Kory and Fairbanks, arguing at the top of their lungs. \"You're right.\" Reaver says, astonished. \"She is?\" \"I am?\" Bipolar and I say at the same time. \"Yeah, I hate to say this but,\" Reaver turns to me, \"We need to get off this island.\" \"What? Why?\" I ask. There's a loud thud, and Fairbanks has taken a large plank of wood and knocked Kory in the head with it. \"Oh…\" \"Do you see my point?\" He asks. \"Yeah,\" I lay back on the sand and let out a groan. \"We've been… all around the world…\" \"Not everywhere.\" \"Okay we have Asia, the rest of Australia and Russia. But we already know what's happened to Russia.\" \"Maybe… maybe we don't.\" Reaver says quietly. I prop myself up on my elbows and look at him, \"What do you mean?\" \"Maybe Russia wasn't telling the truth.\" He proposes. \"You have no proof of that.\" I say. \"You're right. But we have no proof that it isn't safe there.\" He retorts. \"What's your beef with Russia?\" I ask. \"I don't have one.\" He answers, and stands up. \"Fine, tell the others to meet up here. I'll think of something.\" I let out a sigh and he walks away. Bipolar was looking at him like he was the crazy one. \"Ignore him, he's just being grumpy.\" \"Still…\" But she doesn't say anything else. I stand up and make my way toward the other side of the beach where Kory was knocked out on the sand and Fairbanks was sitting on the rock next to him. \"Fun times?\" I ask. \"Well…\" She drifts off. \"What were you guys arguing about?\" \"Oh, nothing…\" She sighs. \"No, seriously.\" I say. \"It was nothing, I'm sure he'll be fine when he uh…\" She pokes him with her foot, \"When he wakes up.\" \"Right… well, we're gonna have a little family chat due to Reaver's suspicions, so we'll probably meet over by the fire.\" \"Kay,\" She drags Kory by his feet across the sand. Nope, not crazy at all… \"Alright everybody, shut up.\" Jay says for me. I thank him and he sits down. All attention is on me. \"And now time for another one of Minneapolis' famous plans.\" Kory jokes. \"Sure is,\" I smile. \"Now… who knows how to build a boat?\" Everyone shares the same look. They knew what this meant. \"You want us to leave the island?\" Nick asks, his eyes wide. \"Yes.\" I breathe. \"Alright,\" Texas says. What? \"Yeah, I was getting sick of this island anyways.\" Bavaria adds. They're agreeing with me? \"This whole stranded on a desert island thing was getting really cliché.\" Jay shakes his head. Did he just say cliché? \"Alright, let's get moving on this boat, guys. We need wood, vines and anything else that's useful you can find.\" Reaver commands. Everyone goes their separate ways, than I realize something. \"We were missing someone.\" I state, thinking about the numbers, the faces I saw. \"Who?\" Reaver asks me. \"I'm not sure.\" I think about it. \"Oh my god.\" I feel like I'm about to puke all of a sudden. \"What? Who was it?\" \"Emmett.\" I say. \"Calm down, he's probably just wandering around in the jungle, he'll be back any minute, I'm sure.\" \"Reaver, I haven't seen him all day.\" I ignore his last statement. \"Come to think of it… neither have I.\" He looks at me, \"Breathe.\" I take a deep breathe. \"Thanks,\" I say, and we run into the jungle. \"Emmett!\" I call. We had been searching for hours. The sun was already starting to go down. The jungle's air was musty and humid. Suddenly there's a howling sound, and something rushes past. \"What was that?\" I ask. There isn't an answer. I look over at Reaver, his face is frozen and he twitches slightly. \"That- that was… that was Jay… on a vine… and he wasn't- he wasn't wearing any… clothes.\" \"He and I are going to have a little chat later.\" I shake my head and continue our search. ****Told you I would get back at you**** \"Rednecks.\" Reaver scoffs. \"Emmett, come here.\" \"Reaver, he's not a cat.\" I say. \"You're right. Emmett! Here kitty, kitty, kitty.\" I roll my eyes. Then a sudden stench overwhelms the humid air and my nausea returns. \"Damn, what is that?\" He asks me. \"It smells like… It smells like…\" I scream. Sorry about that little intrusion. I just wanted a little revenge. Don't you just love cliff hangers? /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 31] Some people may be a little angry with me for the decision I've made… but oh well!:D There's a second of laughter before I realize what just happened. \"You fucking douche bag!\" I cry as Emmett laughs his ass off. \"That was… so… funny!\" Emmett says between laughs. \"Your face was… priceless!\" \"You think that was funny?\" Reaver raises an eyebrow. \"Hilarious.\" Emmett pulls his hands out in front of him. \"Don't tell me you're mad.\" \"I thought you were dead!\" I cry. I realize how stupid this all is and turn around and walk back to the beach. Screw Emmett. He's a waste of my time. Who cares if he's dead. Doesn't he deserve it after all this? And besides, what does he even do in this group? He's just more weight for us to carry. And what the hell is up with this whole being mean to me all the time? What's wrong with him? Maybe it's this whole survival thing… It's changing him. Actually, I think it's changing all of us. I mean, I'm definitely not the same. So I just…. I don't care! \"What's wrong?\" Jay asks me. I hadn't even realized I had already found my way back to the beach. \"N-nothing.\" \"Yeah, right. Seriously, what's up?\" He nudges me with his elbow. \"Emmett...\" Is all I say. \"That asshole.\" Jay frowns. \"Don't worry, I'll fix it.\" \"Really, you don't have to-\" \"Where is he? Hm? C'mon. That wuss is hiding isn't he.\" Jay puts his fists in front of his face and starts bouncing around like a pro-boxer. \"Geez, testosterone much? He's in the jungle somewhere last I saw him.\" I shrug. \"I knew he was hiding!\" Jay says victoriously and jabs the air. \"Right… just, when you see him, try to take it easy on him.\" I pat one of his arms which was still in front of his fast and walk away. Bunch of nut jobs… \"If you seriously think that we'll be able to make it off this island in two days then you are sorely mistaken.\" Texas tells Nick as he ties a log in place. \"You dare doubt my brain power?\" He hisses. \"I dare doubt your sanity!\" Texas says. \"Ginger.\" Nick scoffs. \"Yodeler.\" \"That's it!\" Nick stands up. A good foot and a half taller than Texas. \"Enough you two,\" Bavaria rolls her eyes. \"We have too many problems without your bickering.\" \"I'm the wiser one.\" Texas sighs. \"Old doesn't mean smart.\" Nick retorts. I walk away from that little scene. The sun was once again starting to set. I wonder briefly if I might miss the island once we leave. Fat chance of that. \"You don't have a knife.\" Russia asks blatantly. \"I have a gun.\" Kory answers. \"How's a gun supposed to help us?\" Russia groans. \"We could shoot the vines.\" Bipolar suggests. Kory and Russia give her an odd look. \"Just… saying.\" She says quietly. \"Go ask someone for a knife. I bet… I bet Fairbanks might have one!\" Russia tells Kory and shoos him away. I sit on a rock and admire their work. \"How goes it?\" \"Great.\" I can't really tell if Russia is being sarcastic or not. \"That's nice. Emmett's a dick.\" I immediately start venting. Bipolar giggles, Russia laughs heavily. \"Child, I've known this for some time.\" Russia shakes her head, smiling. \"You have?\" I ask, surprised. \"Yes, quite a while.\" She sighs, than examines the sun meeting the water at its horizon. The island really was a beautiful place. \"War… changes people. The cruelty of it all makes us someone from who we once were. It can make us both weaker and stronger. But it cannot make us good nor bad. It's just a way of life. It's just how things are.\" \"Sure is, thanks Russia.\" \"Anytime,\" She looks away from me toward Kory, who was arguing with Fairbanks once again. \"Let's go you swine! We haven't got all day!\" Then she mumbled something in Russian. I get up to go observe Fairbanks and Kory when I see Emmett and Reaver step out of the jungle. Emmett brushed past me without a word while Reaver stopped to talk. \"I'm sorry, things will work out. But right now we need to focus on escaping the island.\" He says. And he was right; we really needed to get away from here. It was making everyone crazy. \"Yes, everyone's working on that. I will too, thank you.\" I smile weakly. Reaver nods and walks away. The sun was just barely visible above the waves… night was here. \"Minneapolis, be reasonable.\" Believe it or not, this was Jay talking. \"I am reasonable.\" I say flicking a piece of bone into the fire. Bavaria laughed. \"Shut it.\" \"There's absolutely no way we're going to get this boat done in two days, it could take months.\" When did Jay become the expert on boats? \"If there's promise of waffles and chicken on the other side then it could definitely be possible.\" I smile. I think I saw Reaver start drooling at this thought. \"True… well, we'll see what happens tomorrow.\" Jay nods. \" Tomorrow, tomorrow-\" \"Cram it.\" Bavaria stuffs a stick in Nick's mouth before he could continue the song. Nick spits it out, \"Ugh! Do you know where that's been? It probably has millions of germs! Creeping and crawling around like… ugh! I could get so many diseases from that. Malaria, Influenza, Salmonella, Avian Influenza, Giardia, Leprosy-\" \"Shush.\" Texas shushes him. We all laugh a little. Good times…. I was still up by the time everyone was sleeping. Something was wrong in my brain… I just didn't know what. I kept thinking about how amazing it was that none of us had gotten sick or infected or even died yet. And that we had all stayed together as a group, despite Hugo, Darious and Neap. I get up to walk along the beach; maybe some good ol' pacing will make me feel better. The moon wasn't very high in the sky. But it was very bright. It's light washed over the whole beach, making the sand luminous and sparkly. You could hear something howling deep in the jungle. Funny how that has become the least of our problems. I might actually miss this little sanctuary. \"What are you doing?\" A voice asks behind me. \"Huh?\" I turn. It's Emmett. \"I asked what you're doing.\" \"Oh, nothing. Can't sleep.\" I avoid looking at him. \"Maybe I can help.\" He says, grabbing my hand. I uncomfortably shake it away. \"Leave me alone, Emmett.\" I sit on the sand and prop my head on my knees. \"What'd I do?\" He asks, clearly annoyed. \"I just want to be left alone.\" I lie. \"What about what I want?\" He asks suddenly. There was a certain anger to his voice. One I had heard before. \"I…\" He pulls me up by my hair so I'm standing, face to face with him. \"That's right. You didn't. Maybe you should start thinking.\" He hisses. I wince. \"Y'know, this is all your fault.\" He continues. \"If you would have just listened to me, just trusted me in the first place, we wouldn't have to be friends with these freaks. We wouldn't have to be here.\" He shoves me back onto the ground. \"They're not freaks!\" I squeal. Well that was dumb. \"Yes,\" He laughs, \"They are. And so are you.\" He kicks sand into my face and picks me up by my arm, then starts dragging me into the jungle. I felt like a ragdoll all of a sudden. How cliché. \"See? You're worthless. Spineless. Pathetic and Naïve. \" Each word was like venom. \"You mean nothing to anyone. If it weren't for you, we would all be safe right now, still in our home country. But as usual,\" He laughs again, this time a little more violently. \"As usual it was your fault.\" \"You're a piece of shit, Emmett.\" I growl. His face turned red. \"Everything you're telling me… they're lies, it's a load of bull, it's all just your-\" For a split second my world spins. Then there's a sudden throbbing in my right cheek… then my eye. \"Serves you right.\" He drops me to the ground. He punched me… he just fricking punched me and I can't get the nerve to do anything about it. Why can't I stand up? Come on legs! Work! One more second goes by, and this is what I am sure of. I am on the ground in tears like some Sunday school special. Emmett is pissed but smiling menacingly at his work. And there's a shadow creeping up on both of us. And then-\" \"Fucking. Say. You're. Sorry.\" \"What?\" Emmett gasps. \"I'm going to fry your liver lick Saturday night steak.\" Oh thank god for rednecks. \"Get off me, freak!\" Emmett yells. \"Hell no, you don't deserve to even live. You're a disgrace to every human left on this planet. You know that? And hell, while I'm around, you got a real bad chance of liv'n right now, buddy.\" I wipe my eyes to see Jay holding Emmett up by his throat. My eyes widen, \"Jay…\" \"Shush-hush-ush.\" He uses his free hand to put on finger over his lips. I nod silently. \"Now where was I? Oh yeah. You're a load of cow fuck.\" Jay's fist meets Emmett's face. \"Damn, you are some messed up dude… Stay away from her. Or else next time, I won't let you live.\" I heave out a sigh, exhausted by all of this. And then, when it seems like it's all over, Emmett lets out a scream. A pair of jaws clenches around his throat. \"Shit!\" Jay drops him. A decaying figure appears out of nowhere and immediately begins to devour Emmett. My mouth widens and I breathe in. I have to keep myself from screaming. \"Minneapolis-\" \"Go!\" I scream and shove Jay forward and out of the trees. \"Get the others let's go! \" Hmmmm? S:) You likey likey the dead, you say? RAWR. ^W^ Until next time my pretties…. Muahahahhahahahhahahahha.[Chapter 32] What do I have to do to get you people to review? Not even review, but just to read!? Well… if you were wondering, we're still on the island. Despite our little zombie problem. It was easy enough to defend ourselves while we were searching for supplies. The raft is almost finished, I was right of course. Jay was wrong. But seriously, we needed to get off the island before more zombies came. We had no clue how many there really were on this island, and we didn't expect much. But still, you never know. I suppose I'm rambling, and the truth is you want to know what happened to poor Emmett rather than the approximate chances of us living. Well, it's not easy for me to think about. That look on his face… that sad, helpless, pathetic look on his face is burned into my brain. \"Minne, come take a look at this.\" Bavaria says peering at something behind the trees. \"What's up?\" I ask, confused by the concerned look on her face. I walk to where there's a slight bend in the trees and look where she's looking. I cover my mouth and back away from the opening. \"There are… there are so many zombies in there.\" \"Yeah, I don't think we can hold them off.\" She whispers. \"Why didn't we see these guys before?\" I ask her. \"I don't know, maybe… I don't know.\" She mumbles and walks away. \"Kay, so I'll just figure this out myself then.\" I say to her back with large amounts of sarcasm. \"Reaves, I have a problem.\" I tell him jumping up on a log he was currently sawing in half. Oh, and we had established nicknames throughout the team now. \"'Sup?\" He asks looking up at me. \"You may not want to stand there.\" \"Right,\" I hop down and sit on the log, he rolls his eyes and shoves me off. \"So we have a new problem.\" He laughs. \"There's a whole bunch of them. In the jungle. I don't think they know that we're here, but it might not be long before they figure it out.\" I explain. \"Them?\" \"The zombies.\" \"Of course.\" He chuckles. \"I'll fix it. Give me some time,\" He grins, \"I'll dispose of them.\" \"Don't make me regret this.\" I hiss. \"You won't. I'm quite experienced with these fellows, they're growing on me.\" \"As long as you don't become one, that's fine with me.\" I walk toward the other side of the beach where Nick was focused on bossing the Kory and Fairbanks around. \"Alright,\" I clapped my hands together, \"Break time.\" Fairbanks and Kory drop what they're doing and walk away. \"What was that for?\" Nick asks me. \"All work and no play makes Johnny a dull boy.\" I raise my eyebrows. \"You just got rid of all my workers.\" Nick glares at me. \"So I did.\" I nod and grab a vine to tie in place. \"You're doing it wrong.\" \"Am I now?\" I look up at him, annoyed. \"Yeah, it's like this.\" He shoves me away and ties it… it was pretty much the exact same way I had tied it. \"Okay, see you later than.\" I begin to walk away. \"Sorry.\" He says. I turn back around and give him a questioning look. \"I'll try not to be so bossy anymore. It's not right. I'm sorry.\" Rather than actually responding I just let my jaw drop. \"Yeah I know, amazing, huh? Just enjoy this moment while you can.\" He says. \"Wait, wait, wait.\" I pull my phone out of my pocket. \"Can you record that for my ringtone?\" \"You still have a phone ?\" He asks, shocked. \"Yeah, why?\" \"How does it even have battery?\" He asks. I hold up a charger. \"What- wha…. Where do you find an outlet on an island?\" \"Pfft… are you stupid? It hasn't been charged since we were at the airport.\" I roll my eyes. \"You're crazy.\" He states. \"At least I don't randomly start singing show tunes every five minutes.\" I say. There are many idiots in our little group. And often times it is hard to pick one, but I have to say, that the craziest, biggest idiot of all us is- \"Howdy.\" Jay says, catching up with me as I climbed up some of the rocks on the beach. \"Hey.\" I say, pulling myself onto one of the taller rocks. \"Feeling better?\" He was referring to my recent loss. \"Definitely.\" I say, swinging my leg onto a jagged rock. I winced. \"That's awesome.\" He climbs up after me. \"Yeah, I guess.\" I climb up to the tallest rock. \"Hey look,\" I wave my arms back in forth, \"I'm king of the rock.\" \"Queen,\" He corrects me. \"Whatever.\" I look out to the waves. It had been more of a gloomy day. The clouds looked like they were going to pee their precipitation all over us any second now. Fog had already covered the rest of the beach. Jay stopped on the rock he was climbing and thought for a moment, \"I'm going to go start a fire. Come down soon?\" He questions me. \"Sure.\" I call down to him. And so I was left to my thoughts again. \"And so today we gather to mourn our beloved teammate, Emmett.\" Kory says in a mock serious voice. \"Kory, stop, that's mean.\" Fairbanks says. Texas smacks him upside the head. Kory sticks his tongue out at her but sits back down. \"Oh, what would I do without you all?\" I laugh. \"Eat brains?\" Texas asks. \"Drink blood?\" Jay asks. \"That's vampires, idiot.\" Bipolar shakes her head. \"Rawr.\" He snaps his teeth at her. Charlotte giggles. \"You would have died without the help of dear Russia.\" Russia winks at me. \"Of course, how could we forget dear Russia.\" I roll my eyes. \"I'm going to go to bed, I'll see y'all in the morning.\" Kory sighs. \"Night,\" We all call as he walks into the darkness. \"Yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.\" Bavaria says and follows him. Everyone but Jay gets up as well. \"Goodnight.\" I say to all of them. Then sigh and lean against a log. \"Don't think about it.\" Jay says, once again bringing up Emmett's death. \"I can't help it,\" I look at him. \"Is it bad that… I don't miss him?\" PLEASE VOTE! Who is the biggest idiot in the whole group? You decide! Review! Phew… DRAMA! Hey, why don't you guys post some things in the suggestion box?

Still excepting OCs! /1_/1 (=^ . ^=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 33] Still taking in your votes. I know, you've sent in so many, I just can't keep up. That's sarcasm. I'm going to quit this story, unless multiple people disagree. This may be the last chapter, so I'm sorry if it just ends. Anyone who has an \"Original Character\" in this fanfiction please let me know if you're still reading, otherwise I am going to kill your OC. \"Shh…\" Jay shushed me. I sucked in a breath and he covered his hand over my mouth. \"Shh.\" His hand was now wet with my tears. The others had no clue what was going on, and I don't know if I really did either. \"Please calm down, please.\" Jay whispered. He put his hand down and grabbed a nearby gun. \"You good?\" He asks. I nod. The sun was just about to rise; the rest of the group was still fast asleep inside the shelters, while Jay and I had been up all night watching the fire. The island had an eerie quietness to it. The trees behind us didn't move with the ocean breeze as it usually did. The sky was laced with clouds that looked as though they would bring rain soon. \"They're close.\" He hissed. \"Go wake the others, careful though.\" I do what he says and begin the trek to the other side of the beach that stretched across the whole island's perimeter. I passed the rocks I had climbed the afternoon before and then I would cross the low palm trees hiding the shelters. I had gotten as far as the rocks when I heard something. Crack. Hissssssssss. An infected head appeared. I cried out for Jay who responded with a \"Shit!\" and \"I'm coming!\" He sprinted over and just as he got here he realized he still had a gun in his hand. He rammed into the zombie and shot its brains out. \"Nice shot.\" I breathe barely above a whisper. \"Thanks,\" He looks toward the tents. \"That should wake 'em up.\" \"Jesus!\" Texas hissed as everyone exited the shelters. \"Are you insane?\" Bavaria asks. \"No. Well… yeah, but this isn't the time.\" Jay shrugs as another zombie exits the jungle. He blows it's brains to bits in one shot. \"How far done are we with the raft?\" I ask, thinking quickly. Adrenaline rush. \"Uhm… just a few more adjustments to make.\" Nick says thoughtfully. Then turns toward the raft, which was located near the shelters. \"Good, good. Anything important?\" Reaver catches onto my thinking just as quickly. \"Well, it could possibly save our lives… than again it could be useless.\" Nick scratches his head. I shrug, \"We can take the risk. Le'go.\" \"Are you sure?\" Kory asks me. Two zombies run at us with full force. Jay shoots one and Fairbanks cracks the others skull open with the tip of her shotgun. \"Very. Move.\" I command. We hurry to grab everything we need. Compass, maps, weapons, etc. But it seems we're not fast enough, the infected are coming at us with more and more each time. And when we finally get the raft into the water, just as the sun is visible, we realize something a little different about these particular zombies. \"What are they doing?\" Bipolar asks as Kory and Reaver push the raft out into the water as far as they can before they have to swim. \"They're… they're swimming!\" Charlotte gasps. \"Impossible!\" Nick growls. \"Maybe not,\" I turn to him. \"I think these guys are a little more advanced.\" \"Push faster!\" Russia hisses at the Kory and Reaver. \"Trying!\" Kory growls. \"Try harder.\" \"Communist.\" Kory mumbles. Russia reaches down and smacks his head. The two boys jump onto the raft as Nick and Bavaria paddle away from the beach with two sticks. The zombies were splashing into the water like the mindless freaks they were. They swarmed at the end of the beach, toppling over each other at the water's edge just to get to us. But it appeared as though Nick was right (again) and the zombies could not swim. \"Hah!\" Nick points in my face. \"I was right!\" He smiles to himself. \"Not like I doubted myself, of course.\" \"If you're so smart than I would appreciate it if you could figure out how to get us out of the ocean.\" I say, creeping away from the edge of the raft. \"Hand me a map.\" He sighs as Reaver hands him one of the maps that had proved useless until now. Nick stayed quiet while he studied it. I was truly exhausted. I had not slept since the morning before and was slowly falling asleep to the rocking back and forth of the waves on our wimpy little raft. The sun was hot overhead but it didn't keep my eyes from shutting besides my best attempt at staying awake. Things were quiet now, people too tired to speak. And with that I fell asleep. Like everyone when they dream, the first thing I saw was a dark tunnel. It then opened up into a small room. There were two chairs. I was in one, the other and its occupant sat faced toward me. It was Emmett… \" Look at me.\" He says stiffly, which confuses me since I am already face to face with him. \" You let me die.\" This left by paralyzed. What was I to say to that? I mean… it was true, wasn't it? \"I didn't let you die.\" He adds. \" You could have.\" I retort. He blinks. \"You really should have.\" I mumble. \" Whatever. None of this is my fault. Go back to your perfect little world out there. I don't want you here anyways.\" \" Then why am I here?\" I ask. He shrugs, \"You're dreaming.\" \" Why would I want to dream about you?\" I hiss. \" God knows.\" He shrugs again. \"Coincidence, guilt, fear… maybe you just miss me. And all that's left of me is up here.\" He taps my head. \" Makes sense.\" I nod, understanding. \" Of course it does. I'm logic. I'm your reasoning. I'm just a figment of your imagination.\" He rambles. Than looks at me and glares like I was supposed to be saying something. \" So… what's it like? Being dead?\" I ask out of curiosity. \" None of your damn business what it's like.\" He answers. \"' Course. Don't have to be mean about it.\" I say. He just glares in response. \" It's time for you to wake up now. Get out. Scram.\" He pushes me back in my chair, but grabs the leg before it hits the ground and I'm suspended in midair. \"One more thing.\" He says. \"We weren't far from Australia when we crashed the plane. It's somewhere west of the island. And uh… don't get wet.\" He let the chair fall. And fall I did. \"Christ!\" I gasped as a surge of cold water flooded the raft. The part of the group that wasn't fast asleep stared at me, wet and miserable. \"I knew it wouldn't last long.\" Nick says, not taking his eyes off me. Part of him looked amused. \"You act like you know everything,\" Bavaria rolls her eyes. \"It's not acting.\" Nick wiggles his eyebrows. Bavaria shoves him. It was these two, then Russia and Kory that were still awake. \"You're so full of yourself.\" Kory squints his eyes at Nick. \"And that's a lot coming from this dick.\" Russia laughs. \"You know it.\" Kory smiles. \"Not always.\" Nick says to himself. But no one else seemed to be listening. I will say it again. Still taking in votes for biggest idiot. Anyone who has an \"Original Character\" in this fanfiction please let me know if you're still reading, otherwise I am going to kill your OC. I wish you all a pleasant time between now and the next chapter. LAWLZ. ^.^ Gimme some feedback. PWEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSEE. /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 34] Hellooooooo my dearies. How are you? Hmmmmm I want more votes gosh darnit. And just so you know, it's not a poll; it's just reviewing and private messaging. Two weeks after leaving the island we were floating in the sea/ocean (I don't know, I was never any good at geometry… geology…. Geography. Yeah, that. Let's try that again. We were still on the raft, looking for land that hopefully had survived all the destruction done to our world so far. But that was a little much to hope for. \"Are we out of food?\" Kory dared to ask. Fairbanks glared at him but checked one of the backpacks anyways. Fresh out. \"God help all of us!\" Jay cries. I let out a small laugh but then realize that we're screwed. \"Oh my god!\" The long and miserable silence was broken by Texas who is screeching at the top of her lungs. \"What-what?\" Nick asks suddenly waking up and flopping around. \"I see… omigod!\" \"Out with it.\" Reaver demands. \"Land!\" She claps her hands together. \"You're shitting me.\" Kory says. \"Nope!\" She laughs and sits down. \"Row, slaves!\" Russia yells at Kory and Reaver. They cower and grab their \"ores.\" The sun is beating down hot even with the cold water splashing us every few seconds. Kory and Reaver were sweating from the work of rowing. But the land mass in the different grew larger and larger. You could almost feel the hope rising in amongst the group. It took hours, but we finally reached the beach's surface. \"Yes, thank you, thank you!\" Nick kissed the ground in a very cliché fashion. I myself had very much missed the land. It was so great to return to it… Even if it was in the form of an uninhabited island. \"Who are you?\" A new voice. Oh sweet Jesus. It was a Jamaican accent. \"We're…\" I turn around. \"We're screwed aren't we?\" The Jamaican man nods. WE were taken (by force) to a secretive location placed strategically in the middle of the jungle. It was a huge pit in the ground, four trees place around it. Small shacks were built along the giant branches of the canopy. But from our view (in the middle of the pit) life was not so pleasant. \"State your names.\" A new guy. He's very stout with a scruffy, white beard and sunglasses. He's wearing combat boots and pacing along the edge of the pit. \"I'm Minneapolis. This is Kory, Bipolar, Russia, Bavaria, Reaver, Texas, Jay, Nick, Fairbanks, Charlotte and...\" I trail off, realizing there was no one else to call. The guy (let's just call him commander, he kind of looks like one) raises an eyebrow but doesn't stop pacing. \"I'm Commander-\" \"Hah!\" I yell. I suddenly realize that was outside of my mouth…. And I had meant it only as a thought. \"Strike one. I'm Commander R.T. Jordan. We are a small tribe of survivors living on the outer perimeter of Australia. You seem not to be of any threat, but I will warn you now.\" He drops his voice down low, \"I am watching you. Screw up once, and I sharpen a stick on both ends.\" I briefly wonder what he means, but quickly realize I didn't want to find out. The commander walks away and the Jamaican takes his place. \"You are free to go about the village as you please. If you need anything feel free to talk to Commander or me, Moi. Talk to one of us before leaving the village.\" He nods and leaves in the opposite direction of the Commander. Later that evening we found ourselves in different shelters. We were high above the ground in the canopy of the trees, and if you got up from the soft bed on the floor to look out the window you could see the rest of the forest and the clearing where the pit was below you. But from here on the floor you could see the stars dancing in the dim light of the moon. They twirled and leapt but somehow kept their spot so high above me. All was quiet despite the soft snoring of Russia and the spasm every few minutes coming from Bipolar. Somehow we had ended up as \"Shelter-Mates\"… the first three. I had almost fallen asleep. Almost. Then a piercing scream filled the air. Bipolar suffers from a more harsh spasm and wakes herself up. Russia pulls out her gun and points it directly at me before even opening her eyes. She pops one open and glares at me. \" Vat da hell vas that?\" \"Someone was screaming.\" I shiver. \"A guy.\" Bipolar adds. Russia's head pops up as we all realize what happened. \" Kory .\" She hisses. She pushes herself up at the same time I do. Bipolar crawls to the door. A drum was beating. The slight glow of the fire sent chills running up and down my spine. A tear slipped, another one… that one wasn't mine. Charlotte whimpers and coughs. Russia and Bipolar stand close to me, shaking with silent sobs. Ominous. Nick shakes his head, frustrated. Bavaria sighs, Texas cries. Fairbanks wouldn't even come. Reaver is stone. Jay's silent but effective. A body is laid upon a row of branches. Leaves set out beneath it. One flower rests at its side… The flower was dead and poisonous. But I wouldn't tell anyone that. The body is marched past us. The drum quickens. The body is thrown into a new pit. It reeks of death and sorrow. Patches of blood splatter the wooden door covering the pit. The body is gone. Two eyes, a mouth, a nose… Dead. Hair, jaw, eyebrows, ears. But nothing past that. No neck, no body. Just a wooden stick, sharpened at both ends. Nothing was real anymore. We were all dead. The head disappears, soon the drumming stops, people go. I stay. Who was left? Anyone? \"Let's go.\" Says someone. Time passes. How much? Who could say. \"Please.\" Softer now. The voice grabs me by the arm and pulls me away from the clearing. Pulls me toward the beach. The water. Water... Time's ticking… the death clock is tick… tick… ticking. You there with the application that has not been made a character. Don't worry, next chapter most likely. Reaves: Charlotte will be more included as time passes and people die. Thank you all. Keep voting. Until… next time…? /1_/1 (= X . X =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 35] It's May and it's still snowing…. At least where I am-_- Depressing. And speaking of depressing: The village had become a sad and gloomy place. Though it was easier to focus on ourselves for once rather than each other's lives, we were all mourning. Well the majority of us anyways. \"And another one bites the dust.\" Commander laughs over a bottle of Corona. Where do you even get beer in the middle of the jungle? It seemed there were things they still weren't telling us. No one laughed with him, but ate in silence. \"You're all spineless little girls.\" He takes another sip. \"'Specially you.\" He glared at Charlotte. \"That's because she is little.\" Reaver growls protectively. Charlotte starts coughing uncontrollably. \"Let me tell you something you ignorant fool. No one is innocent in this war. We're all a bunch of murderers.\" Commander slams his bottle onto the poorly built wooden table and stands up abruptly. He walks off into the darkness. We were sitting outside near the fire at a large table built for gatherings such as these. Or really daily meals. Either way they never ended well. \"That bastard.\" Reaver stands glaring at the Commander's back. \"Calm down.\" I try. \"But-\" Reaver knew he was in a losing argument so he sat back down. \"There is nothing left to do, mon.\" Moi shakes his head and walks toward the shelters. Then stops and turns, \"You best be keeping your head, or you'll lose it just like you're friends.\" He points to the pit, then continues to walk. Fairbanks shoved her chair back and stomped away. \"I'm going to bed.\" Many people agreed and left the table. Reaver, Bavaria and I were left in silence. \"Who do you think is next?\" I ask quietly. \"Who's the next dumbest person in the group?\" Reaver laughed darkly. \"A good question.\" Bavaria nods. Silence; that conversation was over. I stood up and walked around, mosquitoes buzzed around the air, threatening to bring itchy bumps that would mean nothing anymore. After living in Minnesota for so long you get used to it. \"Where are you going?\" Nick's voice behind me. I turn to face him. A long cut was beginning to form on his left cheekbone, somehow I had failed to notice that. \"I don't know.\" I mumbled. Nick waited for an answer. I glared back at him. \"We should leave.\" He suggests after a few minutes. \"I know. But I don't know where we would go.\" I sigh, sitting on a fallen tree. \"We could go further into the jungle, find a city.\" Nick sits across from me on another tree trunk that showed signs of once being on fire. \"I don't think… what if they don't let us leave?\" I ask thoughtfully. \"And what if they do?\" \"Hey!\" Russia was running down the side of the hill that we were sitting on. \"Causing trouble?\" She asks while sitting down next to me. \"We're trying to think of the next place.\" I say. \"Minneapolis. We can't just keep running from place to place.\" Nick shakes his head. \"What else are we supposed to do?\" Russia asks him. It's quiet, you can almost hear the gears turning in our heads. \"Let's find somewhere to stay. I don't like this whole nomadic lifestyle we have.\" Nick sighs. Another long pause. The crickets chirped in the trees. Weird bugs and birds and other animals made up the music of the jungle. They were wild but so were we. Once we lived normal lives and now… now we were all our own monsters. \"Alright.\" I say finally. Nick and Russia look at me, shocked. \"Alright?\" \"All right: Without a doubt. A word used to add assertion to a mood.\" I say. \"Okay then, tomorrow we escape.\" Nick says. \"Do you really have to say escape?\" I ask. \"Do we know if they'll let us just leave?\" I think about that, \"Escape it is.\" A History Class Special: \"In the year 2012 what major event changed our lives?\" Ms. Fields asks her class. \"The world ended?\" \"A gasoline spill?\" \"Zombie Apocalypse?\" \"Very good, Hansel!\" Ms. Fields claps her hands together. \"And what happened?\" Lumi, Hansel's twin sister raised her hand, \"Zombies took over the world and a lot of people died.\" She says shyly. \"Good job, Lumi!\" The teacher sings. These were second graders, and their teacher treated them as such. \"Does anyone know anything else about this major event in history?\" \"Well…\" Lumi looks at Hansel before continuing, \"Our mommy and papa were survivors of the Zombie Apocalypse.\" \"Yeah! Mine, too!\" A few kids screamed excitedly. \"Settle down, settle down. Does anyone know how it began?\" \"A nuclear cloud exploded in Asia and a disease began. It quickly spread to the rest of the world.\" Says the smartest kid in the class, Wilber. \"Precisely.\" Ms. Fields smiles. \"Show off!\" Jr. yells. \"Yeah, show off.\" Says another kid. \"Four eyes!\" \"Freak!\" Wilber lowers his head and sits silently through the rest of class. He knew his father was a hero, and someday he would be, too. Majorly short chapter, sorry. Last chance before I destroy your characters if you haven't already talked to me. :D /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 36] Wow. I'm loving all this reviewing you people have been doing. Yes, I am a My Little Pony fan. (Pegasister) If you want me to add your character it would be really useful to know its gender. If you recall, when Commander was talking to the group about being safe and whatever he mentioned that if you doing anything wrong he sharpens a stick on both ends. This term originates from the book \"Lord of the Flies \" by William Golding (I think). It basically is saying that Commander will hunt them down with a sharpened stick and cut their head off. Then the head will be placed on the stick and with the other end will be stuck in the ground. Kory broke the rules by making a smart remark because well… Kory's an idiot. Good enough explanation? If anyone would like to count the number of characters for me and let me know how many there are I promise to love you forever. Not really but you get the point. Last chance to save you characters. If things turned out like I didn't plan, key word: didn't. Then we would be far away from this stupid tribe in less than three hours before they could realize that we were gone. But chances of that working out were… well they were actually pretty good. \"You all set?\" Nick asks me, hauling a bag on his back. How we had not lost all of our equipment yet I do not know. \"Sure,\" Finishing sharpening my axe and tying it onto my back. Then reloading my pistol and putting it in the holster. \"I'm readier than a baboon in a fire nest.\" Jay grins. \"Mmmhm. That's nice.\" I say. \"Let's kill some zombies.\" Bavaria grabs a shotgun. It was three in the morning. The villagers were still asleep for the most part, but there were some we'd have to sneak past without suspicion. There were five different guards we could go to, and there were like ten of us… so we had to go in pairs. \"Alright people!\" Texas shouted (quietly of course to keep the neighbors asleep). \"We're using the buddy system here, so grab a partner and head out!\" Russia grabs her whip and pulls Bipolar out of whatever confusion she was in and they set out. The next pair was Fairbanks and Texas then Bavaria and Nick. I look to Reaver but he shakes his head and takes his little sister's hand and pulls her out of the shelter. I look unenthusiastically at Jay and sigh. \"Move it, buttmunch.\" I push him out of the room. \"Yes ma'am.\" He says sarcastically. We walk to the guard waiting at the opening of the fence which surrounded the village. Oh lucky us, we got Commander. \"Hello, sir.\" I say, saluting you. Jay stifled a laugh. \"What do you want?\" He huffs. \"We're going for a stroll.\" I cough. \"At three in the morning?\" Commander raises an eyebrow. \"It's no fun when it's light out.\" Jay says. Commander glares at us. \"Come on, we both know, that you know, that I know, that she knows,\" He jabs a finger at me,\" That I know, that you know what I'm talking about.\" The commander rolls his eyes, \"Go.\" Jay and I nod and walk into the jungle. \"What did you mean?\" I ask awhile later as we were looking for the others. \"Hm… Y'know, I don't know.\" Jay shrugs. Somewhere in the trees you can hear a bird that just doesn't sounds quite right. \"Do you hear that?\" I ask. \"Yeah, ain't ever heard no bird like that.\" \"Hm…. Oh, I get it.\" I roll my eyes. \"Nick! You don't need to pretend you're a bird, we're far enough away. \"If you say so.\" Him and Bavaria come out from the trees. \"Anyone else with you?\" Jay asks them. \"Nope, you're the first we've found.\" Nick says. \"Oh, I hope the rest are okay.\" Bavaria winces. \"They'll be fine.\" I say. Just then we hear gunshots and yelling. \"God damn it. Run!\" We rush ourselves deeper into the trees. There were footsteps and I turned around to see if they were following us. When I looked back I was inches from another person. \"Oof!\" I fell backwards. I look up, dazed. \"Let's go,\" Reaver helps me back up and we take off again. Him and I had lost the other but you could hear footsteps and heavy panting everywhere. \"Ouch!\" Someone yelled, then there was a thud. \"Do you see that?\" Reaver breaths. \"See what?\" I pant. \"Never mind, follow me.\" He swerves suddenly and I chase him out right out of the jungle and into a clearing. A metal fence stopped us from going any further. I seized the fence and climbed it like a squirrel. It was at least ten feet tall but didn't take long for me to pass. Reaver jumped down behind me. \"Come on!\" We run into a shack and lock the door. \"Are we safe?\" I ask, not really thinking. \"We are… but not sure about the others.\" Reaver sighs. \"Oh my god,\" my brain begins to function again. \"the others!\" I get up. Then look at Reaver who was deep in thought. \"Where's Charlotte?\" \"I lost her back there when we heard the gun shots. We had already found Russia and Bipolar and she followed them while I went in the other direction. \"Russia and Bipolar? She should be alright. I trust them…\" I start to open the door. \"Coming?\" \"I think I'll stay here.\" He sighs. \"Alright.\" I look out. \"Careful out there.\" Reaver says. I nod and close the door behind me. There were pools of blood. But I didn't recognize any of the bodies. Was it possible that we all made it? I hear a scream, a familiar voice. It was Texas. \"Texas!\" I say relieved. But then I see the people behind her. \"Go!\" She shouts at me. I shake my head and raise the only gun I had left. \"What are you doing? You can't make it from back-\" I pull the trigger, one of the guards fall behind her. \"There…\" \"Reaver's in that shack over there. Go, I'll hold them off.\" I command. I pull out my axe. It seemed brutal to kill living people with this but… a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. \"Let's go!\" I yell. \"Thank god you're all safe.\" Fairbanks says quietly. \"Yeah, so my plan worked after all.\" I say sitting on a crate full of hamburger buns. A box of buns for meh buns.:3 \"Sure did.\" Jay nods. \"Hey, where are we anyways?\" Russia asks. \"I saw a pool outside.\" Charlotte says. \"I saw a tall building, I think.\" Says Bipolar. \"I think I may know where we are.\" Russia says. Sorry, a pretty boring chapter… Oh well.(: New characters soon. /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 37] Hai er'body! The daylight burned our eyes. For a second it was impossible to see our surroundings, and then a tall building emerged from the trees. There were other buildings, small huts that. Like Charlotte observed earlier, there were pools for every few buildings. \"We're at the Te Tiare Beach Resort, Huahine.\" Russia says. \"I came here once as a child.\" \"It's beautiful but…\" Reaver pulls out his map. \"You can hardly see it on the map.\" He squints. \"It's pretty far from New Zealand.\" \"Well… close enough.\" I say. \"Now. What to do, what to do.\" I begin pacing around the area, studying it. \"Are there zombies here?\" Someone says. I ignore them and look at a pool of blood. \"Are. There. Zombies.\" I look at Bipolar. She was in her annoying mood and I didn't want to deal with it. \"Of course there are zombies.\" And I walk closer to the next shack. \"But let's find out.\" I motion for Reaver to come closer and put a finger over my lips. \"Sh.\" I bust the lock open with the back of my axe and burst in the door. Then there's the inevitable, \"Ouuuhmmmmannnnnn.\" \"We got ourselves a hot one!\" I howl. \"What does that even mean?\" I hear Reaver behind me. \"It means grab your gun.\" \"I think you've been hang out with Jay too much.\" He pulls his gun out and shoots the damn thing. \"Thanks. Now let's get out of here.\" I dance my way out of the shack. \"God damn!\" I sing. \"I think I missed killing them sons of bitches!\" \"You didn't kill it. I did.\" Reaver reminds me. \"It's better than when we were with those control freak, psychopaths.\" I point toward the jungle. \"Maybe… Maybe they weren't crazy…\" Charlotte whispers. \"Huh?\" Reaver asks her. \"Well… I'm just trying to say… well… maybe we're the crazy ones. Maybe we've changed. \" \"None sense!\" Russia cries. \"Yeah, yeah. Now let's get to kill'n. We'll go in groups. Russia, Jay, Nick, you're with me. Reaver, Charlotte and Bipolar, go to that tower over there,\" I pointed to a radio tower, \"And see if you can get a signal started. Fairbanks, Texas and Bavaria, you look for supplies in these shacks. Nick… I changed my mind. Go with Reaver, Charlotte and Bipolar. Got it?\" I ask. \"See ya!\" Nick waves. \"Later.\" Texas says. Reaver grabs my arm, \"You going to the hotel?\" \"Yup.\" \"Be careful.\" \"Of course. If anything happens down here. Let me know right away.\" I dig through my backpack and toss him a phone. \"See if this'll do you any good. My number's on speed dial… three.\" I say. \"Good luck.\" \"Same to you.\" I motion for Jay and Russia to follow me. We walked toward the tallest building as the silence started to set in. This was quite possible the most dangerous thing we've done in a while. And as usual I didn't really have a strategy. But I hoped things would turn sunny side up… as the always had. \"What do you think is in the hotel?\" Russia asks us. \"No clue. Civilization? Preferably not as crazy and strict as our last encounter with people.\" I say. \"Sounds good. Or there could be the more likely option.\" Russia smiles. \"Zombies!\" Jay pumps his fists in the air. I sigh, but they ignore me. Switching to 3 rd person… sorry if I screw up…. Bavaria waited just outside the shack keeping guard. Fairbanks and Texas were inside looking for food and other stuff. They had been in there for a while and Bavaria started to get worried. \"Everything okay in there?\" She called inside. No response. \"Guys?\" Silence. Then an ear piercing scream emerged from inside the shack. Bavaria ran inside and to her horror saw one of the girls in a blood pool on the floor. Texas knelt on the ground next to her, backed away from a giant, hulking body in the corner. It moaned out of the darkness. \"Go! Go get help!\" Texas cried. \"But…\" Bavaria couldn't form words. A bite mark on Texas' left arm appeared. \"Go!\" She repeated herself. And Bavaria ran out the door to find the others. 1 st person \"Wow.\" Jay says looking around. \"That's a lot of cars.\" \"They might be useful. We need to find an airport, by the way.\" I remind them making my way around the cars whose lights were on… didn't want to start any alarms… \"Jesus shit. Again?\" Jay asks annoyed. \"Of course.\" I yawn. \"Ain't ever letting you fly that god damn plane again.\" He glares at me. I glare back. \"Who else is going to?\" I ask. \"I think Nick can.\" Russia says thoughtfully. \"What?!\" Jay and I ask at the same time. \"Yeah, I think he mentioned it while we were at the airport.\" Well gee, that would have saved a lot of time. \"So you're telling me…\" Jay starts. I finish for him, \"That we could have been in Australia this whole time?\" \"It's possible.\" Russia smiles. \"Oh, well in that case…\" I slap Russia's head. \"Ow…\" She winces. \"Oh like you haven't dealt with worse.\" I roll my eyes. She shrugs. I then realize that we lost Jay. \"How the hell… Jay!\" I call. \"Var da hell did he go?\" Russia hisses. \"You know the question we should be asking is where could he have gone? \" I sigh. We searched for the next twenty minutes without any luck. \"That's it. He's gone.\" I sigh. \"He'll turn up somewhere.\" Russia says. \"Maybe.\" Yay! /1_/1 (= ' .

Rather than Jay it turned out to be Bavaria just covered in blood from head to toe and red faced. \"Don't tell me…\" I start. \"Oh it was horrible! We were checking in this one shack-that one, by the pool- and it seemed safe- It wasn't really different from the rest- really it did seem safe- and we expected a few zombies.- But there was this big massive one and he and and…\" \"And?\" I urge. \"Fairbanks and Texas… well they're… um…\" \"Dead.\" Russia guesses. I sigh, cover my face with my hands. Then my mind returns to Jay. \"Shit.\" I uncover my faces and start toward the doors. \"But… what are we going to-\" \"We don't have time for this Bavaria.\" I say pushing passed the doors and- \"Welcome.\" A cheery girl at the front desk smiles. Wait. What? \"My name is Lauren. Do you have a reservation? Or are you a part of our member's club?\" She asks. \"Vat… da fawq.\" Russia's jaw drops. Lauren giggles in a very creep sort of way. I place my axe on the spotless counter and lean in to the crazy girl, \"I'm looking for a certain redneck. Tan skin, bout ye tall.\" I hold my hand up to Jay's approximate height. \"Hmm…. No. You're our first guest today.\" \"Our?\" I ask, disappointed. \"Oh, yes. We've actually had a rapid decline in both guests and employees lately.\" Lauren says thoughtfully, \"Though I can't imagine why. All that's left is me… Nel, and… oh what was their names…\" A long silence passed as she thought. \"That's right, we need a room. No we do not have reservations and no we aren't members. I want to be on the lowest floor and it better be two beds.\" I demand, slamming my fist on the counter. \"Oh! Right away. I'll show you to your room.\" She grabs to room keys and wanders down a hall into an elevator. We go up two floors, passed the lobby, ballroom and whatever X stands for. Lauren leads us down another hall and show us room 427. \"Here you go! If you need anything I'm right downstairs!\" She says cheerfully and skips out of sight. I set my backpack on one of the desks and rest my axe near the TV. God… I forgot those even existed. Russia throws her stuff on the floor and flops onto the bed furthest from the window. I sit on the edge of the bed and sigh. \"That was scary.\" \"Fucking crazy.\" Russia agrees. We sit quietly again as Bavaria sits down on the floor, quiet until now. \"What… what do we do?\" \"What do you mean?\" I ask her. \"Well… Texas. She wasn't… she wasn't really dead. She was bitten and we can't just let her suffer!\" Bavaria spits out. \"I'll call Reaves.\" I say turning on my phone. Then I stand up, grab the charger out of my backpack and plug it into the wall. I hit the call button and wait. \" You know that is really weird.\" He says. \" What is?\" I ask. \" Using a phone again. I thought I was dying when it started buzzing.\" I laugh, \"Funny. Hey, I need a favor of you.\" \" What's up?\" \" Well… it's pretty gruesome you sure?\" I don't wait. \"Right, anyways. Fairbanks and Texas are dead. Well technically Texas is a zombie and I need you to put her out of her misery.\" Reaver hisses and sucks in a breath, \"You want me to do your dirty work?\" \" Thanks. I'll catch up with you later.\" I ignore him. \" Wait! Wait! You can't just expect me to-\" Click. Oh yes I can. \"Now we only need to find Jay.\" I say putting the phone away. \"Minneapolis… just face it. He is… gone.\" Russia sighs. \"No.\" I point the butt of my axe toward her. \"But…\" \"Fine. You stay here. I'm going to find him myself.\" I hiss and slam the door behind me. Okay… Maybe that wasn't the best way to handle that. But… whatever. Jay's not gone. He can't be gone. He's too stupid to be gone. \"What are you doing here, mon. This be a restricted area.\" Jamaican. \"Who…?\" \"Ah, where are my manners? I am Nel the janitor.\" \"Nice to meet you, Minneapolis.\" I hold out my hand. Nel raises an eyebrow, unfamiliar with the gesture and I put my hand back. \"Have you seen anyone come by here? Maybe a younger guy, black hair… blue eyes, tan skin. Pretty much an idiot.\" \"Yes. One person. But I just thought… maybe he be the…\" \"A zombie?\" I ask. \"If that's what you call them.\" He shrugs then shivers. \"He was climbing up this wall.\" He points toward the end of the hallway. \"Good luck, mon.\" I run to the elevator and press the highest floor. I wait, listening to the cheesy music. When the doors open I look around the hallway for a way to get up stairs. Then I see a lever on the ceiling and realize it's a door. \"Damned if I do. Damned if I don't.\" I say to myself and jump up and grab the lever. Hanging by my fingertips, I pull myself through the opening and into a ventilation system. \"God forgive me.\" I whisper. And crawl through the vents. One hour later… I see light. I shove a piece of metal out of my way. \"Thank you!\" I squeal. I breathe a sigh of relief and look out onto the roof. Out of nowhere I hear a gunshot. \"What…?\" \"Jay!\" I squeal again. Geez, two squeals in five minutes… what am I becoming? \"Minne… Mineapolis!\" He puts the gun down and runs over. Pulling me into a hug that lifted me off that ground. I wheezed something out that was completely incoherent. \"What was that?\" He loosens his grip a little. \"Put… me… down…. Shiebekoff.\" I hiss. \"Oh, sorry.\" He puts me down and grimaces. \"Don't you ever do that again!\" I screech. \"Do what? Pick you up?\" He asks. \"No.\" I say, looking away. \"Then… what?\" He say to my back because I'm already on my way back down. He grabs my arm, \"Minne.\" \"What?\" I growl. \"Please?\" I hesitate for a moment. \"Don't ever leave me again.\" Jay smiles deviously. I hit him upside the head. I'm going to get yelled at for that… but… whatever. Come get me MOFOS!:D Oke seeya laterz BAI! /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 39] Dear readers, Thank you Lauren Cunningham for giving me more character information. England… either you haven't been reading or you're just ignoring me. -_- Jay… you know what? In my imagination it is possible to crawl through air vents. Thanks for all the reviews, everyone!^.^ *Mario voice* Here we go! _████████████ -_██▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ M ▓████ -_██████░░░░██░░██████ ██░░░░████░░░░██░░░░░░██ -_████░░░░░░░░░░██ ██▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓████▓▓▓▓█: -_██░░░░░░████░░███: -_██▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓██ -_██████████████ Jay and I made our way down from the roof of the hotel. I couldn't wait to get back to the group and prove them wrong. But despite that… **** Okay so right now I'm watching Kronk's new groove and I'm laughing so hard… omg. Had to tell you. Okay continue**** I was still upset with Jay. He still hasn't told me why he left… but I could figure that out later. \"Hah!\" I yelled busting down the door. \"What the- oh. He's alive.\" Russia says and goes back to the card game that her and Bavaria were playing. Not even half the reaction I wanted. \"Missed you too, Russia.\" Jay smiles ignorantly. Wow he's a dumbass. \"Flush.\" Russia sighs laying down her cards, standing up, and stretching. She walked over to my phone and tossed it to me. \"Reaver called about a million times.\" She yawns. \"And you didn't answer it…why?\" I ask. \"Well he called you, not me.\" Russia raises an eyebrow and sits down on her bed. \"We're going to need more rooms.\" I say waiting for Reaver to pick up. \"I'm on it.\" Jay starts toward the door. \"Stay.\" I stop him. \" Took you long enough.\" Reaver hisses. \" Skip the welcome wagon, Reaver. Tell me what's going on.\" I study my nails. \" Texas has become quite the problem.\" I don't say anything. \" Minneapolis?\" Nope. \" Please.\" He sighs. \" Why is she a problem?\" I ask. \" Remember what she was like when she was living?\" \" Not really.\" \" Well she's worse now… wait- what?\" I ignore him, \"I'll be there in a bit. Gonna bring some friends. But we found a place to stay.\" I say clicking the end call button. \"Let's go.\" I drag Jay out of the door. \"What do you want us to do?\" Bavaria calls. \"Something.\" I say bluntly. Jay and I walk down the hall and to the elevators. I push the lobby button and wait. I hate elevators. Always have. They are unreliable and annoying. And right now Jay was standing too close. I shove him to the other side of the elevator as the doors open. We are just about to pass the doors when- \"Do you need me to call a taxi?\" It's that girl again. \"No.\" \"Do you want to take a travel guide? Maybe you can-\" \"No.\" \"Is everything okay? I can call in a thera-\" \"No.\" \"Well is there anything I can…\" \"Yes, actually,\" I turn around. \"can you book three more rooms?\" \"Sure thing!\" She goes straight to her computer and Jay and I take our chance to escape. \"Who was that?\" Jay asks, very confused. \"Oh, her? That's Lauren. She's okay.\" I shrug. I look around and find a valet key rack. I grab a random set of keys and start looking for the parking spot that matched the number. \"When did we meet her?\" He scratches his head. \"You actually think I remember?\" I ask. \"Huh?\" \"Yeah, that's right.\" I sigh. I press the unlock button and see the lights on a purple jeep flash. Jesus. \"You want to drive?\" I ask. \"Sure.\" He shrugs. I toss him the keys and side the jeep, getting in the passenger side. It turns out Jay drives like a rapid polar bear. I'm not even sure how we're still alive. But I do know that we killed a few zombies on the way… well I hope they were zombies… \"And you think that my plane flying skills are bad.\" I say almost falling out of the vehicle. \"Hey, don't blame the man blame the-\" \"Oh, good. You're here.\" Bipolar greets us. \"Somehow.\" \"Where's Texas?\" Jay asks. \"She's in there… or what's left of her.\" Bipolar shrugs. \"Why isn't she dead, yet?\" I grunt. \"I don't think Nick or Reaver could bring themselves to do it.\" She sighs. \"And you?\" Jay asks. \"Not me! No way!\" Bipolar shakes her head. \"Alright.\" I take the gun that she was holding and walk into the shack that Texas was in. All that's left of Fairbanks is a bloody mess. Texas' gurgling body stood motionless, face to the wall. With her back to me I could easily get the job done and have it off my hands in just a few seconds. But no, life couldn't be that easy. \"You almost done in there?\" Jay calls from outside. This intrigues Texas and she whips around to face me. \"You're next Jay!\" I yell over my shoulder. \"Hello Texas.\" I say aiming the gun. \"GRRRWWWBbbbllllo.\" \"Mhmmm. Mhmm. See you in the next life.\" I shoot the gun. Pew and dead. \"Yay!\" Jay cheers from outside. I walk out and hit him with my gun. \"Please shut up.\" Later that night I was bored and couldn't sleep. So I decided to go back up to the roof. \"Hey there!\" I hear behind me and I nearly fall off the roof. \"Woah.\" Jay catches me before I do. \"Thanks.\" I growl. He sits next to me on the edge of the building. \"So…\" \"You never told me what you were doing up here earlier.\" I say. \"Oh yeah, I was trying to get a better view of the island when I saw these guys down below… They were chasing someone so I just shot them down.\" He shrugs. I smile. \"Why are you smil'n like a goat in a briar patch?\" He asks. I roll my eyes. \"What? You're not hitting me.\" He gasps. \"No,\" I say. \"This is an all new you!\" He exclaims. \"Jay?\" \"I don't think I've ever actually seen you smile.\" \"Jay.\" \"That makes me giddier than a bat-\" Before he can finish I kiss him just to shut him up. There's a long silence. \"Why'd you do that?\" \"It was either that or push you off the roof.\" I say standing up and leaving. Yeah… he's gonna hurt me for that… but whatever. :D Oke. Well until next time my friends… /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 40] I'm sorry that it's been so long. I've been trying to get through the rest of school and haven't had time to write. I just received a stuffed bear… his name is Shackleton Bear. If you have ever read Endurance which is quite possibly one of the most boring books I have ever read, then you would understand. Either way I have a Shackleton Bear. And he is awesome. Very. Awesome. Downstairs in the lobby an entire breakfast had been made for many people. Who it was made for was a good question. Who it was made by was an even greater question. \"Good morning, friends.\" Nel appears in the hallway. \"Morning.\" I smile at him. \"Did she just smile?\" I hear Reaver whisper to Bipolar. \"What's the plan for today?\" Russia asks me. I shrug, sitting down at a table near where the many breakfast foods had been placed. \"Hey, Lauren. There isn't any human in this is there?\" I ask. Her head pops up from behind the desk. She looks scared. Then she laughs nervously. \"Uhm… heh, no uhm… funny.\" She tries to smile but it falters and I laugh. How can you seriously not notice a disease that has taken over the entire world around you? Beats me. \"Minneapolis it's not nice to scare people like that.\" Reaver chastises me. \"Awwwww. But it's soooo fun.\" I whine, propping my feet up on the table in front of me. Russia joins me. \"This girl I swear,\" Jay shakes his head. \"You could give her Heaven and Earth - she'd still want a tater patch in hell.\" He then proceeds to scoop up a plate full of mashed potatoes. \"Jay… what the hell is that supposed to mean?\" I glare at him as he sits in front of me on the other side of the table. \"It means a lot of things.\" He says simply. I open my mouth to say something but am cut off by Nick shoving my legs off the table. \"You've forgotten quite a bit of your manners, too. Haven't you?\" I cross my arms, than stand up to go get my own food. Bavaria, Bipolar and Charlotte sit down at the table, same with Reaver. \"So… what are we supposed to do now?\" Bavaria asks me when I come back. I sigh, setting my plate on the table and picking at the food with my fork. \"I'm really not sure…\" The whole table gasps. There's a very long silence. \"I think…\" Russia starts. We wait, eager to know what she has to say. \"Well I… I've been doing some research.\" Russia fixes her glasses and looks up at us. \"The virus that began the apocalypse was by a toxic gas that spread into people's lungs and went into their blood, causing it to pump through the blood system, heart and brain. But there was actually two contributing causes. The main one was a nuclear cloud that exploded in North Korea. Since North Korea had separated itself from the rest of the world, no one had knowledge of this event. But after doing some digging I found this information in a newspaper. The newspaper had the cause of the gas cloud, but the only problem is that the newspaper factory had been suspiciously burned down immediately after the papers had been printed. The article I had found was only a burnt morsel of the story. \"The second contributing factor was an unexpected asteroid shower that hit Russia. During the time I had been studying physics and psychology in Japan. When the asteroids hit, my home was destroyed, so I never returned.\" Russia sighs, than continues, \"The gas cloud had been filled with many poisonous particles, that could easily kill an entire population. But other elements that had filled the cloud stopped it from doing so. When I learned what was in the cloud my immediate reaction was that the cloud was only a minor coincidence. But then I saw that there was a similar element in both the cloud and the asteroids. Chlorine. This chemical could kill anything in its path instantly, but it was combined with Germanium. A somewhat harmless element and could be considered an essential to life forms. Although, synthetic soluble Germanium salts are considered an irritant. This is exactly what was found in the asteroid. When the Chlorine, Germanium mixture hit the Earth's troposphere and mixed in with the oxygen and nitrogen, it became a deadly virus that would put the human population's mind into a bizarre state. It caused a craving for itself. The twist is that the hunger is not for other humans, but really the Germanium, Chlorine mixture. Chloranium. And that is what's causing the apocalypse.\" Russia finishes. We all stare at her dumbfounded. \"I don't understand. So I disagree.\" Jay says. \"Wait,\" Nel says walking over, \"Dat means dat ther is still a cure.\" \"Precisely.\" Russia says, shocked. \"We only need to find a way to reverse the Chloranium.\" Nel adds, nodding. \"Yes! And the only thing we need is-\" \"Potassium!\" The two say at the same time. \"It's all so clear now.\" Bavaria rolls her eyes. \"That means about as much to me as strawberry up a bear's butt.\" Jay crosses his arms and leans back in his chair. \"You're not very smart, are you?\" Russia sighs. \"It's my Mother's fault. I was never like this 'till I was born.\" He shrugs. Then falls of his chair. \"Minne, I have a favor of you.\" Russia turns to me. \"Crap.\" \"I need you to go back to the jungle-\" \"Hell no.\" \"And get me as many bananas as possible.\" Jay stands up from the floor, \"Hell yes! Let's go get some o' that Posatnium!\" \"Potassium.\" I correct him, reluctantly getting up from my chair and leaving a perfectly good breakfast. \"Whatever cranks your tractor.\" He shrugs and grabs his gun from under the table. I lower my head and motion for Nick to follow. The rest can stay. So a little science lesson for y'all. Sorry it was kind of a lot to explain. Anyway, see you soon!:D /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 41] Hallo! Let's just get started. No special introductions. If you want to translate the two languages I'm using is German and Serbian. Wait… Nick, Ich wird haben meine rache! \"If I were a banana where would I be?\" Jay wonders as we scour the wild jungle for non-other than the possible cure to all of humanity, saving our lives and all the world's as well, the leading source of potassium… bananas. \"I would prefer you as a banana.\" Nick mumbles. \"Jay, be a banana.\" I command. \"Well that's just-\" \"Bananas don't talk.\" I cover his mouth with my hand. He licks it and I smack him, shrieking, than proceed to wipe my hand on his hair. \"Gross.\" \"But Minneapolis your tongue has-\" \"Schweigen!\" I shove him down a slope that we had been walking past. He tumbles down into a river, and thankfully stands up unharmed… but visually upset. \"What was that for?\" Nick asks. \"Der junge bedroht zu verschütten meine geheimnisse... so ich gedumpten ihm in das fluss. \" I say. Nick looks at me with a baffled expression. \"Boy get dumped in river. \"And your logic behind it is...? \" He asks. I roll my eyes and dump Nick into the river as well. A few minutes later the two boys return, muddy and frowning. I laugh, and continue down the small clearing with them following behind. \"There! Do you see that?\" Jay points up into the trees. \"Uhm…\" \"It's a monkey.\" Nick says flatly. \"Exactly!\" Jay grins, beginning to climb a sturdy tree. \"So the monkey is exciting because it what?\" I ask. \"Well what do monkeys eat?\" Jay asks, halfway up the tree. It was like a natural ability of his. \"Lots of things, bugs, leaves, wild berries…\" Nick begins. \"And?\" \"And what?\" Nick hisses. He didn't seem so excited that Jay was interrupting him. \"Bananas!\" Jay leaps from one tree to the next in attempts to follow the monkey. He swings on a vine and- \"Jay! That's ridiculous! That's only a stereotype, monkeys don't actually eat…\" Nick trails off as we come upon a large clearing… that of which was filled with the doubted fruit. \"Bananas…\" Jay gives us a sly grin, swinging down to the ground on a nearby branch and winks at me. \"Now let's bring some of that posatnium-\" \"Potassium.\" \" Potassium back to the hotel so we can save the world.\" Jay picks a bunch of bananas and me up, grabbing a vine, me screaming as he takes us back to the hotel… monkey style. Also leaving Nick alone in the jungle. \"You're still here?\" I question Reaver as I walk through the lobby doors. He, Bipolar, Bavaria and Charlotte were still sitting there. \"Yeah, Nel and Russia went off to go do some crazy biz.\" He shrugs, leaning back in his chair. \"I see you didn't learn a lesson from Jay earlier.\" I roll my eyes, hanging my backpack on the coat rack next to the table. Reaver quickly comes to his senses and sits upright. \"Glad I was of service.\" Jay nods, passing the eating area and heading towards the elevator. I quickly follow. The doors open and him and I step inside. A silence that really should be awkward follows, but we're not much for unneeded emotions anymore. \"So how far do you think Russia and Nel are in their research?\" Jay asks me as we walk down the hall to the room. \"Oh I don't know,\" I say, sliding the key through the door. \"My bets are that they're pretty far, I mean currently they are saving the world…\" I open the door, look inside and immediately slam it back into place. Shaking. \"Minne, what's wrong?\" Jay asks, confused. I slump against the door frame and sink to my knees, covering my eyes. \"Hello?\" \"They're certainly not saving the world in there.\" I gag. I peek out from behind my hands and see Jay's eyes widen. \"Lord have mercy on your soul.\" He hugs me. \"I'd rather stare directly at the sun the go in there.\" Just then the door bursts open with Russia's hair in a mess and Nel's pants only halfway up. \"Minneapolis!\" Russia gasps, hands covering her mouth. \"I am so sorry!\" My face contorts as I rush away towards the hallway bathroom. 3 rd Person Somewhere in the middle of the jungle… Sacrifice dečaka! Za našeg šefa! Uzmi mu poklon! više čista! Nick hears chanting as he makes his way in the wrong direction out of the jungle. Sacrifice dečaka! Za našeg šefa! Uzmi mu poklon! više čista! He wondered what that could be. Who it could be. He hid beneath a pile of large leaves and peered out through the openings. A group of tan people with straw skirts and red tattoos became visible. The majority of the group consisted of women and who, as Nick suddenly noticed, were not wearing anything to cover their chests. Nick, clearly a gentleman and former farm boy, looks away, blushing. ****Rache ist lieb, ist es nicht?**** The two men in the group threw their spears down as the leader of the pack, an unusually muscular woman, commanded something in the foreign language. \"Ja ga osetim!\" She cries, looking around then straight to were Nick was hiding. \"Tamo.\" \"Da!\" The two men nod in unison. The march toward the leaves and pull Nick out of the brush. Exposing him to the entire group. \"What do you want!?\" He cries. The two men were lifting him off the ground by his arms, which seemed impossible by Nick's height. \"Čistoće. Dečak je čist. Novi. Savršen za naš vođa. Dovedite ga do šefa. On će biti zadovoljan.\" The muscular woman grins mischievously and commands her hunting group to return to their village. \"It'll be okay.\" Jay sighs, holding my hair back as I puke over the revolting sights, somehow becoming the water in the toilet. They were everywhere. Images. BlaH! \"I never really took you for the kind of girl who would get so upset after seeing-\" Another large amount of vomit escapes my mouth. \"something so…\" cough, cough, gag. \"Natural.\" Jay finishes. \"Uh…\" Is all I can get out, limp, hanging over the toilet. \"Y'all good now?\" He asks, flushing the toilet for me. Nodding is the best I can do. I stand up, shaking, and make my way carefully to a mirror, cleaning my face up, than fall to the floor. \"Ow…\" I sniff. It was no longer the images of Nel sweating over Russia. It was actually the feeling of sickness. \"Come on.\" Jay says, scooping me into his arms. He carried me down the hall into a (thank the lord) different room than the one were the \"cure\" was being \"created.\" \"Thanks, dude.\" I cough, laying on my back. \"No! No, no.\" He scolds me. \"What?!\" I ask, confused. \"You have to lay on your side so you don't choke on your own puke!\" He shoves me onto my side. \"Oh, how pleasant.\" I say sarcastically in a nasally voice. \"Don't worry. I'll stay here to make sure you don't!\" The thought of him near me while I rested was revolting. It suggested compassion. And I didn't have time for that. \"Go away!\" I hiss. \"Nope.\" I cross my arms, but lose the argument. Too weak to continue. Then I remember something kind of important. \"Jay...?\" \"Yes?\" Ugh, he's still here. \"Where's Nick?\" Silence. \"…Shiiiit.\" HAH! See that Nick?! It only gets worst. Go ahead, insult my writing one more time. I dare you. Plenty of people love what I do, and I don't see you get hundreds of views every damn day. Haha, ich liebe du, rache. Ich liebe dich. /!_/! (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 42] I started a new fanfiction! For those of you who are Ouran High School Host Club fans, it's called Operation Rainbow. You will love it. Okay… onward my friends! Lauren, I hope you don't mind. I'm giving your OC a Norwegian accent. Jay whistles, \"Nick… I didn't think you could do it.\" Nick stares off into space, not with a dreamy expression but more of a scared to death, scarred for lifekind of expression. ****That is my expression. As of now, I have copywrited it. It is mine. \"Scared to death, scarred for life.\" Mine.**** \"Nick?\" Jay tries again. \"Nick you in there, buddy?\" Jay lightly shakes Nick's shoulder and he falls over onto the ground. \"Now it might just be me… but I think something's wrong with him.\" I roll my eyes and snap my fingers, \"Reaver, Jay, take Nick up to one of the rooms. I don't know what those tribal people did to him but obviously it wasn't something we want to talk ab-\" \"Oh I know what they did to him.\" Reaver grins, sharing a look with Jay. I kick his shin, \"Just follow your god damn orders.\" \"Yes ma'am.\" Reaver huffs sarcastically. \"Yeah you better run.\" I mumble. \"We're not running!\" Reaver cries. I take a seat next to Russia in the lounge that was next to the dining room. This has become our favorite new meeting spot or headquarters if you will. \"So what's on the agenda today, girls?\" I ask. \"I was actually hoping we could go shopping.\" Bavaria says. \"…what?\" I raise an eyebrow. \"Well… have you looked in a mirror lately? Our hair is awful. It looks like a cat crawled up there and died. Our clothes are blood soaked and shredded. And I really want a change of socks… not to mention other things…\" \"Well I suppose the good part about the zombie apocalypse is no one ever knows when you get your period since there's already so much blood everywhere else.\" I shrug. Russia laughs, \"I suppose it's not a bad idea. We could even pick up something for the boys.\" \"Oh hey, I've been wondering… where is Bipolar?\" Bavaria asks. \"I haven't seen her lately either.\" I add. \"Don't ask me. She does her own thing.\" Russia sighs. \"What do you think happened to her?\" A moment of silence passes as we think about all the horrible things that could have happened. \"Let's just go shopping.\" I say getting up. \"Hey, Lauren!\" I call to the lady at the front desk. \"Yes?\" She calls back cheerfully. \"Where's the nearest shopping center?\" I ask. \"Oh! It's in the next town over! Here, take one of these maps!\" She says handing one to me. \"Thanks,\" I say taking it and turning towards the doors. I opened it halfway then stopped. God forgive me… \"Lauren…?\" \"Ya?\" \"Would you… want to… join us?\" I splurge. Kindness is not an easy trait for me. \"Oh ya! But… den I'd have to leave da desk… and I might get in trouble…\" \"You won't, trust me.\" I say. \"Well… oke! Maybe just for a bit.\" She jumps happily from behind the desk and skips towards the door. \"What're you doing?\" Bavaria hisses in my ear. \"I just… don't know how to read maps.\" I lie. \"What… happened?\" Lauren asks with wide eyes. I peer through the review mirror to see her reaction. \"Well, Lauren, I think it's about time we told you the truth.\" Bavaria starts. \"See… when you were overly indulged in your work life at the hotel, a huge virus spread and-\" \"There was a zombie apocalypse.\" I cut Russia off. Lauren laughs nervously, \"This is a joke, right?\" \"Afraid not.\" I say, making a turn into an alleyway. \"Well… I suppose that would explain the loss of business… and how crazy you all look.\" \"Hey!\" Bavaria growls. \"You're the one that just described us as acid trip murderers a few minutes ago.\" I say bluntly. Bavaria crosses her arms but says nothing. \"Oh! Right here!\" Lauren says excitedly pointing at a large parking lot ahead of us. I turn into the lot an find a space close to the East entrance. We pile out of the car we had driven and opened up the back. \"Alright… here, you're gonna need this.\" I say handing Lauren my two sided axe. Her eyes widen. \"Oh, don't worry, I have another one. I pull out mine and strap it onto my backpack. \"I like this one more.\" I whisper, giving her a thumbs up. Her eyes just bulge at the weapon in her hands. We make our way into the mall and carefully open the gates to the best stores. My personally favorite, which I had to have Lauren translate out for me, was Hot Topic. We went inside and turned on the lights, immediately killing the remaining costumers and what appeared to be the sales attendant. \"Heh heh, guys, guys. Check this out.\" I say holding up a sweatshirt that read My zombie killing sweatshirt. \"I am so taking this.\" Russia rolls her eyes as I stuff it into a plastic bag. I then proceed to find many more pieces of clothing, then follow the girls to the other stores. \"I have gone down four sizes.\" Bavaria gapes. \"I think I've gone down six.\" I say, checking myself out in one of the dressing room mirrors. \"Mmhmm…\" Russia nods. \"This is so scary.\" Lauren whispers. \"Oh I know! It's like I'm a walking skeleton.\" Bavaria cries. \"No I mean… the zombies.\" \"What? They're not scary. They're just annoying.\" I say, opening each of the changing stalls to check for infected. \"All clear.\" I smile. Returning to a pile of clothes yet to be tried on. Russia was frowning and fidgeting with her tangled hair. \"Hey, Lauren,\" Bavaria says. \"Hm?\" \"Do they have a hair salon in this mall?\" She asks. \"Hm I think they do!\" \"Perfect.\" She grins. \"Are you sure you know what you're doing?\" I ask. We were back at the hotel, it was just Russia, Bavaria and myself. Lauren was watching a sick Charlotte downstairs. \"Absolutely! I was going to go into cosmetology when I finished high school. I used to cut my friends' hair.\" She says chopping off more of my hair. \"Besides, you've already seen the wonders I've worked on Russia.\" It was true; Russia looked like a totally different person now. \"Okay…\" I say reluctantly but letting her continue. \"I can't wait to show the boys!\" Bavaria did a little dance and cut more of my hair. Sorry for my male readers, it's bad enough that you are forced to go to the mall with your sister/mom/girlfriend/friend that is female/aunt/grandma/godmother/cousin, and worse that you have to read about it. And it was also a boring chapter, I must admit. But I'm trying to stretch it out before the ending. /1_/1 (= ' . ' =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 43] It's been soooo long. This because I've been on vacation. So here I am, prepared to give you another chapter brought to you by zombies. The only thing that eats your brains with a smile on its face. Sorry if my writing seems a little weird, I'm not using my usual software. I hadn't realized how much this new world changed me until Bavaria showed us the way we used to be. It's kind of how you say you never know you love something until its gone. But then I think of Emmett. And I don't love him and I don't think I ever really did. But maybe that's because the apocalypse changed him, and I'm blinded by that. Bavaria knocks on the room that the boys were in. \"Hey freeloaders! Get yo asses out here!\" She yells. The door opens and Reaver and Jay's heads pop up and both are wide eyed and have dropped jaws. \"What the hell happened to you?\" Jay asks. Bavaria shuts the door. \"Oh come on,\" Jay yells from the other side. \"I was only kidding.\" \"I wanna see!\" Nick cries. Nel walks around the corner and drops his broom, then slowly backs away behind the wall. Jay opens the door. \"But you guys some clothes, too, but if you don't want them then...\" Nick shoves Bacaria aside and runs out into the hallway, \"Where are the clothes?\" \"Our room...\" Russia says. Nick runs off. The two remaining boys continue to stare. \"What?\" I hiss. \"You look so... Normal.\" Reaver says, astonished. \"We didn't think you could actually look like... Girls.\" Jay says walking towards the door and Reaver behind him. I slap Jay. \"Sorry.\" He winces. \"Are you guys ready to get out of here? I'm sick of this hotel.\" Russia says. \"Already?\" Reaver asks. \"Sure.\" We pack just as quickly as we had decided to leave. There would be nothing left behind, no trace of us ever being here. \"What about the cure, Russia.\" I ask. \"Oh... That.\" She looks up, pushing up her glasses. \"It's finished.\" \"What!?\" I screech. \"Why didn't you tell us earlier?\" \"I guess we were just having so much fun..\" She looks away with a sad expression on her face. \"It doesn't matter now. We can all go home.\" The room stiffened, the air suddenly got cold. \"Home?\" Reaver asks. \"Are you sure the cure is right? It works?\" Jay asks. \"I tested it myself.\" Russia nods. \"Then I guess...\" Bavaria starts. \"I guess we can go home now.\" I say slowly. Something wasn't right. This didn't feel... Right. \"I suppose someone should go tell Lauren, Charlotte and Nel.\" Bavaria suggests. \"Where's Charlotte?\" Reaver asks as if just realizing she was gone. \"She's down stairs with Lauren. She wasn't feeling very good.\" I say. \"I'll be downstairs.\" Reaver runs out of the room. \"Are you enjoying those clothes, Nick?\" I ask. He rubs his face up against a sweatshirt and smiles, content. \"Does anyone know what ever happened to Bipolar?\" Bavaria asks. There's a bloodcurdling yell from outside. \"What the hell?\" I get up and walk into the hallway. Reaver was staring at the elevator. \"What is your problem? Bavaria hisses. \"B-b... Bipolar...\" Reaver covers his hand over his mouth. Russia walks to the elevator and screams. I then proceed to examine the scene. I stand there, my body waving back and forth. Nauseous. If I went too far forward I would fall right down to the bottom of the elevator shaft. Bipolar's neck was crooked, causing her head to tilt slightly to the left, and causing it to hang down. Her body was limp, her limbs hung and dangled in the same fashion as her head. There was blood all of her and wounds everywhere. A sickly dripping noise that was probably blood echoed from down below. Her eyes were dull. She was looking past us. A stench rose from inside. And the source of her death... A wire hanging from the bottom of the elevator wrapped around her neck. \"It was just... Like this when I got here...\" Reaver says, slack jawed. \"Who do you think did this?\" Suspense:D /1_/1 (=o.O=) (\")-(\")[Chapter 44] So... I'm very, very, very, sorry that I haven't updated in a while... Please forgive me...! I know that is one of the worst things an author can do so I'm so sorry! Also I'm writing on my ipad so any screw ups I apologize in advance for. \"You haven't been honest with me.\" I say bluntly. \"You've been lying the whole time.\" \"What are you talking about? I can't lie to you. I am you.\" I cross my arms. \"Still not convinced? Whatever. I don't care.\" Emmett says. \"So who did it then? It can't be a suicide. It's impossible.\" I claim. \"Nothing's impossible and you know it. But you're right, it was a murder.\" \"Of course I'm right.\" \"Stop being so damn conceited. I can't tell you who did it.\" He growls. \"Why not?\" I hiss. \"Because you don't know. If I'm a part of you then how am I supposed to know something you don't?\" He asks. \"Enough.\" \"You're alone now. There may be people all around you be you're alone. You can feel it. Nawing at your brain and your insides like a parasite.\" \"Stop.\" I demand. \"You'll be swallowed up inside of your own madness. You'll only have me to talk to!\" He gives me a sharp, toothy grin. \"The infection's spreading my dear. The infection's spreading faster and faster.\" \"Stop!\" I cry standing up. \"Stop what?\" Reaver looks at me, confused. The rest of them are giving me odd looks as well. \"...Nothing...\" I say quietly. \"Get back to work.\" They continue to load up the truck. \"Maybe it's sea sickness.\" Jay suggests. \"You dope we're on land.\" Russia barks. That stupidity faintly reminded me of someone else. \"It's okay, I specialize in health and medical.\" Nick says. \"And when did you have time to go to college?\" Bavaria rolls her eyes. Charlotte suddenly starts hacking. Since we had come back from the mall she's become so sick. Her skin was a greenish-white color, her eyes had a yellow tint and swelled purple underneath. \"That's it.\" Nel says, closing the trunk. \"I'll drive.\" I say, taking the keys from Jay. \"Ahem, I'll drive.\" Reaver snatches the keys out of my hands. Nick, Charlotte and Russia pile into the backseat. \"You're gonna have to sit in the trunk.\" I say to Jay and Bavaria. I go to the passenger seat. \"You coming?\" I ask Nel and Lauren. Lauren's jaw drops. \"You're letting us come, too?\" Nel raises an eyebrow. \"If you don't mind sitting in the back.\" I shrug. \"Oh and... Lauren?\" I say before getting in. \"Shut your mouth before any flies fly in.\" Later that night... \"So are we just going to pretend nothing ever happened?\" I ask Reaver. Everyone else was asleep. \"No.\" \"Then what are we going to do?\" I ask. \"Well, if there's a killer among our group it's either Nel or Lauren.\" Reaver shrugs. \"We'll just have to keep our eyes on them.\" \"Right.\" I nod. There wasn't much else we could do. \"And then again... There's always the possibility that we're being followed.\" Reaver says adjusting the review mirror. Two headlights appear and then disappear. Reaver starts to pull over. \"Don't stop the car.\" I command. \"Please. Don't stop it.\" I beg. He nods and continues driving. It was silent. \"So now you have an idea of who it is.\" Emmett shrugs. \"Good for us.\" I roll my eyes. \"Oh, and by the way. It seems that only the people you remember are the people who sow up in your crazy little dreams. For instance, myself. I learned this today when you had a brief recollection of someone from your past. He'll be joining us from now on.\" Emmett says. \"Wha...?\" I ask before a shadow starts moving behind the single dull light. \"Hello, beautiful.\" A familiar voice says. \"I bet you missed me, didn't you. But what I want to know is... How could you forget about me? With all my good lucks and charms and such... How could you forget about good ol' Kory?\" \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" I scream. Shush. I know it was short. /1_/1 (\")-(\")[Chapter 45] Sorry for the shortage of chapters lately. I have like a million other things going on. But it's about the celebration of the one year anniversery of ZOMBIE CANDY CHAINSAW MASSACRE! Only 11 days! And I'm still using my ipad... Nuff said. Also I got a Wattpad account. So if you'd like to read it on there... I would love some followers... I have one... But I have other stories on there, too! TheFierceBunnyDragon - Username... \"Well now that you have two of us you might as well accept us.\" Emmett urges. \"Never.\" \"What a mule.\" Kory sighs. I growl at him. \"Meaning your stubborn.\" Emmett tries to save him. Kory looks at him and shakes his head. \"The first step is acknowledging that there's a problem. The second is accepting it.\" \"I have nothing to accept.\" I argue. And with that I wake up. It was a new day. The sun was beating down into the crowded vehicle. The AC was on full blast and Jaywas the only other person awake. He had been driving since Reaver decided it was time to take a break. If things went okay, today was the last day. The last day we'd have to worry about surviving on our own. We could have our families back. It would be... It would be what life should be! \"I'm going to stop up ahead.\" Jay says, as we passed a sign for gas. \"Okay.\" I smile at him. There's a minute of silence. \"Jesus.\" Jay says, breaking it. I look at him in question. \"I don't remember the last time I've seen you smile like that. That's about as rare as a cactus with Christmas lights on it.\" ****just for the record I came up with that last one and I'm very proud of myself**** \"Well...\" Is all I say. \"Je-...Minneapolis?\" He says breaking another silence. My head snaps to the side. He was about to call me by my real name. I decide to ignore it. \"Yes?\" \"Do you think we'll all be friends after this still? Even without the zombies and the rescuing each other... Even though we'll be thousands of miles apart?\" I take awhile to answer that. \"I sure hope so, Jay.\" \"Me too.\" He nods. I decide to ask him. \"So how'd you know?\" \"Know what?\" \"My name you idiot.\" \"Oh.\" Jay chuckled. \"I heard Emmett say it in his sleep once.\" My breath catches. \"Ew...\" I fake a grossed out look. My heart feels like it's being squeezed and juiced as if it were an orange or some other fruit behind made into juice. Jay looks over at me. He ruffles my hair, \"Don't let it get to you. He was a jack ass.\" \"Thanks.\" I almost whisper. We pull into the parking lot of a gas station, waking a few people up. \"Well this brings back memories.\" I mumble. Suddenly I remember meeting Texas at another gas station... It seems like so long ago. Now that I've remembered her... Shit. \"I'm going to go get beef jerky.\" Jay says, hopping out. \"I want food.\" I say following him out. The people riding in the back were wide awake already. \"Woohoo! Gas station!\" Reaver yawns, stretching before jumping out of the back seat. I remembered the vehicle we saw the other night and began to worry. What if it was still following? \"And I'll take this, and this, and this... And-\" \"Jay, you fat ass. Eat something healthy.\" I nag him as he grabs pretty much every piece of junk food available. He sticks his tongue out at me. I turn and see Reaver studying a box of cigarettes. \"NOOOOO!\" I run over and flying ninja kick it out of his hands. \"What?\" He asks. \"Smoking is bad for you!\" I cry. Nel walks in and looks longing at the mop in the corner. Maybe being a janitor really was his life calling. \"Do they have cough medication in here?\" Lauren asks, walking in. \"Probably behind the counter.\" I say. \"How's Charlotte?\" Reaver asks. \"Sleeping.\" Is all Lauren says. Just then Russia burst through the door. \"We have a problem.\" Sorry it was so short... Again. I'm trying to stretch it out til da big finally, mon. Okedoke well den. /1_/1 (\")-(\")[Chapter 46] HAPPY ANNIVERSARY ZOMBIE CANDY CHAINSAW MASSACRE AND FANS! Its actually a day after, I wanted to update yesterday but i didn't have internet. I'm sad to say that this is the last chapter. BUT there may be a sequel AND you can follow me on Wattpad or read some of my other stories on here. Again, my Wattpad username is TheFierceBunnyDragon Jsyk I'm using my iPad again so... Spelling errors. Well then... Let's get to it. \"Someone's out there.\" Bavaria whispers. We were all in the gas station now, hidden behind shelves and guns at the ready. For once we would be prepared. \"We need to get out of here!\" Nick says. \"We'll wait for them.\" I say. The silence starts to overwhelm me. Suddenly I was hearing voices that I knew weren't there. \"Be careful.\" Emmett reminds me. Yeah. I got it. \"Don't screw this up.\" Kory says. Go die again. \"Go get 'em.\" Texas grins. Go away, go away, go away! The door creeks open. Shit, shit, shit, shit. \"Luffy! Gil! Get in here.\" A deep, husky voice commands. I peek up from a tub of frozen foods and see a bearded man in a red plaid shirt. He looks like a lumberjack. I breathe as silently as possible and duck quietly out of sight. \"Yes sir!\" Two voices say in unison. I couldn't peg their ages. But they were definitely younger than the lumber jack man. Both male. \"Scan the place for any unwanted visitors. I'll grab everything we need. Make it quick and clean, if you don't I'll chop off your other hand... Luffy.\" The man laughs darkly. It's silent. There's small rustling sounds as the man begins his search and footsteps as the other two boys begin to look around. I squirm nervously. We have to move stealthily. I watch as Reaves and Charlotte scurry away from one of the boys, out of sight. I let out a small sigh of relief. Jay makes his way around the side of a machine and out the propped open back door in silence. The others follow. One by one they make their way out. Russia is last and looks at me, I nod and begin to make my escape. And then I bump my head on something. I look up slowly and gulp. One of the boys is standing above me. Probably twice my size. Muscular, tall. Had nice eyes and cute hair. Get a hold of yourself, Minne. Under other circumstances, this boy would be gorgeous. But he's about to kill me. A moment of shock and silence goes past. He looks at me like I'm some sort of penguin in the middle of a beach. My eyes are glued on the gun he's holding and then slowly make their way to his hand. It wasn't real. It was a robotic hand. Like nothing I'd ever seen before. This must be Luffy. He points his gun at me. Oh, please god! I know you and I have never been the best of friends, but right now I'm really just begging you- He drops his gun. What. \"Come on.\" He pulls me forward and glances backwards. To my surprise he tries to rush me out the back door. \"LUFFY!\" The lumber jack yells. \"Yes sir?\" He asks, motioning for me to stay crouched down. \"Stop fooling around, we don't have time for that.\" The man grumbles. \"Sorry.\" Luffy holds the door open for me and nods. I mouth \"thank you\" and hurry back to the others. We get in the truck and I start it. It sputters and fails. Nobody filled it up. \"Shit. I'm going to have to get out and fill the tank up. Wait here. Don't do anything stupid.\" I hiss, climbing out the door. I crawl to the pump and wait. Hurry! Hurry! Suddenly the doors of the gas station swing open and out come the three men. The lumber jack man spots us and aims his gun. \"What're you doing here!?\" He demands. I wince and stand up, arms in the air. \"Look, we don't want any trouble. We're just filling up and then leaving.\" I say with a shaky voice. \"Please just let us go.\" I say. \"What about a trade.\" He commands more than asks. \"What do you want?\" I ask hesitantly. \"Your lives for that nice truck, and your weapons. Oh... And the you three.\" He points at Russia and Bavaria who were sitting in the front seat. I almost barf in my mouth. \"No way.\" I shake my head. Never. Ever, ever... Ever. \"Well then.\" He says, and holds his gun up, aiming it at my forehead. I cringe. \"Wait just a goddamn minute.\" Lumberjack man freezes. I open my eyes. He was at gun point. Something shined in the light. Luffy's robotic hand. \"You have been harassing, mistreating, bullying, abusing and pushing us around since the day we met. I'm sick of your bullshit.\" Luffy huffs. Gil's mouth drops. \"I don't know why we didn't stand up ages ago. But now I know that I cannot take it anymore. Put the gun down and leave that girl and her friends alone!\" He demands. It's silent. Deadly silent. No moaning zombies, no buzzing insects and you couldn't hear a single breath. Something clicks. Gil's hand appears opposite of Luffy's also holding a gun to lumberjack man's head. \"Scruffy,\" heh. That's a great name.\"Luffy's right. We've had enough.\" A chuckle rumbles deep from Scruffy's chest. Only someone crazy would laugh at a time like this. \"So? You're gonna kill ol' uncle Scruffy?\" He asks. \"I don't think you have it in you. You're spineless. Weak. Both of you are wasted space. You'd be dead right now if it weren't for me.\" \"I'd still have my right hand if it weren't for you.\" Luffy growls. I felt like I should leave this was none of my business. But Scruffy's gun was still pointed at me. If I move... \"So do it. Kill me.\" Scruffy grins. Luffy and Gil share a glance. And then... Gil hits Scruffy in the back of the head with the gun. Scruffy curls over. Knocked out on the hot pavement. Luffy grabs a key ring from Scruffy's shirt pocked and looks at me. \"You need a ride? You seem a bit full there.\" \"That'd be great.\" I smile. I hand Reaver the keys and take Lauren, Nel and Russia with me. No way was I leaving my team alone with strangers. Whether they saved our lives or not. I hop into their back seat and look up. Luffy adjusts the mirrors and looks back at me. \"Where're you headed?\" He asks. I just now notice that he has an American accent. \"The airport. Can you take us there?\" I ask. \"We can take you anywhere. As long as you take us with.\" Gil says. He has an English accent. \"That's a far trade.\" I say. Luffy starts the truck and peels out of the gas station. I sigh in relief. An hour later we park in front of the airport. I grab my backpack from the other truck and hook my axe onto it. I take a deep breath. This is it. \"I'll need to go to the control room to see if there's a crop dusting plane. We can use that to spread the cure over a highly populated area to start the process.\" I say. Russia nods and the two of us head inside, the others following close behind. After taking care of the zombies that blocked our path we ended up in a control room. I take out an infected pilot by cracking its skull with the back of my axe. I search the computers until a small plane comes up. I check the information on it and it appears to be just what we're looking for. \"Well.\" I say. The eleven of us were standing in a between two gates. \"This is it.\" I sigh. Everyone squirmed uneasily. This was hard to do. \"We'll keep in touch.\" Jay nods. Everyone else seems to agree. One way or another we would. \"We've lost... A lot.\" Bavaria says. \"Things will never be normal again.\" Gil shakes his head. \"I know I'll be scared of the next human I meet.\" Reaver laughs nervously. \"I'll get to go home.\" Charlotte smiles. \"We all will. Russia says. \"But it won't be like home.\" Lauren says thoughtfully. \"I miss my mop.\" Nel frowns. \"I don't even have a home anymore.\" Nick sighs. \"Some of our homes will have been destroyed.\" Luffy points out. \"It'll never go back to normal. We'll always still be here, in this world that we have,lived in for the past year or so.\" I shake my head but then look at the gate. \"It's time to go.\" Russia reminds me. \"Yeah.\" I say. I start to get a bit teary eyed. \"I'll miss you guys!\" I say somehow hugging them all at once. They look down at me strangely. No. I am not this kind of person but you only live once. Russia and I head for the plane outside on the run way. We install the cure were the chemicals would normally go. After that we board the tiny, two seated plane. I put on goggles and a head set so that Russia and I could communicate. \"Everything set?\" She asks. \"All set. Preparing for take off.\" I say. \"All engines are full. Systems are a go. Permission to take off.\" \"Thank you.\" I say, switching on the gears and pushing the plane forward. I stop in front of a long runway. And sigh, turning the propeller on. \"Take off in three, two, one.\" The plane goes forward, faster and faster as I push the stick down. The wheels leave the ground as we fly into the air. I circle the airport and head for the most popular city on the map. /1_/1 ( = ^ . ^ =) (\")-(\")[Chapter 47] I tricked you guys! ^.^ there's actually one more chapter. Its a little bit cheesy. So enjoy. I'd love to see some of your final reviews. I love you all my wonderful readers! Until next time! /1_/1 (\")-(\") EPILOGUE There was a knock on my apartment door. \"Be right there!\" I call. I finish washing some dishes and skip to the door. I open it and a familiar face appears. He's holding flowers and his hair isn't as messy as it usually is. \"Are you ready?\" He asks. \"Always, those are for me, right?\" I grin. He nods and hands me the flowers. I set them in a vase and put them by the window sill. \"You look cute today.\" He says. \"Uhm... Don't I always?\" I raise an eyebrow. I quickly glance at my lacy blue shirt and black slacks. \"Sure.\" He says. I smack his arm and he laughs. \"Let's go.\" I say. \"Can we take my baby?\" I ask. \"Won't that mess up your hair?\" He asks. I look longingly outside at my blue and black motorcycle. \"You're right, lets take the truck.\" I say. We walk outside and I sit down in the truck's passenger seat. \"I can't believe Rosalie is coming all the way from Russia for this.\" I say. \"Well... This is kind of a big deal.\" He reminds me. True. \"I can't believe it's been five years already.\" I shake my head. It seems like the world was at its end only a week ago. \"Time sure does fly.\" He says. \"What about Gilbert? Has his plane landed yet?\" I ask. \"Gilbert should be there on time.\" He nods. \"And Lauren and Nelson?\" I continue. \"Already here.\" He confirms. \"How about Jacob? Bradley? Charlotte? Nicho-\" \"Jessica. They have their own lives now. You don't need to worry about them anymore.\" Luffy says. \"Right...\" I say. Habit I suppose. Luffy parks the truck and gets out. He opens my door for me and we go inside together. \"The guests will show up at seven. The Dj will arrive at six and catering should be here at six thirty. The guest of honors will arrive anytime after seven. Everyone thing has to go perfectly.\" I tell the man in charge of arranging our party as we walk down a hallway. I'm going over my notes on my clip board over and over again. \"The speeches will be at eight. Are all the decorations up? Are the chairs in the right places?\" I ask. The guy, Tony, nods. \"Great.\" I breathe as I head outside. The place was beautiful. There were waterfalls streaming down the side of the building. Glass tables were set everywhere. Little cards were set on the table for the special guests. And one long table where the guests of honor were sitting. A place for the Dj was reserved in front of a curved glass wall. Tony catches me eyeing it and says \"There will be fire shooting up between the glass. It's thicker than it looks.\" I nod, amazed. There was a place for people to dance. A table set for catering. It was... Beautiful. \"Looks good.\" Luffy grunts. \"It looks better than good!\" I hiss. \"... Looks great?\" \"Go die in a hole.\" He rolls his eyes at me. \"So are the toilets wrapped with ribbon, too? Or does the elegance end there?\" Tony chuckles but stops when he receives a deadly glare from me. \"She's just a peach, ain't she?\" Luffy smiles. \"And now, ladies and gentleman, it's time.\" Says the mayor of Minneapolis. \"Let's give a big thanks to our guests of honor, the one who saved this world and all of our lives!\" The house goes crazy. So many people were here from all parts of the world. I have a feeling we didn't rent a large enough space. This was the biggest event I've ever seen. It was even being broadcasted on live tv. \"Please welcome, the one who made this whole thing possible, Jessica Probst!\" My heart beat rises wildly. I stand up and make my way to the podium. I remind myself to smile. \"Hi.\" I laugh nervously. \"I'm so happy I could make this happen.\" The crowd cheers. Oh boy. \"But I didn't do much, in fact, I couldn't have done any of this if it weren't for my team, and dear friends.\" I look over to the group of people sitting at the table. \"Y'know... All I did was get some crazy strangers together and swing an axe.\" They laugh. Oh thank god. \"But we... We did lose a few along the way. Three? Four? Maybe more than that. Looking back now, I can't even remember. We tried, though. And I'm surprised we made it as far as we did. We made the impossible possible. Sure, we saved the world. But we weren't thinking about that at the time. We were only thinking about ourselves. To admit it, we were a little bit selfish... Or at least I was, I don't know about the rest of you.\" They laugh again. \"And somehow... It did work. And we succeeded. With Rosalie and Nelson's brains. Nick and Bradley's strength. Gilbert's and Luffy's bravery and Ophelia's wits. Charlotte was a ten year old who killed at least twelve zombies a day for god's sake! And let's not forget Jacob's bad jokes.\" More laughs. \"So thank you, for coming here tonight to celebrate these wonderful individuals. And thank you,\" I turn to the ten survivors, \"for being there with me to save the world.\" I finish. Applause. Sit down. Okay. Good. Russia then proceeded to go up and explain how she created the formula for the cure. Then Nelson added his side of the story and explains how he was just a janitor who only cared about his mop. Then Lauren told the crowd how she had thought the whole time that the hotel she was working for with her parents was just losing money. And that her parents were on vacation. Jay told a few bad jokes. Charlotte and Bradley told them about life in Canada until they met up with us. Nick spoke of his quiet life and tragic story of how he had to kill his own family to survive. Luffy and Gil told about their abusive uncle Scruffy. Ophelia explained how she made the long journey between countries trying to find help. Then the mayor spoke again and started talking about those on our team who died. \"We gives these awards in memory of Ellie Sinclair,\" Texas \"Sarah Michaels,\" Fairbanks \"Kory Love,\" Kory \"and Emmett Childs.\" Emmett \"I'd like to give our first hero's award to Jacob Broadbent.\" Jay \"Next, Lauren Cunningham.\" Lauren \"Rosalie Sokolovskii.\" Russia \"Bradley James.\" Reaver \"Nicholas Carter.\" Nick \"Luffy Starr.\" Luffy \"Gilbert Ellington.\" Gil \"Nelson Oyai.\" Nel \"Charlotte James.\" Charlotte \"Ophelia Tenebaum.\" Bavaria \"Jessica Probst.\" Me... Minneapolis I could hardly respond to that name anymore. Even though it had been five years. It was still so difficult. I suppose it helped when I learned Luffy lived only an hour away from my hometown. I found Jay without any problems. And even though it took some real searching for the others... Here they are.
